World peace. A cure for cancer. Or a British grand slam tennis champion. Adapting the technique last Friday, I persuaded myself that the government has a coherent plan for economic reconstruction. After many phone calls, several cups of coffee and a return visit to a factory in Sheffield it almost made sense. The two divergent themes tugging at the coalition – \"get government off our backs\" against \"get the government here to help\" – swam into a sort of alignment. I decided the coalition's growth strategy exists, that it might even work, but that, unfortunately, no one will ever grasp it. A jumble of apparently unconnected things, it lacks any single idea to string them together. The two single ideas available – step in, or step back – are not easily braided. The resulting tangle is useless in the face of assault by Ed Balls, who was tricksy as ever on the BBC today. Until last week's GDP figures, the government hoped alarm about cuts and tax rises (which Labour also wants to impose in some form) would be offset by evidence of a growing economy. But Zen economics falters when the consequences come with minus numbers attached. That is why ministers started talking about growth in Davos last week. This creates a second problem. Part of the coalition – hippy Lib Dems, Vince Cable some of the time, and Michael Heseltine, who's helping with industrial planning – leans towards state activism, which isn't the same as opposing cuts. The other part – George Osborne and Lib Dems of the David Laws type – thinks shaping the economic environment by removing obstacles to growth is better. Actually, these two schools are not contradictory. Both can be right, and people cross between them. Osborne likes state-sponsored infrastructure projects such as high-speed rail. But the differences make setting out a unified growth plan awkward, especially as in part it involves committing the state to doing less – not helping employees harm employers at industrial tribunals, for instance. Yet for the left, growth looks straightforward: it takes a modern Soviet Gosplan, national hyperactivity with lots of borrowed money – \"growth\" being the latest disguise, after \"investment\", for what is always really spending. Some of this works too. Stapling a £10 note to every Guardian tonight would do wonders for tomorrow's sales. \"If the figures stay bad they will try anything for growth,\" says one official watching the Treasury, but that amounts less to a U-turn on deficit reduction than the resurrection of Whitehall's wheeze-mongers who came up with schemes for Gordon Brown. You do not have to search long among ministers to find fear over cuts, – they read the FT's commentators and Larry Elliott – but they also believe that the difference between the Alistair Darling plan and the Osborne plan – only a handful of billion in cuts – is not the choice between eventual redemption and ruin. So what is to be done? A year ago I went to South Yorkshire to see Sheffield Forgemasters, a company that accidentally became a testing ground for economic choices when the coalition cancelled an £80m state loan. I think the decision was wrong. Forgemasters would have paid back the cash and created jobs. (I suspect in some form the business will end up with the money, though directors won't discuss how.) For the moment, their take on growth is worth hearing. They want stability from government and skills from universities: they see a role for the state, but no quick fix from sloshing cash about. Forgemasters is inspiring: in profit every year since its managers bought it out of bankruptcy, it has taken on 30 teenage apprentices since the election, and five of its 830 staff are doing PhDs. It's involved in Sheffield's Advanced Manufacturing Park, a cell of scientists, engineers and firms such as Boeing. It is the embodiment of an economy that goes beyond banking and shopping. When China licensed US plans to build its nuclear power plants, it had to come to Forgemasters for the stainless steel pumps that pressurise the cooling water. A lesson from Forgemasters is that promoting growth comes down to a series of nasty choices that must be adhered to over many years. Mostly, rapid mucking around from the centre doesn't help. Construction has fallen through the floor since the coalition scrapped Labour's building targets, so should the government loosen the strings, or localise planning and keep the green belt sacrosanct – since building on it would certainly boost the economy as it did in the 1930s? Should it expand paternity and maternity rights, or free bosses from employment rules? Short-term schemes would sound great in the budget, but when the Treasury reviewed its 1980s enterprise allowance scheme it found 96% of the grants had no economic effect. Last year the government nearly published a growth white paper, then dumped it. That was the right decision. Growth is largely unpredictable, and easier to damage than to foster. But appearing hands-off when growth is languishing looks dreadful. Which leads me to a synthesis of sorts between the step-back and the step-in factions. Doing nothing may be the best underlying philosophy, but you'd better at least look as though you're doing something. Yet, as an economist once put it, governments can't pick winners – but losers can sure pick governments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/oct/11/michael-white-university-fees-review-rebellion","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-11T21:01:23Z","webTitle":"Browne's university fees review is a rehearsal for the coalition's crunch time | Michael White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/11/michael-white-university-fees-review-rebellion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/11/michael-white-university-fees-review-rebellion","fields":{"headline":"Browne's university fees review is a rehearsal for the coalition's crunch time","bodyText":"Crunch time looms for the coalition's hastily-engineered agreement. It might have been over Trident or nuclear power. It will come soon enough over George Osborne's 20 October package of cuts. But today will provide at least a dress rehearsal in the shape of Lord Browne's review of English university funding. For days the drums have been sending an unmistakable signal from the Whitehall policy jungle that the former BP boss is offering the Tories roughly what they want: the lifting of the annual £3,290 cap on tuition fees (£10,000? £12,000 for Oxbridge?) and more realistic rates of interest on student loans. That is enough to enrage students, who vote in marginal university constituencies and will not be much appeased by noises about the need to nurture participation among the poor and protect low-paid graduates from crippling debt. It comes at a horrible time. Osborne's package will unveil cuts in university teaching subsidies and tax rises which will hurt working families – all in a world where raising skill levels is ever more crucial to economic survival. Browne's supporters, who include the universities minister, David Willetts, and the elite sector, say Britons are not exactly debt-averse and that students will not have to find the money upfront, only to pay it back during their careers. How and how much remains the nub. Will Browne propose a higher interest rate for highly-paid lawyers and bankers? If so, will the Tories reject it as penalising success? Will the Lib Dems insist on a cap? Will they vote against it and risk being accused of ruining a great UK export-industry or driving talent abroad at a time when immigration policies are already keeping talent out? There is plenty of wriggle room, if the political will exists. On paper it would take 42 of the 55 Lib Dems to vote no (as distinct from abstain as the coalition pact permits) to defeat the government on a full turnout. As business secretary, Vince Cable, the coalition's Hamlet, will make a holding statement today, indicating a direction of travel, promising a white paper and, eventually, legislation. Cable has been modifying his position, public and private, for months, first talking about a graduate contribution rather than a tax and – on Saturday – admitting in an email to supporters that he was wrong. The National Union of Students persists with its own alternative to create a \"people's trust for higher education,\" an antidote to market forces, albeit in the long run. Last night, Sir Andrew Cubie, the Scot whose own solution – the graduate endowment scheme for funding future bursaries – was canned by the SNP government, warned that Browne's formula would leave Scots, Welsh and Northern Irish universities at a disadvantage. But Browne's solution will not stop the search for tweaks that are fairer, efficient and do not strangle the success of alumni donation schemes among people disinclined to pay twice. One website suggestion has graduates over 40 – who got their education free – making a one-off payment, equivalent to today's fees. Now that might cheer up the NUS."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-gypsies-engineers-labourers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-13T18:42:37Z","webTitle":"Fukushima cleanup recruits 'nuclear gypsies' from across Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-gypsies-engineers-labourers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/13/fukushima-nuclear-gypsies-engineers-labourers","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima cleanup recruits 'nuclear gypsies' from across Japan","bodyText":"The sun has only just risen in Iwaki-Yumoto when groups of men in white T-shirts and light blue cargo pants emerge blinking into the sunlight, swapping the comfort of their air-conditioned rooms for the fierce humidity of a Japanese summer. Four months on from the start of the world's worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl, this hot-spring resort in north-east Japan has been transformed into a dormitory for 2,000 men who have travelled from across the country to take part in the clean-up effort 30 miles away at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Iwaki-Yumoto has come to resemble corporate Japan in microcosm. Among its newest residents are technicians and engineers with years of experience and, underpinning them all, hundreds of labourers lured from across Japan by the prospect of higher wages. They include Ariyoshi Rune, a tall, wiry 47-year-old truck driver whose slicked-back hair and sideburns are inspired by his idol, Joe Strummer. For five days a week, Rune is in thrall to the drudgery of life as a \"nuclear gypsy\", the name writer Kunio Horie gave to contract workers who have traditionally performed the dirtiest, most dangerous jobs for Japan's power utilities. The industry has relied on temporary workers for maintenance and repair work since the nuclear plant construction boom in the 1970s. Now, as then, those from the lowest rungs of Japanese society work for meagre wages, with little training or experience of hazardous environments. \"I've never thought working at the plant was dangerous,\" Rune tells the Guardian after a day's work, for which he receives 12,000 yen (£95). \"And I think my wage is fair for the kind of work I do. It's more than I used to get driving a truck.\" He arrived at Fukushima in early June after seeing an advertisement for labourers in a magazine. His 73-year-old mother knows her son is working in the area, but she has no idea he spends half of every day at the site of Japan's worst-ever nuclear accident. Rune, who is divorced, generally gets two days off a week, when he travels to nearby Ibaraki prefecture to see his sons. \"When I told them about my work the first thing they said was, 'Please don't get irradiated.' They worry, but they also think that what I'm doing is kind of cool.\" He says he has been exposed to five millisieverts (mSv) in little over a month – more than double the worldwide average background dose of 2.4mSv a year. While Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco) engineers working inside reactor buildings are allowed an annual radiation dose of up to 250mSv, Rune's firm has imposed a cut-off point of 30mSv for staff and 15mSv for casual labourers. \"I have about two months left before I reach my limit, but I'm hoping they will make an exception and let me work for longer,\" he says. The next morning, at 5.45am, the bus is already waiting when Rune emerges from his hotel, where he shares a room with five other workers. Before them lies a 45-minute journey to J-Village, a football training complex, where they will be briefed on their duties for the day before changing into radiation suits, masks and goggles, protective gloves and glass-encased monitors which they must carry with them at all times on site. At 8am they begin the first of two 90-minute shifts at Fukushima Daiichi, separated by a break of similar length. Radiation exposure and heat bring their working day to an end by early afternoon. Rune gave the Guardian a rare insight into working conditions inside the plant. As he leaves his place of work for his 90-minute break, he must remove his cotton gloves before opening a door into a second room, where he takes off two pairs of rubber gloves and strips down to his underpants. In a third room, he is scanned for radiation. If he gets the all clear, he is given a new uniform and underwear. The process is repeated again after his second 90-minute shift of the day. \"It is so hot there at the moment, we have to take lots of breaks, so I don't think this will be done by January,\" he says, referring to Tepco's self-imposed deadline for stabilising the plant. \"That said I have seen signs of progress, like the treatment of contaminated water.\" He is part of the team of 25 men removing and packing 23,000 firefighters' uniforms dumped near reactors No 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the first chaotic days of the crisis, when three of the plant's six reactors suffered core meltdowns. One group retrieves the uniforms, which he collects by truck and drops off for another crew to sort and pack before they are taken away for disposal. \"We don't have any contact with the Tepco engineers or technicians,\" he says. \"My company is about six places down the pecking order.\" None of the men the Guardian spoke to was confident that Tepco would meet its deadline of January to bring the reactors to a safe state, known as cold shutdown. In April, Tepco said it would reduce radiation leaks by this month and achieve cold shutdown by January. But that timetable is expected to be revised when the utility company releases its latest roadmap on Tuesday. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, said this week that it may be a decade before work can even begin on decommissioning the reactors. In the aftermath of the 11 March disaster, Tepco called on major construction and maintenance companies to help. Those firms in turn hired workers from a sprawling network of 600 contractors of varying expertise and reputation. For the time being Iwaki-Yumoto will comprise three disparate communities – about 30,000 locals, 2,000 plant workers and 1,000 people evacuated from towns and villages near Fukushima Daiichi. The presence of so many contractors, and the sheer number of men, has led to fears that not all are observing health and safety regulations. One restaurateur complained of workers returning in the evenings still wearing their uniforms, even down to the boots they wear inside the plant's grounds. Tourism to the town, with its hot springs and mountain views, has dried up since the nuclear accident. \"There's not much exchange between the workers and local people,\" says Katsue Takahashi, an Iwaki city official. \"The inn owners are pleased to be fully booked for months ahead, but they are beginning to worry about how long this will go on. With the evacuees here, too, no one wants to come here for a holiday.\" Toshiyuki Sasaki, an employee at a construction firm in Hokkaido, is one of the better-paid contract workers who have made Iwaki-Yumoto their temporary home. He is earning twice his monthly salary of 350,000 yen clearing debris from in front of the No 3 reactor, preparing it for the arrival of a 700-tonne crane that will erect a huge steel shroud over the unit to prevent further radiation leaks. \"I'm not allowed inside the reactor itself, and I work for just one or two hours a day,\" says Sasaki as he drinks a cold beer at a local restaurant. \"If my reading reaches 40mSv for the a year, I have to leave for good.\" Sasaki, like other machinery operators, spends his shift inside crane and digger cabins, the only way they can clear dangerously radioactive debris. He has helped build nuclear power plants, but never helped rescued one from catastrophe. Yet he says he will work at Fukushima for as long as his radiation readings permit. \"We are very careful,\" he says. \"If my dosimeter hits a certain level during a single shift, I have to get out. But that hasn't happened yet.\" Not all of the firm's staff share his optimism. About half the company's employees have refused to work at the plant at the pleading of their families. All of the men who spoke to the Guardian said they believed the most immediate threat to their health came not from radiation but from hours spent wrapped in masks, goggles and protective suits sealed tight with tape at the ankles, wrists and neck. \"Radiation doesn't bother me, but I am worried about falling ill because of the heat,\" says a 34-year-old man from Osaka who declined to give his name. \"It is unbelievably hot inside those suits. I know of several people who have been taken ill on the job.\" The food, meanwhile, has improved since the early days of the crisis, when Tepco and the government were criticised for not providing workers with enough to eat and drink. Lunch is usually a boil-in-the-bag curry and rice, bottled water and tea, jelly-like vitamin supplements sucked from a tube and packets of sweets. \"But there is not enough room to get your head down for an hour during breaks,\" says Rune, who travelled to Fukushima from the south-western island of Kyushu, about 600 miles away. \"That said, there are more toilets and drinks and more space for relaxing.\" When the Fukushima crisis is finally over, accolades will deservedly go to the Tepco engineers, soldiers and emergency workers who battled serious radiation leaks and exploding reactor buildings in the days after the tsunami. But Rune expects there will be little praise, at least in public, for the men who cleaned up the devastation the waves left in their wake. \"People like me came here partly out of a sense of duty, but mainly to make more money,\" he says. \"Some came because they were unemployed. And others are here because they have never been able to hold down a regular job. Until now, no one has ever wanted to give them a chance.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2012/jun/18/china-birth-of-superpower","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2012-06-18T19:30:00Z","webTitle":"China: witnessing the birth of a superpower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/18/china-birth-of-superpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2012/jun/18/china-birth-of-superpower","fields":{"headline":"China: witnessing the birth of a superpower","bodyText":"When I moved to Beijing in August 2003, I believed I had the best job in the world: working for my favourite newspaper in the biggest nation at arguably the most dramatic phase of transformation in its history. In the past decade, it has given me a front-row seat to watch 200-odd years of industrial development playing at fast forward on a continent-wide screen with a cast of more than a billion. That said, I am glad my daughters were young and easy to please back then or we might well have taken the first plane out of the country. As we drove from the airport to our apartment, I tried to maintain an upbeat chatter. \"Look at all the kites,\" I said as we passed Chaoyang park, even though my heart sank at the tatty buildings, endless construction sites and stultifying haze. In my head, I asked myself: \"Have I done the right thing for them?\" We had come from Japan – a democratic, comfortable, polite, hygiene-obsessed, orderly, first-world nation – to the grim-looking capital of a developing, nominally communist country that looked and sounded like a giant building site. For all my enthusiasm, my family must have felt we were taking a step backwards in lifestyle. It required an adjustment of preconceptions. Like many newcomers, I delighted at discoveries of Chinese literature and Daoist philosophy, Beijing parks, the edgy eccentricity of Dashanzi and the glorious mix of classicism and obscenity in the Chinese language, though I never managed to master it. The mix of communist politics and capitalist economics appeared to have created a system designed to exploit people and the environment like never before. It was so unequal that Japan appeared far more socialist by comparison. And it was changing fast. As swaths of the capital were being demolished and rebuilt for the Olympics, there was an exhilarating (and sometimes disorientating) sense of mutability. Everything seemed possible. Looking back over the stories that followed, it is hard to believe so much could be compressed into such a short span of time – the outbreaks of Sars and bird flu, the attempted assassination of the president of Taiwan, deadly unrest in Tibet, the devastating earthquake in Sichuan, murderous ethnic violence in Xinjiang, Tibetan self-immolations, as well as the huge regional stories: two tsunamis – in 2004 in the Indian Ocean and last year in the Pacific, a multiple nuclear meltdown in Fukushima, and the protracted rattling of nuclear sabres on the Korean peninsula. One of my first tasks in 2003 was to chose a Chinese name. I opted for \"Hua Zhong\", partly because it sounds a little like \"Watts, Jon\", but mainly because the characters mean \"Sincere to China\" – something I was determined to be as a reporter. Nine years later, that sentiment has not faded. But at various times, I have been called a communist sympathiser, supporter of Taiwan, a stooge of the Dalai Lama. However, my focus has been on development and its impact on individuals and the environment. In 2003, China had the world's sixth-biggest GDP. It passed France in 2004, Britain in 2006, Germany in 2009, and Japan in 2011. On current course, it will replace the US as No 1 within the next 15 years. It is already top in terms of internet population, energy consumption and the size of its car market. A decade of dominance The primary driver for change has been the movement of people. Over the past nine years 120 million Chinese people – almost twice the population of the UK – have moved from the countryside to the city. This mind-boggling shift has its problems, as I found in Chongqing, but for the most part, China appears to have avoided the worst of the poverty, crime and ghettoes seen in other rapidly urbanising countries. Yet it also seems more brittle, perhaps because of the other big economic engine: infrastructure investment. In this period, China has been re-wired and re-plumbed. There has been an extraordinary expansion of power, transport and communication networks that have linked the nation like never before: west-east gas pipelines, south-north water diversion, hundreds of airports and a massive new electricity grid linking wind and solar power plants in the deserts to power-hungry consumers in cities and industrial plants. This has been a decade of cement and steel, a time when economic development has pushed into the most remote corners of China with a series of prestige projects: the world's highest railway, the biggest dam, the longest bridge, putting a man into space, the most ambitious hydroengineering project in human history and, of course, hosting – and dominating – the Olympics for the first time. It has been a privilege to watch this redistribution of wealth and power from the developed to the developing world. On a global level, such a shift will require nothing less than a grand accommodation – or a violent conflict. Beijing appears to be preparing for both. Other news during this period showed a hardening of China's military muscle: a breakthrough satellite-killing missile test, the launch of a first aircraft carrier, the development of a new stealth fighter and a steady increase in military spending. Criticism has rarely been appreciated. All too often, there have been flare-ups of anti-foreign media hostility. Some of my colleagues in other media organisations have received death threats. I never expected China to be an easy place to work as a journalist. For political and cultural reasons, there is a huge difference in expectations of the media. For historical and geo-strategic reasons, there is a lingering distrust of foreign reporters. Run-ins with the police, local authorities or thugs are depressingly common. I have been detained five times, turned back six times at roadblocks (including during several efforts to visit Tibetan areas) and physically manhandled on a couple of occasions. Members of state security have sometimes followed interviewees and invited my assistants \"out for tea\", to question them on who I was meeting and where I planned to visit. Censors have shut down a partner website that translated Guardian articles into Mandarin. Police have twice seized my journalist credentials, most recently on this year's World Press Freedom Day after I tried to interview the blind human-rights activist Chen Guangcheng in hospital. When that happened, I debated with another British newspaper reporter who was in the same position about whether to report on the confiscation. He argued that it was against his principles for journalists to become part of the story. I used to believe the same, but after nine years in China, I have seen how coverage is influenced by a lack of access, intimidation of sources and official harassment. I now believe reporters are doing a disservice to their readers if they fail to reveal these limitations on their ability to gather information. Yes, there is often negative coverage and yes, many of the positive developments in China are underemphasised. But I don't think it does the country's international image any favours to clumsily choke access to what is happening on the ground. Treated like a spy, I have sometimes had to behave like one. At various times, I've concealed myself under blankets in a car, hidden in a toilet, waited until dark in a safe house and met sources in the middle of the night to avoid detection. At other times, it is Chinese journalists and officials who pull the screen of secrecy aside. Take the foot-and-mouth outbreak on the outskirts of Beijing in 2005. I was first alerted to this by a Chinese reporter, who was frustrated that the propaganda department had ordered the domestic media not to run the story. Foreign ministry officials often tell me China is becoming more open and, indeed, there have been steps in that direction. But restrictions create fertile ground for rumour-mongering. One of the biggest changes in this period has been the spread of ideas through mobile phones and social networks. The 513 million netizens in China (up from 68 million in 2003) have incomparably greater access to information than any previous generation and huge numbers now speak out in ways that might have got them threatened or detained in 2003. Microblogs are perhaps nowhere more influential than in China because there is so little trust of the communist-controlled official media. It has been fun watching netizens create an ingenious new language to evade restrictions. In this anti-authoritarian world, the heroes are the \"grass mud horses\" (which, in Chinese, sounds the same as a core banned phrase: \"Fuck your mother!\") while the villains are the river crabs (which is pronounced like \"harmony\" – the favourite excuse of the authorities when they crack down on dissent). But ultimately, a journalist wants to see things for him or herself. I will never forget the epic road trips – across the Tibetan plateau, along the silk road, through the Three Gorges and most memorably from Shangri-la to Xanadu. Along the way, I met remarkable people with extraordinary stories. True to the oft-heard criticism of the foreign media, many were from the \"dark side\": a young man in Shaoguan who confessed – as the shadows lengthened on the building site where we had our interview – to killing Uighur co-workers at his toy factory because of a rumour they had raped Han women; a gynaecologist in Yunnan who argued with great conviction that it had once been necessary to tie pregnant women up to carry out abortions; the young boy who found the body of his dead grandmother who killed herself a year after his father – an illegal migrant – phoned her to say he was about to drown in what became known as the Morecambe Bay disaster. Other stories literally turned up on my doorstep – such as the petitioner who arrived at my office a few weeks before I left. We had never met, but it was easy to identify Yang Zhong, who stood out a mile with his country boots, green overalls and bags crammed full of injustice. The look was all too familiar. I have lost count of the number of petitioners who have asked the Guardian to investigate land thefts, corruption cases, industrial accidents, rapes, murders and other alleged abuses of power. Yang had come from Jinshantun village in the far northern province of Heilongjiang to accuse a local forestry chief – Wang Liguan – of illegal logging in one of China's last great protected forests and for having him locked up and beaten when he dared to complain. Typically, his story, minutely recorded in reams of papers and even on a DVD, was anything but black and white. Weak laws and strong censorship make it difficult for such people to have their cases heard in the domestic system so they turn to foreign news bureaus. There were so many grim accounts it was impossible to give them all the time and attention they deserved. Heroism and brutality But there were also stories of success, heroism and inspiration as a nation embraced new wealth and battled for new ideas: the business empires built by enlightened philanthropists such as Yin Mingshan of Lifan auto, the internet fortunes accrued by entrepreneurs such as Jack Ma of Alibaba and Robin Li of Baidu. Compared with nine years ago, people in China have more freedom to shop, to travel and to express their views on the internet. The Communist party tolerates a degree of criticism,but step over the invisible line of what is acceptable and the consequences are brutal. In my first years in China, I interviewed several outspoken opponents – Liu Xiaobo, Gao Zhisheng, Hu Jia and Teng Biao. I was impressed back then that they were at liberty to speak out. It seemed like the act of a confident government. But all of them have subsequently been locked up and, in at least two cases, tortured. The blame for that surely lies with the authorities. But I have sometimes felt pangs of guilt. I first interviewed Ai Weiwei in the summer of 2007 for an Olympic preview. He was one of the creators of the \"bird's nest\" stadium and I was expecting him to tell me how proud he would be when it was unveiled at the opening ceremony. Instead, he told me he would not attend in protest at the \"disgusting\" political conditions in the one-party state and then launched into a withering assault on propaganda. It was the first time he had expressed such views to the foreign media – a great scoop, but also one fraught with risk. At the end of the interview, I cautioned the artist: \"Are you sure you want to say this? It could get you into a great deal of trouble with the authorities.\" \"Absolutely,\" he replied. \"I only wish I could say it more clearly.\" Despite that confirmation and the similarly critical comments he subsequently made to other media organisations, I felt partly responsible when Ai was detained last year. Whether the repression is getting better or worse has been a constant question with few clear answers. My feeling is that China has become a less tolerant country since 2008. That was a coming of age of sorts, when China stopped seeming like a work in progress and started looking and behaving like a superpower. On the Beijing skyline, the scaffolding and cranes had been replaced by stunning architectural wonders. The ever-present sentiments of victim-hood and nationalism found powerful outlets in the Tibetan uprising, torch relay protests and the Sichuan earthquake. Meanwhile, those who had supported moves towards a more open, liberal, internationalist China saw the value of their political stock plunge almost as fast as the Dow Jones index in the global financial crisis. With the western model apparently shattered, many in China understandably felt less inclined than ever to listen to outside advice. In the four years since, China has become a more modern and connected nation, but – despite the official hubris – it also seems more anxious that the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa may spread. The government now spends more on internal security than defence of its borders – a sign that it is more frightened of its own people than any external threat. Little wonder. This has been an era of protest in China. The government stopped releasing figures a few years ago, but academics with access to internal documents say there are tens of thousands of demonstrations each year. The reasons are manifold – land grabs, ethnic unrest, factory layoffs, corruption cases and territorial disputes. But I have come to believe the fundamental cause is ecological stress: foul air, filthy water, growing pressure on the soil and an ever more desperate quest for resources that is pushing development into remote mountains, deserts and forests that were a last hold-out for bio and ethnic diversity. This is not primarily China's fault. It is a historical, global trend. China is merely roaring along the same unsustainable path set by the developed world, but on a bigger scale, a faster speed and at a period in human history when there is much less ecological room for manoeuvre. The wealthy portion of the world has been exporting environmental stress for centuries. Outsourcing energy-intensive industries and resource extraction have put many problems out of sight and out of mind for western consumers. But they cannot be ignored in China. The worst problems are found in the countryside: \"cancer villages\", toxic spills, pitched battles to block a toxic chemical factory, health hazards from air pollution and water and the rapid depletion of aquifers under the north China plain – the country's bread-basket. The implications are global. China has become the biggest greenhouse-gas emitter on the planet. This year, it will probably account for half the coal burned in the world. The number of cars on China's roads has increased fourfold since 2003, driving up demand for oil. Meanwhile, there is less and less space and respect for other species. For me, the most profound story of this period was the demise of the baiji – a Yangtze river dolphin that had been on earth for 20m years but was declared extinct in 2006 as a result of river traffic, pollution, reckless fishing and massive damming. I switched my focus to environment reporting. It was not just the charismatic megafauna and the smog, though the concern about air quality never went away. It is really not funny to send your children off to school on days of high pollution with a cheery \"Try not to breathe too much\", knowing they will probably be kept in at break-times because the air outside is hazardous. As I have noted at greater length elsewhere, I had come to fear that China may be where the 200-odd-year-old carbon-fuelled capital-driven model of economic development runs into an ecological wall. Britain, where it started, and China may be bookends on a period of global expansion that has never been seen before and may never be repeated again. Developed nations have been outsourcing their environmental stress to other countries and future generations for more than two centuries. China is trying to do the same as it looks overseas for food, fuel and minerals to satisfy the rising demand of its cities and factories. This has been extremely good news for economies in Africa, Mongolia, Australia and South AmericaI sympathise with China. It is doing what imperial, dominant powers have done for more than two centuries, but it is harder for China because the planet is running short of land and time. With their engineering backgrounds, President Hu Jintao (a trained hydro-engineer) and premier Wen Jiabao (one of China's leading experts on rare earth minerals) are probably better aware than most global leaders about the challenge this poses. While there has been almost no political reform during their terms of office, there have been several ambitious steps forward in terms of environmental policy: anti-desertification campaigns; tree planting; an environmental transparency law; adoption of carbon targets; eco-services compensation; eco accounting; caps on water; lower economic growth targets; the 12th Five-Year Plan; debate and increased monitoring of PM2.5 [fine particulate matter] and huge investments in eco-cities, \"clean car\" manufacturing, public transport, energy-saving devices and renewable technology. The far western deserts of China have been filled with wind farms and solar panels. That is the most hopeful story of this grey era. If China could emerge from the smog with a low-carbon economy, it would be a boon for the world. But talk of the world's first green superpower remains as premature as the image of the \"red menace\" is outdated. When my predecessor, John Gittings, left China after 25 years, he presciently foresaw how the the old cold war stereotypes would be shattered by the country's speed of development. But that is just the start of realignment. In the future, I believe the most important political division will not be between left and right, but between conservers and consumers. The old battle of \"equality versus competition\" in the allocation of the resource pie will become secondary to maintaining the pie itself. But the transition has some way to go. In the next 10 years, China is likely to build more dams than the US managed in its entire history and, despite the Fukushima disaster, it plans to construct more about 20 new nuclear power stations. But even with this huge expansion of non-fossil-fuel-based energy, if the economy continues to grow at its current pace China will require about 50% more coal than it currently burns.I expect there will be a slowdown before then as overseas markets contract and domestic investment suffers from the law of diminishing returns. Long-hidden environmental costs – over-depletion of key resources and under-regulation of waste – will force their way onto corporate balance books and national budgets in the form of turbulent commodity prices and higher clean-up expenses. China may well look back on the Hu and Wen era as a golden age of growth and perhaps a missed opportunity to put in place the reforms needs to adjust to leaner times. Respect, sympathy – and pessimism Meanwhile a new leadership – almost certainly to be headed by Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang – will take the helm at this autumn's party congress. They will have their work cut out. While the Hu-Wen era was one of construction, Xi and Li will have to put more effort into maintenance. This will require more than the creation of wealth and construction jobs; it will require a system with greater flexibility, efficiency and a new set of values. I expect that transition will be more turbulent than anything seen in the past 10 years. But success or failure, I believe it will remain the most important story in the world. So why am I leaving? Well, over the years, I have come to feel increasing respect, sympathy and affection for China, but also more pessimism. Journalists here are worn down like brake pads on a speeding juggernaut. Such cynicism is not healthy. I hope a change of scene will allow me to see China – and the world – afresh. Regardless of Beijing's choking smog, traffic and politics, it will be hard to match living and working in China. I shall miss hikes along wild stretches of the Great Wall, swimming under remote waterfalls, wandering through vibrant hutongs, incredible food and some of the smartest company I have encountered anywhere in the world. In the past few weeks, I have said goodbyes to places, friends, long-suffering assistants and sources, some of whom have become global names as their country has risen in prominence over the past nine years: the environmentalist Ma Jun (winner of this year's Goldman Prize), the lawyer Teng Biao, journalist Li Datong, the rights activists Hu Jia (winner of the Sakharov human-rights prize), and Zeng Jinyan; the social network guru Isaac Mao, the public intellectual Wang Xiaoshan and the artist Ai Weiwei (recently named \"the most powerful artist on earth\"). On my final weekend in China, I went to Weiwei's grey-walled home in the Caochangdi art district. He was with his wife, two aides, a film crew and two lawyers, but as gregarious and mischievous as ever. \"It's hot. Let's take our clothes off,\" said Weiwei, who proceeded to strip to the waist. I was too shy to follow suit. So was everyone else. The lawyers simply proceeded with their brief about the next stage in his tax case. I couldn't stay. The China story was moving on again. News had just come in that Chen Guangcheng was at Beijing airport, about to board a plane to the US. After six years of house arrest and prison, he was finally flying to freedom. I said my goodbyes and wandered home to write up what felt like an uplifting article to finish on. I knew though, that it was not really the end. For all the hardship Chen endured, I guessed he would miss China. I certainly will. This is a peak and perhaps one for mankind. • Jonathan Watts will be based in Rio de Janeiro as Latin America correspondent from July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/217956","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-29T21:30:19Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: South Korean view on Kim Jong-il's health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/217956","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/217956","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: South Korean view on Kim Jong-il's health","bodyText":"Friday, 24 July 2009, 07:38 C O N F I D E N T I A L SEOUL 001171 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 07/24/2019 TAGS PGOV, PREL, PINR, ECON, KN, KS SUBJECT: A/S CAMPBELL'S MEETING WITH ROK UNIFICATION MINISTER HYUN IN-TAEK Classified By: Ambassador Stephens. Reasons 1.4(b/d) 1. (C) SUMMARY: In a July 20 meeting, Unification Minister Hyun In-taek outlined Kim Jong-il's health and succession concerns, key figures and the current state of the DPRK for A/S Campbell. Although Kim Jong-il (KJI) remained firmly in control of the regime for now, he was unlikely to live beyond 2015. On succession, Hyun observed the current succession preparations for Kim Jung-un were \"rushed,\" and anticipated additional \"fireworks\" (either a third nuclear test or missile launches) at the end of the current 150-day campaign, scheduled to end in mid-October. North Korea would return to dialogue afterwards. North Korea is suffering from severe food shortage and devastating economic crisis caused by lack of foreign aid, economic foundation and decent harvest. The situation is worse than the 1996/ 1997 crisis, because the economic uncertainty is taking place during, not after, a power transition period. Desperate for cash, Hyun believed North Korea would sell nuclear technology to potential buyers. North Korea desired to be a \"strong state,\" ideologically, militarily and economically. Nuclear power would allow two of the three: ideological and military strength. The role of the DPRK Foreign Ministry diminished after Kim Gae-kwan failed to \"deal with the United States.\" The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) remained a source for cash for the DPRK; it was also a potential window of opportunity for inter-Korean cooperation, and at the same time a potential political liability for both Koreas. Hyun believed North Korea after KJI's death would look very different than the current state and require economic assistance from South Korea and the United States. Hyun also underscored the importance the U.S.-ROK cooperation and believed a unified Korea should be nuclear free. END SUMMARY. -------------------------- KJI's Heath and Succession -------------------------- 2. (C) While KJI's overall political power remained \"firm and strong,\" his health was weakening, Hyun said. South Korean analysts believed that KJI was unlikely to live more than 3 to 5 years, although he seemed to be doing better lately. MOU had not discovered any firm basis for rumored pancreatic cancer, reports of which stemmed from a Japanese press article with a Beijing source. Wang Jiarui, Director for PRC Communist Party International Liaison Department, told Hyun that when he had met with KJI in January, Wang could not detect any scars on KJI's head from his widely reported surgery after suffering a stroke. Also, KJI did not look as though he would die soon when he attended the 15-year commemoration of the death of his father, Kim Il-sung, on July 8. KJI remained for the entire duration of the celebration -- over three hours -- and met with his staff for about 20 minutes after the event. 3. (C) Hyun observed that the current, \"rushed,\" pace of succession preparation in the North was noteworthy. \"Semi-officially,\" Hyun said, the transition had started, with some power and authority already transferred to the youngest son, Kim Jong-un, who had already been recognized publicly as a \"young commander\" and a \"brilliant star.\" The current 150-day campaign, scheduled to end in mid-October, was to provide a boost to a smoother transition. Hyun said he expected further nuclear and/or missile tests in October; perhaps, after that, North Korea would return to the nuclear talks. -------------------------------- Return to Dialogue After October -------------------------------- 4. (C) Hyun said it was only a matter of time before North Korea returned to the nuclear talks; the only question was when. North Korea faced a severely degraded economy, serious food shortages, and a shortage of foreign currency. It could resist for a while, but not for a long time. The Five Parties, therefore, should focus on how to manage the return of North Korea to the negotiations. If the return was not well managed, there would be poor results. The United States and South Korea must apply patience and pressure. -------------------------------- The Current State of North Korea -------------------------------- 5. (C) According to Hyun, North Korea now faced a very difficult economic situation, similar to the conditions in 1996 and 1997. Hyun pointed out that North Korea \"produces nothing\" and had \"no meaningful trade\" with the outside world. On food, Hyun said that North Korea was now asking private ROK entities for food assistance. Hyun confirmed that the ROKG did not send food aid or fertilizer to the DPRK from 2008 to present. Having also refused U.S. food aid, the DPRK was severely suffering, and the food situation would not improve soon, Hyun said. Since early July, North Korea had suffered from unusually heavy rainfall, which would have a devastating effect on the harvest this year. 6. (C) On inter-Korean trade, Hyun cited data from the Korea Development Institute (KDI), which showed a sharp decrease in inter-Korean trade over the past six months. Moreover, inter-Korean projects such as Mt. Kumkang and Kaesong city tours, major sources of cash, had dried up completely because they were closed in July and December 2008. The remaining, legitimate, cash flow for the North is now the Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), from which the North receives about USD 35 million for its 40,000 workers. Hyun believed that North Korea could, and would, sell nuclear technology, and even plutonium. 7. (C) Hyun assessed that Pyongyang's nuclear and missile tests were to earn \"one big deal\" with the United States. North Korea wanted to be recognized as a nuclear state. North Korea's goals were to become ideologically, militarily, and economically a strong state. Aiming to achieve \"strength\" in all areas by 2012, the year when North Korea will \"enter the gateway to become a strong and prosperous nation,\" according North Korean schedule. Hyun said the ideological goal was already achieved through Kim Il-sung's Juche, or self-reliance, ideology. The DPRK's aim to become a military power was \"nearly achieved,\" through the North's nuclear and missile capabilities. In North Korea's view, ideological and military strength would come from becoming a nuclear power. When North Korea would \"gain strength\" on all three fronts, it would also obtain the recognition and respect from the rest of the world. ----------- Key players ----------- 8. (C) Hyun identified Jang Sung-taek as the central figure in North Korea at the moment, probably the second-in-command. However, Jang did not oversee serious military issues, including nuclear and missile programs. On military issues, key authority was held by the National Defense Committee. Among the committee members, Hyun said Joo koo-chan was responsible for the rocket launch, and Oh Kuk-ryul and Kim Young-choon were key decision makers within the military. Other National Defense Committee members, such as Cho Myung-rok, who had met President Clinton, were not doing well because of old age. Oh Kuk-ryul and Kim Young-choon were also old, but remained active. According to Hyun's sources, Kim Young-choon suffers from bad hearing, but remained one of KJI's close confidants. Apparently, KJI called for Kim Young-choon twice on July 8, at the celebration of the 15th anniversary of KIS's death -- a clear sign of influence. Hyun also identified Kim Jeong-gak as \"very powerful,\" but underscored that KJI still controls \"everything, including the military.\" ----------------------------------- Diminishing Foreign Ministry's Role ----------------------------------- 9. (C) In the past, the DPRK Foreign Ministry enjoyed some of influence and power, as a check-and-balance element of the DPRK regime. Currently, that balance system has broken down and the foreign ministry's role has diminished considerably. One reason for this downfall, according to Hyun, was the perceived failure of the Six-Party Talks (6PT) where Kim Gye-kwan did \"not deal with the United States successfully.\" Hyun said that the North Korean authorities expected a lot from Kim Gye-kwan, but he had \"failed to deliver.\" ------------------------------- Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC) ------------------------------- 10. (C) Hyun saw the KIC as a window of opportunity for inter-Korean development, especially in introducing South Korean capitalism to the North. Run by South Korean managers and machines, the KIC provides glimpse of the South Korean way of life to over 40,000 North Korean workers and their external families. The workers' change in appearance and way of thinking was visible, Hyun said. The 40,000 KIC workers could spread the South Korea's way of life to their families, thus directly affecting some 150,000 people around Kaesong city. Hyun also noted that, the KIC was a divisive issue in South Korea too. The North could use KIC to \"divide\" the South, Hyun assessed, but still, Hyun said, most of South Korea, including the ROKG, did not want the project to fail. ----------- Way forward ----------- 11. (C) Hyun believed North Korea after KJI's death would look very different, requiring considerable economic assistance from South Korea, the United States and international community. Hyun advised that in case of a sudden collapse in North Korea, the ROKG and USG should move quickly toward unification of the Korean peninsula. There was \"no disagreement\" among ROK agencies on this point, Hyun said. The USG could expect \"full cooperation\" from the ROKG; unification was the goal of South Korea. Hyun underscored the importance the U.S.-ROK cooperation and stated that a unified Korea should be nuclear free. 12. (U) A/S Campbell has cleared this message.

If you liked this liveblog, please give generously! We are going to the pub. Patten - who became increasingly unsurefooted as the interview wore on - was at his most hesitant when asked why the headhunters (£186,000 + VAT) who recommended George Entwistle didn't have a clause in their contract then required a refund if the candidate left the job very soon. Patten's defence of the names-up-a-chimney process was rather wobbly. We used the process we'd been through before. The first stage involves talking to people who know about the media, ex-chairmen and ex-DGs, then talking to candidates around the world. In the middle of that process I talked to Tony about whether he would throw his hat in the ring... [the first time round] he said two things - that he was committed to completing the cultural Olympiad and the second thing was that he thought it was time for a younger man. I was so much older then - I'm younger than that now, it seems. On the payoff, Patten was again rather emotional. \"It would have been easier if George's lawyers had been prepared to settle for six months\" but had the case not proceeded amicably, the BBC would have faced paying more than the 12 month salary in fees. Twelve months pay is standard in constructive dismissal, Patten said. Mair pushed him - \"do you feel you let him down?\" It was right, on that grim Saturday night, to press him to settle for 6 months rather than 12. I owe hi a huge amount of sympathy... he's had a lot of manure heaped on him. Extra fees that were part of Entwistle's payoff: 12 months' private medical care, £10,000 to cover legal fees reated to the resignation, £25,000 to cover legal fees related to contributions to the Savile investigation and £10,000 for PR. And did Patten ever consider his own position? Only at 3 in the morning, he said. My responsibility was to steer the BBC through the crisis, and if I don't manage to, then come back and ask me the question... Several people mooted Emily formerly-of-this-parish Bell to me as a potential director general. This is in the context of fantasy football-esque lineups among the tech contingent, I should add, though if the BBC were ever to split the top job and enshrine digital ingenuity to one of those roles, things would be looking very different. Either way the appointment process looks extremely outdated - a media industry version of stuffing bits of paper in a chimney and seeing who wafts out of the top. Not sure patten would agree. Here's a word from Bell: I've been repeating the headline 'Chernobyl Fallout' to myself again and again, but still can't think of any gags. It's on the tip of my tongue. #unsuitableanalogies Just chasing the audio for the Patten interview. @skirrid on Twitter tells me Eddie Mair \"went for him, proper. The word is slither.\" John Plunkett's been hard at work digging out everything you might need to know about the BBC's new boss man. And it is a man. Again. • Hall made Huw Edwards the face of the Six O'Clock News • Hall led tributes to murdered presenter Jill Dando in April 1999 • Three days after that, Hall was moved to a safe house by police after a death threat from a Serbian activist who claimed responsibility for Dando's death • Was known as 'head prefect' because of his loyalty • Held nerve when BBC secretly prepared controversial Diana interview • Hall and John Birt proposed downgrading Newsnight and Today editors in 1997 • Hall moved radio journalists to move to White City, much to the anger of John Humphrys. He rejoins just as they move back to lavishly renovated buildings at New Broadcasting House - in central London. John Plunkett has spoken to former deputy director of BBC News and Radio 4 controller Mark Damazer, who worked with Tony Hall when he was director of news: Amusing, companionable, convivial, he's a really nice guy. He's a relaxed person, but not to the point where he doesn't convey authority while being relaxed. Battle hardened by his time at the Royal Opera House and BBC News, he has a history of picking decent people. He's also an extremely good mimic when he wants to be and a big reader. He has always had an intellectual curiousity about the world. He is a very good choice and they have done very well to get him. A few choice quotes in this BBC summary. The Spectator's Tom Bower last week wrote: Doubters should consider his success at Covent Garden and his rescue of the Cultural Olympiad from disaster. Hall knows how to rebuild a valuable institution mired by greed, stupidity and cowardice. Every crisis produces a solution. This one should not be wasted. Stewart Purvis, former ITV chief executive: The fact that we believe he didn't apply first time around made him a very good candidate second time around, because he wasn't in any way damaged by the first time. I would guess that perhaps the BBC Trust made it clear they would really like him to have the job - and being a BBC man at heart it was difficult to resist the temptation to come back and help at a difficult time. Former Press Complaints Commission chairman Sir Christopher Meyer: Such an effusion of praise for Tony Hall, why didn't he succeed Mark Thompson in the first place? * Admittedly this is 'celebrity' used in the media context. Kardashian wasn't talking. Sorry. Some friends, and some sceptics: In this Telegraph interview last December, Hall says he asked the Royal Opera House chairman for a paycut in his £390,000 salary because of the tough climate, but was turned down. Would do the same at the BBC in a period, as the NUJ points out, where it faces yet more job cuts? Hall left shortly after losing out to Greg Dyke in the battle to be Director General. Everyone, his wife included, thought he was mad to go to the ROH, but given that Dyke resigned in the wake of the Hutton report and Hall is now riding high at the ROH … well, look who has had the last laugh. 'Obviously I would have loved to have become the DG,' says Hall now, 'but life has a funny way of turning out.' Charlotte Higgins again on why the Royal Opera House was crushed, shambolic and elitist when Hall joined - and how he turned it around. The NUJ's general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said she looked forward to a good working relationship with Hall. The corporation is going through a torrid time and needs stability and a leader who will be supporting well-funded, quality journalism. We will be asking Tony Hall to address this, particularly in the light of this week’s National Audit Organisation report which notes that the corporation is ‘failing to monitor spending against its strategic and editorial priorities’, putting at risk high-standard news coverage and programming. I will be asking him to call a moratorium on the cuts and take the opportunity to make his mark by halting the assault on frontline journalism and put in place measures to shore up news and current affairs before it is too late. The NUJ is in the process of balloting for industrial action over compulsory jobs losses. He should step in and sort out the shambles of the redeployment system which is causing this problem and stop this dispute in its tracks. Some clever winkling out by Tom Phillips of MSN over on Damian Kahya's Energydesk blog, who has found a piece called Nuclear Cloud over Britain Tony Hall wrote for Marxism Today in 1986. (As well as coal mining, Hall published Nuclear Politics: The History of Nuclear Power in Britain). Consider it a welcome gift from the BBC's incoming director general to the Daily Mail, with love. Patten was visibly rattled when talking about George Entwistle's payoff sum. \"We must remember that Entwistle was a distinguished and long-serving member of staff who had taken a significant cut in salary. \"This amount is entirely defensible before the Public Accounts Select Committee,\" Patten said. \"The deal was done to resolve a difficult issue swiftly and that was in the interests of the BBC and licence-fee payers.\" He added that the alternative would have been to deal with lawyers in an case for unfair dismissal and that no employment lawyer has yet disagreed with the settlement that totalled £450,000 - equivalent to Entwistle's one-year salary. Cutting off the next question, Patten continued, getting increasingly animated. \"If you think it was easy you're kidding yourself. I've been in public life for some time - I knew what people would say, what the headlines would be... it was the right settlement and I'm looking forward to saying that to the DCMS select committee next week if they ask me. I'll have more to say on that, too.\" That will, of course, be covered on MediaGuardian. Steve Hewlett asked if Patten was happy with the openness of the DG-recruitment process - did you just phone him up? It wasn't quite like that. Patten said they interviewed each other, and that ultimately every member of the trust was involved in appointing Tony Hall. If you appoint the outstanding candidate arguments about process are by-the-by. It wouldn't have made sense for us to spend four months going through the process we went through before while we had [so many acting heads of department]. I'm delighted that in moving fast we've also found the out-and-out outstanding candidate. If we'd spent four months on this you'd all have told us we were out of our minds. Dan Sabbagh asked if Patten has under any pressure from any part of government: I've been under no pressure whatsoever except the pressure of my obligations, what I and the trust believe is in the interest of a very great institution which is to rebuild the trust people have put in it over the years. Hall was introduced by a very tired looking Lord Patten, who praised Hall's \"formidable reputation in three decades of leadership\" and an \"equally distinguished record as leader of one of our greatest cultural institutions... where once of his greatest accomplishments has been opening up one of our great treasures to a bigger, wider, younger audience\". Patten also praised the \"terrific and brave job\" being done by temporary DG Tim Davie for \"some wonderful work getting the BBC back on an even keel\" and said the two would be working together closely before Hall starts in March. Introduced by BBC TRust chair Lord Patten, Tony Hall's first words as BBC DG were: It take a lot to drag me away from the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, which is a place I love hugely - but the reason I'm standing before you today is because I believe passionately about the BBC and what it can do, what programme makers can do... It's an extraordinary organisation that is part of the UK, part of Britain, part of who we are. It has also had an incredible impact around world too. It has been a really tough few weeks for this organisation but I know we can get through it, and I will be listening patiently to what you think we should be doing next. I'm absolutely committed to this news organisation as an absolute world beater, committed to ensuring that the best and brightest and most creative people in the country and the world come and want to work in this place first. No-one can do this on their own. If you're going to run a creative organisation you need a good team - I have known this from my earliest days in news through to the latter day. I know that with the right creative team. working off each other, sparking off each other, giving each other ideas, you can do extraordinary things. And that's not just the people who work here but the people who support us around the world. Hall then made his apologies and said his immediate priority as to meet staff. He'll do interviews in a few weeks' time, he said. Press gathering at New Broadcasting House. Sabbagh's snapping the snappers: But the press turnout's a bit low. Maybe it was labelling the press area as a 'pen' that did it? The nation can relax: Stephen Fry has given Tony Hall the thumbs up. The British Council is bigging up Hall's time as trustee, saying he helped champion the arts in international relations, UK arts in China and internationalising UK higher education. Chair Sir Vernon Ellis said: “Tony Hall is a superb choice for the BBC’s new Director General. I’ve worked closely with Tony for many years, firstly at English National Opera and more recently at the British Council. He’s been passionate about our work to connect people internationally through culture and education – and he’ll bring that same passion to the BBC. He’s good in a crisis and a perfect fit for one of Britain’s great institutions, the BBC.” Slightly mesmerising promo by the Royal Opera House in which Tony Hall makes a few fast-talking appearances. Robert Andrews on paidContent posits that Hall doesn't have a huge amount of digital progress on his CV, but that all he needs to do is follow the ambitious digital mission laid out by George Entwistle, who excited many in the tech community with his plans. He was prepared to shoot for a greater prize: 'It’s the quest for this – genuinely new forms of digital content – that represents the next profound moment of change we need to prepare for if we’re to deserve a new charter. We need to be ready to produce and create genuinely digital content for the first time.' Entwistle was prepared to tear up existing BBC structures to achieve it, promising to integrate three distinct units — Vision (TV), Audio &amp; Music and the digital Future Media division — within two years to ensure all three were conceiving digital content from the start, not just 'obsessing only about the creation of television or radio'... No matter who is top dog at the BBC, much of online strategy thinking will come from the corporation’s future media director, currently Ralph Rivera, and not the director general. But it was from Entwistle and not from Rivera that we first heard the exciting post-iPlayer proposals in September. But seeing as we're in a lull ahead of the photocall (and a brief statement by Hall) at 3.30, why not? More archive content while stuffing a late lunch (eating is cheating, livebloggers!) - this time a detailed profile from November last year. On the similarities between running an arts venue and a news organisation: Risk-taking is one – not being able to define with absolute certainty when it's working well and when it's not. Defining what is good in the art you're doing is as difficult as programme-making at the BBC. Another similarity is dealing with very devolved ways of working where you depend on teams delivering things. I remember spending some time at management school when I was at the BBC. The American view of leadership is that it's all about leaders: that they do incredible things and work endless hours. Actually I think it's quite the reverse in broadcasting and in this place; you depend absolutely on teams doing things. And on leadership to lead a good team? I felt that we needed to get over that and stress what this place is brilliant at: what people come to see on stage. It is absolutely crucial to look outwards and see how you're perceived from the outside. So it's about people, it's about strategy and it's about knowing where you're going. The other thing is creating an environment where people can talk about what went wrong without wanting to hide anything. That latter principle is an interesting one given ongoing investigations at the BBC. Head of media and technology at the Guardian, Dan Sabbagh, has written an article asking whether Hall will take the heat off Lord Patten. The question now is what happens to Lord Patten. Is No 10 really pleased with his performance thus far? He has struggled to respond to the Savile crisis, failing to strike a tone that is respected by the public. Nor does it help that the BBC chairman is laden with other jobs, being for example chancellor of Oxford University, which must involve some work. Our eminent media blogger referred to his recent Standard column: If he can be persuaded to step into the maelstrom, I would prefer Tony Hall, or Baron Hall of Birkenhead as he became in 2010. He would be an 'inside outsider' because he enjoyed a successful career at the BBC, where he became director of news until quitting in 2001. He went on to be chief executive of the Royal Opera House, where he has had a glittering decade. He should now return to the BBC stage. Full comment from Labour's shadow culture, media and sport secretary: Tony Hall is an excellent choice as the new director general of the BBC, with experience that includes head of news at the BBC and leadership of the Royal Opera House, one of our great cultural institutions. He is the right person to bring stability to the BBC in these difficult times and I look forward to working with him. All those BBC staff tweeting @TonyHallBBCDG to try and impress him with your social media chops - it ain't him. The profile's a bit of a giveaway: \"I'm the man to take us out of this shit. Views aren't of the BBC, (although I run the bloody thing LOL?!)\" A few select comments from you, glorious readers. BruceWhitehead isn't impressed: Another terrible choice. Hall is a Birtite who is part-and-parcel of the very establishment mesh of incompetents who are totally out of touch. We needed someone with a fresh, healthy, original take on broadcasting and the arts, who could inspire and lead. Instead we get another grey suit without charisma or talent, who has risen without trace in the goobledigook-speaking tribes of the MBA managementariat. MartinNYID: It's all pointless without a complete audit, pay reducations and an overhaul. More Emperors, no clothes. END THE TAX. And no love for PPE from Buckster69: People are wondering why these scandals, within political, media and commercial circles are becoming a regular occurrence. Why we continually hear the same old terms rolled out along with the usual flimflam of institutional placebos and buzzwords provided when there is a public outcry and demands for action. Well, it's no coincidence that most of those involved directly or indirectly have completed the PPE (Philosophy,Politics and Economics) degree course. It has become the byword as the entry level requirement for those to be considered for a place within elite governmental, media and banking roles. It has been so ingrained since the 1980's within the hierarchy of this country, that it's hardly surprising that dominant spheres share the same lack of accountable morality and contempt for public sentiment... The Question Time host told the Radio Times: \"I think it's a very good choice and a great relief for those of us who work for the BBC. He knows the BBC and he's worked outside but, above all, he understands BBC journalism. He's a good public face for the BBC. I feel like I'm serving in the Royal Navy when the message came in: 'Winston is back.'\" Dimbleby added: \"I think most people will be thrilled at this choice and [we] will also get the leadership that is needed from somebody who is a creative man and a good administrator - and a calm man in a time of crisis.\" Talent agent Jonathan Shalit has welcomed Hall's appointment: \"At last with Tony Hall the BBC have the right man for the role of Director General. The BBC is without doubt the greatest broadcaster in the world and needs a man of global stature to lead it. Tony has led The Royal Opera House into being globally recognised and admired. Having to deal with the current BBC problems – only an outsider can be fully objective as he will have no existing affiliations. At the same time having worked successfully in the BBC, Tony Hall has some understanding of the machinations with which he has to deal. The BBC Trust have got it right – albeit a painful journey to get there.\" A more sceptical BBC insider from BBC tech tells me Hall is the least worst choice, and will be good at standing up for the BBC against corporates and politicians. There's also a hint of Obama second term go-for-brokeness, which we like: \"He's also old enough to allow a younger generation to dream, which is good - it's not like going in there at 45 and staying for 15 years.\" On his part in the creation of BBC News Online, Hall apparently demanded that the team \"go away and don't come back until it is done... he was willing to take a punt on something he knew was important\". That also bodes well, especially for tech. \"Given the complete fucking disaster, it's better than many of us expected. I for one embrace my new operatic overlord....\" Baker is spewing out various 'helpful' suggestions for Hall's opening agenda... Useful reading for any BBC staff who may feel they need to brush up on their opera. Ladbrokes' odds: TONY HALL is heavily odds-on to last longer at the BBC than Lord Patten according to Ladbrokes. The appointment of Hall as the new BBC Director General has seen the firm open up a market on who will last the longest at the corporation and it's the new DG who comes out on top at 1/4 with the Trust Chairman given a 3/1 chance. It's a pick of two at even money that Hall's tenure in his new role is over or under 3 1/2 years, or for the pessimistic out there it's a 54/1 chance that Tony Hall's term is shorter than George Entwistle's stint as DG. How long will Tim Hall last as BBC Director General? Under 3.5 Years Evens / Over 3.5 Evens Term to be shorter than George Entwistle's 54/1 Who will last longer? Tony Hall 1/5 Lord Patten 3/1 Head of media and technology at the Guardian, Dan Sabbagh, says it turns out that Hall was phoned late last week, and asked if he would take on the top job at the BBC. Hall then agreed to meet trustees on Tuesday, where they interviewed him and he asked them questions. Friends of Hall say that he \"felt a sense of duty\" to take on the job. An agreement appears to have been reached yesterday. BTW, Peston tweeted Hall's appointment at 11:55 - head of the official BBC email. Which means many BBC staff probably read it first on Twitter. The Indy mentions that Hall stepped up now because he \"understood that he was needed\", with Yentob praising his good judgment. A flurry of humourous/welcoming tweets: Here's how most BBC staff learnt of Hall's appointment, just after noon today. The media desk has had its interest piqued by this nugget from Hall's ROH bio, which states that in 1981 he wrote a history of the National Union of Mineworkers called King Coal. Which, given the events of the time, may or may not point to him being a bit of a leftie. Even Amazon looks rather bereft on this one. Anyone got a copy? The wrong Tony, alas. Thanks, @keithemmerson Our chief arts writer Charlotte Higgins on Tony Hall: At the Royal Opera House, Tony Hall has transformed a deeply troubled organisation into a well-oiled machine. Let's hope it works for the BBC. From Broadcast, 2004. Hall said he wouldn't have taken the role even if he was approached, and then criticised the controversial \"due process\" investigation into the death of David Kelly which is fascinating in the context of Savile, Newsnight and McAlpine. You have got to have discipline in an organisation, and if things have gone wrong you need to know why. But those sort of things have got to be conducted and sorted out quickly, and without the feeling of blame or retribution. The BBC has been through a complete trial, where the chairman and director have left. In my view; move on, learn lessons but learn them quickly, and then move on to restoring confidence in the organisation. We all need a strong powerful BBC committed to making programmes, committed to having news that not only reports what is going on, but also makes life difficult for politicians and organisations and others. That is very important for our British culture. Audio from Robert Peston at the BBC on Tony Hall's appointment: Andrew Culf, who was the Guardian’s media correspondent from between 1992 and 1997, recalls Tony Hall’s time running the BBC’s news operation: Tony Hall was head of the BBC news operation during the tumultuous period of John Birt’s leadership of the BBC, so he is used to being in the eye of the storm. He brought a “tiggerish” zeal to his job as director of news at the corporation, the post to which he was appointed in 1993. He was responsible for a major overhaul of the BBC’s news output and oversaw the successful launch of the BBC Radio 5 Live, as well as being an early evangelist for online news coverage and the concept of “news for you”, the idea that new technology would increasingly allow viewers to access news on their own terms, rather than just through old-style television and radio news bulletins. He was also at the helm of the news operation when the BBC held its nerve and secretly prepared the controversial Panorama interview with Princess Diana to the consternation of the palace and the BBC’s chairman Marmaduke Hussey. A BBC man through and through (he was editor of the Nine O’Clock News at the age of 34), he was generally respected by his staff for his unstuffiness and approachability, even though he was also known by some as the “head prefect” because of his on message loyalty to the corporation and his more senior colleagues. And with perfect timing, ITV has agreed to pay Lord McAlpine £125,000 damages + legal costs for Phillip Schofield's This Morning blunder. Alan Yentob, the BBC's creative director, said that he believed that Hall was \"the right man to run the BBC\" given that he has both experience of the organisation and spent \"10 years outside the BBC\". At 61, Yentob said that he believed that Hall had \"the judgement and wisdom\" to run the BBC - and that his age was not a barrier to running an organisation despite the intense pressures that saw off Entwistle. NUJ stalwart Paul McLaughlin tweets: Be a good appointment for journalists/journalism inside BBC, although some felt he was too close to Birt. Hall was head of News when Birt created the News Division (directorate) created a very powerful journalistic silo. Interesting to note the job creation of journalists during that time, online, 5live, News24. Freedland is pleased: Hall will start in early March. Tweeter Chrishdouglas helpfully asks: Is Tony Hall related to the First Lord Birkenhead who died of drink and was famous for his 'poisonous vituperation'? I do hope so. Culture secretary Maria Miller said: I congratulate Tony Hall on his appointment as director general, he has a very strong track record in successfully leading iconic organisations. I am pleased the BBC Trust have appointed a new director general. It is important now that Tony Hall gets to grips quickly - to provide the stability and certainty that the BBC needs, and restore public confidence. Harriet Harman says yes: Tony Hall excellent choice for BBC DG. Right person to bring stability in these difficult times. Look forward to working with him Hall and Patten are doing a photocall at 3.30pm at the Media Cafe, New Broadcasting House. Here's our news story on the appointment of Tony Hall. The BBC Trust said it took the unusual approach of making a direct approach from to Hall and he accepted without the broadcaster speaking to anybody else. Hall did not apply for the job when it last became vacant as a result of Mark Thompson's departure earlier this year – partly because at 61 he felt he was too old. There is likely to be more scrutiny of the very closed process by which he was appointed - by which every DG is appointed - where the trust reviews likely candidates and approaches them directly. Hall was the only candidate approached, we have been told. • He'll be paid £450,000, the same as outgoing/outgone DG George Entwistle and temporary DG Tim Davie • He'll be the 16th director general • He already claims a BBC pension • No word on whether he'll wear a tie or not. Odds very much on him wearing a tie, we think. Full biog, ending with his lordly duties: Lord Hall took up his position as Chief Executive of the Royal Opera House in April 2001. He joined the BBC as a news trainee in 1973 and during a 28 year career at the Corporation he held roles including Senior Producer at World at One, Assistant Editor of the Nine O’Clock News, Output Editor for Newsnight, culminating as Chief Executive of BBC News from 1996 to 2001. While at the BBC he launched Radio 5 Live, BBC News 24, BBC News Online and BBC Parliament. He is Deputy Chairman of Channel 4 Television and sits on the board of The British Council and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation. He is passionate about education and skills within the cultural industries. He was the founder Chair of the Creative and Cultural &amp; Skills Council and Chairman of the Musical and Dance Scheme. He spearheaded the development of the new High House Production Park in Thurrock, Essex. With the exception of his role at the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, he will be standing down from all his other current roles before taking up the post of Director-General of the BBC. He has been Chair of Stratford East Theatre, and Honorary Visiting Fellow of Journalism at City University, a member of the Regeneration Through Heritage Steering Group, a board member of Race for Opportunity, a former non-executive director of HM Customs and Excise and was a member of the Council for Brunel University. In 2009 he was asked by the Government and the Mayor of London to set up and chair a board to direct the Cultural Olympiad and also joined the board of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. He was appointed a CBE in 2005 and in 2010 was created a life peer with the title Baron Hall of Birkenhead. He sits on the Crossbenches in the House of Lords. And Ashley Highfield, former BBC director of future media and technology, weighs in: So Tony Hall (lives in Henley) replaces Tim Davie (lives in Henley) who replaces John Smith (lives in Henley) - BBC diversity in action! Our own Jonathan Freedland retweets himself. Ten points, Jonny: An eminent Labour figure texts to say Tony Hall of Royal Opera House is a good bet for DG: he lost out to Dyke Richard Bacon points out on Twitter: \"A quarter of ALL the people to hold the title 'Director General' in the BBC's 90 year history... have held that title in the last 10 weeks.\" There's a good backgrounder on Hall on the Royal Opera House website, which includes: He is widely credited with bringing financial stability to Britain’s largest and most complex arts institution, building the organization into a global centre of excellence for opera and ballet, and a beacon of creativity and best practice within the arts sector. Hall said in the BBC's statement: I believe passionately in the BBC and that’s why I have accepted Lord Patten’s invitation to become Director General. This organisation is an incredibly important part of what makes the United Kingdom what it is. And of course it matters not just to people in this country – but to tens of millions around the world too. It’s been a difficult few weeks – but together we’ll get through it. I’m committed to ensuring our news services are the best in the world. I’m committed to making this a place where creative people, the best and the brightest, want to work. And I know from my first days here as a news trainee, to my time as head of news and current affairs, to my time now at the Royal Opera House, that I can’t do it on my own. Having the right teams working together, sparking off each other, is key. And I want to build a world class team to lead a world class BBC. Hall was head of BBC News and Current Affairs from 1996 to 2001, and chair of the Cultural Olympiad. Hall also helped launched BBC News Online, Radio 5, BBC News 24 and BBC Parliament. He will almost certainly be required to step down from his current position as deputy chairman of Channel 4. Lord Tony Hall, who has been chief executive of the Royal Opera House since 2001, was today announced as the new BBC director general. In a statement, BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said Hall \"has been an insider and is a currently an outsider\": As an ex-BBC man he understands how the Corporation’s culture and behaviour make it, at its best, the greatest broadcaster in the world. And from his vantage point outside the BBC, he understands the sometimes justified criticisms of the corporation – that it can be inward looking and on occasions too institutional."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/apr/20/fossil-fuel-lobbying-shale-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-20T16:24:55Z","webTitle":"Fossil fuel firms use 'biased' study in massive gas lobbying push","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/20/fossil-fuel-lobbying-shale-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/apr/20/fossil-fuel-lobbying-shale-gas","fields":{"headline":"Fossil fuel firms use 'biased' study in massive gas lobbying push","bodyText":"Senior executives in the fossil fuel industry have launched an all-out assault on renewable energy, lobbying governments and business groups to reject wind and solar power in favour of gas, in a move that could choke the fledgling green energy industry. Multinational companies including Shell, GDF Suez and Statoil are promoting gas as an alternative \"green\" fuel. These companies are among dozens around the world investing in new technologies to exploit shale gas, a controversial form of the fuel that has rejuvenated the gas industry because it is plentiful in supply and newly accessible due to technical advances in gas extraction known as \"fracking\". The expansion of shale gas holds out the promise of a glut in gas that is driving down prices and creating a bonanza for the fossil fuel industry. Burning gas in power stations releases about half the carbon emissions of coal, allowing gas companies to claim it is a \"green\" source of fuel. Central to the lobbying effort is a report claiming that the EU could meet its 2050 carbon targets €900bn more cheaply by using gas than by investing in renewables. But the Guardian has established that the analysis is based on a previous report that came to the opposite conclusion – that renewables should play a much larger role. The report being pushed by the fossil fuel industry has been disowned by its original authors who referred to it as \"biased\" in favour of gas. For the last two months, company lobbyists have been besieging government officials in Europe, the US and elsewhere to push the report. Their efforts are being boosted through alliances with energy-intensive industries, which are joining in the pressure on government in the hope of securing cheap energy. As the problems with the Fukushima plant in Japan have cast a pall over nuclear power, gas companies sense the chance to brand themselves as the main \"green\" source of energy. James Smith, outgoing UK chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, one of the leaders in the lobbying effort, said switching to gas would offer the world \"a breathing space\" in the battle against climate change. This view was challenged by Prof David Mackay, chief scientific adviser to the UK's Department of Energy and Climate Change. He told the Guardian: \"You can't reach the [climate] targets like this - there is no way that switching to gas would solve the problem. I don't think it's really credible that gas is the only future.\" The lobbying effort by fossil fuel companies has been intense. At a high level meeting on Wednesday, the president of the European parliament hosted a lunch for the gas industry with VIP guests including the EU's energy chief, Günther Oettinger. It is the latest in a long round of meetings in recent months between gas lobbyists and senior officials in Brussels, including other EU commissioners and prominent MEPs, as part of the industry's charm offensive. Oettinger alone has held at least two other major meetings with gas representatives this year. At most of these meetings, and at many other formal and informal meetings to discuss EU energy and climate change, officials have been presented with a report commissioned by the European Gas Advocacy Forum (EGAF), an industry lobbying group, based in part on an analysis by consultancy firm McKinsey and called Making the Green Journey Work. This report appears to show the EU could meet its 2050 climate targets €900bn more cheaply using gas than by investing in renewables. A copy of the report has also been presented to the office of José Manuel Barroso, the EU president, who has taken a close interest in EU gas supply with visits to the Ukraine, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan this year. Apart from coming to different conclusions about renewable energy, the report also relies on questionable assumptions about the future price of technology to capture and store carbon. The team at the European Climate Foundation that produced the original report described the EGAF version as \"biased to one preferential outcome in support of gas advocacy\". They warn that adopting its conclusions would reduce energy security and expose the European economy to the volatile gas price. A spokesperson for McKinsey said: \"It is our long-standing policy not to discuss our clients or the work we do for them.\" David Rimmer, Shell's general managed for global gas said, \"Shell sees renewables as a major part of the future energy mix but this analysis has shown that increased reliance on gas in the near term saves money and jobs, delivers on climate targets and allows new technologies to be improved before large scale deployment.\" Further doubt has been thrown on the industry's claims by a newly released academic study from Cornell University which found that generating electricity from shale gas – because of the difficulty in extracting it from rocks – produces at least as much carbon dioxide as coal-fired power, and perhaps more. Jenny Banks, climate and energy policy officer at WWF-UK, called on the British government to halt shale gas exploration. \"It would be ridiculous to encourage shale gas when in reality its greenhouse gas footprint could be as bad as or worse than coal. We need to reject this source of gas, and have a clear plan to move away from our dependency on fossil fuels and harness the full potential of renewable technologies.\" Some in the gas industry are careful to argue that its fuel is complementary to renewables, as it can be relatively easily turned on and off to provide flexible back-up power when the wind is not blowing. This argument is accepted by Oettinger, who insists that both gas and renewable energy will be needed for flexible low-carbon power generation, and some other senior figures. Nobuo Tanaka, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said: \"Gas is potentially a game changer. But it is complementary to renewables, as it can be turned on and off quickly. It could be baseload power and we could turn off coal.\" But renewable energy generators are wary, as they fear that cash-strapped governments will ease off on subsidies for clean power, in favour of licensing gas-fired power stations. A new gas-fired power station would be expected to have a useful life of about 25 to 40 years. So although switching from coal to gas would help countries meet their short term emissions targets, in the longer term they would be left with fleets of redundant, high-emitting fossil fuel power stations – unless they were fitted with expensive technology to capture and store the carbon dioxide underground. However, this technology is still unproven and it is likely to be decades before it can be widely used. The economics of the technology are highly uncertain, and renewable companies argue that the assumptions used by EGAF to show that the fossil fuel is cheaper than renewables do not stand up to scrutiny. Shale gas is controversial because it requires large amounts of water to release it from rocks, and the use of potentially dangerous chemicals that could leach into the water supply. Numerous cases in the US, which has led the way in releasing gas from shale rocks using fracking technology, have shown evidence of contamination and dangerous leaks of methane. Prof Robert Howarth, lead author of the Cornell study, said: \"My strong belief is that shale gas has been promoted far beyond the objective evidence of what it can and cannot do. It is time to step back, and objectively analyse whether this is a reasonable energy technology for our future. It is also time to analyse how environmental issues associated with the technology might be reduced, and at what cost.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/oct/10/pension-funds-investment-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-09T23:07:24Z","webTitle":"How pension funds can plug the investment gap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/10/pension-funds-investment-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/oct/10/pension-funds-investment-infrastructure","fields":{"headline":"How pension funds can plug the investment gap","bodyText":"The London Gateway, a £1.5bn project to build a giant deep-water port and logistic park on the banks of the Thames near Thurrock, Essex, received its latest ministerial delegation last week. Vince Cable, pictured, the business secretary, followed in the footsteps of his predecessor, Lord Mandelson, and then prime minister Gordon Brown, in donning a hard hat for the obligatory tour and photo-call. The reason why London Gateway gets more than its fair share of flying visits by politicians – its proximity to Westminster aside – is the fact that there are precious few examples of other major infrastructure projects to point to in the UK. It's not that there isn't a need to build new railways, roads, ports and, most of all, new pieces of energy kit such as power stations, wind farms and electricity grids. The estimated investment required in energy alone by 2020 is a cool £200bn. It's the same story globally. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an eye-watering $1,900bn (£1,200bn) a year needs to be spent on roads, rail, telecoms, electricity and water every year until 2020. So where is the money going to come from? Certainly not the banks, who need to repair their battered balance sheets after the credit crunch. Governments such as the UK's are too steeped in debt to make any meaningful contributions. Oil-rich foreign investors cannot be expected to meet the challenge on their own: the London Gateway is being bankrolled by Dubai-based DP World, which almost scrapped the project because of its debt problems and a slump in global shipping markets. Step forward, then, the pension funds. With stock markets no longer offering the steady growth they once did, and interest rates at rock bottom, pension funds' traditional investments – in shares, bonds and sovereign gilts – are no longer so attractive. Increasingly, they are putting money into new infrastructure funds, which offer long-term, steady returns – particularly if they invest in regulated assets such as electricity networks – to match the long-term liabilities of their members. Yet pension funds, like any other investor, will contribute only if they think they will get a decent return. So to justify huge up-front investment in low-carbon technologies whose economics are uncertain – such as nuclear power, offshore wind farms and clean coal – governments need to guarantee a radical regime of subsidies stretching out for decades. One chief executive of a major UK energy company claimed that getting pension funds to invest in this way could solve two of the biggest crises facing society: supporting an ageing population and climate change. Others are less optimistic. One banker compares today's infrastructure challenge with that faced by 19th-century London, when a lack of adequate sanitation turned the Thames into an open sewer, most notably during the \"big stink\" of 1858, leading to cholera epidemics. Only then was civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette given the funds to build an effective – and expensive – sewer network in London. This banker thinks that we will need an energy crisis of similar proportions before the political – and public – will exists to foot the bill for the billions needed to invest in infrastructure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2011/apr/22/japan-earthquake-jleague","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-22T11:29:06Z","webTitle":"Football plays big supporting role in Japan's recovery from disasters | John Duerden","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/apr/22/japan-earthquake-jleague","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2011/apr/22/japan-earthquake-jleague","fields":{"headline":"Football plays big supporting role in Japan's recovery from disasters","bodyText":"\"We knew something wasn't right and then suddenly our phones weren't working,\" recalls Eddy Bosnar of the J-League team Shimizu S-Pulse. \"We went home to see what was happening on the television. People were saying that just one person had died but when I saw what was happening with the tsunami, I said: 'That can't be right.'\" Unfortunately it wasn't but, even as the Australian defender watched events unfold on 11 March, he didn't imagine that he would have to wait until 23 April to play the second game of the 2011 J-League season. In the immediate aftermath of the earthquake, Bosnar did what most foreign players did. He went home. \"We had four or five days off initially. I made a quick visit to Australia just to show people that I was OK and then I came back.\" Others ended up leaving permanently. The Brazilian striker Marquinhos had played only once for Vegalta Sendai, the top-flight club closest to the epicentre of the earthquake, but one aftershock too many had him requesting that his contract be terminated as, according to the club, he was in a state of physiological shock. Everyone understood. \"The Japanese are normally immune to earthquakes as all the buildings are earthquake-proof but the tsunami was something different,\" Bosnar says. \"It was a scary thing for everyone.\" Sendai have done all they can to get their stadium ready for their next home game on 29 April. Kashima Antlers is 150 miles south of Sendai but is the only one of the four top-flight clubs to suffer stadium damage that has been forced to move. After all that has happened, playing an hour away in Tokyo for a few weeks is not a great hardship. The star Kashima midfielder, Mitsuo Ogasawara, hails from the devastated Tohoku region, as does his wife. Unable to get in touch by phone and unsure if his in-laws were still alive, he drove north to see for himself. \"For those few days I felt they hadn't made it,\" Ogasawara says. \"There was nothing left of what I remembered in the area. We had no information and I thought my wife's parents had been lost.\" They were safe but the same couldn't be said of many in the surrounding area. \"I went to high school in a nearby town to Rikuzentakata. There are people with no water, food, clothes or homes. There were rations coming through but the distribution wasn't quick enough. I decided to set up my own network to help with the distribution to those who most needed it,\" he said. The football community has pulled together and shown the way in contrast to baseball's popular Central League which argued for days about whether to start their season as scheduled on 25 March – mounting pressure from inside the game and out saw the first pitch thrown on 12 April – while the sport of sumo is wrestling with its own match-fixing mess. Even the national football team manager Alberto Zaccheroni has been rattling collection boxes in Tokyo. Seeing footballers on the street has been a common sight of late. \"All the players have been to stand in front of the train station holding big wooden boxes,\" Bosnar says. \"People have been happy to see us and everyone has been very generous. The boxes are soon full, not with coins but with notes.\" The 29 March match between Japan and a J-League All Star team, hastily arranged after the cancellation of international friendlies, also raised morale as fans sung Vegalta Sendai songs. Yasuhito Endo curled home a trademark free-kick in the first half and if the sight of the national team players – all the top players came home from Europe – raising their black armbands to the sky didn't bring a lump to 41,000 throats, then a second-half goal and celebration dance from the 44-year-old Japanese legend Kazuyoshi \"Kazu\" Miura surely did. A spate of charity matches has done something to improve the lot of those affected by the disaster. These ranged from the regional derby between Cerezo Osaka and Kyoto Sanga that fans agreed to watch in silence to a glamour fixture between Shimizu and Ajax. The games have also given match practice to players who have just 90 minutes of competitive action under their belt since the 2010 season ended in early December. It is a situation that has been challenging for head coaches. \"It has been a tragic time but our continual training has been a source of comfort for the people here,\" the Shimizu head coach, Afshin Ghotbi, says. \"We have had training blocks with a friendly at the end of each block followed by a day or two off. We set up short-term goals for players in that block and created competition among the players with a daily points system, and at the end prizes are given out.\" An absence of competitive action will not be a problem for long because the J-League has to squeeze six weeks of missed matches into the rest of the season. The threat of congestion led the Japan FA to announce it would withdraw the national team from the Copa América in July, a decision that has since been reversed. The initial plan was to send a team to Argentina largely made up of the growing Japanese legion in Europe (the lack of domestic action has had fans focusing on the Uefa Champions League exploits of Atsuto Uchida's Schalke, who triumphed over Yuto Nagatomo's Internazionale in the quarter-final) but this week Stuttgart said their striker Shinji Okazaki will not play in the tournament. A reluctance to release players is understandable. The Copa América will be the third major tournament for Japan in the space of 12 months after the World Cup and January's Asian Cup. J-League clubs are unlikely to be much more open to the idea. Dragan Stojkovic led Nagoya Grampus to the title in December and likes the idea of the tournament \"but it's very important that they don't touch the players from the J-League,\" the Serbian says. \"Players who play abroad? OK, no problem. But for the J-League, each team needs their players.\" A brewing club versus country row, albeit one that is likely to be polite given the circumstances, suggests that football and life in most parts of Japan are returning to something approaching normality. Competitive football has already returned and Kashima drew 1-1 with Suwon Bluewings of South Korea on Tuesday in the Asian Champions League. It was a fairly unremarkable game except that it kicked off just after lunchtime at the Antlers' temporary Tokyo \"home\". Afternoon games will become the norm for a while. With the damage to the Fukushima nuclear power plant, football is doing its bit to save energy. A banner at the March match in Osaka said football had saved Japan. That may be an exaggeration but the beautiful game has certainly helped. And this weekend, it will be helping again as it goes back to doing what it does best."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/17/japanese-earthquake-toll-ageing-population-deaths","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-17T20:56:44Z","webTitle":"Japanese earthquake takes heavy toll on ageing population","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/17/japanese-earthquake-toll-ageing-population-deaths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/17/japanese-earthquake-toll-ageing-population-deaths","fields":{"headline":"Japanese earthquake takes heavy toll on ageing population","bodyText":"The devastating impact of the Japanese earthquake on the country's ageing population was exposed on Thursday as dozens of elderly people were confirmed dead in hospitals and residential homes as heating fuel and medicine ran out. In one particularly shocking incident, Japan's self-defence force discovered 128 elderly people abandoned by medical staff at a hospital six miles from the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant. Most of them were comatose and 14 died shortly afterwards. Eleven others were reported dead at a retirement home in Kesennuma because of freezing temperatures, six days after 47 of their fellow residents were killed in the tsunami. The surviving residents of the retirement home in Kesennuma were described by its owner, Morimitsu Inawashida, as \"alone and under high stress\". He said fuel for their kerosene heaters was running out. Almost a quarter of Japan's population are 65 or over, and hypothermia, dehydration and respiratory diseases are taking hold among the elderly in shelters, many of whom lost their medication when the wave struck, according to Eric Ouannes, general director of Doctors Without Borders' Japan affiliate. This comes after Japan's elderly people bore the brunt of the initial impact of the quake and tsunami, with many of them unable to flee to higher ground. Although the people from the hospital near Fukushima were moved by the self-defence forces to a gymnasium in Iwaki, there were reports that conditions were not much better there. An official for the government said it felt \"helpless and very sorry for them\". \"The condition at the gymnasium was horrible,\" said Cheui Inamura. \"No running water, no medicine and very, very little food. We simply did not have means to provide good care.\" Japan's deepening humanitarian crisis came as the military was enlisted to try to douse the damaged nuclear reactors and spent fuel pools at the Fukushima plant using helicopters and high-powered hoses. Chinook helicopters dropped several tonnes of water, much of which seemed to miss its target. More workers were drafted into the danger zone to prevent the spread of radiation and the plant's operator said it had managed to connect an electric cable to allow it to restart critical water pumps in one of the six units. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman, Gregory Jaczko, said the commission believed \"radiation levels are extremely high\" at the plant, while Britain said citizens should not go any closer than 50 miles from the plant, much further than Japan's recommendation to stay 12 miles away or take shelter indoors if evacuation was not possible within an 18-mile radius. Sir John Beddington, Britain's chief scientific adviser, also said he believed cooling water essential to preventing radioactive emissions from the spent fuel pools alongside reactor 4 had almost totally evaporated and he was \"extremely worried\" the storage pools at reactors 5 and 6 were also leaking. The Japanese government revised the estimated disaster death toll up from 10,000 to 15,000. It confirmed that 5,178 people had died and 2,285 were injured. The number of missing was increased to 8,913 from 7,844. Almost 200,000 households regained electricity, but this left more than 450,000 without power. Approximately 2.5m households still do not have access to water. Pat Fuller, of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which met on Thursday in the earthquake zone to plan longer term relief with the Red Cross of Japan, said the lack of heating oil was critical. \"They don't have enough kerosene to run heaters for all the evacuation centres,\" he said. \"Only a small percentage of the petrol stations are functioning which affects efforts to get food back into the shops. There had been an outbreak of gastric flu at one health centre we visited and if that hits old people there could be serious complications.\" Search and rescue teams began scaling back their operations as relatives began to lose hope of finding missing loved ones alive. In the town of Kamaishi, American and British teams completed their final sweeps, and Japanese mechanical diggers began the task of clearing collapsed homes, offices and stores. Crews found more than a dozen bodies, some trapped beneath homes flipped on their roofs, another at the wheel of his overturned car. In three days of searching the battered coast, they found no survivors. \"We have no more tasks,\" said Pete Stevenson, a firefighter heading Britain's 70-strong team. \"The Japanese government have told us they are now moving from search and rescue to the recovery phase.\" Heather Heath, a British firefighter, said: \"There are probably dozens of bodies we just can't reach. The water can force people under floorboards and into gaps we can't search. It's such a powerful force.\" In Rikuzentakata Katsuya Maiya, whose home was hit by the tsunami, said he had accepted he would not find his 71-year old sister-in-law and her husband. The elderly couple fled their home on foot, but they could not keep up with their neighbours and fell behind as the tsunami rushed in. \"I think there is no hope,\" he said. \"The only thing that I can do is wait until members of the Japanese self-defence force collect their bodies.\" The very young too were suffering. Save the Children on Thursday reached Ishinomaki, Nobiru and Onagawa, north of Sendai, and reported children living in miserable conditions. \"There were some terrible scenes, in some places like Onagawa there was nothing left,\" said Ian Woolverton, who led the mission. \"In other places like Ishinomaki we found children in evacuation centres huddled around kerosene lamps.\" The charity said they met Kazuki Seto, eight, at an evacuation centre not far from Sendai. He told them: \"We are really worried about the nuclear power plants. We are very afraid of nuclear radiation. That's why we don't play outside.\" Another, Yasu Hiro, 10, added: \"We know about the bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and we are very scared. It makes us really worry. If it explodes it is going to be terrible.\" New footage also emerged of the tsunami striking last Friday, filmed by a local reporter who fled to safety as the wave swept in. The footage showed a wave crashing down a street moments after he found safety on a staircase. Buildings and cars were swept away, while a father and two children were stranded on the side of an upturned car. A woman clung to a tree. She was rescued using a fire hose. \"Thank you. Thank you. I thought I was going to die,\" she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-16T18:20:00Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama gives green light to new wave of nuclear reactors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama gives green light to new wave of nuclear reactors","bodyText":"Barack Obama pressed the start button on the first new construction of nuclear reactors in a generation today, announcing $8.3bn in loan guarantees for the company building two. Obama, in a visit to a job training centre in Maryland, said the loan guarantees to the energy giant, Southern Company, would help launch the first wave of construction of new reactors in nearly 30 years as well as advance his energy and climate agenda. \"Even though we have not broken ground on a new nuclear plant in nearly 30 years, nuclear energy remains our largest source of fuel that produces no carbon emissions,\" he said. \"To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we'll need to increase our supply of nuclear power. It's that simple.\" The loans would commit the US government to repaying Southern's loans if the company defaults. The guarantees cover some 70% of the estimated $8.8bn cost of building the two new reactors at the company's Vogtle plant, which is east of Atlanta. White House officials said today's announcement reinforced Obama's pledge in his state of the union address last month to expand America's use of nuclear energy and to open up offshore drilling. Obama has also asked Congress in his budget request to triple loan guarantees for the nuclear industry to $54bn from the current $18.5bn. Obama's pledge to the nuclear industry was seen as part of a strategy to win Republican support for a climate and energy bill that has stalled in the Senate. Expanding America's reliance on nuclear power – which currently supplies about 20% of electricity – is one of the few elements of Obama's energy and climate agenda to win broad-based support. A number of Republican senators have demanded Obama help fund the construction of 100 new nuclear plants over the next decade. Lindsey Graham, the Republican who is working closely with Democrats to draft a compromise cap and trade bill, is also on board with a greater role for nuclear power. His state, South Carolina, gets nearly half of its electricity from nuclear power. But the subsidies for the nuclear industry have made some senators as well as environmental organisations uneasy. \"It's a heck of a lot of money,\" said the Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders, who is an independent. \"The construction of new nuclear plants may well be the most expensive way to go.\" The administration is also stuck on a solution for nuclear waste, after shutting down plans to bury the waste in the Yucca Mountain range in Nevada. The administration last month set up a panel to recommend new waste disposal solution. Obama acknowledged those controversies today, saying: \"There will be those who welcome this announcement, and those who strongly disagree with it. The same has been true in other areas of our energy debate, from offshore drilling to putting a price on carbon pollution. But what I want to emphasise is this: even when we have differences, we cannot allow those differences to prevent us from making progress. On an issue which affects our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, we cannot continue to be mired in the same old debates between left and right; between environmentalists and entrepreneurs.\" The Southern projects must still win licensing approval. White House officials said the new reactors could come on line by 2016 or 2017, and would generate 2.2GW. Construction alone would create 3,500 jobs, and the plant itself would create 800 operations jobs. The loan guarantees announced today are the first of some $18.5bn in funding originally approved by Congress in 2005."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/nov/07/obama-india-trip-deals-6bn","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-07T00:23:00Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama's India trip set to seal £6bn worth of deals for US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/07/obama-india-trip-deals-6bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/nov/07/obama-india-trip-deals-6bn","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama's India trip set to seal £6bn worth of deals for US","bodyText":"President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, arrived yesterday in the Indian commercial capital of Mumbai on the first leg of a 10-day four-nation tour of Asia to drum up business for American companies and to consolidate relations with key allies in the region. The couple will also hope to find some relief from the domestic political fallout of the Democratic party's resounding defeat in midterm elections last week. The president made his first statement of the trip, the longest he has taken in office, at Mumbai's Taj Mahal Hotel, one of the targets attacked by Islamic militants in the city just under two years ago. \"We will never forget,\" Obama said at a memorial to victims of the attack. The Obamas were due to stay overnight in the hotel before flying to Delhi today. An entire floor has been reserved for their use and all 570 rooms booked for their entourage and security. Around 10,000 security personnel have been deployed. The president, who is travelling with hundreds of investors and trade officials, addressed an audience of top Indian businessmen in Mumbai last night. The White House, aware of the role the fragile American economy played in last week's poor poll results, has been keen to underline the economic gains the trip is expected to bring for America. American firms are set to finalise deals worth around $10bn (£6bn) with India that will support 54,000 jobs back home, senior White House aide Michael Froman told reporters. Some 20 deals are in the pipeline, including an engine contract for General Electric and a $2.7bn commission for passenger aircraft from Boeing for one of India's fast-expanding private airlines. However, the $4.5bn sale by Boeing of C-17 military transport planes is still being negotiated. The last visit by an American premier, in 2006, saw George W Bush controversially announce America's formal blessing for India's civil nuclear power programme. Few expect the same kind of breakthrough this time. But no one predicts an upset either. \"At the end it will look good. The Indians understand they need to be seen to be helping the US with some decent economic deals. Obama understands he needs to reassure India that the momentum in relations generated by Bush is still there,\" said C Raja Mohan, an Indian academic and foreign policy analyst. The economic emphasis has disappointed some in Delhi. Indian diplomats are looking for signs of a new US strategic vision for South Asia that would give them a central role to counterbalance China. American officials have restricted themselves to noting the \"emergence\" of India and its middle class and observing that \"regional dynamics will change fast\" over coming years. US diplomats last week restated their desire to see measures ranging from reforms of ownership regulations to changes in intellectual property law, which would ease the access to Indian markets for American firms. Indian hopes for the waiving of restrictions on the transfer of American technology to government bodies working on space research or nuclear technology seem likely to be fulfilled. The White House is also set to support Indian membership of four key global nuclear nonproliferation regimes. \"We will end up treating India similar to other close allies and partners other than as a country of concern,\" Froman said. However there is unlikely to be an explicit statement backing India's bid for permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council. In Delhi, in addition to a visit to a Mughal-era Islamic tomb, an address to parliament and a state dinner, Obama will meet Manmohan Singh, the 78-year- old Indian prime minister, and Sonia Gandhi, the head of the Congress Party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-rescue-tsunami-kesennuma","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-14T15:55:21Z","webTitle":"Japan earthquake: Rescue provides rare light amid deepening darkness","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-rescue-tsunami-kesennuma","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/14/japan-earthquake-rescue-tsunami-kesennuma","fields":{"headline":"Japan earthquake: Rescue provides rare light amid deepening darkness","bodyText":"The power of the tsunami is horrifyingly apparent at Kesennuma harbour, in Miyage prefecture, where ships have washed up on car parks, rammed into office blocks and crashed into one another. Nothing is where it should be. The giant pink-and-white hull of a tuna fishing ship is berthed on the tarmac, a three-storey office building has floated into the middle of the road, and cars are rammed into the sides of buildings. The corridor of the city hall has become a lost-and-found centre for human beings. On one side is the \"seeking\" wall, which is home to hundreds of neatly written requests for information on missing persons; opposite is the \"refugee\" wall, which lists the names of those staying at the dozen or so evacuation centres around Kesennuma. Among those looking anxiously through the inventory is 16-year-old Yuta Saito, who has not heard from his parents, brother or sister since the disaster struck. Still wearing the school uniform he left home in last Friday, he tries hard to retain his composure, but worry is written all over his face. \"It's pitiful,\" said Yuta's guardian, Naomi Ogata. \"The chances of survival are slim because they lived in one of the worst-hit areas.\" She has driven to the information centre with requests from 10 people who have taken temporary refuge in her neighbourhood. \"I'd like to come and search more often but I don't want to use up all the petrol,\" she said. \"I'm running out and must leave enough in the tank in case we need to make another emergency evacuation.\" The refugee mentality is new to this area, but understandable. Disaster has come in many forms during the past few days and constantly threatens to return. Aftershocks continue to rattle the windows, smoke billows from half a dozen fires. A morning tsunami alert prompted a rush to high ground, then came word of a new explosion at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, further south along the coast. The explosion is more than 60 miles away from Kesennuma, but the wind was blowing from the direction of the nuclear plant and radiation levels were reportedly rising at a nearby monitoring station. The state broadcaster advised people to stay indoors and close the windows. One refugee said it was like an endless nightmare. \"It's terrifying,\" said Masaki Ohata, who sleeps without blankets on the cold floor of the city hall with a collie named Shell, which trembles nervously in his arms. \"We have been hit by disasters and now we are threatened by something that we can't even seen. Any one of these dangers would be bad, but to be hit by three in a row is beyond imagination.\" Ohata risked his life for the dog. \"When the tsunami hit, I was in a car trying to evacuate with my mother and my dog,\" he said. \"The waters came so quickly that I could feel the car start to float. I couldn't open the door so I climbed through the window, pulled my mother out and tried to get Shell to leave. But he was too scared. The car started to sink so I lunged in and heaved the dog into the water. We all swam together until the water subsided.\" Many others were less fortunate. In the Saiwai district of Kesennuma, large numbers of the dead drowned in their cars as the waters closed in on a deadly traffic jam of people trying to flee. The Saiwai (Happy) District resembles a war zone. From the top of a nearby hill, the carnage stretches as far as the eye can see. Shops, office blocks, roads and homes have been catastrophically rearranged as broken beams, piles of rubble and mountains of rubbish. Cars, motorbikes and fire engines lie broken and upside down like the discarded toys of an angry child. Blazes rage uncontrolled on distant hills and in nearby malls. The emergency services say there is a limit to what they can do because the roads are only partially passable for 300 metres – and even then by climbing on foot through the rubble. Teams frequently have to evacuate when the fire spreads, and the air is punctuated with the pops of exploding gas canisters. It is the same story on the island of Oshima, further out in the bay, from where rescuers are ferrying people to safety. \"My home is burning. I can't go back there. It is too dangerous,\" said one evacuee, Emiko Mimura. \"I'm staying with a friend, but it is tough. We have no electricity, gas or water. We can't bathe. There are huge queues outside the shops and nothing to buy inside. We have no idea when our lifelines will return. It's terrible, terrible.\" In Kesennuma port, Fumiko Saito and her sick husband had been trapped at home since Friday. Teams of search dogs and rescuers had been unable to reach the area because the debris is piled so high in the streets. But rescue workers finally worked their way near enough to hear Saito's cries for help, and then spent hours trying to arrange a helicopter rescue for the couple, who are both in their eighties. It was slow going: Mr Saito was unable to move, and at one point a fresh tsunami warning forced rescuers to delay their mission. When the Saitos were finally winched to safety, Japanese camera crews ran live reports from a nearby hillside. First Lieutenant Kaneyama Hiroyasu, of the Yamagata 6th Division of the Self Defence Forces, told the Guardian: \"It's great that we got them out. It was tough. The husband had a bad heart so we could not move him easily. It took a long time.\" More survivors could yet be found, but thechances are diminishing with time. Apart from interruptions from aftershooks and tsunami warnings, the biggest problem for rescuers at the moment is the debris, which has piled up to more than head hight on some streets. One rescue worker said it was impossible to move more than 300 metres into Saiwai district. Hiroyasu said: \"We've got to move quickly to help those who might still be alive. We will give it our utmost.\" The official death toll reached 1,833, with at least 2,369 people missing, the National Police Agency said on Monday. These figures are almost certain to rise further as more bodies are found in the hardest hit prefecture of Miyagi. The discovery of the Saitos was a moment of rare upbeat news, but much more will be needed to lift the gloom. \"We don't have electricity [or] gas, and only one onigiri sushi or piece of bread for breakfast, lunch and dinner,\" said Mekaru Takashi, a professional bowler who was queuing outside the community hall for water. \"The rescue is good news. We need that. But it doesn't change how terrible things are.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/14/rescind-barack-obama-obama-transparency-award","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-14T17:00:01Z","webTitle":"Rescind President Obama's 'Transparency Award' now | Open letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/14/rescind-barack-obama-obama-transparency-award","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/jun/14/rescind-barack-obama-obama-transparency-award","fields":{"headline":"Rescind President Obama's 'Transparency Award' now","bodyText":"On 28 March 2011, President Obama was given a \"transparency award\" from five \"open government\" organisations: OMB Watch, the National Security Archive, the Project on Government Oversight, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and OpenTheGovernment.org. Ironically – and quite likely in response to growing public criticism regarding the Obama administration's lack of transparency – heads of the five organisations gave their award to Obama in a closed, undisclosed meeting at the White House. If the ceremony had been open to the press, it is likely that reporters would have questioned the organisations' proffered justification for the award, in contrast to the current reality: • President Obama has not decreased, but has dramatically increased governmental secrecy. According to a new report to the president by the Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) – the federal agency that provides oversight of the government's security classification system – the cost of classification for 2010 has reached over $10.17bn. That's a 15% jump from the previous year, and the first time ever that secrecy costs have surpassed $10bn. Last month, ISOO reported that the number of original classification decisions generated by the Obama administration in 2010 was 224,734 – a 22.6% jump from the previous year (see The Price of Secrecy, Obama Edition). • There were 544,360 requests for information last year under the Freedom of Information Act to the 35 biggest federal agencies – 41,000 requests more than the year before. Yet the bureaucracy responded to 12,400 fewer requests than the prior year, according to an analysis by the Associated Press. • Obama has invoked baseless and unconstitutional executive secrecy to quash legal inquiries into secret illegalities more often than any predecessor. The list of this president's invocations of the \"state secrets privilege\" has already resulted in shutting down lawsuits involving the National Security Agency's illegal wiretapping – Jewel v NSA and Shubert v Obama; extraordinary rendition and assassination – Anwar al-Awlaki; and illegal torture – Binyam Mohamed. • Ignoring his campaign promise to protect government whistleblowers, Obama's presidency has amassed the worst record in US history for persecuting, prosecuting and jailing government whistleblowers and truth-tellers. President Obama's behaviour has been in stark contrast to his campaign promises, which included live-streaming meetings online and rewarding whistleblowers. Obama's department of justice is twisting the 1917 Espionage Act to press criminal charges in five alleged instances of national security leaks – more such prosecutions than have occurred in all previous administrations combined. • The Obama justice department's prosecution of former NSA official Thomas Drake, who, up till 9 June, faced 35 years in prison for having blown the whistle on the NSA's costly and unlawful warrantless monitoring of American citizens, typifies the abusive practices made possible through expansive secrecy agreements and threats of prosecution. • President Obama has set a powerful and chilling example for potential whistleblowers through the abuse and torture of Bradley Manning, whose guilt he has also publicly stated prior to any trial by his, Obama's, military subordinates. • Obama is the only president who has reenacted Fahrenheit 451 by actually having his agency collect and burn a book due to a never-justified classification excuse: Lt Col Tony Shaffer's Operation Dark Heart. • Under President Obama, the FBI has launched a series of raids and issued grand jury subpoenas targeting nearly two dozen antiwar activists. Over 2,600 arrests of protesters in the US have been made while Obama has been president, further encroaching on the exercise of first amendment rights. • President Obama has initiated a secret assassination programme, has publicly announced that he has given himself the power to include Americans on the list of people to be assassinated, and has attempted to assassinate at least one, Anwar al-Awlaki. • President Obama has maintained the power to secretly kidnap, imprison, rendition, or torture, and he has formalised the power to lawlessly imprison in an executive order. This also means the power to secretly imprison. There are some 1,700 prisoners outside the rule of law in Bagram alone. • The Obama administration is also busy going after reporters to discover their sources and convening grand juries in order to target journalists and news publishers. • President Obama promised to reveal White House visitors' logs. He didn't. In response to outrage over his refusal to reveal the names of health insurance CEOs he had met with and cut deals with on the health insurance reform bill, he announced that he would release the names going forward, but not those in the past. And going forward, he would withhold names he chose to withhold. White House staff then began regularly meeting lobbyists just off White House grounds in order to avoid the visitors' logs. • President Obama has sent representatives to aggressively pressure Spain, England and Germany to shut down investigations that could have exposed the crimes of the Bush era, just as he has instructed the US justice department to avoid such matters. This includes his refusal to allow prosecutions of the CIA for torture, following a public letter from eight previous heads of the CIA informing him that he had better not enforce those laws. The \"transparency award\" in question was described as \"aspirational\", similar to the rationale for awarding Obama the Nobel Peace Prize early in his presidency when he had done nothing yet to further the cause of peace. Participants admitted they used the private meeting in March to try and lobby Obama to do more to earn their award. If the president doesn't change course as a result of the lobbying and \"award\", there are some who would shrug and say, \"no harm, no foul\". The giving of an unmerited award, however, whether for transparency or peace, is not entirely benign. No one knows better how destructive secrecy is for maintaining systems of justice, ethics and democracy than these self-proclaimed \"open government\" watchdogs. Especially when such a false accolade emanates, as in this case, from those who are supposed to serve as counters to secrecy and to retaliation against government whistleblowers, such appearance of approval will tend to cover up and mask the reality of the executive's increasingly undemocratic and illegal use of secrecy. Therefore, the undersigned call on these organisations: OMB Watch, the National Security Archive, the Project on Government Oversight, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and OpenTheGovernment.org, to publicly take back their \"transparency award\", as difficult as that may be, from Barack Obama. The watchdog organisations should, of course, continue to promote aspirations for open, democratic government, reduced secrecy and adherence to the rule of law, in more genuine, legitimate ways than giving unmerited awards to the executive. Such false awards only stand to backfire and hurt the cause of open government.

The intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, said western \"spy services\" were behind the complex computer virus that recently infected more than 30,000 computers in industrial sites, including those in the Bushehr nuclear power plant, appearing to confirm the suspicion of computer security experts that a foreign state was responsible. The announcement also suggests that the attack involving the Stuxnet worm virus, which computer experts believe may have been designed to spy on Iran's nuclear facilities rather than destroy them, has caused more alarm in the regime than has so far been acknowledged. In remarks carried on Iranian state television and the Mehr news service, Moslehi said Iran had discovered the \"destructive activities of the arrogance [of the west] in cyberspace\", adding that \"different ways to confront them have been designed and implemented\". \"I assure all citizens that the intelligence apparatus currently has complete supervision on cyberspace and will not allow any leak or destruction of our country's nuclear activities. \"Iran's intelligence department has found a solution for confronting [the worm] and it will be applied. Our domination of virtual networks has thwarted the activities of enemies in this regard.\" Moslehi gave no details of when the arrests had taken place or whether those detained were Iranians or foreign citizens. According to experts the Stuxnet worm, designed to be delivered through a removable drive like a USB stick, is one of the most complex pieces of malicious code ever deployed. It was written specifically to attack Siemens industrial control units of the kind used in the Iranian nuclear programme. Suspicion for responsibilty for the attack has inevitably focused on Israel and the US, although there is little evidence to support this. The announcement of the arrests, intended to reassure Iranians, follows comments last week by another senior Iranian official, Mahmoud Liaii, who said: \"An electronic war has been launched against Iran.\" Iran has denied that the worm damaged the main control systems at Bushehr, rather infecting the laptops of some workers at the plant. However, the disclosure of the attack coincided with an announcement that the plant's inauguration has been delayed until at least next year because of continuing technical problems. It was confirmed earlier this week that Iran will start fuelling the Bushehr nuclear reactor with enriched uranium fuel over the next few days, months later than had been originally announced. The vice-president, Ali Akbar Salehi, maintained the delay had nothing to do with the computer worm and said the plant had not been affected in any way. \"We hope to load the fuel into the Bushehr reactor by early October and the necessary groundwork for this is coming together, God willing, so it [the fuel] will be completely put in place in the heart [of the reactor] by November,\" he told the semi-official ISNA news agency. In recent years Iran has announced the arrest of nuclear spies on a periodic basis. Three years ago it announced it had broken up a spy ring that had handed nuclear intelligence to the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/apr/06/iran-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-04-07T19:00:00Z","webTitle":"Meir Javedanfar: Thursday's celebrations of Iran's nuclear power could be Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's swansong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/06/iran-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/06/iran-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Obama factor reaches Iran","bodyText":"A year after becoming president in 2005, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared that the 20th day in the Persian month of Farvardin would officially be known as National Nuclear Technology day. On this day, which falls on Thursday 9 April this year, the government and people of Iran are to celebrate their country's nuclear achievements. Ahmadinejad is not in charge of Iran's nuclear programme. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is. Nevertheless, he allows Ahmadinejad to use the occasion to inform the people of Iran about the technical progress made by Iran's nuclear programme during the past year. Last year, Ahmadinejad declared that \"Iran was ready to install some 6,000 new centrifuges at the nuclear facility in the central province of Natanz\". This year, National Nuclear Technology day will have added importance for the president. While Ahmadinejad will be making his yearly speech about Iran's nuclear accomplishments, he will be well aware that from that day, only 64 days remain until the presidential elections, scheduled for 12 June. The past year has been one of the worst for Ahmadinejad since he took office. He has suffered a number of embarrassing domestic defeats. One of them was parliament's unwillingness to pass the subsidies reduction clause in this year's budget, which called for the reduction of energy subsidies and to distribute the money instead to Iran's poor as cash handouts. Parliamentarians are worried this may further increase the level of inflation. Ahmadinejad has invested heavily in this clause. He has been promoting it since last year and parliament's resistance has damaged his credibility. The other setback was the embarrassing dismissal of Ali Kordan, his interior minister, by parliament. Kordan was found to have had a forged doctorate degree from Oxford university. This created a large number of email and text message jokes about the former minister's credentials by offering degrees from \"Aksford\" and \"Oxphord\" university. The fact that Ahmadinejad backed Kordan until the last moment caused further blows to his standing. Even football and its extraordinary popularity in Iran do not seem to have helped the president. During the last world cup qualifying match between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Tehran, Ahmadinejad made a surprise appearance in the stadium, 30 minutes after the start of the game. However, the fact that Iran lost 2-1 on home soil after initially leading their Saudi rivals 1-0 led to the popular belief that Ahmadinejad had 'ghadame shoor', a Persian expression that describes someone who brings bad luck. This wasn't the first time Ahmadinejad made a surprise appearance at a major sporting event. The previous occasion was in early March when Iran made it to the finals of the World Wrestling Championship against Azerbaijan. Iran lost that match too. In all likelihood, Ahmadinejad is going to make the most of this year's nuclear technology day ceremony to boost his falling popularity at home. Unlike the economy, the nuclear programme is one area which Ahmadinejad has not ruined. Many people believe that the only reason is because he is not in charge of it. Nevertheless, thanks to Ayatollah Khamenei, Ahmadinejad will gladly use the opportunity as a means to boost his position. This will be the case even if Iran's nuclear programme has not made any spectacular gains in the past year. Ahmadinejad could quite possibly paint a picture that is rosier than the reality. He will have no other choice — this is his last chance before the elections. The Iranian electorate is unforgiving and he has to take every opportunity to reach out to them. The international community, especially Israel and the US, may have a different perception on Ahmadinejad's nuclear technology day declarations. Any major announcement could be taken as a sign of antagonism, or threat. This would be logical. However, the international community should understand that promoting one's capability and leveraging power is a tried and tested negotiation method. In other words, there is also the possibility that forthcoming statements could be mere bolstering to improve Iran's position before the start of negotiations with the US. This is one area which Ahmadinejad has no control over. In fact, negotiations with the US may make or break his presidency. Until now, the supreme leader has offered unprecedented support to Ahmadinejad. However, new events on the ground may mean that for the next elections, matters may not be entirely in Khamenei's hands. The election of Barack Obama and his offer of unconditional talks with Iran have created new challenges for the supreme leader. With such a popular president at the helm in Washington, shunning America could be a costly mistake. Khamenei realises that during the expected negotiations, Obama would prefer a reformist resident of the presidential office in Louis Pasteur Street in Tehran. This is why he is waiting to negotiate with Iran after the Iranian presidential elections. He does not want to improve Ahmadinejad's chances. Although the supreme leader is under no obligation to compromise with Obama, shunning the US president would be damaging, both diplomatically and economically. Realising that the re-election of Ahmadinejad may be interpreted as a rebuff in Washington, it is very possible that Khamenei may decide that Ahmadinejad's removal may serve his interests far more than keeping him as president. On nuclear technology day, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad could try to take all the glory for Iran's nuclear programme. Despite that, the day after Iran's presidential elections, he may find himself the most prominent victim of the \"Obama factor\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/15/fukushima-50-workers-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-15T18:39:15Z","webTitle":"Fukushima 50 battle radiation risks as Japan nuclear crisis deepens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/15/fukushima-50-workers-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/15/fukushima-50-workers-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima 50 battle radiation risks as Japan nuclear crisis deepens","bodyText":"Battered by a terrifying earthquake, exhausted from days of battling a spiralling nuclear crisis, and aware that their loved ones were only miles from the crippled facility, the exhausted workers at the Fukushima No 1 plant must have hoped a new day would finally bring respite. Instead, Tuesday dawned with the outbreak of fire at a fourth unit – the start of a chain of events in which their worst fears appeared to be coming true. More than 90 hours after the earthquake and tsunami battered Japan's north-east, shutting off the Fukushima plant and halting its cooling systems, workers learned that radiation at the facility had hit a level harmful to human health. Hundreds of non-essential personnel were shipped off-site after the blaze, knowing that they were leaving behind dozens of colleagues risking permanent damage to their health. The gravity of the situation emerged a few hours later when Naoto Kan, the Japanese prime minister, addressed the nation. Clad in blue overalls, Kan began by urging people to remain calm. Fire had broken out in unit No 4, radiation had spread, the level was high, and there was a very high risk of further radioactive material emerging. He asked anyone remaining in the 20km (12-mile) evacuation zone around the plant to leave immediately, and those within 30km to stay indoors. But it was the workers who were \"putting themselves in a very dangerous situation\" to try to contain the problems, he acknowledged. Chief cabinet secretary Yukio Edano revealed that a containment vessel might also have been damaged at reactor No 2, increasing the risk of a radioactive leak. While both men called for calm, behind the scenes there were signs of the government's plummeting faith in the plant's operators, the Tokyo Electric Power Company. Kan was overheard reading the riot act to executives for failing to inform him of the blast, Japanese media said. \"The TV reported an explosion, but nothing was said to the prime minister's office for more than an hour,\" the Kyodo agency quoted Kan as saying. \"What the hell is going on?\" Kan, who had already announced he would take personal control of a new joint-response headquarters involving the power company and the government, reportedly warned Tepco of serious consequences should it decide to pull its workers out before the plant has been made safe. \"In the event of a withdrawal, I'm 100% certain that the company will collapse,\" he said. \"You must be determined to solve this.\" Between 50 and 70 employees – now known in English as the Fukushima 50 – all in protective gear, were left at the plant to battle myriad problems. Some are assessing the damage and radiation levels caused by the explosions, while others cool stricken reactors with seawater to try to avert a potentially catastrophic release of radiation. The workers are the nuclear power industry's equivalent of frontline soldiers, exposing themselves to considerable risks while about 800 of their evacuated colleagues watch from a safe distance. Fifteen people on the site, including members of the self-defence force, have been injured in the blasts. The fire appears to have been the biggest culprit in the release of radioactive materials. By 10.20am, readings at the plant had reached 400 millisieverts per hour in one spot and 100 millisieverts in another, although they were much lower in other areas of the facility. An NHK expert spelled out what that \"very grave situation\" meant for the workers. A level of 100mSv per hour could cause infertility in men without protective gear within a short time, for example – though other experts suggested any affected technicians should recover from ill-effects because they would be withdrawn if they had been exposed to high levels. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said later that 150 workers had been monitored for radiation levels, and 23 had undergone decontamination. At midday, there was one welcome victory as workers extinguished the fire at unit No 4. The priority switched back to cooling operations at reactors 1 to 3. But by late afternoon, there was a fresh blow. Kyodo reported that the spent nuclear fuel pool at Unit 4 might be boiling, with the water level falling sharply. Experts had already warned such a problem could be far more serious than a meltdown in the reactor cores, because they are not shielded by containment units. By 7pm, Japan's nuclear agency was warning there were two eight-metre holes in the outer building of the unit. The UN's nuclear watchdog reported that radiation levels appeared to be dropping, with readings at the main gate falling from 11.9mSv per hour at 9am to 0.6mSv per hour by 3pm. But six hours later, Kyodo reported that radiation levels inside the control room for the No 2 reactor were too high for the engineers to stay there for long periods. Instead they were working in rotations to avoid contamination, and monitoring the cooling efforts from less hazardous locations inside the plant. As the day wore on, the Japanese public's admiration for the anonymous workers contrasted with mounting criticism of their employer. The governor of Fukushima, Yuhei Sato, reportedly told Kan that residents are angry and about to reach breaking point. Tepco officials' vague answers at a morning press conference hit whatever confidence in the company remained. Tepco has a history of covering up safety issues. In 2002, seventeen of its reactors were shut down and the firm's senior management resigned after it admitted hiding problems and obstructing inspections. The Japanese nuclear industry says it has cleaned up its act in the wake of that and other scandals. The government at least appears to have learned some lessons. After the Tokaimura disaster of 1999, in which two people died and several hundred people were exposed to radiation, officials initially rejected offers of help from the IAEA. This time they have sought help from the UN's nuclear watchdog and the US. Yet the IAEA seemed short of information more than 18 hours after the blaze broke out in unit No 4. \"The IAEA is seeking clarification on the nature and consequences of the fire. The IAEA continues to seek details about the status of all workers, reactors and spent fuel at the Fukushima Daiichi plant,\" it noted in a statement. With midnight approaching, the agency said it remained concerned about the plant. Workers continue to battle through the night, injecting seawater to cool the reactors in units 1, 2 and 3. Few can be feeling optimistic about what the new day will bring."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/oct/15/niger-mining1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-15T17:16:49Z","webTitle":"Niger's uranium mining carries on despite al-Qaida kidnappings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/15/niger-mining1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/15/niger-mining1","fields":{"headline":"Niger's uranium mining carries on despite al-Qaida kidnappings","bodyText":"There is no question of stopping uranium production: that is the message the Niger authorities have been repeating since the Arlit kidnapping in the middle of September. \"The challenge for us is to maintain output and not be discouraged by these dramatic events,\" the military junta's minister of mines and energy, Souleymane Abba, said. The kidnap of seven hostages by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb has not affected uranium production at the two mines in Niger in which Areva, France's nuclear conglomerate, is the main shareholder. Only construction work at the future mega-mine at Imouraren has stopped. Uranium is Niger's top export and vital to the economy of one of the world's poorest countries. \"The only thing that works here is the mines,\" says a French expatriate who knows the country well. But its mineral riches, of little benefit to the population, are the main source of corruption and a symbol of Niger's dependence on foreign buyers, starting with France, the former colonial power. Recent upheavals - the Tuareg rebellion in 2007-09 and the military takeover that ousted former president Mamadou Tandja - all fit into this larger picture. After 1971 uranium exports to France qualified as a \"privileged outlet\", decided by the two states as part of an agreement on economic co-operation signed in 1961 when Niger gained its independence. When President Nicolas Sarkozy, accompanied by Areva CEO Anne Lauvergeon, visited Niamey in March last year there was no longer any talk of privilege but rather a \"win-win partnership\". Tandja and his guests celebrated the decision to allow Areva to operate the Imouraren mine, ending a two-year dispute. In 2007, wishing to take advantage of the high price of uranium, Niger scrapped France's monopoly and started granting prospecting rights - 158 so far - to companies from all over the world. The president's inner circle, the main beneficiary of this move, was nevertheless divided. Due to pressure from one of Tandja's sons, under Chinese influence, Areva almost lost Imouraren. Tandja demanded that Paris adopt a firm line on the Tuareg rebels, who wanted a fair share of mining revenue. He also obtained a 50% increase in Areva's payments to Niger. In March 2009, when Tandja was accused by the opposition of wanting to change the constitution so he could stay in power, Sarkozy hailed the regime's \"democracy and stability\". Reassured by this support, the ageing president dissolved parliament and awarded himself an unlimited term of office, abruptly cut short in February by Lieutenant-General Salou Djibo. The new regime added rules on transparency in the management of mineral resources to the draft constitution up for approval by referendum on 31 October. But some fear that the insecurity caused by al-Qaida and its threat to Areva may compromise the election set for January and the subsequent return to civilian rule. The authorities are keen to reassure foreign mining interests, but are wary of legal provisions they deem contrary to the interests of Niger. \"The Niger people wishes to maintain its relations with Areva, providing that resources are exploited in its best interests and that the environmental costs are covered,\" says Marou Amadou, a former anti-corruption campaigner and now speaker of the transition parliament. He also desires construction of \"a civil nuclear power station\". \"The country is full of uranium,\" he points out, yet less than one in 10 inhabitants are connected to the power grid.

The prime minister, Naoto Kan, called the disaster \"Japan's most severe crisis since the war ended 65 years ago\". He called on the country to unite and said its future would be decided by the response to this crisis. The threat of further seismic shifts and tsunami is far from over. As rescue teams from more than 70 countries and tens of thousands of Japanese troops descended on the disaster zone, meteorological agency officials warned there was a 70% chance of a magnitude 7.0 earthquake striking the region in the next three days. \"There will be many aftershocks in multiple locations. We have to brace ourselves for aftershocks of magnitude 5 or even magnitude 6,\" an agency official said. The meteorological agency upgraded last Friday's earthquake, the fifth biggest in the world for a century, from magnitude 8.8 to 9.0. What began as a violent seismic shift lasting minutes has left a permanent geological legacy: the US geological survey said the force of the quake had shifted the island a distance of 8ft (2.5 metres). New images from Japanese TV revealed, one submerged community after the other, the full extent of the devastation, and the determination of a nation united by a natural catastrophe that almost defies comprehension. Rescue teams and survivors are in constant fear of yet more powerful quakes and tsunami. Millions of others were bracing for a potentially catastrophic nuclear accident after the government warned that a second nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi (No 1) nuclear power plant could explode. More than 300,000 people are living in emergency shelters along the coastline and millions of survivors face a third night without water, electricity and proper food. Japanese media reported that 5.5 million people were without power, while 20,800 buildings had been destroyed or damaged. Land once occupied by towns and villages now resembles paddy fields, the surface of the water breached by the roofs of wrecked homes, trees and other debris created by a wall of water so high that taking refuge on a building's third floor proved futile for some. The arrival of Japanese TV crews in the worst-affected areas has given the disaster what it lacked in the immediate aftermath: a human face. Residents broke off from searches for lost friends and relatives, and some spoke from hospital beds to recount the terror of Friday afternoon. \"Everything has turned upside down,\" an elderly man in Miyagi prefecture said. \"After the tsunami, everything had gone. But we're going to have to get on with life.\" Fighting back tears, one woman said: \"I tried to run away but I was just swallowed up by the tsunami. I kept shouting 'Save me, save me'. I can't begin to describe what I saw.\" Another evacuee from Miyagi said: \"My children are cold and complaining of headaches. We don't know how long we're going to have to stay here. It's very upsetting.\" The official death toll has reached more than 700, with more than 10,000 others still missing. Given the size of the disaster, in breadth and intensity, the eventual number of dead could be much higher. The apocalyptic images of entire neighbourhoods filled with the muddy remnants of the tsunami suggest that there is little hope that many, if any at all, will be found alive. In Rikuzentaka, a city close to the coast, some among the 1,000 people taking refuge at a school located on high ground wept as they stared at a list of the survivors. \"There have been tsunami before but they were just small. No one ever thought that it could be like this,\" said Michiko Yamada, a 75-year-old in Rikuzentakata, a near-flattened village in far-northern Iwate prefecture. Images taken from the hills overlooking Kesennuma, in Miyagi prefecture, showed a town of more than 70,000 reduced to ashes by fires that raged on Friday night. In scenes repeated along the coast, debris hangs from tree branches well inland, indicating how high the waters surged before they began to recede. One image, broadcast across the world, shows a solitary white car perched on the roof of a house. All other news has been pushed aside while the country's broadcast media feeds an insatiable public need for information about the death toll and the nuclear crisis in Fukushima. With alarming frequency, broadcasts are punctuated with a now-familiar jingle announcing more powerful aftershocks that snake their way down from the northeast to Chiba and Tokyo. While Nagatacho, Japan's political nerve centre, has united around the rescue and relief effort, criticism of the authorities' response is seeping through. A headline in the Asahi Shimbun blasted the government's \"incoherent\" crisis management strategy, accusing it of taking too long to release information about the problems at Fukushima nuclear plant and evacuate tens of thousands of people living nearby. \"Every time they urged us to 'stay calm' without providing concrete data, they simply made people more anxious,\" the paper quoted an unidentified politician as saying. The cost of the rescue, relief and recovery effort will be huge. Manufacturers have closed plants while the energy infrastructure, from closed or crippled nuclear plants to burning oil refineries, is so badly damaged that power companies have warned of sporadic electricity cuts in areas hundreds of miles from the epicentre. Russia, a rival for new energy sources in the Asia-Pacific, on Sunday offered to provide emergency supplies of natural gas. The government, meanwhile, is poised to dip into a 200bn yen (£1.5bn) contingency fund to pay for the relief effort. The prime minister, Naoto Kan, until Friday the subject of a funding scandal that could have cost him his job, called on the country to come together in its time of need. \"We must do all we can to save as many people as possible,\" he said. That effort is now an international concern, with the arrival over the weekend of rescue and medical teams from several countries, as well as a US aircraft carrier. A team of 63-strong British rescue workers, some fresh from searching through the rubble in Christchurch, was due to land in Tokyo, along with two search dogs and 11 tonnes of equipment, including heavy lifting and cutting gear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/nov/04/signing-up-force-de-frappe","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-04T00:04:02Z","webTitle":"Letters: Signing up for the force de frappe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/nov/04/signing-up-force-de-frappe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/nov/04/signing-up-force-de-frappe","fields":{"headline":"Signing up for the force de frappe","bodyText":"Although details are lacking, the proposed Anglo-French agreement for collaborative nuclear weapons research and virtual testing does more than possibly violate article 1 of the non-proliferation treaty (Leaders hail landmark defence agreement, 3 November). France has tactical air-launched bombs; we have abandoned this type of weapon and have no such capability. The UK reduced its nuclear arsenal substantially in recent years and enjoys a status as the most disarmament-friendly nuclear power. Technical collaboration that ties us to a more intransigent nuclear weapons state would therefore be a backward step both for this country and for any hope of progress towards nuclear disarmament worldwide. Peter Nicholls Colchester, Essex • The proposed \"defence share\" agreement between Britain and France is a sure sign that the government's much-heralded strategic defence review has been a Treasury-driven fudge that has cut our armed forces too far. Mr Cameron is playing a naive and dangerous game. His motivation may be cost-savings, but the French play to an altogether different agenda. It suits their ambitions in Europe if we willingly give them an effective veto over our military actions, and in the process allow them to become the dominant military power in Europe. The deal also goes blatantly against the grain of the Nato alliance and the \"special relationship\" – the very security structures that have protected us and the rest of Europe since the second world war. If Mr Cameron is desperate to reach a cost-saving defence share pact with any nation on this planet, might I suggest America might be a more fitting partner. Dr Mark Campbell-Roddis Dunblane, Perthshire • You report David Cameron as claiming that \"British troops had in practice only operated truly independently twice in the past 30 years – in Sierra Leone and the Falklands\". This claim is not accurate in respect of the Falklands war. Without the logistical support of the US, the UK could not have brought the war to a successful conclusion. We might have gone into the war \"truly independently\" but we did not fight it independently, nor could we have. Russell Woodrow London • How can our government commit us overnight to a 50-year treaty without any prior debate in parliament, let alone in the country as a whole?

It has some concerns, though: A bright future for unconventional gas is far from assured: numerous hurdles need to be overcome, not least the social and environmental concerns associated with its extraction. Producing unconventional gas is an intensive industrial process, generally imposing a larger environmental footprint than conventional gas development. More wells are often needed and techniques such as hydraulic fracturing are usually required to boost the flow of gas from the well. The scale of development can have major implications for local communities, land use and water resources. Serious hazards, including the potential for air pollution and for contamination of surface and groundwater, must be successfully addressed. Greenhouse-gas emissions must be minimised both at the point of production and throughout the entire natural gas supply chain. Improperly addressed, these concerns threaten to curb, if not halt, the development of unconventional resources. The technologies and know-how exist for unconventional gas to be produced in a way that satisfactorily meets these challenges, but a continuous drive from governments and industry to improve performance is required if public confidence is to be maintained or earned. The IEA has developed a set of \"golden rules\" it believes will help the unconventional gas sector earn itself a \"social licence to operate\". Most of the rules focus on minimising any local environmental impacts, but what of the wider issue of the carbon emissions resulting from extracting and burning a fossil fuel such as gas? Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, a major investor in the gas sector, said today that the industry is not doing enough to tackle \"fugitive methane\" leaks which are currently cancelling out any carbon savings shale gas might offer over coal. But what are your views? If quoting figures to support your points, please provide a link to the source. I will also be inviting various interested parties to join the debate, too. And later on today, I will return with my own verdict. 1.10pm: WWF-UK is quick out of the traps having already responded to the IEA report: The report explicitly points out that \"natural gas cannot on its own provide the answer to the challenge of climate change\". Responding, Keith Allott head of Climate Change at WWF-UK said: \"A golden age for gas is clearly very far from a golden age for the planet. Buried in the depths of this report is the bombshell that a global dash for unconventional gas will condemn us to warming of at least 3.5C. Those who claim that shale gas is some sort of wonder fuel that can that tackle climate change are seriously misleading the public – the reality is that it is a dangerous distraction from energy efficiency and clean renewable energy. In a country like the UK it is important to recognise that there is not even a short term benefit to the availability of shale gas. Dirty coal was on its way out before shale gas turned up and the prospect of a dash for gas now appears to be the biggest threat to meeting UK carbon targets.\" The IEA's report contains two scenarios entitled the 'Golden Rules Case' and 'Low Unconventional Gas'. In both scenarios the projection for long-term increase in the global mean temperature is significantly above 2C. Whilst emissions are very slightly lower in the IEA's Golden Rules Case', the IEA point out that any gains from replacement of coal with gas are counteracted by higher demand and less investment in low carbon fuels: \"At the global level, there are two major effects of the Golden Rules Case on CO2 emissions, which counteract one another. Lower natural gas prices mean that, in some instances, gas displaces the use of more carbon-intensive fuels, oil and coal, pushing down emissions. At the same time, lower natural gas prices lead to slightly higher overall consumption of energy and, in some instances, to displacement of lower-carbon fuels, such as renewable energy sources and nuclear power. Overall, the projections in the Golden Rules Case involve only a small net shift in anticipated levels of greenhouse-gas emissions.\" 1.18pm: Earlier this week, the Daily Telegraph reported that Ed Davey, the UK's energy and climate secretary, had \"accused those on the right of the Tory party of making out the UK could rely on shale gas in order to undermine investment in alternatives such as offshore wind\": \"The right wing of tory party are trying to make out shale gas is the answer but I'm afraid the evidence does not bear it out,\" he said. However, he did make clear that shale gas could still be useful to the UK, providing up to 10 per cent of energy needs, and is expected to give fracking the go-ahead in the next few weeks following a consultation which has just ended. 1.25pm: Here are the thoughts of Tony Bosworth, Friends of the Earth's energy campaigner: Drilling for shale and other unconventional gas would put the world on course for catastrophic climate change - incomprehensible when we have clean energy solutions at our fingertips like wind and solar power. Our changing climate is already leaving millions hungry, destroying wildlife and costing our own economy billions - more fossil fuels will just make that worse. There's no guarantee the IEA's golden rules will eliminate the risk of earthquakes and water pollution - no wonder people are worried. The energy secretary knows shale gas is not the answer to our energy woes. He must convince the government to cut energy waste and listen to the public who want more of their electricity to be powered by our sun, wind and water. 1.56pm: Last year, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Lord Lawson's climate sceptic thinktank which routinely highlights the merits of shale gas, asked Matt Ridley to examine the \"likely implications\" a shale gas \"revolution\" would have on international climate policy. Ridley concluded (pdf): Few of the low-carbon alternatives are ready to take up the challenge on a scale that can make a difference. Nuclear is too slow and costly to build; wind cannot provide sufficient volume of power or reliability; solar is too expensive; biofuel comes at the expense of hunger and high carbon dioxide emissions. All except nuclear (and to a lesser extent solar) require unacceptably vast land grabs...However, switching as much power generation from coal to gas as possible, and as much transport fuel from oil to gas as possible, would produce rapid and dramatic reductions in carbon dioxide emissions...If Europe and the wider world are bent on cutting carbon emissions, they would be foolish to ignore the claims of shale gas, at least until superior versions of nuclear or solar power are developed later in the century. Fortunately, this strategy is also the most affordable. 2.12pm: Thanks to @TimProbert below the line for linking to his \"Top ten takeaways\" from the recent SMi Shale Gas Environmental Summit in London. It's certainly worth a read. I found point 7 particularly interesting: 7. Fugitive methane emissions are estimated at 4%, which could make shale gas more environmentally damaging than coal, says UCL energy professor Studies suggest fugitive emissions may total 4% of total gas captured from fracking, higher than conventional gas, says UCL's Paul Ekins. \"You only need fugitive emissions of 3-9% for gas to be equivalent to emissions from coal in power stations. Unless you can be very sure that these fugitive emissions won't occur then the carbon benefits of substituting coal generation with gas might be seriously undermined.\" I have tried to reach Prof Ekins at the UCL Energy Institute for further comment, but he is currently away. 2.20pm: Jim Footner, head of Greenpeace UK's climate and energy campaign, says: This report admits that gambling on gas will drive up bills and send climate change out of control. Studies have shown that shale gas can be worse for the climate than coal, and this report offers no proven solutions. As the IEA itself admits, the only way to tackle climate change is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. This would also cut our reliance on all forms of gas and so stabilise bills. 2.43pm: For me, this is the key part of the IEA report (page 91 of the pdf) when it comes to discussing how a \"dash for gas\" would impact on greenhouse gas emissions. As WWF has also spotted, it seems to accept a temperature rise of more than 3.5C in the long term - without carbon capture and storage. (A very big \"if\", as the technology currently stands.) It also makes the important point that a dash for gas in Europe might not lead to significant carbon savings, if any, but in places such as China, where coal is king, a switch to gas could have a \"substantial\" impact on CO2 emissions: The Golden Rules Case puts CO2 emissions on a long-term trajectory consistent with stabilising the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions at around 650 parts per million, a trajectory consistent with a probable temperature rise of more than 3.5 degrees Celsius (°C) in the long term, well above the widely accepted 2°C target. This finding reinforces a central conclusion from the WEO special report on a Golden Age of Gas (IEA, 2011b), that, while a greater role for natural gas in the global energy mix does bring environmental benefits where it substitutes for other fossil fuels, natural gas cannot on its own provide the answer to the challenge of climate change. This conclusion could be changed by widespread application of technologies such as carbon capture and storage, which could reduce considerably the emissions from the consumption of gas (and other fossil fuels); but this is not assumed in the period to 2035. At country level, the impact of the Golden Rules Case on greenhouse-gas emissions from gas depends to a large degree on the structure of domestic fuel use, in particular for power generation. In countries where the average greenhouse-gas intensity of power generation is already close to that of natural gas, as for example in Europe, the addition of extra natural gas to the fuel mix has relatively little impact on the overall emissions trajectory. By contrast, in countries heavily reliant upon coal for electricity generation, such as China, the increased availability of natural gas has a more substantial impact on CO2 emissions. Such increased use of gas also reduces emissions of other pollutants; compared with burning coal, combustion of natural gas results in lower emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and gas also emits almost no particulate matter. Local emissions of particulate matter and NOX are the main causes of low air quality – a particularly important consideration for emerging economies seeking to provide energy for fast-growing urban areas. 2.44pm: @leohickman Following your live blog. Check out latest scientific articles on methane leakage: springerlink.com/content/c338g7… and pnas.org/content/109/17… — Robert Watt (@wattrob) May 29, 2012 2.46pm: @leohickman How green is shale gas? Higher life cycle GHG emissions than natural gas, according to this study: iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/6/3/… — Will Jenkins (@WillJJenkins) May 29, 2012 2.49pm: Here are the thoughts of Simon Moore, environment and energy fellow at Policy Exchange: As the IEA's report again makes clear, in the absence of other policy to tackle climate change, shale gas is no panacea. However, with other policies in place, gas in general, and shale gas in particular, can have a role as a transitional fuel that is consistent with required emissions reductions. To ensure that this occurs, Policy Exchange recently called on the EU to extend its emissions cap through to at least 2035. This would give long term certainty to investors, allowing the market to decide which technology has the most potential to deliver emission reductions at the cheapest cost. If due to shale or other technological developments, gas prices are lower than previously anticipated, using gas rather than more expensive alternatives to generate electricity would free up resources. Carbon emissions from electricity, capped by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, would be the same under either approach. This could allow governments to be more ambitious about carbon reduction, or invest in effective low carbon innovation support – research, development and demonstration, and early stage deployment of a range of low carbon technologies with global potential. 2.55pm: Carbon Brief, a \"project of the Energy Strategy Centre\", which \"fact-checks stories about climate and energy\", has produced a timely Q&amp;A on \"fugitive emissions\" released by the extraction of shale gas. It includes a handy graphic comparing \"different researchers' assessments of fugitive emissions as a percent of the total emissions from both conventional gas and shale gas wells\". 3.04pm: Here's a new story by my colleague Fiona Harvey, the Guardian's environment correspondent: Energy from gas power stations has been rebranded as a green, low-carbon source of power by a €80bn European Union programme, in a triumph of the deep-pocketed fossil fuel industry lobby over renewable forms of power. In a secret document seen by the Guardian, a large slice of billions of euros of funds that are supposed to be devoted to research and development into renewables such as solar and wave power are likely to be diverted instead to subsidising the development of the well-established fossil fuel. The switch follows more than 18 months of intensive lobbying by the European gas industry, which is attempting to rebrand itself as a green alternative to nuclear and coal, and as lower cost than renewable forms of power such as wind and sun. Read on here... 3.11pm: It's worth returning to the report on shale gas published by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in January 2011 and updated late last year: Irrespective of whether UK shale gas substitutes for coal, renewables or imported gas, the industry's latest reserve estimates for just one licence area could account for up to 15% of the UK's emissions budget through to 2050. Therefore, emissions from a fully developed UK shale gas industry would likely be very substantial in their own right. If the UK Government is to respect its obligations under both the Copenhagen Accord and Low Carbon Transition Plan, shale gas offers no meaningful potential as even a transition fuel. Moreover, any significant and early development of the industry is likely to prove either economically unwise or risk jeopardising the UK's international reputation on climate change. Against such a quantifiable and stark evaluation, it is difficult to conclude other than the UK needs to invest in very low carbon energy supply if it is to both abide by its international obligations and support economically sustainable technologies. 3.27pm: Craig Mackenzie, head of sustainability at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership (see 12.59pm), has sent me this: My statistic of the year so far is the fact that coal power generation in the US has fallen by 19% and gas power generation is up by 38% (US Energy Information Administration). Cheap and abundant shale gas, with the helping hand of new air pollution standards is shutting down coal in the US - and doing so extremely quickly. The switch in one year is roughly the same size as the total US wind generation. If this keeps happening, and if the gas industry deals with the fugitive methane problem which SWIP identified in our recent report (pdf), then shale gas could bring a substantial short-term climate benefit. Even more interesting, it is possible that the coal-gas switch could start to happen in China - host to the world's biggest shale gas resource - where 80% of electric power comes from coal generation. This could have an even bigger climate benefit. While it would be best for the climate if the world did a switch direct from coal to zero carbon power. We need to ask how likely this is - given the costs and the politics. If we cannot have this ideal scenario, then temporary coal-gas switching could be better for the climate than the alternative: keeping burning coal. While a coal-gas switch might be a pragmatic short-term option in the US and maybe China (the world's two biggest carbon emitters), this doesn't mean that shale gas makes climate sense everywhere. In the EU - given political support for strong climate policy - we should be discussing how we start to phase out of gas (or add CCS), not how we ramp up long-term production. Even in the US and China we need to be careful - while a coal-gas switch makes climate sense a wind-gas switch certainly doesn't. And without ongoing subsidy - or preferably carbon taxes - there is a risk that this is what we will get. Also, even in the US and China, we need to switch the gas off (or attach CCS) within a couple of decades or so. So we need to start planning for this. But. If it is true - as the new US data seems to indicate - that gas can topple king coal faster than any alternative currently available, then this is a climate benefit worth having - if only for a decade or two. 3.46pm: Earlier, I mentioned that I had unsuccessfully tried to reach Prof Ekins at the UCL Energy Institute. However, Christophe McGlade, one of his PhD students, has responded. The range of 3-9% [for fugitive emissions] is quite large and critically depends on the global warming potential (GWP) assumed for methane. The IEA has a nice representation of this in figure 1.5 on page 40 of its report. Some groups have argued for a GWP factor of 25 (the GWP of methane over a 100 year time frame) and others a factor closer to 100 (over a 20 year time frame). Proponents of the shorter time frame argue that it is the next 20 years that will be crucial for tackling climate change. There is also a large debate raging over the fugitive emissions of shale gas production stimulated by recent papers from Howarth et al. at Cornell. The first of these papers met with a lot of criticism from industry and a variety of other groups carried out their own review (such as Deutsche Bank). Another recent, independent, report on gas emissions was released by the NOAA in a paper in Nature (http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/files/2012/02/Petron_Colorado_Front_Range_2011.pdf and http://www.nature.com/news/air-sampling-reveals-high-emissions-from-gas-field-1.9982) which also suggested a figure of around 4% methane being released. Given the levels of criticism of Howarth et al. this was a surprising new piece of research and puts gas production onto a similar footing as coal. There is an urgent need into more (unpartisan) studies into this area. In the UK, just as important as fugitive emissions however is the long term implications of tying into a (shale) gas filled future. In order to have any hope of reaching the legally binding climate change targets, a carbon neutral electricity system is essential. A quick back of the envelope calculations suggests that immediately switching all UK coal power plants to gas will save around 58 million tonnes CO2, not a small amount, but only around 23% of the required reductions needed in energy system CO2 levels by 2030 and only 12% of the required 2050 reductions. The technical aspects of carbon capture and storage (CCS) mean that gas with CCS cannot be used as back up to renewables and so if gas is to play any part of the future electricity system, it can either be as gas with CCS or, burning unabated, as simple back up to renewables. If the latter of these, then the number of gas power plants required will be a lot lower or those that have been constructed will have to run at very low capacity levels. Some of the research we have done here as part of the UK Energy Research Centre using the MARKAL energy systems suggests that gas can have a part to play in a future decarbonised electricity system, but any unabated gas will only be able to run 10% of the time. This is the danger in rushing into another dash for gas. This is not to say that gas use will not be useful in other regions as any increases in gas supply in regions like China could lead to potential new coal plants being switched to gas plants. Shale gas could therefore be useful for helping to meet climate targets in regions such as these, but probably not in the UK. 4.07pm: Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, reminds me that Deutsche Bank published another report last year (see 3.46pm) that poured cold water over the idea the the UK will see a shale gas revolution, as witnessed in the US. Not least, because of the tougher planning and environmental regulations that come from living on a densely populated island. 4.12pm: Fiona Harvey's news story about the IEA report will soon be live on the Guardian website. Here's a teaser: On current trends, according to the IEA, the world is set for far more global warming than the 2C that scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. \"A golden age for gas is not necessarily a golden age for the climate,\" warned [Fatih Birol, chief economist for the IEA]... Gas produces only about half of the carbon emissions of coal when burnt, which has led some industry lobbyists to attempt to rebrand it as a \"clean\" or \"low-carbon\" fuel. But its effect on the climate is less clear cut than the direct comparison with coal would suggest. In the US, gas-fired power stations have taken over in some areas from coal-fired power, which reduced the nominal carbon emissions from US power stations. But that does not necessarily equate to a global cut in emissions. Last year, the consumption of coal in Europe rose by 6%, according to Birol, which was a result of an excess of cheap coal on the market because of less consumption in the US, while the price on carbon emissions under the EU's emissions trading scheme – supposed to discourage coal – was too low to have any effect. That rise in coal consumption will have increased emissions in the EU, though the data has not yet been fully collected. This example shows that gas can simply displace emissions rather than cut them altogether, according to Birol. \"Gas cannot solve climate change – we need renewable energy,\" he told the Guardian. 5.43pm: My verdict There's no hiding from the fact that shale gas is a fossil fuel. Both the extraction process, and the burning of it as a fuel, emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But there is some logic - albeit garlanded with caveats - that replacing coal and oil with shale gas could lead to a significant reduction in overall emissions. This is currently the story coming out of the US, where the shale gas revolution is well under way. And in fast-developing countries such as China, where coal is king, a direct transfer to gas would be a very positive development. Shale gas certainly has potential as a \"bridging fuel\", buying us perhaps a couple more decades to work out - both technically and politically - a viable way to genuinely and rapidly decarbonise the global economy. However, those pesky caveats can't be suppressed for long. The principal danger is that a \"dash for gas\" will suck investment and momentum away from the fledgling renewables sector. Cheap, abundant gas might also trigger the \"rebound effect\" - people will likely just burn more of the stuff, thereby quickly cancelling out any carbon savings. There also seems to be far too much confidence that carbon capture and storage will ride in to save the day, when the technology is still a very long way off from being proven. As will be the case with minimising shale gas's localised environmental impacts, such as water pollution and earth tremors, politicians and regulators will need to be strong-willed and beady-eyed if they are to ensure it delivers any genuine environmental benefits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/sep/25/iran-cyber-hacking-nuclear-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-25T06:30:51Z","webTitle":"Iranian nuclear plants likely target of foiled cyber sabotage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/25/iran-cyber-hacking-nuclear-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/sep/25/iran-cyber-hacking-nuclear-plants","fields":{"headline":"Iranian nuclear plants likely target of foiled cyber sabotage","bodyText":"Iran was the likely target of a sophisticated computer worm designed to sabotage factories and infrastructure which was almost certainly the work of a national government agency, security experts told the Guardian yesterday. According to the security company Symantec, 60% of the computers infected by the Stuxnet computer worm are in Iran, which is where the malicious software, known as malware, was discovered by a Belarussian computer security company. Stuxnet has been described as one the \"most refined pieces of malware ever discovered\". What makes it even more unusual is that it is aimed, not at financial gain, but at sabotaging computer-controlled infrastructure including nuclear plants. There was speculation among experts yesterday that the target could have been the Bushehr nuclear reactor in Iran — which was loaded with Russian uranium fuel last month – and that Israeli hackers were behind the sophisticated operation. But security analysts said it may be impossible to identify the perpetrators. The computer security firm, Symantec, which has been charting Stuxnet's spread, estimates that the group behind it would have been well funded, comprising between five and 10 people, and that it would have taken six months to prepare. Stuxnet works by exploiting previously unknown security holes in Microsoft's Windows operating system. It then seeks out a component, called Simatic WinCC, manufactured by Siemens, which controls factory operations. Siemens was involved in the design of the Bushehr plant. Alan Bentley, senior international vice president at the security firm Lumension, said Stuxnet was \"the most refined piece of malware ever discovered\", and that the worm was significant because \"mischief or financial reward wasn't its purpose, it was aimed right at the heart of a critical infrastructure. \"There is circumstantial evidence to suggest Iran was the target of Stuxnet. We know the worm was designed with a specific target in mind – its makeup and the way it executes render the telltale signs. \"Combine this with the fact that the worm was identified by a Belarussian security firm working for an Iranian client and the fact that the nuclear power plant was not working properly for months, it is understandable that speculation points towards Iran as the target.\" The discovery of the Stuxnet worm comes amid tension over Iran's nuclear programme. Despite four sets of sanctions Tehran has rejected UN security council demands for the country to suspend uranium enrichment, insisting the programme is for peaceful purposes. Western governments warn that Iran has already amassed enough uranium to build two nuclear warheads, if further enriched. The CIA, the Mossad and other western intelligence agencies are reported to have attempted to sabotage the programme by ensuring that equipment Iran bought on the black market was defective. The US has recently set up a Cyber Command, which it says is for defensive rather than offensive purposes. Its head, General Keith Alexander, said Stuxnet was \"very sophisticated\". • This article was amended on 28 September 2010.

In one of the web's fastest-growing environmental campaigns, Greenpeace international says at least 500,000 people have now protested at the organisation's intention to run its giant new data centre mainly on electricity produced by burning coal power. Facebook will not say how much electricity it uses to stream video, store information and connect its 500m users but industry estimates suggest that at their present rate of growth all the data centres and telecommunication networks in the world will consume about 1,963bn kilowatt hours of electricity by 2020. That is more than triple their current consumption and more electricity than is used by France, Germany, Canada and Brazil combined. Facebook announced in February that it planned to build what is expected to be the world's largest centralised data storage centres in Portland, Oregon. Although it will include some of the world's most energy-efficient computers, the sheer scale of the Facebook operation will almost certainly use more electricity than many developing countries. The company has said it will source its electricity from Pacific Power. It uses coal power – the dirtiest form of power generation – for 67% of its electricity, and produces less than 12% of its electricity from renewable sources. The company has said it plans to generate more electricity from renewables in future but has given no detailed information. In a statement Facebook said: \"It is true that the local utility for the region we chose, Pacific Power, has an energy mix that is weighted slightly more toward coal than the national average. However, the efficiency we are able to achieve because of the climate of the region and the reduced energy usage that results minimises our overall carbon footprint. \"Said differently, if we located the data centre most other places, we would need mechanical chillers, use more energy, and be responsible for more overall carbon in the air – even if that location was fuelled by more renewable energy.\" Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International, urged Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to commit his company to a plan to phase out the use of dirty coal-fired electricity. In a letter to Facebook, Naidoo said: \"Facebook is uniquely positioned to be a truly visible and influential leader to drive the deployment of clean energy.\" Earlier this year Greenpeace admitted that many of its own web hosting operations are also housed in data centres powered primarily by coal and nuclear power. The environmental group said it offset all the energy used to power its main website in Amsterdam and used renewable energy where it could.

Commissioned by the Department for Business, Energy and Regulatory Reform (DBERR), the report says that if government chose to be as ambitious as some other countries, a combination of loans, grants and incentives could lead to nearly 10m microgeneration systems being installed by 2020. Such a large scale switch to microrenewable energy could save 30m tonnes of CO2 – the equivalent of nearly 5% of all UK electricity. The report estimates that there are nearly 100,000 microgeneration units already installed in Britain. Nearly 90,000 of these are solar water heaters, with limited numbers of biomass boilers, photovoltaic panels, heat pumps, fuel cells, and small-scale hydroelectric and windpower schemes. If no action is taken, says the report, Britain can expect about 500,000 microunits to be installed by 2015 and 2-3m by 2020. But, with the right incentives, nearly one in five buildings in Britain would effectively become mini power stations, feeding electricity into the grid, or generating enough to be largely self-sufficient. Some of the greatest gains would be in combined heat and power units which are suitable for large blocks of flats, estates and businesses. Britain has been widely criticised for not doing as much as other countries to encourage a mass market for small-scale renewables. The few existing schemes have failed to kick-start the industry. But the report says this could be swiftly changed: Germany has invested nearly £10bn in photovoltaic technology and Sweden has made it very attractive for consumers to install heat pumps. The small-scale energy revolution will depend on the government stimulating the market with a range of consumer-friendly financial incentives schemes. \"For widespread uptake of microgeneration to occur in the UK, sustained policy support will be required,\" says the report. Top of the proposed incentive list is a \"feed-in\" tariff scheme which would reward people who invest in making their own electricity for feeding excess power into the national gird. This has been introduced in most European countries and is now a part of the Conservative party's energy policy. Other possible incentives include 50% grants to help people meet the high initial cost of equipment and installation. If the government subsidised 50% of the cost of the some of the technologies, Britain would save 14m tonnes of CO2 a year, or 3% of all emissions for a cost rising to £2.2bn a year by 2030. A third option would be to provide mortgage-style discounted low-interest \"soft loans\" payable over 25 years. This, suggests the report, would lead to a massive 8m units being installed by 2020. But it cautions that the life of the loan would probably exceed the life of most power units. It also proposes a scheme where consumers put up some of the cost of a new electricity generating boiler in return for a long-term guaranteed cut in their power bills. The report comes at a critical point, with the government's energy strategy due to be published soon and microgeneration targets due to be decided later in the year. The outlook it thought to be favourable because energy prices are expected to continue rising steeply as oil and gas prices soar. The energy minister, Malcolm Wicks, welcomed the report: \"Microgeneration has the potential to make a significant contribution to overall energy use in the UK and, combined with energy efficiency measures, will help towards reducing our carbon emissions. The concerned individual can take an active role in the battle against climate change.\" The industry has called for binding targets which it said would lead to greater certainty for investors and lower costs for consumers. \"This shows that with the right policies in place, citizens can save money and make make a marked difference to tackling UK emissions and future-proof their homes,\" said Dave Sowden, chief executive of the Micropower Council. One problem was not considered by the report, however. Conservative leader David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Malcolm Wicks have all had applications to erect wind turbines on their roofs turned down by planning officers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jul/25/2011-year-news-overload","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-25T18:59:01Z","webTitle":"2011: the year of the news overload","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/25/2011-year-news-overload","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jul/25/2011-year-news-overload","fields":{"headline":"2011: the year of the news overload","bodyText":"They always say too much disaster has the effect of inoculating the audience, so that we don't care. But there is a level above that, of so many disasters that you go beyond the inoculation effect, into the Armageddon effect (or, as Private Eye had it, when they captioned George Bush on 11 September, \"Armageddonouttahere\"). Whatever the news has been of 2011, one thing always strikes me: this story, the alleged homicidal hospital worker, or the imminent implosion of Greece, or the famine in the horn of Africa, any one of these would normally have been enough to hold the front pages for days, even weeks: were it not for that story, the Murdoch affair, the imminent collapse of Italy, the Norwegian massacre, the American debt ceiling. There is such an abundance of news that it's torpedoed the news agenda. How do you make an agenda, when everything is as important as everything else? There is just too much news. It's the kind of news environment that makes conspiracy theorists say: \"These things are all connected.\" There is also a sense of headspin, of being unable to digest one tragedy before another happens. It's compounded by Twitter, as almost everything always is: the modern business of half-knowing meant that the news of Amy Winehouse's death was on Twitter before it was publicly announced, of course. The Facebook profile of the allegedly homicidal nurse would normally have been picked over for clues all week. But they're superseded so fast that you never get time for that half-knowledge to turn into full knowledge before the next thing happens. The effect is a news twilight, where you can't even be sure what has been confirmed and what hasn't. But to return to that urge to connect, the urge to understand: even for non-conspiracy theorists, that is a legitimate aim; when huge events tumble up on one another, it is human to look for a link. This is easier with natural disasters than it is with sudden decapitations of the high command, so, to start in New Zealand: the Christchurch earthquake in February would, in a normal year, have taken up news coverage on a scale of the Australian fires of 2009: there would have been eyewitness accounts pouring out, the whole disaster would have been broken down to individual narratives with either an especially tragic or ironic twist. I can remember specific stories about those fires, families who died in cars, brave individuals who fought off flames with a spade. I can't remember anything at all about Christchurch, since less than three weeks later, the Japanese suffered their greatest, costliest disaster since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The tornados that hit Arkansas and Ontario in April would normally – having killed 45 people – have been quite a big story, but were obliterated by the destruction that had already happened. In that ruminative period that usually follows a significant event, people were batting around the theory that one earthquake will predispose the earth to suffer another; otherwise, the coincidence of New Zealand, then Japan, then Japan again a few days later (not to mention New Zealand again in June), just seemed too great. In fact, the intricacies of new tectonic theory were totally wiped out by the threat to the Japanese nuclear power plants, which themselves – and this is surprising, given that the story is far from over – lost coverage to the Arab spring. But even without knowing the answer to the earthquake question, there's still a sense with natural disasters that, if they look connected, they may well be; we're just waiting for the right climate change/environmental scientist to come along, and the links between the Brisbane floods and the drought in the Horn of Africa, the earthquakes in the far east and the tornados in the west, all of it will become clear. Likewise, with financial meltdown: if Greece looks as if it's on the brink one minute, and the next thing you know, Portugal is; if Italy suddenly starts to wobble and Merkel and Sarkozy undertake the unsettling stunt of seeming to agree with each other just so as not to frighten the horses, the links there are pretty evident. You don't need to understand who's in favour of the eurobond and who isn't, the degree to which Berlusconi created this mess because he should have been minding the ship but was actually at a bunga bunga party, you don't need the one, two, three of all this to understand that it's all the same currency, so naturally contagion was always a possibility. It's true that the US breaching its debt ceiling is a different matter, and can't be shrugged off with a nervous \"I wonder if this shared currency was a good idea after all?\" laugh. But it's also true that, if we understand anything at all about global finance, it's that the shockwaves from the credit crunch were never going to restrict themselves to crashing on one bad decision; they will crash anywhere, and continue to crash. Nobody, looking to understand all of that, need find themselves resorting to God. On the other hand, consider the worldwide disruption of powers that seemed inviolable: Mubarak in Egypt, whose regime fell in February after only 17 days of street protest; Osama bin Laden, killed by the Americans in May in a blow so sudden and so long-awaited that everybody immediately assumed it had been made up to boost Obama's poll ratings; President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali forced to flee Tunisia, for Saudi Arabia; Colonel Gaddafi, as tenacious a tinpot dictator as has ever existed on the world stage, now apparently clinging on to power in Libya only because he has no alternative. There is, naturally, a connection between the events of the Arab spring, but what has the Bin Laden attack got to do with any of that? What were the chances that he would be knocked off the front pages by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, and that his demise would be dwarfed, to the point of being almost erased, by the end of the era of Rupert Murdoch? The tragedy in Norway distilled this last feature of the year's news: how could you ever have seen that coming? There will be people, of course, most probably in Norway, who could have foreseen that a far-right militant would want to attack one of the world's most famously peaceable nations, wreaking a death toll in that country greater than any single event since the second world war. But an outside observer, asked to predict far-right terrorist atrocity: you'd say America, some off-grid hyper-nationalist whipped into a homicidal frenzy by the Tea Party; or you might say the Netherlands, just for the heat of its debates on Islamic fundamentalism versus nationalist extremism. But Norway . . . if it could be Norway, it could be anywhere. If the Arab spring could have started in Tunisia, it could have started anywhere. Maybe all that's standing between any of us and mania is heavy artillery. Conspicuous by their absences are the good news events, in which a good thing happened. The royal wedding in April, it is true, accounted for significant news acreage, being both photogenic and pleasant in conception (two people, young and in love. What's not to like?). By the time they got to their North American tour, however, their blameless irrelevance became clear. You can't pose in an ice-hockey shirt while people are just starting to starve to death in Somalia. In a regular year, Cameron's trip to Africa this month would have yielded at least one tale in which he triumphed, either brokering a peace or a trade deal, something to make the business of international diplomacy seem worthwhile. Instead, the only question arising from that escapade is what was he doing in Africa, when the integrity of parliament, the police, the press, indeed, every major institution of the British body politic, except if you count doctors, was coming into question? There has been so little of actual Westminster politics, it feels as if recess started a month ago. What happened with the NHS? We know they dropped the reforms. Did they drop the reform of the reforms? Domestic political events which seemed – because they were – vitally important, the cuts, the marches, the strikes, the summer of discontent, the swelling clash between the unions and the would-be union-smashers (let's not write this off, by the way: this is waiting in the wings) have all fallen off the pages. It's not because they're not happening. Cuts are still going ahead, people are still losing their jobs, it's all going according to plan. But the conversation is elsewhere. As exasperating as that is, politically, that is nothing on the desperate, teeth-grinding frustration of the director of Unicef, David Bull, who took out full-page adverts in the national press last week to say: \"I am writing for your support in moving the news agenda on. The story about phone hacking does matter, but there's another, far bigger and vital story that's going unreported.\" This is the first official famine to happen in 20 years. It's worth bearing in mind that we are still talking about the Ethiopian famine of the 80s, we're still – in government, in the aid sector, in the media – talking about responses to that, and what went wrong, and what we could have done better. In 20 years' time, the priorities of the news of 2011 will probably seem unfortunate: Bull is right. As serious as it is when a media outlet corrupts a police force, it's not as bad as 10 million people being on the brink of death. At the beginning of BBC radio, if the time rolled around for a news bulletin, and there was no news, the newsreader would simply say \"there is no news\". Sooner or later, the idea of a news agenda developed, and if there was no news, they would just find some news. But you can imagine today, just waking up to hear that there was no news: what a comfort that would be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/236375","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-30T21:30:16Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Pakistan's position on treaty to control fissile material","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/236375","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/236375","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Pakistan's position on treaty to control fissile material","bodyText":"Tuesday, 24 November 2009, 12:59 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 03 ISLAMABAD 002840 SIPDIS EO 12958 DECL: 10/06/2019 TAGS MNUC, KNNP, PREL, PGOV, PTER, PK SUBJECT: PAKISTANI VIEWS ON FISSILE MATERIAL CUTOFF TREATY (FMCT) STILL MALEABLE Classified By: Anne W. Patterson for reasons 1.4 (b) (d) 1. (C) Summary: Pakistani officials do not appear to have coalesced on a strategy or position for the mid-January resumption of Conference on Disarmament (CD) discussions on the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty (FMCT). Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) interlocutors continue to stress the need for consensus language to bring Pakistan on board a CD work program that includes FMCT negotiations, while Strategic Plans Division (SPD) officials urge a cautious approach that leaves plenty of time for deliberations. In the absence of a formal decision, continued delay along procedural lines is the most likely default approach. Overt U.S. pressure may solidify this tactic, according to a non-governmental contact who follows disarmament issues. The GOP strongly desires the resumption of U.S.-Pakistan talks on nonproliferation, security, and strategic stability before the next CD session in order to discuss perspectives on the FMCT and come to an \"understanding\" on each side's positions. In order to take advantage of internal GOP deliberations, Post recommends high-level interventions with Pakistan's military leadership to help build support for proceeding with FMCT negotiations. End summary. 2. (C) Over the last two weeks, PolOff canvassed GOP officials in the Disarmament Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Director General Dr. Irfan Yusuf Shami and Director Kamran Akhtar), the Arms Control and Disarmament Directorate at the Strategic Plans Division (Director Khalid Banuri and Deputy Director Adil Sultan), as well as one non-governmental contact (Maria Sultan of the South Asia Strategic Stability Institute (SASSI)) who follows nonproliferation issues, for views on Pakistan's likely approach to Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty discussions at the Conference on Disarmament when the 2010 session convenes in January. The discussions with Pakistani interlocutors suggest that Pakistan's FMCT position remains somewhat malleable and that GOP officials have not yet coalesced on a specific position for the next CD session. They also underscored the importance of bilateral discussions, particularly with high-level Pakistan military officials, if the USG is to secure Pakistani support for beginning CD negotiations. ------------------------ Strategic Considerations ------------------------ 3. (C) According to Pakistani counterparts, Pakistan's FMCT position is shaped by four strategic considerations, which point to a degrading of the deterrent value of Pakistan's nuclear weapons and thus make an FMCT difficult for Pakistan. First, Pakistani officials perceive the U.S.-India civil nuclear cooperation initiative as having unshackled India's nuclear weapons program. Prior to the initiative, they said, India faced a significant uranium supply constraint that forced it to choose literally between nuclear weapons or nuclear power. Now, however, India is able to secure foreign-supplied uranium for its civil nuclear power reactors, leaving it free to devote a greater share of its domestically-sourced uranium to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. This perceived growth in nuclear weapons production capability blunts any numerical advantage in nuclear weapons Pakistan may have. 4. (C) Second, the increase in high-technology defense and space trade between India and the United States, Russia, and others has improved the quality of India's nuclear systems, according to Pakistani thinking. While Pakistan continues to face significant trade barriers and is subject to export denial regimes, Pakistani officials believe India is no longer held back by these constraints and is using market access to improve its nuclear delivery vehicles. 5. (C) Third, India's growing conventional military superiority, coupled with its Cold Start military doctrine of fast mobilization and rapid strike capability, poses a new level of threat, according to Pakistani counterparts. Indian plans and capabilities have forced Pakistan to rely more on nuclear weapons and less on conventional military capability to balance Indian force. Maria Sultan of SASSI suggested that Pakistani military planners now focus on the possibility of a two-front war and believe that Pakistan needs to transform its arsenal to smaller, tactical weapons that could be used on the battlefield against Indian conventional capabilities. The result of this trend is the need for greater stocks of fissile material to feed Pakistan's nuclear weapons requirement. 6. (C) Finally, Pakistani counterparts point to India's interest and investment in missile defense, even if it will take many years to field a capable system. They believe this indicates that India is not interested in a balance of power, but intends to degrade the value of Pakistan's nuclear deterrent. 7. (C) Taken together, these strategic considerations point Pakistan in the direction of a larger nuclear force that requires a greater amount of fissile material, Pakistani officials argue. By this logic, agreeing to a production cutoff now does not meet Pakistan's interests. It is unclear whether GOP officials believe Pakistan is ahead of India in terms of nuclear capability, but they point to the combination of India's capabilities and intentions, as well as its stockpile of fissile material (even if spent nuclear reactor fuel is not as useful in nuclear weapons), to suggest that there is little advantage for Pakistan in trying to lock India into an FMCT now, since both countries' arsenals appear set to grow. Maria Sultan suggested that this is not the consensus view, however, and that at least some part of the Pakistani military establishment believes it better to agree to an FMCT now since India has a much greater long-term fissile material growth potential than Pakistan. In either case, the argument that the FMCT is a global disarmament imperative seems to have no currency in Islamabad; Pakistan's position, as described by Pakistani counterparts, is shaped exclusively by its own regional concerns. ------------------ FMCT Policy Circle ------------------ 8. (C) While GOP officials would not comment directly on internal FMCT policy deliberations over the summer, Maria Sultan argued that Pakistan's surprising reversal at the CD can be chalked up to two factors: a CD Ambassador too eager to join consensus and a lethargic policy process driven more by personalities than institutions. By her account, Pakistan's initial support of the CD work program in the spring of 2009 was a decision made by Ambassador Zamir Akram without the benefit of a full policy review in Islamabad. Akram, she suggested, is part of the old guard of MFA ideologues and a long-time supporter of the Shannon mandate, which identified parameters for international consensus on an FMCT. However, Pakistan's position to support FMCT negotiations based on the Shannon mandate was outdated, she said. The advent of the U.S.-India civil nuclear initiative, in particular, had changed the terms for Islamabad, but its CD strategy had never been updated. Military officials in Islamabad intervened, she stated, and it was left to MFA to extricate Pakistan from a dilemma of its own creation, which is why Pakistan sought to tie up the CD on procedural grounds. 9. (C) According to Sultan, there are several camps within the GOP policy circle on FMCT. MFA officials, she said, tend toward continuing to support negotiation of an FMCT. In addition to Foreign Secretary Bashir and Irfan Shami, other officials, such as MFA spokesman Abdul Basit and Ambassador to Beijing Masood Khan, are Akram protgs and will continue to be consulted on negotiating strategy even though they are not directly tied to the Disarmament Division, she suggested. While important, MFA officials probably are not the most influential voices on FMCT, she argued; the views of high-level military officials, in particular Gen. Kayani and SPD Director General Khalid Kidwai, carry more weight within this circle. Kayani, she indicated, is aware of the issue but is not prepared to make a decision. Kidwai, on the other hand, favors delaying negotiations as long as possible, presumably to leave time and space for the investments made in expanding Pakistan's fissile material production capacity to bear fruit. SPD Arms Control Director Khalid Banuri indicated this preference for delay, telling PolOff that the current momentum on FMCT should not be used to rush the process and \"there needs to be plenty of time for deliberations.\" 10. (C) Sultan argued, however, that Kidwai does not monopolize the debate on this issue and that other critical inputs come from the Strategic Forces Command, the Director General for Military Operations (DGMO), the Minister of Defense, and some National Defense University experts. In particular, she stated, \"the DGMO (Maj. Gen. Javed Iqbal) takes a view on the FMCT 180 degrees apart from Kidwai's,\" believing that it is better to bind India to current fissile material levels than wait for the full effect of the U.S.-India nuclear initiative, which will allow India to produce even greater amounts of plutonium. 11. (C) When asked how she rated overall government support for these two positions, Sultan assessed 70% favor further delay while 30% support negotiation. However, she cautioned, overt U.S. pressure on Pakistan will firmly tip the balance toward delay. To bring Pakistan on board, she said the U.S. needs to focus on addressing Pakistan's strategic concerns and the slow degradation of deterrence. In particular, she argued for opening the high-technology defense market for Pakistan on early warning capabilities, such as the AWACS platform. ------------------------------------- Next Steps and Post's Recommendations ------------------------------------- 12. (C) Looking ahead to January, MFA Disarmament Director General Irfan Shami expressed a strong desire to resume bilateral talks on nonproliferation, security, and strategic stability before the CD session in order to discuss perspectives on the FMCT and come to an \"understanding\" on each other's positions. He would not elaborate on what that \"understanding\" might constitute, but stated Pakistan needs time to explain its position. While it is unlikely such discussions will turn Pakistan's policy around, they should have the effect of forcing more internal discussions on the issue, which provides some opportunity for USG influence. 13. (C) It seems clear that, beyond MFA, Pakistan's military leadership is a crucial audience. While direct U.S. pressure is unlikely to convince them to support FMCT negotiations, and may even hurt efforts to move forward, mil-mil discussions on Pakistan's strategic concerns, particularly with COAS General Kayani and DGMO Major General Javed Iqbal, could help build the military's confidence that Pakistan's interests will be taken into account. As part of these interventions, it may help to provide Pakistani military leaders with an analytical case for why an FMCT makes more sense for Pakistan now than in the future in terms of the strength of the its deterrence vis-a-vis India.

Last November, British-led efforts to build a radically designed giant offshore wind turbine with a 275m wingspan were given a shot across the bows when a group of Spanish companies announced they were starting work on an even larger and more powerful turbine. At stake is dominance of the nascent offshore wind sector as it steps up to the sort of scale that will enable it to compete with gigawatt-sized coal, gas and nuclear power stations. Most of today's large wind turbines are now more than 100m tall and generate about 3MW, meaning more than 300 or even up to a thousand such turbines are needed to match the output of a conventional power plant. By contrast, just one of the British 10MW \"Aerogenerator\" turbines being developed by designers and engineers, including Arup and Rolls Royce, could power 5,000-10,000 homes. The dramatic-looking project is also unusual in its vertical axis design – it rotates like a sycamore leaf – rather than the horizontal axis turbines that currently dot the UK coast. Feargal Brennan, head of offshore engineering at Cranfield University, where work is being carried out on the design, says: \"The UK has come late to the race, but with 40 years of oil and gas experience we have the chance to lead the world. The new [Aerogenerator] turbine is based on semi-submersible oil platform technology and does not have the same weight constraints as a normal wind turbine. The radical new design is half the height of an equivalent [conventional] turbine.\" The first Aerogenerator turbines are unlikely to be built until 2013-14. But even such grand ambitions are likely to be dwarfed by Spain's \"Azimut project\", which hopes to build an enormous 15 MW turbine as soon as 2020. Spanish turbine-maker Gamesa is leading the €25m (£21m) effort, along with 11 wind and engineering companies and 22 research centres. A Gamesa spokeswoman says: \"The initiative, scheduled to finalise in 2013, is designed to establish the technological groundwork for the subsequent development, in around 2020, of a large-scale offshore wind turbine. The programme's initial objectives call for developing a turbine with unit capacity of 15 MW that is capable of overcoming the technical and financial hurdles currently limiting the rollout of offshore wind energy.\" The company believes connections to the grid and foundations for the turbines will prove to be two of the toughest technical obstacles. Spain is already a world leader in wind, with installed wind power rising by 18.5% last year and now providing 16% of the country's electricity needs. Spain and the UK are not alone in the big wind battle. US wind turbine-maker Clipper is working on a 10 MW offshore turbine dubbed the \"Britannia project\", with a prototype expected as early as 2012. The 72m-long blades will be made in the UK, on Tyneside, and Clipper has been awarded a £4.46m government grant for offshore wind development. The world's leading turbine-maker, Danish firm Vestas, is also eyeing bigger turbines, and has told industry press that it is working on a 6 MW model. Elsewhere in Europe, Upwind, an EU-funded project that has been working since 2006 to tackle the technical challenges of building 8-10 MW-sized turbines, draws to a close this year. All the players in the race have an eye on the huge offshore wind plans being encouraged by governments around the world, from the British coast to the Yellow Sea off South Korea and the Google-backed offshore farms off the US's eastern seaboard. Who will succeed is unclear, but one things seems certain: large scale could bring colossal rewards. In search of jobs as well as energy Britain's lead on offshore wind presents a major opportunity in the global scramble for green jobs and business, experts predict. \"For once in a very long time, Britain is leading in a cutting edge technological sector, both in terms of policy frameworks and expertise,\" says Peter Madigan, head of offshore at green energy trade body, RenewableUK. \"We are seeing an increasing number of foreign delegations from places as far as China, Thailand, Singapore, Japan and the United States visiting the UK to discover 'the secret' of our success in this sector.\" But despite having the most installed offshore wind in the world and some of the planet's best natural resources around its coast, the UK must not get complacent, he warns. \"There has to be a sense that this kudos is based as much on our current success as it will draw on our ability to rollout further projects. Continual development of our offshore market will send a clear signal that the technology has a future and that we are in the best position to assist everyone else.\" Madigan also points to the importance of moving the manufacture of offshore wind turbines to the UK, most of which are currently made in Europe, the US and China. The turbines are the single largest items of expenditure when a new offshore wind farm is built. Siemens recently announced plans to build Britain's first major offshore wind turbine manufacturing plant in Hull and other firms, such as Mitsubishi and GE, are also planning turbine factories in the UK. Robert Gross, the director of the centre for energy policy and technology, Imperial College London, says that while the UK catches up on turbine-making, other companies still benefit from offshore wind's rise. \"One of the main myths about wind power is that because British-owned companies do not produce turbines there is no role for UK industry in offshore wind. In fact UK companies are active in many parts of the supply chain, from specialist components used within turbines to towers, foundations and cables.\" UK expertise in design, support services and vessels is another opportunity, he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/jul/12/renewable-energy-feed-in-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-07-12T14:47:55Z","webTitle":"Civil servants 'are delaying renewables plan'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jul/12/renewable-energy-feed-in-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/jul/12/renewable-energy-feed-in-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"Civil servants accused of delaying renewable energy incentives","bodyText":"Civil servants in Ed Miliband's Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) are trying to water down and delay the introduction of so-called feed-in tariffs designed to boost the deployment of renewable energies, according to one of Miliband's advisers. Writing last month to the energy minister Mike O'Brien, who has since left DECC, Alan Simpson, Labour MP for Nottingham South, accuses civil servants of \"delaying\" and \"frustrating\" their introduction. In his letter, a copy of which has been obtained by the Guardian, Simpson, appointed by Miliband this year to work on feed-in tariffs, wrote: \"You asked me to play a role in 'driving this through'. It is difficult to drive if I can't even get in the car.\" Feed-in tariffs work by rewarding installers of renewable energy technologies such as biomass boilers or solar panels an above-market price for the electricity or heat they produce. They have been used with great success in countries such as Germany, which introduced a feed-in tariff in 1999; it has 250 times as much solar power installed as Britain and 10 times as much wind power. Miliband has announced that a feed-in tariff for electricity will be introduced in April next year and for heat technologies a year later. Simpson thinks both should and could be brought in together, and has come up with a plan for doing so. He accuses civil servants of frustrating this by carrying out an \"industrial boycott\" of meetings with himself and representatives of the renewables industry. Critics of DECC officials say they are transfixed by the arguments of the nuclear industry. Many of the big energy companies have lobbied the DECC against feed-in tariffs. Simpson's letter raises the issue of who governs in government since, he says, officials are obstructing the will of elected politicians, including Miliband. \"Their ability to delay and frustrate is the government's greatest achilles heel,\" he says. Instead, he suggests to O'Brien, \"why don't we set up meetings of our own and ban the civil servants from taking part?\" A DECC spokeswoman said Simpson's fears were groundless and pointed out that on Wednesday Miliband will unveil a low-carbon transition plan. But Philip Wolfe, head of the Renewable Energy Association, said the document would talk only about the electricity tariff for next year and not the heat tariff for 2011: \"There is a lack of ambition. Delaying the heat tariff until a year later shows they are not pushing as hard as they need to.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2010/nov/13/this-weeks-new-films","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-13T00:05:51Z","webTitle":"This week's new films","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/13/this-weeks-new-films","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2010/nov/13/this-weeks-new-films","fields":{"headline":"This week's new films","bodyText":"We Are What We Are (15) (Jorge Michel Grau, 2010, Mexico) Francisco Barreiro, Alan Chávez, Paulina Gaitán, Carmen Beato. 90 mins Vampires are so last season, so bring on the cannibals!

Nuclear power is generated using uranium, a metal that is mined as an ore in large quantities, with Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan providing more than half of the world's supplies. Nuclear reactors work in a similar way to other power plants, but instead of using coal or gas to generate heat, they use nuclear fission reactions. In most cases, heat from the nuclear reactions convert water into steam, which drives turbines that produce electricity. There are different kinds, or isotopes, of uranium, and the type used in nuclear power plants is called uranium-235, because these atoms are easiest to split in two. Because uranium-235 is quite rare, making up less than 1% of natural uranium, it has to be enriched until the fuel contains 2-3%. Inside a nuclear reactor, rods of uranium are arranged in bundles and immersed in a giant, pressurised water tank. When the reactor is running, high-speed particles called neutrons strike the uranium atoms and cause them to split in a process known as nuclear fission. The process releases a lot of energy and more neutrons, which go on to split other uranium atoms, triggering a chain reaction. The energy heats up the water, which is piped out to a steam generator. To make sure the power plant does not overheat, control rods made of a material that absorbs neutrons are lowered into the reactor. The whole reactor is encased in a thick concrete shield, which prevents radiation escaping into the environment. In Britain, nuclear power stations provide 19% of our electricity and account for 3.5% of our total energy use. All but one of those reactors are due to close down by 2023. Some groups oppose nuclear power stations because they produce radioactive waste and could release radioactive material if there was an accident. But nuclear power plants do not release greenhouse gases, which cause coal and gas-fired power plants to contribute to global warming. Without nuclear power stations, UK's carbon emissions would be 5% to 12% higher than they are. In 1957, the world's first nuclear power accident occurred at Windscale in west Cumbria. A fire in the reactor caused a release of radioactivity, which led to a ban on milk sales from nearby farms. The site was later renamed Sellafield. Modern reactors are designed to shut down automatically. The worst nuclear power accident in history took place in Chernobyl in 1986 when a reactor there exploded, killing tens of people instantly and exposing hundreds of thousands more to radiation. In January, the government reaffirmed its plans to expand nuclear power in Britain to help it meet stringent targets to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Nuclear weapons There are two main types of nuclear weapon: atomic bombs, which are powered by fission reactions similar to those in nuclear reactors, and hydrogen bombs, which derive their explosive power from fusion reactions. The first atomic bomb was produced at Los Alamos National Laboratory in America under the Manhattan Project at the end of the second world war. An atomic bomb uses conventional explosives to slam together two lumps of fissionable material, usually uranium-235 or plutonium-239. This creates what is known as a critical mass of nuclear material, which releases its energy instantaneously as atoms inside it split in an uncontrolled chain reaction. Atomic bombs unleash enormous shock waves and high levels of neutron and gamma radiation. In atomic bombs, uranium is enriched much more than fuel, to about 85% uranium-235. On August 6 1945, an atomic bomb called Little Boy was dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, followed three days later by another, called Fat Man, on Nagasaki. Hydrogen, or thermonuclear bombs, work in almost the opposite way to atomic bombs. Much of their explosive power comes from fusing together hydrogen atoms to form heavier helium atoms, which releases far more energy than a fission bomb. Two types, or isotopes, of hydrogen are used - deuterium and tritium. A deuterium atom is the same as a hydrogen atom, except the former has an extra neutron in its nucleus. A tritium atom has two extra neutrons. A hydrogen bomb has a built-in atomic bomb, which is needed to trigger the fusion reaction. Hydrogen bombs have never been used in war and are thousands of times more powerful than atomic bombs. The first test of a hydrogen bomb was at Enewatak, an atoll in the Pacific Ocean. It released a three mile-wide fireball and a mushroom cloud that rose to nearly 60,000 feet, destroying an island in the process. Nuclear waste One of the biggest problems the nuclear industry faces is what to do with the radioactive waste it produces. Some of it will remain radioactive and hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years. High-level waste is the most dangerous because it can melt through containers and is so radioactive it would be fatal if someone was near it for a few days. This type of waste makes up just 0.3% of Britain's total volume of nuclear waste, which is mostly waste from spent fuel rods. The largest amounts of radioactive waste are made up of nuclear fuel cases, reactor components and uranium. Today, high-level waste is dealt with by cooling it in water for several years and then mixing it into a molten glass, which is poured into steel containers. These canisters are then stored in a concrete-lined building. This is only a temporary measure, though. Scientists know that eventually they need to find a way of storing nuclear waste safely for thousands of years. Some countries, such as America and Finland, plan to store nuclear waste in deep underground bunkers. For this to be safe, scientists have to be sure the material could never leak out and contaminate water supplies or rise up to the surface. Britain already has more than 100,000 tonnes of higher activity radioactive waste that needs to be stored. Large amounts of low-level waste are already stored in concrete vaults in Drigg in Cumbria. Other plans for disposing of nuclear waste have included dumping it at sea and blasting it into space."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/apr/25/arriva-deutsche-bahn-takeover-rules","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-24T23:05:35Z","webTitle":"Britain's assets are slowly being nationalised - unfortunately, by other countries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/apr/25/arriva-deutsche-bahn-takeover-rules","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/apr/25/arriva-deutsche-bahn-takeover-rules","fields":{"headline":"Britain's assets are slowly being nationalised, unfortunately not by us","bodyText":"It is not necessary to be a raving protectionist to feel a sense of absurdity at the takeover of bus and train operator Arriva by German state-owned train company Deutsche Bahn. The UK's mania for privatisation of industries such as rail, nuclear and utilities has led to important British assets being nationalised by a foreign government. EDF, a French state company, owns nuclear power group British Energy, along with several local electricity franchises; the Dutch state railway owns chunks of our network, German state telecoms company Deutsche Telekom bought T-Mobile in the UK and Deutsche Post has a licence to deliver letters here. Then there are the sovereign wealth funds controlled by foreign governments, which bought chunks of Barclays Bank, P&amp;O's ports and Manchester City football club. This may not be a terrible thing. It may even be a good thing – the French government will probably do a better job of running nuclear power than ours. But these takeovers are too important to be waved through - and the situation is asymmetric. We did not use our North Sea oil revenues to create a sovereign wealth fund of our own; state-owned British firms are not on shopping sprees, and our open door policy towards bids is not replicated in Paris, Berlin, or even Washington DC. I have been arguing for several years that there needs to be a public debate on foreign takeovers – a lonely view until US company Kraft's takeover of British chocolate-maker Cadbury brought the issue centre stage. Support is gathering for a tightening of takeover rules. The Tories are quiet on the subject but Labour and the Liberal Democrats want to lock short-term investors out of the voting, so firms cannot be bought and sold at the behest of hedge funds. The Lib Dems want to subject takeovers to a public interest test on whether a deal would serve the UK economy. Even bosses' club the Institute of Directors has joined in, backing Labour's manifesto proposal to introduce a \"Cadbury rule\" so hostile takeovers can only go through on a \"super-majority\" of two thirds of shareholders in the target. The captains of industry actually go further, and say the higher threshold should apply to the bidder as well. A major motivator for takeovers is the rewards they decant into boardrooms, legal firms, investment banks and PR advisers. The incentives in the top ranks of a target company are stacked towards succumbing to a hostile bidder, after racking up the price. In the case of Kraft, \"winner\" Irene Rosenfeld had a 40% pay rise to £17m last year, but \"loser\" Todd Stitzer, the former Cadbury chief executive, walked away with £40m in cash, shares and pension. The hedge funds just want a quick return and even \"long-term\" shareholders often prefer to cash out at a profit to boost their quarterly performance figures. It is not an environment conducive to the welfare of employees or pension fund members, or to the long-term interests of the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jun/24/energy-industry-efficiency-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-23T23:04:03Z","webTitle":"Chris Huhne's efficiency drive to turn wasteful houses green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/24/energy-industry-efficiency-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jun/24/energy-industry-efficiency-bills","fields":{"headline":"Chris Huhne's efficiency drive to turn wasteful houses green","bodyText":"Chris Huhne will promise today to put a £90bn domestic energy efficiency programme at the heart of the government's agenda saying that thousands of jobs will be created as 14m houses are given a complete overhaul to drastically cut energy demand, reduce power bills and lower carbon emissions. New legislation to enable the mass retro-fitting of homes will allow energy companies, local authorities and even high street stores to spend as much as £6,500 insulating millions of Britain's most energy-wasteful homes. The money spent would be claimed back from savings made in bills with householders not having to pay anything directly. The Energy and Climate Change Secretary will tell today's Economist UK Energy Summit that energy efficiency will help drive economic recovery. \"The market is big. There are up to 14m homes in the UK which could benefit. We are working on the package for each home, which could unlock tens of billions of spending over many years. \"Energy saving is the cheapest way of closing the gap between demand and supply, yet it is the Cinderella of the energy ball. At the moment, we may as well be burning £50 notes outside our front doors. We use more energy per home than does Sweden. And the waste from this sector cannot be ignored, because households account for a quarter of all carbon emissions,\" he will say. \"The Green Deal\", which Huhne hopes will be extended to small businesses later, will be the Department of Energy's main bill for the first session of parliament. In an interview with the Guardian, Huhne accepted that the fuel-poor, and those in hard-to-heat homes lacking cavity walls – would need extra help because energy savings alone would not be enough. \"We intend to provide that help by refocusing the obligations on energy companies. Local authorities could also join with energy companies to reach those who live in houses that need it most; insulation measures are often cheaper if implemented a street at a time. And we are planning to strengthen the government's powers to target energy insulation measures on the highest priority cases\", he said. The government believes that the initiative will largely be in the hands of private sector companies but not necessarily just traditional energy firms such as British Gas or EDF. \"A competitive market will provide best value and confidence in products for the customer. With professional marketing from trusted brands, we ought to make energy efficiency as attractive as broadband or satellite TV,\" said Huhne. \"And the Green Deal – by tying energy saving to the people who pay the energy bills – will be a breakthrough not just for owners but for tenants as well. We are also looking at whether it could apply to businesses. To sustain the market on the long march to a comprehensive refit of our housing stock, we are looking at triggers and incentives to encourage demand.\" The UK also needed investment in its energy generating infrastructure, Huhne said, about £200bn in the next 10 years. \"There is a massive need to replace assets, old coal plants and nuclear stations. The great prize for us as a society is that we can move to a position where we are much less threatened by geopolitics and price hikes. Investing in renewables will insulate the economy,\" he said. But Huhne, a Liberal Democrat who has dismissed nuclear power as a \"dead end\", warned the nuclear industry that there would be no subsidies for its power and that there would have to be proper accounting of its costs. He rejected claims by independent analysts this week that government would subsidise the industry by leaving the public to pick up much of the bill for handling the nuclear waste. \"Absolutely not. There has got to be a proper asking of what the real costs [of nuclear] are. The truth is what nuclear operators want is certainty and these [costs] are relatively small,\" he said. The Conservative-LibDem coalition agreement makes a commitment to a new fleet of nuclear power stations, while allowing LibDems to oppose the plan. Hunhe also saw a role for coal in electricity generation – albeit through cleaner power stations equipped with carbon capture and storage mechanisms that bury pollution underground, which has been derided by some as untested, expensive and unsafe. \"An absolutely key low carbon source is going to be carbon capture and storage from coal and possibly gas because we will need 'swing' production. The great thing about wind is that once it is up and running – especially onshore – it is extremely economical but is intermittent and raises that nightmare of the calm cold winter day when there is absolutely no wind but everyone wants their heating on. \"In those circumstances you need swing capacity to meet peak demand and realistically I can't see that coming from anywhere else except carbon capture and storage from coal and gas.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/nov/07/barack-obama-india-visit","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-07T10:47:04Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama urges India to redouble peace efforts with Pakistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/07/barack-obama-india-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/nov/07/barack-obama-india-visit","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama urges India to redouble peace efforts with Pakistan","bodyText":"Barack Obama urged India today to strengthen peace efforts with Pakistan after relations dived following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. \"My hope is that over time, trust develops between the two countries, that dialogue begins, perhaps on less controversial issues, building up to more controversial issues,\" Obama told a meeting of students at a college in Mumbai. \"There are more Pakistanis who've been killed by terrorists inside Pakistan than probably anywhere else.\" While Obama's visit is mainly about boosting trade with India, the issue of regional stability in South Asia dominated the student meeting. Obama answered a range of questions at St Xavier College, a Jesuit institution. When a young woman challenged him on US support of Pakistan, Obama said: \"I must admit I expected [that question].\" India blames Pakistan for backing militants and claims that elements within Pakistan were behind the Mumbai attacks in 2008, when Pakistan-based gunmen killed 166 people. Obama and his wife, Michelle, arrived yesterday in Mumbai on the first leg of a 10-day tour of Asia to boost American trade and to consolidate ties with key regional allies. Obama yesterday paid tribute to those killed in the Mumbai attacks at the Taj Mahal hotel. \"We will never forget,\" Obama said at a memorial. The Obamas stayed at the Taj Mahal hotel before flying to Delhi. An entire floor has been reserved for the couple and all 570 rooms booked for their security team and entourage, which includes investors and trade officials. Around 10,000 Indian security personnel have been deployed for the visit. Last night, the president addressed an audience of top Indian business people in Mumbai . The White House, keenly aware of the role that the fragile American economy played in last week's poor midterm election results for the Democrats, has been keen to underline the economic gains the trip is expected to bring for America. US firms will finalise deals worth around $10bn (£6bn) with India that will support 54,000 jobs back home, a senior White House aide, Michael Froman, told reporters. Some 20 deals are in the pipeline, including an engine contract for General Electric and a $2.7bn commission for passenger aircraft from Boeing for one of India's fast-expanding private airlines. However, the $4.5bn sale by Boeing of C-17 military transport planes is still being negotiated. George W Bush, during the last visit by an American president in 2006, controversially blessed India's civil nuclear power programme. Few expect the same kind of breakthrough this time. But no one predicts an upset either. \"At the end it will look good. The Indians understand they need to be seen to be helping the US with some decent economic deals. Obama understands he needs to reassure India that the momentum in relations generated by Bush is still there,\" said C Raja Mohan, an Indian academic and foreign policy analyst. The economic emphasis has disappointed some in Delhi. Indian diplomats are looking for signs of a new US strategic vision for South Asia that would give them a central role to counterbalance China. American officials have restricted themselves to noting the \"emergence\" of India and its middle class, and observing that \"regional dynamics will change fast\" in coming years. US diplomats last week restated their desire for measures ranging from reforms of ownership regulations to changes in intellectual property law, which would ease access to Indian markets for US firms. Indian hopes for the waiving of restrictions on the transfer of US technology to government bodies working on space research or nuclear technology seem likely to be fulfilled. The White House is also likely to support Indian membership of four key global nuclear nonproliferation regimes. \"We will end up treating India similar to other close allies and partners other than as a country of concern,\" Froman said. But there is unlikely to be an explicit statement backing India's bid for permanent membership of the UN security council. In Delhi, as well as a visit to a Mughal-era Islamic tomb, an address to parliament and a state dinner, Obama will meet Manmohan Singh, the 78-year-old Indian prime minister, and Sonia Gandhi, the head of the Congress party.

While this is certainly true for some industries, others, such as construction and manufacturing, continued to recruit and train apprentices, although perhaps on a smaller scale. The last few years, however, have seen a massive resurgence in apprenticeships. There are now more than 200 different kinds, including many new areas such as creative and digital media, telesales and youth work. Since the coalition government came to power in May 2010, it has invested heavily in apprenticeships, upping the annual spend of £1.3bn to more than £1.4bn for the next financial year – enough to train 360,000 apprentices. And it is not just investing in training for young people; funding for 50,000 additional adult apprenticeships was announced in the budget, earlier this year. But David Way, chief operating officer at the National Apprenticeship Service, points out that increased government investment is not the only reason for the apprenticeship boom. Backing and commitment from employers is also vital. \"You have to remember that these opportunities are created by employers and there's not a lot of point in stoking up lots of interest from individuals if we haven't got the apprenticeship vacancies for them to go into. So there has to be work on both sides.\" Changes to the higher education landscape may also have a part to play. University tuition fees are due to rise from next autumn and, with institutions set to charge up to £9,000 a year, many school leavers are exploring the alternatives. Higher-level qualifications Apprenticeships offer the opportunity to earn and learn on the job, which can be very attractive to young people concerned about running up student debt. At the same time, young people want to ensure there are opportunities for progression. \"What they are very keen to avoid is going into cul-de-sacs,\" says Way. By this he means the perception that there is a \"glass ceiling\" in the apprenticeship route, with few opportunities to take qualifications beyond level 3 (A-level equivalent). In reality, there are various routes to progress to higher-level apprenticeships and qualifications including foundation degrees (which combine academic learning with practical skills and can be topped up to a degree at a later date), higher national certificates (HNCs) and higher national diplomas (HNDs). The recently published higher education white paper promised to create more flexibility in degree-level study, including sandwich and part-time courses, and distance and e-learning, which should make it easier for apprentices to build on existing qualifications. And the government has recently announced its intention to fund 10,000 advanced and higher apprenticeships with the aim of giving firms in sectors such as advanced manufacturing, information technology and engineering the hi-tech skills they need to grow. Many big employers, such as KPMG and BT, already offer opportunities for those on apprenticeships or school-leavers' programmes to progress to higher-level qualifications, so the £25m higher apprenticeships fund is particularly aimed at encouraging small and medium-sized businesses to take on more higher apprentices. But getting people to recognise that a higher-level apprenticeship can be equivalent to a degree and lead to comparable – and possibly even better – salaries and career progression is one of the biggest challenges facing the government. Graham Hoyle, chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers points out that competition for apprenticeship schemes with the better-known, blue-chip companies such as British Aerospace can be as tough as for an Oxbridge place. But, he says, the reality is that \"most apprenticeships are in ones and twos with more companies, and operate on an informal basis\", and finding employers to take on all those who want to be apprentices can be hard. Although still in the early stages, there are ambitious plans to increase the prestige of apprenticeships. Earlier this year, a scheme backed by the National Union of Students, the education charity Edge and various employer organisations was launched, offering discounts in high-street shops and other student-style benefits for apprentices. And the government plans to create a Royal Society of Apprentices to promote apprenticeships in colleges and schools, lobby on issues that affect apprentices and help members join other industry-based societies. Meanwhile, City &amp; Guilds has launched a campaign to help ensure a million new people start an apprenticeship by September 2013. Known as Million Extra, the initiative will offer support and information to help employers, learners and training providers access apprenticeships. Supplying more information about apprenticeships is vital, says Nick Gooderson, head of standards and qualifications at CITB-Construction Skills – the sector skills council for construction. \"I was recently invited to a roundtable event by the Chartered Institute of Building where there were lots of schoolchildren. I was amazed at how little they knew about apprenticeships.\" Way says this is not surprising, adding that the information young people are getting – or perhaps not getting – from parents and teachers can shape their views about apprenticeships. \"When you talk to people of a certain age about apprenticeships, most of their knowledge can be based on their experience when they were 17 or 18. So they think of apprenticeships as just being in engineering, construction and maybe hairdressing.\" But there is a strong appetite for vocational opportunities, he says, recalling a talk he gave at an all-girls' school with a young female apprentice from Jaguar Land Rover. \"When we got there, they [the pupils] knew nothing about apprenticeships, but by the time the apprentice had spoken to them they were all really keen and asking questions like what kind of car she had. There is something really powerful about meeting someone who is an apprentice, seeing how much they are enjoying it and getting on in the world.\" The good news is that schools are becoming much more open to vocational skills and careers, says John Watkins, director of learning and development at the accountancy firm PKF, which offers approximately 25 jobs to school leavers each year and funds their AAT (the professional body for accounting staff) qualification. \"Schools are definitely more open to having companies like ours go along and talk to their kids about opportunities, whereas in the past they were really set on trying to get as many kids as possible into university.\" Training at Honda: motoring ahead I've always been fascinated by cars, and from an early age I was interested in learning everything about them. My parents say I was so keen to find out how things worked, I dismantled everything in the house. After GCSEs, I started A-levels but soon realised it wasn't the right path for me. I left school and applied for an apprenticeship with my local Honda dealer in Chelmsford in Essex. After a challenging assessment process, I was delighted to be offered the job on a salary of about £450 a month. Honda has its own training institute near Slough in Berkshire so, during my three-year apprenticeship, I worked at the dealership for four to five weeks, then did a week's residential training. I was 17 when I started at Honda, so the experience of being away from home really helped me grow up. As well as technical training, Honda apprentices do a personal development training programme that includes first aid, customer care and speed awareness, which was really useful. I did so well in my apprenticeship that I was given the opportunity to progress on to level 4 and 5 qualifications (equivalent to degree level). My progress has been helped enormously by taking part in both Honda and national skills competitions. I've also been selected to represent my country at the international skills competition WorldSkills London 2011, which is being held in October. There are three levels of technician at Honda – maintenance, diagnostic and master. I'm a diagnostic technician, but my training for WorldSkills means I am already working beyond master level. There are about 400 diagnostic and 60 master technicians at Honda, which shows how far I've come. I'm 22 now and when I compare myself with friends who chose the university route, I'm streets ahead. Last year, I earned about £29,000 with bonuses. I've also bought my own house and car. In the long term I'd love to train apprentices, design cars or even own my own garage. But for the time being, I'm happy to focus on developing my skills to the highest level. Nothing satisfies me more than when a car has a fault and I can work out a way to repair it. • John Couldridge is a diagnostic technician at Glyn Hopkin Honda in Chelmsford. He will be representing the UK in automobile technology at WorldSkills London 2011 Independent salon: a cut above the rest I started off as an apprentice hairdresser 23 years ago, so when I started my own salon with my wife Sara, seven years ago, I was keen to train as many staff on the job as possible. We have about 35 staff, many of whom are working towards a range of qualifications. At any one time, we can have as many as nine apprentices working with us, at different stages of their training. Typically, our apprentices spend the best part of a day at Gloucestershire College. Staff there are really good at accommodating our business needs and stagger training days so we don't have too many assistants out at the same time. It can vary, but most apprentices take about 18 months to two years to complete their initial training. It usually takes about eight months to see a real return on your investment, at which point the apprentices have received enough training to start taking on basic responsibilities. But even new apprentices can add to your business, offering far more than just sweeping up or making tea. At college they learn about things such as retailing, so they often have good ideas about marketing and improving customer service. The other benefit is that they are networking with staff from other salons at college, which can be good for keeping up with the latest developments in the industry. The benefit of growing your own talent through apprenticeships is that you have total control from day one. We have recruited staff with NVQ level 2 [the basic level of hairdressing], some of whom have paid thousands of pounds to train with big hairdressing chains, and they haven't quite been up to scratch. We've ended up spending six months getting them up to standard, which can be costly in the long run. As well as the college training, all our apprentices get an additional half day in‑house training each week, which means we can make sure they are absolutely tip-top in everything. Of course, there is always the risk that you will invest in training someone, only to have them move on once they are qualified, but many do stay and the benefits definitely outweigh the downsides. • Stuart Holmes owns the Stuart Holmes Hair &amp; Beauty Spa in Gloucester, which has been recognised as one of the Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers, supported by NAS and City &amp; Guilds EDF energy: going nuclear In the past, each of EDF Energy's eight nuclear power stations trained their own apprentices, working in partnership with local providers. This meant there were differences in the levels of training at each location, so, three years ago, we entered into a partnership with the Royal Navy's training partner VT Flagship to provide residential training for all our apprentices. Now they do their training at HMS Sultan in Portsmouth where there are many fantastic resources, including training rigs, pumps, valves and heart exchangers – all the kinds of things they'd get on a real power station. We now have about 250 apprentices at different stages of a four-year apprenticeship. All of the trainees complete a level 3 (equivalent to A-level) qualification in engineering and the most academically capable can progress to qualifications such as the higher national certificate (HNC) or a foundation degree if they wish. Being based away from home and living at HMS Collingwood in Portsmouth helps our apprentices mature more quickly and become independent learners. We look for 16- to 25-year-olds with a minimum of grade C in GCSE maths, English and a couple of science subjects. Roughly a third are school leavers, while others have been working or studying for a while. We're getting more and more trainees who say they are put off by the idea of university debt and want to earn as they learn. Salaries range from £8,900 in the first year of training to approximately £17,100 by the fourth year, and EDF Energy pays for apprentices' accommodation and meals, as well as a number of journeys home each year. Because EDF Energy is a worldwide company, there are also opportunities for our apprentices to travel, including visits to power stations in France, Spain, Luxembourg and Hungary. It is widely documented that the civil nuclear workforce is an ageing one, so training the next generation of technicians on the job makes sense. EDF Energy is planning to build four new power stations – two at Hinkley in Somerset and two at Sizewell in Suffolk – which could create thousands of new jobs. Our apprentices pick up the right skills and an understanding of the business very quickly. We can then mould them into what we want as a workforce. We have a number of ex-apprentices in management roles. With the right behaviour, vision and drive there are no limits to how far our apprentices can go in the organisation. • Ian Williams is EDF Energy apprentice manager.

Yet the situation at Fukushima remains catastrophic. Three reactors have been breached along with their containment vessels, and are leaking radioactive material into the environment. Eighty-thousand hectares of adjacent country have been rendered uninhabitable. Dangerous levels of radioactivity have been recorded in soils, groundwater, vegetables, milk and drinking water up to 100km from the plant. Japanese schoolchildren are being exposed to radiation levels over the limits set for European nuclear workers. Clouds of radioactive iodine, caesium, xenon and other elements are streaming across the Pacific and raining down on North America, western Europe and ultimately the entire northern hemisphere. Even if this nightmare were to end tomorrow, its human, environmental and economic costs would be incalculable. One has only to look at Belarus, where maternity hospitals in some towns outside the Chernobyl exclusion zone are recording birth abnormalities at rates of 85%, to get a sense of the tragedy that is unfolding. But there is no end in sight. The recent admission by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) that at least one of the plant's reactors has undergone a total meltdown has put paid to its claim that it would achieve cold shutdown at the plant in six to nine months. Some experts believe it could take decades to get the situation under control. Until then, deadly radioactive materials will continue to poison the ocean, land and atmosphere. Further critical states or hydrogen explosions could send massive plumes of radioactivity over inhabited areas, including Tokyo. This is not just Japan's problem; it is an international emergency. I urge Japan to request major international assistance with tackling the crisis, since Tepco and the Japanese government are inadequate to the task. I also urge the international community to take immediate steps to put the global nuclear power industry into cold shutdown, and to consign this ill-conceived and genocidal technology to the dustbin of industrial history. Martin Hawes Abels Bay, Tasmania, Australia Rose-tinted gardens Your book review of The Founding Gardeners certainly sees the white American gentlemen farmers through rose-tinted glasses (The patriotism of planting, 22 April). What is missing is the historical scholarship on the usual frontier myths about the \"land without people\" – for it was the aboriginal people who had long cultivated these \"new food crops\", and it was not Lewis and Clark who first discovered the marvellous \"new species\" of plants. The US had many people, and Thomas Jefferson was a strong advocate of transplanting or removing them – a method now called ethnic cleansing. And it is untrue that Jefferson was a \"sturdy small landholder\" of fine moral character, who actually dug in the soil; he owned 700 slaves and it is likely that it was African slaves who did the digging and planting. This encomium attributes the early American cultivation of useful and lucrative plants to the founding fathers' revolutionary spirit and ideals, the striving for independence from the old British ways. Could it also be the beginnings of the spirit of industrial agriculture and green revolutions that continue to rob the small farmers and the poor people of the world of land and healthy food? Or could the gentlemen farmers' attempt to defy perceptions of American species as \"inherently weaker, smaller or shorter-lived\" be an expression of the phallic narcissism that later emerges in the sadistic military-industrial complex? Not such a rosy picture. Judy Deutsch Toronto, Canada Women correspondents Annalena McAfee's fine Women on the frontline (13 May) had one notable omission, the British-born Freda Utley (1899-1978), who reported for The News Chronicle in 1938 on the war in China, and wrote several books on east-Asian affairs. More to the point here, she criticised the Soviet Union at a time when it was distinctly unfashionable to do so. She married a Soviet citizen in 1928, immigrated to the USSR in 1930, and lived for five and a half years in Moscow. In 1936 her husband was arrested – like millions of others, for no good reason – and sentenced to five years in prison. Utley left shortly after with her baby son to mobilise support abroad. Her harrowing The Dream We Lost. Soviet Russia then and now (1940) was rejected by her publisher (Faber &amp; Faber); later, The Friends of the Soviet Union in the US began a four-year campaign for her deportation. However, in his Memoirs (1956) Count Michel Károlyi, former president of the republic of Hungary, then exiled in London and long a convinced socialist, described how struck he was by Utley's reporting on \"the admiration which the Soviets felt for Hitlerism and [that] it was probable that the two dictators would become allies\". Indeed, a few days later, the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact was signed (23 August 1939), following which Moscow urged communist parties in the west to encourage workers to sabotage war-production, and thus fight against \"democratic plutocracy\". It was the beginning of Károlyi's disillusion with Stalinism. Freda Utley took what was then the courageous step of renouncing her long-time belief in communism, at a time when many influential intellectuals in Britain and North America enjoyed the luxury of having it both ways, \"be both secure (by not joining the party) and 'progressive' by joining hands with the communists in popular fronts against fascism\". Why her book encountered their hostility was made clear even by an old family friend, George Bernard Shaw, who wrote (on 8 July 1937) to assure her that her husband was at no risk, because \"imprisonment under the Soviet Union is not as bad as it is here in the west\". Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been a revival of interest in Utley's work. One hopes that it will include her Will the Middle East Go West? (1957). Kenneth McRobbie Vancouver, BC, Canada Use real dictionaries Henry Hitchings says \"The internet is the future of lexicography\" (Slang meets its match, Learning English, 13 May). As a translator, I use online dictionaries, but they will never replace physical dictionaries, because I can trawl books and they lead me on a fascinating language journey. For example: unsure of how to spell the word \"pistachio\", I looked it up in my OED, I came across the French phrase pis aller (the worst that can be). Knowing the Turkish word pis, I checked it in my Oxford Turkish/English Dictionary. It means \"dirty, foul, obscene\", but while I was looking for it I came across the word pisi, which is a childish word for cat, as in pussycat. This led me to consider how the word \"pussy\" came into the English language. The OED says it is a nursery name for a cat and came into the language in 1605, and is of unknown origin. Up to now, such a journey is not possible using online dictionaries, because they don't give you chance to be sidelined. I'm not going to throw out my physical dictionaries any time soon. Felicity Oliver Ostermundigen, Switzerland Briefly • Reading the article dealing with the unpopularity of the proposed carbon tax in Australia, it is most disappointing to note that perhaps the most important detail is omitted (6 May). The prime minister, Julia Gillard, categorically declared just a few days before the recent election that there would be no carbon tax under her government. Had she not done so, it is almost certain that she would be the leader of the opposition instead of the leader of a minority government with the support of a handful of minor party members of parliament, some of who dictate much of government policy.

But the era of Christiania (13 May) was also about living ideas. We knew, at least, that if we wanted to change our thinking, we had to change our lives. I spent about six months at Christania in the early 70s and eventually became a philosophy professor. I often wonder why what was so clear to us then is such a hard idea academically: that we have to transform our mind and lives if we want to catch a glimpse of a better world.

Anyone who has enjoyed drama in the intervening 70 years will have been touched by his work for radio, television, film and stage, which included a Bafta-nominated adaptation of Mary Wesley's The Camomile Lawn for Channel 4 (1992), the 1983 BBC version of Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, a 1975 adaptation of Muriel Spark's The Girls of Slender Means and the 1964 teleplay The Devil and John Brown, for which he won the Writers' Guild award. Perhaps his biggest success was The Jewel in the Crown, the 1984 Granada television mini-series based upon the Raj Quartet novels by Paul Scott, which earned him an Emmy nomination and the writer of the year award from the Royal Television Society. I was asked to look at the role of Ronald Merrick in The Jewel in the Crown in 1981, and worked my way through the huge pile of scripts adapted by Ken from Scott's astonishing books, which I knew and loved. I was aware of Ken by reputation, but I was apprehensive. The books present enormous challenges to the adapter. I realised quite soon that I was in good hands. Not only had Ken sorted out the books' jigsaw of events, he had achieved narrative chronology without losing the story's power. He also captured the psychological complexities of character in which Scott's books abound. Almost impossibly, he had woven in some of the central images: fire is very important; so is the notion of black and white, light and dark, good and evil. In Ken's hands, these threads acquired a thematic weight that gave the dramatisation real depth. The sense of mystery and suspense which the books engender had also been preserved – a mystery which is drawn partly from India itself (where Ken served as an RAF radio operator in 1941, at around the time the books are set in) and partly from the unravelling of the dark heart of Scott's story. The producer/director Chris Morahan invited me to meet Ken in the company of The Jewel in the Crown's co-director, Jim O'Brien. Ken seemed a little tense. I later realised that this was just \"him\" – taut, concentrated, eager – but he put me at my ease, and asked me if I thought there was anything missing from his adaptation. From well over 1,000 pages, I had found only two details. Discussing one of them – the snake in the bath – Ken picked the relevant script from the pile, flicked the glasses which he always wore up on to his forehead, held the page close, and examined it fixedly. It was quintessential Ken, subjecting the material to an intense scrutiny. His eye had peered thus at the whole of Scott's mighty Quartet. My favourite scene from Jewel is when Barbie Batchelor (Peggy Ashcroft) finds Mabel Layton (Fabia Drake) dozing over a book. She gently removes her glasses, but Mabel wakes and invites her to talk. Touched, Barbie sits on the bed and chatters. Mabel eventually says: \"I am ready for the light now.\" Barbie switches it off. Mabel goes into the dark. I scoured the books in order to enjoy this scene again, but could not find the dialogue. The scene was there, of course, but an indication of the sheer brilliance of Ken's work was that I had mistaken his writing for Scott's original. Ken was born in Bolton, the seventh son of a Lancashire cotton-mill owner, and was sent to Gresham's school, Norfolk, where he discovered drama. But the sight of the many unemployed, idle in the streets, sparked a lifelong political conscience. He delayed a place at Cambridge in order to fight nazism, so it is hardly surprising that, when he was able to concentrate on writing, his plays dealt with serious issues. After the second world war, Ken studied theatre direction at the Old Vic theatre school. His first marriage, to Elizabeth Tillotson, led to a daughter, Pamela, but they subsequently divorced. In 1950, working for the Under Thirty Theatre Group, he met Jill Black, whom he married in 1953 and with whom he had three children, Matthew, Vikki and Simon. All four children grew up together in Cornwall and London. In 1951 Ken was co-founder of the Leatherhead theatre (I joked once that he must have had a day off from writing), but this was a rich time for television writers and he was lured into the \"mid-Atlantic market\". The arrival of commercial television in the UK in the mid-1950s provided new opportunities, and Ken made a formidable name for himself as a writer of gritty, kitchen-sink drama. He first worked with Morahan in 1961 on a television drama, The Long Distance Blue, starring Tom Bell, and again, in 1962, on Ken's play The Slaughter Men, which gave James Bolam his first starring role. Sydney Newman, then BBC head of drama, commissioned Ken to write a trilogy of plays at the launch of BBC2 in 1964 – The Seekers. Another trilogy, The Magicians, soon followed. Ken later remarked that by this time, he had said everything he wanted to say as an original writer, which was partly why he turned to fact-based drama in his search for an understanding of the human condition: the suffragettes, the French revolution, Auschwitz, a Scottish collier trapped by a pit-fall. The Poisoning of Charles Bravo (1977) dramatised a famous Victorian mystery and was later adapted for the stage. His many adaptations plundered the work of (among others) Somerset Maugham, HG Wells, Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen and DH Lawrence. Ken was rare in that he wrote wonderful parts for women throughout his career. He preferred the company of women and believed that \"the human race ... must give way to the female instincts of nurturing ... if we are to have the smallest hope of surviving\". His own efforts to help us survive were directed against the building of a nuclear power station near his home in Cornwall (he was successful), and turning a local sand-extraction plant into a nature reserve – a wonderful, real memorial to stand alongside his dramatic legacy. Jill was by his side at the end. He is also survived by his four children, seven grandchildren and a great-grandchild. Christopher Morahan writes: Ken was a clever, compassionate writer and never once did his selfless talents distort the humanity of his vision and his loyalty to his material. The process of adaptation, of telling stories for a visual and popular medium is complex, requiring modesty, sympathy and intellectual rigour in discerning meanings and intentions. The adapter has to be both loyal and creative. Often we are not aware of the liberties that can be taken, not to satisfy the individuality of the adapter, but to illuminate the intention of the original. From The Jewel in the Crown, I recall in particular the scene beside Mabel's grave between Barbie and a small Indian child, entirely of Ken's invention, inserted late in the production because both Jim O'Brien and I realised we had not given full richness to Barbie's story. The scene was entirely Ken's invention, yet utterly true to Scott. The list of his superlative writing for women includes his memorable portraits of the Pankhurst family in Shoulder to Shoulder (1974), for which he wrote three scripts, catching the spirit of the times – both of the story and the 1970s when they were written. Finally, the world of Una, the 16-year-old in his last adaptation, Rumer Godden's Peacock Spring (1996), who is beguiled, betrayed and abandoned by India, is very touching. I speak with some authority, because I directed it and cast my daughter Hattie in the part. I had no doubts because I trusted the truth of the writing, Ken's compassion and honesty. • Kenneth Heywood Taylor, screenwriter, born 10 November 1922; died 17 April 2011"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2010/jul/19/international-power-merger-talks","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-19T07:37:55Z","webTitle":"International Power talks to test coalition stance on foreign takeovers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/19/international-power-merger-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/jul/19/international-power-merger-talks","fields":{"headline":"International Power talks to test coalition stance on foreign takeovers","bodyText":"International Power has reopened talks with France's GDF Suez about a possible multi-billion pound tie-up between the two power companies. Under the terms of the deal being discussed, GDF would become a majority shareholder in International Power, which runs six power plants in Britain and produces electricity for more than 4m households. Both companies would merge their international operations outside Europe as well as certain assets in the UK and Turkey to create an enlarged International Power that would be listed on the London Stock Exchange – a reverse takeover of International Power. Shares in International Power rose 10% in early trading to 345.8p, valuing the company at just under £5.3bn. A takeover by the French group would test the new coalition government's attitude to the takeover of British companies by foreign rivals following the public outcry over Kraft's swoop on Cadbury this year. It also poses questions about the security of the UK's energy supplies as GDF is 35% owned by the French government. International Power's plants would be the latest in a string of British infrastructure assets to enter foreign hands. The Office of Fair Trading announced in May that it was launching a comprehensive stock-take of the country's economic infrastructure, to investigate whether consumers are being ripped off as many of these businesses have changed owner in the past decade. Many utility companies are now owned by foreign groups. Few of the UK's household energy suppliers – Centrica and Scottish and Southern Energy – remain in British ownership, just over a decade after the market was opened up to full competition. Almost half of all UK-listed companies targeted in takeover bids in the past two years have been bought by overseas buyers, reigniting the debate over foreign ownership of British firms. Two years ago, for instance, French energy giant EDF agreed to buy nuclear power station operator British Energy in a £12.4bn deal.

The company is a major beneficiary of a government initiative to support cutting-edge industries such as aerospace and nuclear power. Building the factories will cost Rolls-Royce £300m, with the government contributing £45m. Three of them will develop aerospace technologies. A fourth will assemble and test parts for new nuclear power stations. Sites for the four plants have not been disclosed, but they will all be in \"assisted areas\" – parts of the UK with high unemployment. Sir John Rose, chief executive of Rolls-Royce, said the firm was making \"significant investments in capability and research which reflect our commitment to continue to invest in the future of our business, even at this stage in the economic cycle.\" The firm is also extending its plant in Barnoldswick, Lancashire, so that it can supply parts for the Lightning joint strike fighter – the F-35 single-engine aircraft that is meant to underpin America's future air defences. In addition to the new factories, Rolls-Royce announced two new advanced research programmes, which will investigate ways of cutting CO2 emissions from aircraft and increasing fuel efficiency. The £45m grant comes from the government's Building Britain's Future programme. The business secretary, Lord Mandelson, announced this morning that a total of £151.5m would be invested in British manufacturing. \"This practical package of measures will help equip British manufacturers of all sizes and sectors to take advantage of the advanced technologies and new market opportunities now shaping our low-carbon industrial future,\" said Mandelson. Rose said he was \"delighted\" that the government was supporting the new factories. Rolls-Royce said that the four plants would be built over the next five or six years, and would help the company fulfil its £55.5bn order book. Rolls-Royce is also building a factory in Singapore to construct fan blades used in military and commercial aircraft engines. As with the UK factories, it will receive a government grant to help with the construction costs.

But key policies need detail","bodyText":"Put blue and yellow together and you get green. Few commentators could resist the line when the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition came to power almost a year ago with the promise to be \"the greenest government ever\". The pledge came as little surprise, given the records of the party leaders: David Cameron was the first Tory leader to make the environment a core election issue when he invited people to \"vote blue, go green\", and Nick Clegg was well aware that for Lib Dem voters the environment has long been a touchstone. Nearly a year on from the election, it is far from clear that the mixing of the two parties has produced a green government. Environmental campaigners have been disappointed, business leaders have mixed views, and the government has alienated sections of green industry and spooked green investors. There has certainly been a raft of policy announcements: on a green investment bank, subsidies for domestic renewable energy, electric vehicles, high speed rail, even badgers. But while some have undoubtedly burnished the government's green credentials – the commitment to pushing Europe to a 30% emissions cut by 2020, for instance – others have been less successful. The green investment bank, which begins operations next year, was welcomed for providing £3bn in funding for green projects, but investors are disappointed that it will not issue green Isas or be able to borrow money until at least 2015. Feed-in tariffs for solar panels – where the government pays people for creating their own renewable energy – have been a resounding success, but the government now intends to cut them back, a decision that has led to legal action from solar companies. Flood defences were to be protected, Cameron had promised, but now are suffering severe budget cuts. \"It takes more than a husky ride to be a green prime minister,\" says Louise Hutchins of Greenpeace. \"This government blew the chance to create a truly effective green investment bank, it's put key environmental regulations up for review in an ill-conceived war on so-called red tape, it has proposed billions in hidden subsidies for new nuclear power stations and presided over a sharp decline in renewable energy investment while offering licences for deepwater drilling in the face of the lessons from last year's BP disaster.\" Some investors are prepared to wait and see. A prominent investment expert, who could not be named, says: \"If all current and mooted policies work as planned, I'd give them eight out of 10. If most policies deliver less than expected and one or two fail to deliver, which is a high and significant risk, I'd give them 4 or 5. They are probably on course for a lower score now.\" Perhaps the most eyecatching environmental policy so far – proposals to sell publicly owned forests in England and Wales – was also one of the biggest disasters for the coalition. When the sell-off was announced, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) was caught unprepared for the scale of opposition. Within weeks, the campaign opposing the sell-off gained enormous momentum, uniting ramblers, National Trust members and even the Socialist Workers party. The 38 Degrees website attracted more than half a million signatures for its petition to prevent the sale. The pressure, over what was only ever intended to be a policy footnote, became unbearable. Cameron ordered a stop, and Caroline Spelman, secretary of state at Defra, appeared in front of MPs to apologise and withdraw the sale. For Tom Burke, the director of the green thinktank E3G, the debacle showed the mistakes in the government's outlook. The policy was announced without any attempt to build support for it – Fiona Reynolds, director general of the National Trust, which was expected to take on the management of large swaths of heritage woodlands, heard about the policy only after it had been broadcast. Burke says: \"The government's approach to policy seems to be 'ready, fire, aim' and has not generated great headlines.\" Whitehall observers say the enthusiasm with which Spelman has wielded the axe – she offered up a 30% budget cut, the biggest of any department – could spell trouble. Though frontline services were supposed to survive, the budget cuts to flood spending have the potential to backfire – the insurance industry is already uneasy about the potential impacts. For instance, a £100m programme for the first system to defend Leeds, which has narrowly escaped inundation several times in recent years, is almost certain to be scrapped. \"Spelman doesn't give the appearance of knowing what she's doing,\" says one insider. But if Defra has attracted its share of ire, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has also suffered brickbats. The worst so far has been over feed-in tariffs. Almost 30,000 homes and businesses were fitted with solar panels last year, creating an unprecedented boom for the UK's solar industry. But to their dismay, the government abruptly announced in February that it would review tariffs across the board and slash the money for large-scale solar farms. \"This is a huge blow,\" says Mark Shorrock, founder of Low Carbon Group. \"It was totally shocking.\" Whitehall sources dismiss the complaints as whining from a small group of self-interested companies – but the problem is wider. Penny Shepherd, chief executive of UKSIF, the sustainable investment and finance association, says the abrupt change in policy means investors across the green spectrum now worry that they cannot trust the government. This \"political risk\" could deter investment, she warns. \"What confidence can investors have that policies will remain stable?\" The government has won plaudits for some policies. The renewable heat incentive provides £860m for biomass boilers, solar thermal systems and other forms of low-carbon heating, and new grants for electric vehicles are likely to spur their takeup. Having signed up to the 10:10 emissions-cutting campaign last year, the government will announce next month it has made big energy savings across the public sector, and the rejection of a third runway at Heathrow cheered green campaigners. Several big wind turbine manufacturers are planning to set up factories in the UK. James Cameron, vice-chairman of Climate Change Capital, an environmental investment group, and a member of the prime minister's Business Advisory Group, says: \"I think the UK has, in essence, become a better place for green investors. The coalition government has continued much of the previous governments policy on carbon and climate change but with a greater vigour and with more encouragement for entrepreneurs.\" However, he adds, some key policies are unclear: \"We await decisions on electricity market reform which will tell us whether there is coherence and durability in the policy system. I still think much more could be done to enable innovation in clean technology and new business models for resource efficiency to flourish.\" The Conservative MP and environmental campaigner Zac Goldsmith says: \"I would award the government a cautious seven out of 10. It kept to its promise to scrap the third runway and provide incentives for renewables. It has more or less kept to its promise to create a green investment bank, which though not as ambitious as we need it to be, is nevertheless significantly more ambitious than anyone expected it to be. There are problems in Defra though, where among other worrying signs, the agenda seems to be very much about agribusiness, and not sustainable farming.\" Internationally, the UK's stance at climate change negotiations and in pushing the EU to toughen its emissions-cutting targets have won praise. \"The UK has been in the vanguard, which is nice to see,\" says Tim Yeo, Tory MP and chairman of parliament's energy and climate committee. Some of the government's key green policies have yet to be laid out in detail. Sweeping reforms to the way the energy market is regulated, to pave the way for much greater use of renewables, are several months from being finalised. The green deal, by which householders can have their homes fitted to a high standard of energy efficiency then pay back the cost through instalments on their energy bills, will not come into force until late 2012, and ministers are confident it will be a big success. Even the green investment bank could yet change in its final form. Shepherd says: \"We will watch these policies with interest. The jury is still out.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-green-investment-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-23T10:40:47Z","webTitle":"Budget 2011: Green bank is coalition's biggest environmental test","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-green-investment-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-green-investment-bank","fields":{"headline":"Budget 2011: Green bank is coalition's biggest environmental test","bodyText":"The centrepiece of the coalition's bid to be \"the greenest government ever\" will be unveiled in George Osborne's budget on Wednesday: a green investment bank, primed to invest in low-carbon infrastructure such as renewable energy and the development of new, clean technologies. The bank has been a long time in gestation because of an almighty row within government between green enthusiasts such as the climate secretary, Chris Huhne, and the Treasury over what powers the bank should have. The result of that tug of war will be arguably the most important green measure announced by the chancellor in his speech at 12.30pm. The idea of a green bank has been enthusiastically received by green campaigners and the low-carbon technology industry. Penny Shepherd, the chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association (UKSIFA), said: \"Today, the UK is widely recognised as a global leader in green financial services. There is a real risk that our international competitiveness in this growing market will be seriously damaged if we are not seen to recognise the urgency of financing our own low-carbon transition.\" A green investment bank would be a key part of that financing, she said. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace, called the bank \"the glue that would hold together the coalition's entire green programme\". \"The keystone of the government's green investment policy must be a strong green investment bank,\" added Guy Shrubsole, of the Public Interest Research Centre (PIRC). But campaigners argue that the bank will be introduced in a form that could jeopardise some of its aims. Despite being called a bank, it will lack many of the powers that allow banks to operate – for instance, the chancellor is expected to confirm today that it will not have powers to borrow or raise money until 2015, and it will not be able to issue financial instruments, such as Isas and bonds. The £1bn initial government funding for the bank is less than environmentalists called for, and it is not yet clear what sorts of project the bank will be allowed to invest in. Would it be able to support nuclear power plants, for instance? According to the PIRC, the UK devoted £12.6bn to green investment in 2009-10, which was less than 1% of GDP and less than half of the sum it is estimated will be needed in annual investment to reform the UK's energy infrastructure and meet greenhouse gas emissions targets. (It is also, according to the PIRC, less than the amount the UK spends annually on cosmetics and perfume.) The organisation said the bank would need to be funded with £4-6bn, to be effective. But the green investment bank is likely to be capitalised with only £1bn from the government to begin with, and a further £1bn to £2bn could come from public sector asset sales. Government finance in the form of a green bank is needed to kickstart the UK's low-carbon economy, according to financial experts, because private sector banks are unwilling to take risks on new technologies and some large infrastructure projects. The backing of a government-funded bank could help to attract private sector investment, as it would remove some of the risk associated with early-stage investments. Philip Jones, investment manager at the London Pension Fund Authority, said: \"The green investment bank should be a green investment insurance operation. Unless you can insure projects, a lot of them are going to wither on the vine.\" It is unclear whether the bank will be able to act as an insurer of projects in this way. Many of the finer details of how the bank will operate will not be finalised until May. The bank has been mired in controversy since its inception, because of conflicting ideas within government of what its role should be. According to the original plans laid out by Bob Wigley, the former Merrill Lynch banker and chairman of Yell who was called in by George Osborne to lead the design, the bank should be able to raise equity, borrow money, issue bonds and sell consumers savings products that would allow them to participate in the growing green economy. But many of those plans have been whittled away. The Treasury is known to be unwilling to allow the bank too much autonomy, fearful of creating a beast it cannot control, and is insistent that the bank should remain on the government's balance sheet – an insistence that means if the bank were to borrow, that could swell the public sector deficit, though only on paper. The Treasury is firmly against swelling the deficit on any grounds, even if the increase is purely in accounting terms rather than real. After furious rows between the Treasury and other departments, the compromise reached is that the bank will not be allowed to borrow within the term of this five-year parliament, but will gain such powers from 2015. That restriction is viewed as catastrophic by some. Joan Walley, Labour MP and chair of the environmental audit committee, which published a report critical of the government's plans to curtail the role of the bank, said: \"It would be a tragedy if the green investment bank were not set up in the way that is needed to deliver the investment needed.\" Ed Matthew, the director of Transform UK, which has campaigned for a green bank, said: \"The power to borrow is what gives the green investment bank the ability to leverage in the private investment required to spark low-carbon growth and decarbonise our energy system. If they clip the wings of the green bank so it can't fly, where is the growth going to come from? Are they going to magic it out of thin air?\" He said: \"It seems extraordinary that in terms of delivering a 'budget for growth' the government can't even do something everyone wants. We are in clean-tech race with the rest of the world and the Treasury seems determined to lose.\" Tim Yeo, a Tory MP and former minister, was more sanguine. \"The delay is certainly very disappointing, but allowing it to borrow from 2015 is better than nothing.\" Another power the bank will lack, the Guardian has revealed, is the ability to issue \"green Isas\". These would be individual savings accounts, which let people save a certain amount each year tax-free, which would be invested in green stocks and shares or green projects. Finance experts and green campaigners have been disappointed that green Isas – which were first floated by Osborne in 2008 – will no longer be part of the package. Shepherd, of UKSIF, said: \"What's important here is the principle – if the government chooses not to make these available to retail investors, it will have lost the opportunity to build wider support for the low-carbon transition.\" \"This is very short sighted,\" said Matthew Spencer, of the Green Alliance thinktank. \"[The government] has not engaged the public in the mission to rejuvenate the UK's infrastructure, and a green Isa would have been one way to raise enthusiasm as well as new funds.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/nov/21/us-envoy-north-korea-nuclear-weapons","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-21T18:56:00Z","webTitle":"US envoy heads to Seoul to discuss North Korea's nuclear activity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/21/us-envoy-north-korea-nuclear-weapons","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/nov/21/us-envoy-north-korea-nuclear-weapons","fields":{"headline":"US envoy heads to Seoul to discuss North Korea's nuclear activity","bodyText":"A new nuclear crisis was looming in Asia after it emerged that North Korea had made far more progress than previously thought in enriching uranium. Washington's top envoy on North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, was dispatched to the region after a US scientist said the government in Pyongyang had shown him a \"stunning\" new uranium enrichment plant at the country's nuclear complex at Yongbyon. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mike Mullen, said it provided further evidence of North Korea's increasingly belligerent behaviour. \"From my perspective, it's North Korea continuing on a path which is destabilising for the region. It confirms or validates the concern we've had for years about their enriching uranium, which they've denied routinely,\" said Mullen. \"They are a country that routinely we are unable to believe that they would do what they say.\" Siegfried Hecker, a Stanford University professor who was shown round the enrichment plant, said it contained an \"astonishingly modern control room\" overlooking 2,000 centrifuges. \"These facilities appear to be designed primarily for civilian nuclear power, not to boost North Korea's military capability,\" Hecker wrote in a report on his visit. But he added: \"Nevertheless, the uranium enrichment facilities could be readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU) bomb fuel (or parallel facilities could exist elsewhere).\" Despite North Korea's claims that the facility is designed to produce electricity, the news will trigger suspicions that it is seeking to bolster its weapons capability and gain the upper hand in nuclear talks, as it reels from US and UN sanctions. The North Koreans have already made and tested nuclear bombs made from plutonium. The enrichment of uranium represents another potential route to make a bomb. Plutonium and uranium can also be used to make much more powerful thermo-nuclear warheads. Bosworth will visit Seoul on Monday, and go on to Beijing and Tokyo to discuss a collective response to the revelations. Six-nation talks over North Korea's nuclear programme – between the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and hosted by China – have stalled, and some observers speculated that the Pyongyang regime gave Hecker and other scientists access in the hope of strengthening its position at any future multi-party nuclear talks. Washington has refused to consider North Korea's request to restart six-party talks in Beijing until the regime honours previous commitments to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea is known to have enough fissile material from its plutonium-based programme to make six to 12 nuclear bombs, but has not proven it has a working nuclear weapon. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said the new facility appeared to have been built within a year, in the gutted shell of an old fuel fabrication plant at Yongbyon. The nuclear scientist said: \"The first look through the windows of the observation deck into the two long high-bay areas was stunning. Instead of seeing a few small cascades of centrifuges, which I believed to exist in North Korea, we saw a modern, clean centrifuge plant of more than 1,000 centrifuges, all neatly aligned and plumbed below us.\" He said the facility \"would fit into any modern American processing facility\". Although he could not verify claims by his hosts that they had already put 2,000 centrifuges into operation, he confirmed he personally saw at least 1,000. Hecker, who was not permitted to photograph the facility, passed on his findings to the White House several days ago, according to media reports. He predicted they would cause \"a political firestorm\". The news is the latest in a series of recent blows to Barack Obama's attempts to keep alive his vision for global nuclear disarmament. The speed with which the plant appears to have been built and its sophistication suggest outside help, at least in acquiring parts. Washington is expected to exploit Hecker's report to prove that the regime has continued to develop nuclear weapons, despite UN sanctions. Pyongyang has endured near-universal condemnation and punitive measures since conducting nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. Hecker said: \"It is clear that waiting patiently for Pyongyang to return to the six-party talks on terms acceptable to the United States and its allies will exacerbate the problem ... The only hope appears to be engagement.\" Pyongyang has already carried out two nuclear bomb tests. There have been reports that it may be preparing for a third in north Hamgyong province, where it held its second test in May last year, and where new tunnelling work has been spotted recently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/oct/13/beirut-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-lebanon","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-13T19:09:15Z","webTitle":"Beirut gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a warm welcome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/13/beirut-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-lebanon","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/oct/13/beirut-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-lebanon","fields":{"headline":"Beirut gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a warm welcome","bodyText":"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was given a warm welcome in Lebanon today despite fears that his visit will aggravate domestic tensions in the politically divided country by boosting the militant Shia group Hezbollah, which is supported by Tehran. Thousands of Hezbollah supporters cheered Iran's president and waved Iranian flags as he spoke, partly in Arabic, at a mass rally in a football stadium in Beirut's Shia southern suburbs this evening. \"Lebanon is the school of resistance and steadfastness against all the bullying forces in the world,\" he told the crowd. Earlier, Ahmadinejad was showered with rice and flowers – a traditional greeting – by crowds lining the highway from the airport as he defied security fears and stood to wave through the roof of his car. The Iranian leader laid a wreath at the statue to Lebanon's martyrs in Beirut's central square but did not visit the nearby tomb of the murdered former prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri, as visiting dignitaries usually do. Tensions are running high over the murder, with expectations that Hezbollah members could be indicted by a UN tribunal investigating the 2005 killing, possibly triggering violence on the streets. The militant group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, welcomed Ahmadinejad to this evening's ally from a giant video screen – owing, apparently, to worries about his own security. Ahmadinejad, speaking at the presidential palace at Ba'abda after meeting his Lebanese counterpart, Michel Suleiman, said: \"The Iranian nation will always stand beside the Lebanese nation and never abandon them … We will surely help the Lebanese nation against violations … by the Zionist regime [Israel]. Our region does not need the intervention of any external forces.\" He is due tomorrow to tour areas in southern Lebanon where Hezbollah is popular. It remains unclear whether he will, as reported, throw stones across the border into Israel in an act of symbolic defiance. Israel lobbied the Lebanese government over the visit and the US and France warned it against provocative actions by Ahmadinejad. Washington argued that Hezbollah was undermining Lebanon's sovereignty. The movement, which is hailed by many Lebanese for its resistance to Israel, has not disarmed since the 2006 war and is said to have replenished its arsenal in preparation for future conflict. A statement from the White House today again called the visit \"provocative\". An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman called Ahmadinejad \"a warmonger who has come to Lebanon to play with fire\". Analysts say Ahmadinejad and hardliners in Tehran – facing economic problems at home and international pressure over the nuclear programme – want to affirm Iran's regional importance and show that it is ready to confront US and Israeli policies, at least by supporting their enemies. Lebanon's defence minister, Elias Murr, told the Guardian that despite a series of agreements between the two countries there had been no discussion of Iran's offer to arm the Lebanese Armed Forces, made after the US Congress suspended assistance to the LAF in August following a rare border clash with Israel. \"There's been no talk of that, but what Lebanon wants is an army that can protect the land, fight terrorism and believes in values,\" he said. Murr also reiterated Suleiman's statement that Lebanon supports Iran's right to nuclear power, a stance likely to strengthen the position of hawks in Washington who wish to cut US military assistance. Iran did agree a £283m loan for Lebanon to support power and water projects. Iran is also heavily involved in reconstruction projects in the south. Ahmadinejad also held discussions with Nabih Berri, the speaker of parliament and Lebanon's senior Shia politician, as well as prime minister Saad Hariri, son of the murdered former premier, whom Lebanese news channels reported as being less than comfortable with the talks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2010/nov/21/perfect-lives-aphrodite-hat-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-21T00:02:00Z","webTitle":"Perfect Lives by Polly Samson; Aphrodite's Hat by Salley Vickers – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/21/perfect-lives-aphrodite-hat-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2010/nov/21/perfect-lives-aphrodite-hat-review","fields":{"headline":"Perfect Lives by Polly Samson; Aphrodite's Hat by Salley Vickers – review","bodyText":"The beauty of a short story is the way in which one moment in a life can ripple outwards, offering the reader a glimpse of the past and future that surround this snapshot. Polly Samson's second collection, Perfect Lives, gives the sense of moving like a tracking shot through an affluent English seaside town, peering in through lit windows at characters whose lives touch one another's in tangential relationships. In this interconnection between the stories, the collection is reminiscent of Rachel Cusk's The Lucky Ones, but Samson also shares Cusk's gift for precise, thoughtful language and her sharp eye for the discrepancies between characters' inner monologues and their public faces. Needless to say, the title is freighted with irony. In the first story, a wealthy wife is reminded on Father's Day of her husband's infidelity, a truth airbrushed out of their family life, but at what cost? In another, a successful concert pianist visits the Jewish cemetery in Hamburg where her family history is buried. A young mother relocates from the city to a country idyll but yearns for the lost satisfaction of her career, until she is shocked by near tragedy into discovering maternal love. The small intricacies of family life – misunderstandings, betrayals, disappointments, longings – are Samson's raw materials, and the stories pulse with unspoken feelings. Perhaps the greatest joy is in her descriptions, often as striking and economical as poetry. One character is \"so expensively beige\"; a newly tuned piano is \"crystalline, clean as peppermint\". Or there's this wonderful image of life with a young baby: \"A day with Danny was like being left in charge of a nuclear power plant, lonely and bleak, slightly nerve-wracking, with lots of servicing and safety checks required.\" Although these stories are largely about the heartache beneath the surface of lives that appear enviable, they are far from bleak. Characters from earlier stories reappear, often having taken some small step towards happiness. There is a recurrent sense of stoicism; an acknowledgement that, for most characters, change comes not from dramatic revelation but with greater acceptance, self-knowledge and a degree of compassion, until they are able to say, like the only first-person narrator here, \"It wasn't perfect, but it would do.\" Perfect Lives confirms Samson's reputation as a significant chronicler of contemporary life. Salley Vickers is best known as a novelist and in the introduction to Aphrodite's Hat, her first collection of short stories, she namechecks those writers who have inspired her by succeeding in both forms – James Joyce, EM Forster and the late Penelope Fitzgerald, who commended Vickers' story, \"The Dragon's Bones\", included here. Threaded together by the broad theme of love – what she describes as \"the moment that can flash between human beings, making a homecoming of their apartness\" – these stories have an impish side and often conclude with a reminder that the characters who take themselves too seriously are those who most frequently end up being made to look foolish. There is a lovely example of this in \"Mrs Radinsky\", where the residents of an apartment block make assumptions about the strange old lady who lives on the top floor, and truth triumphs over hypocrisy. But Vickers doesn't shy away from the pain of that \"apartness\" and her characters' failure to find their moment of connection. \"The Buried Life\", an extended story developed from Matthew Arnold's poem of the same name, is perhaps the most heart-rending; an unflinching look at a woman's search for love and the price exacted for it, ripe with regret and the awful wisdom of hindsight, balanced against the longing to be understood. In \"The Return\" she veers towards Wilkie Collins territory, when a young couple on holiday in Rome encounter a more sinister visitor. \"How lucky that you can do these. I find them so hard,\" Penelope Fitzgerald wrote to Vickers of her stories, and there is no doubt that she can \"do these\"; Aphrodite's Hat is an assured debut, confidently ranging across moods and voices, and deftly pinpointing the moments when her characters most truly reveal themselves. Regret and optimism are finely balanced, and although her themes are contemporary, there's a pleasing old-fashioned quality to the stories, presumably thanks to the influence of the masters she cites in her introduction. The short story is considered by some editors to have less commercial appeal than the novel; it's heartening to know that writers such as Samson and Vickers put such love and art into the form.

As if mankind was a political prisoner, shown a run of blinding photo panels designed to shatter hope and force surrender. Those Libyan rebels in rags, facing the empty road down which the tanks will come. The silent flash and puff over Fukushima, as science's boldest dream turns to poison; the dignified old ladies of Japan waiting in snowy wreckage without food or warmth. The hospital in Bahrain, where people lie in their blood who only yesterday thought they had become free. That long, long line of spotlessly new armoured vehicles, motoring in second gear across the causeway from Saudi Arabia to destroy something else new and shining: liberty in a small country. That sea, thick-brown with timbers and minibuses and mud and corpses, heaving itself over the land so slowly and yet so much faster than a car can drive or a man can run. As usual, WB Yeats was here first: \"The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere/The ceremony of innocence is drowned…\" And another artist comes to mind: the weird and doomy Victorian painter John Martin, whose colossal canvases of apocalypse are currently on show in Newcastle. The Great Day of His Wrath shows a dark landscape bursting apart in flame; the oceans rising from their bed; the sinful millions slithering into the abyss; a steam train with top-hatted passengers plunging off a cliff. But Martin, tempting as his imagery is, won't do. Not even for north-eastern Japan in the month of March, 2011. He won't do because so much of what has happened in the world in these weeks, and is still happening, didn't have to happen. Even earthquake and tsunami are only partial exceptions. It's true that little significant could have been avoided: Japan on 11 March was better prepared for seismic disaster than any nation on earth, but the Great Day of His Wrath rolled over the Japanese emergency plans and washed them away. But it's still possible to say that without those plans and preparations it would have been worse – far worse. Tokyo, now standing on springs and shock absorbers, would have been shaken to rubble without its patient, expensive underpinning in the 20th century. Some people on the coast – not very many – were able to escape the tsunami because everyone had been taught at school about what can follow an earthquake, and they had the luck and time to reach higher ground. So human prudence and foresight can at least mitigate the worst natural disasters. And it remains true that many of them – global warming, or the impact of Hurricane Katrina – are not so much natural as the outcome of our own stupidity. Some consequences, such as rising sea levels, become unavoidable and we have to adapt to what we can no longer prevent. But others, such as the hole in the ozone layer or the accumulation of greenhouse gases, can be reduced, if not reversed. And still other catastrophes – including many of last week's fearsome scenes of cruelty and blunder – could have been prevented altogether. Long ago in Karamoja, in the limitless nothingness of northern Uganda, I met a dotty old English engineer. He was a freelance wanderer, giving advice about road building which nobody listened to. He said to me one night: \"As an engineer, I can tell you the root of all human mistakes. It's people putting things right, before they have finished finding out what's wrong\". I thought of him often last week. Most obviously as the Tokyo Electric Power Company frantically threw one dud solution after another at reactors whose damage they had not yet diagnosed. Sea-water dropped from helicopters? New cables to restart a cooling system which, for all they know, may have been burned away? But in a wider sense, the old engineer's maxim applies to the political dramas unfolding in the Middle East. We have decided to use armed force against Libya, and once again American and British missiles are thundering down on foreign cities. It's called 'Odyssey Dawn' – a name fit for a package holiday – but is it 'Shock and Awe' under another name? Gaddafi's tanks were already in the Benghazi suburbs before the first French or British warplanes took off. Kosovo should have taught the west that it is hard to change a dictator's mind from a height of 30,000 feet. But have we really found what's wrong with Libya before we start putting it right? Gaddafi is what's wrong, and it's inconceivable that this intervention won't \"creep\" towards regime change. But half-cock recipes for dealing with Gaddafi have a long history. Plenty of people have tried to put the Gaddafi dysfunction right by ignoring the underlying problem – himself – and instead addressing the symptoms: his appalling behaviour to the outside world. And at that level he responded. Would anything in Libya really change, he reflected, if he junked his nuclear programme, sold el-Megrahi to the Scots and offered oil bargains to his critics? Tony Blair was far from the first to make that mistake. A previous owner of the Observer, the buccaneer financier and cynic Tiny Rowland, also thought that all the colonel needed was a bribe and a hug. I once dared to ask him why he was so intimate with that murderous regime. \"Dear boy\", he replied, \"Gaddafi is a mere retailer in death. The Americans are wholesalers!\" Common to most of these horrors is the world's convulsive greed for energy – whether nuclear or fossil. It's that greed which makes people rush in with cowboy repair solutions, failing to seek the real sources of a problem. Fukushima is only one example. Here we jump into Libya, after a dirty deal with Arab autocrats to win their support against Gaddafi at the price of letting them suppress people's struggling for justice in Bahrain or Saudi Arabia. And that's another old story. Back in 1953, short-term lust for oil drove the British and Americans to overthrow Mohammad Mosaddegh's democratic revolution in Iran, a fatal interference which ultimately led to the tyranny which rules Iran today. All over the world, from China to Germany, governments are halting their nuclear power station programmes because of Fukushima. But what is that supposed to \"put right\"? Whatever went wrong in Japan must have something to do with laying a chain of obsolete reactors precisely along a famous tectonic fault. But the German reactors at Unterweser or Neckarwestheim are nowhere near an earthquake zone, so why has chancellor Merkel shut them for three months? It's about as rational as the grand Chinese salt panic: hoarders have snatched it off every shelf in China, after a rumour that Fukushima had turned the salt of all the oceans radioactive. And the \"Arab Spring\"? The peoples in those uprisings first diagnosed what was wrong: brutal police states, many of them kingdoms. So their ideas about \"putting it right\" are well founded. Out with the tyrants, who stand between us and the \"normal\" modern world with its rights and opportunities. That for a start. So far, only Egypt and Tunisia have struggled over that first threshold. Will Libya and Bahrain and Yemen follow them? And will the new house beyond the threshold be airy and clean? We must hope so.

The government says Britain has become \"the first station anywhere in the world to produce electricity from atomic energy on a full industrial scale\". 1957 The government promises a nuclear power building programme that would achieve 5,000-6,000MW capacity by 1965. The world's first nuclear power accident occurs at Windscale in west Cumbria, when a fire in the reactor results in a release of radioactivity. The then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, told the cabinet that he was suppressing the report that detailed the full extent of the disaster, defects in organisation and technical shortcomings. The facts were not made public for 30 years. 1960 Government white paper scales back nuclear building plans to 3,000MW, acknowledging that coal generation is 25% cheaper. 1962 Berkeley nuclear power station, situated on the bank of the River Severn, in Gloucestershire, begins generating electricity. 1964 The Government white paper, The Second Nuclear Programme, says 5,000MW of new plants will be built between 1970-76. This begins the era of advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGR) after other designs are rejected. Minister for power Fred Lee tells the House of Commons: \"We have won the jackpot this time - we have the greatest breakthrough of all times.\" Magnox reprocessing plant opens at Windscale for the dual purpose of producing plutonium for nuclear weapons and fast-breeder reactor fuel. 1965 Proposed building programme for AGRs increased to 8,000MW. 1966 First AGR construction begins. 1977 Last of seven AGR stations is ordered for Heysham, Lancashire, to complete the 8,000MW programme. The Central Electricity Generating Board describes them as \"one of the major blunders of British industrial policy.\" 1979 Energy secretary David Howell announces 10 new pressurised water reactors (PWR) to be built, calling nuclear power \"a cheaper form of electricity generation than any known to man\". 1983 Planning inquiry for the first PWR at Sizewell in Suffolk starts, lasting two years. Government forced to abandon dumping of low and intermediate-level nuclear waste in the Atlantic following pressure from environmental groups. 1986 The world's worst nuclear accident occurs at Chernobyl in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. 1987 Plans for Sizewell B approved. 1988 Construction begins on Sizewell B, the first of a family of four PWRs that are planned but later abandoned. The government decides to privatise electricity production and a \"nuclear tax\" is proposed. 1989 Magnox reactors are withdrawn from electricity privatisation. The city refuses to buy the older stations because of decommissioning costs and the taxpayer is left with the bill. AGRs and Sizewell B are withdrawn from privatisation because city investors discover that the cost of generating nuclear power is far greater than that of coal. 1990 Nuclear levy is introduced to cover the difference between the cost of generating nuclear energy and coal, adding 11% to electricity bills. The cost of building Sizewell B increases from £1.69bn to £2.03bn. 1991 Government announces plans for a nuclear waste repository costing between £2.5bn and £3.5bn that would be completed by 2005. 1992 International Atomic Agency says the building up of vast stocks of plutonium at reprocessing plants poses \"a major political and security risk\". 1993 It is revealed that the 11% nuclear levy on electricity bills has not been put aside for dealing with decommissioning costs and waste, but spent on building Sizewell B. Economists estimate that the projected income from the levy between 1990-98 will represent a £9.1bn subsidy for the nuclear industry. 1994 Government announces nuclear reviews, one into whether new nuclear stations can be built and the seond into whether the industry can be privatised. 1995 Government decides to make a second attempt to privatise AGRs and the still-to-be-completed Sizewell B. 1996 Sell-off of the newer nuclear stations goes ahead. Despite calls for its cancellation because of delays and cost overruns, Sizewell B opens. 1997 Two nuclear waste stores are to be built at Sellafield, to take intermediate-level waste for the next 50 years. Another 10 are planned for the future. 1998 Deputy prime minister John Prescott signs agreement to progressively reduce concentrations of radioactive substances in the marine environment as a result of emissions from Sellafield. 2000 In February, the British Nuclear Fuels chief executive, John Taylor, resigns over a scandal relating to faked safety records at the Sellafield plant in Cumbria. 2002 Bradwell power station is shut down after 40 years of operation. 2003 The government's 2003 energy white paper highlights the lack of planned new nuclear plants to replace decommissioned ones, but rejects the technology, saying \"its current economics make it an unattractive option for new, carbon-free generating capacity\". September 2004 The European commission launches legal action against the government over \"unacceptable\" failings in dealing with nuclear waste at Sellafield. May 2005 A leak of highly radioactive nuclear fuel forces the closure of Sellafield's Thorp reprocessing plant. October 2005 The government's chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, voices his support for a nuclear power revival, saying there are economic as well as environmental reasons for a new generation of reactors. November 2005 The then prime minister, Tony Blair, commissions a second white paper on energy policy and confirms that a new generation of nuclear power station's is to be considered. He says nuclear power is once again a serious option because \"the facts have changed over the last couple of years\". March 2006 The Sustainable Development Commission warns Tony Blair that there is \"no justification\" for a new nuclear programme. April 2006 The government's environment audit committee warns that a new generation of nuclear power stations would not be able to avert a serious energy crisis. The government has become \"too focused\" on nuclear energy, it says. May 2006 Tony Blair endorses a new generation of nuclear power stations in a speech to business leaders. He says the issue of a new generation of stations is back on the agenda \"with avengeance\". He is backed up again by King. July 2006 The new white paper confirms that nuclear power is back on the agenda. It says a mix of energy supplies is essential and that new nuclear power stations could make a significant contribution. The review says it will be up to the private sector to cover the costs of investment, decommissioning and storage of nuclear waste. Major power generators such as E.ON and EDF welcome what they call an \"important milestone\". October 2006 Greenpeace launched a court action claiming that the government's consultation was \"legally flawed\". February 2007 Greenpeace wins its case and governmen launches a new consultation, which includes plans to treble the amount of electricity from renewable sources and signals a return to the government's nuclear agenda. A Guardian/ICM poll shows opponents of nuclear energy narrowly outnumber supporters, by 49% to 44%. November 2007 New prime minister, Gordon Brown, calls for an acceleration of nuclear power in a speech to business leaders. January 2008 The government announces its nuclear plans. It backs a new generation of nuclear power stations. March 2008 Britain and France announce a deal to construct a new generation of nuclear power stations and to export the technology around the world. The deal will allow Britain to take advantage of French expertise in building new reactors. May 2008 Half a million people in the UK hit by power cuts as seven power stations, including Sizewell B, unexpectedly stop working. June 2008 Government inspectors warn that plans for a new generation of nuclear power stations may be delayed because of a shortage of skilled engineers. July 2008 In a speech to EU states, Gordon Brown calls for eight new nuclear plants to be built in as part of a 'nuclear renaissance' in the UK. September 2008 Business secretary John Hutton calls for a 'renaissance in nuclear power' in a speech to parliament. French energy giant EDF finalises a £12.4bn deal to buy British Energy, which runs eight nuclear sites with land on which new reactors could be built. January 2009 Gordon Brown backs plans for a new nuclear power station at Sellafield, after the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority agrees to provide land for the building of two new stations adjacent to the old site. February 2009 Magnox Electric Ltd, the operator of the Bradwell-on-Sea nuclear plant, is found guilty of allowing a radioactive leak to continue at the site for 14 years between 1990 and 2004. April 2009 The government publishes a list of potential sites for a new generation of nuclear plants. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority raises almost £400m after a seven-week online auction between energy companies wanting to buy three sites for new plants. May 2009 Centrica, which owns British Gas, announces a deal with EDF that will involve it in building new nuclear power stations in the UK. June 2009 A secret report by the government's chief nuclear inspector, Mike Weightman, shows more than 1,750 leaks, breakdowns or other \"events\" at UK nuclear plants over the past seven years. July 2009 Rolls-Royce announces it will open a new factory in the UK to build and test parts for new nuclear power stations. September 2009 State-owned Russian group Atomenergoprom unveils ambitions to break into the British nuclear market, raising fears about the Kremlin's use of energy as a political weapon. UKAEA, the body responsible for decommissioning and cleaning up Britain's fleet of nuclear power stations, has been bought by Babcock International Group for £50m. October 2009 The Guardian learns of secret government plans to tax electricity consumers to subsidise the construction of the UK's new nuclear reactors, contradicting repeated promises by ministers that the nuclear industry would no longer benefit from public subsidies. November 2009 The Health and Safety Executive says French and American designs for new nuclear reactors are significantly flawed. Energy secretary Ed Miliband outlines government plans for a new fleet of nuclear power stations at 10 proposed sites. An 11th site at Dungeness was turned down because of the \"adverse effect\" it could have on the local ecosystem. December 2009 The operator of Sellafield, Britain's biggest nuclear complex, is fined £75,000 following safety lapses which led to the radioactive contamination of staff in July 2007. March 2010 The government announces a £170m funding package for the British nuclear manufacturer Sheffield Forgemasters, who will build a 15,000-tonne press to make large forgings used in modern reactors. May 2010 The Liberal Democrats abandon opposition to the development of new nuclear plants, with new energy secretary Chris Huhne saying a construction programme would be acceptable \"without new public subsidy\". The Health and Safety Executive is cracking down on Sellafield's operators, Nuclear Management Partners, after a series of radioactive leaks and safety blunders. June 2010 Huhne reveals Britain is facing a £4bn black hole in unavoidable nuclear decommissioning and waste costs. The government cancels a proposed loan of £80m to Sheffield Forgemasters approved by the previous government. August 2010 The Health and Safety Executive says the schedule for the UK's nuclear reactor building programme has slipped behind, as the two proposed designs await approval. October 2010 The government gives the green light to eight new nuclear reactors. A report prepared for the government by the British Geological Survey identifies the Lake District as the area of Cumbria most geologically suitable for nuclear waste disposal. January 2011 Huhne announces plans to raise the amount nuclear operators will have to pay towards the cost of any accident in the UK to £1bn. March 2011 In an Observer interview, Huhne says Britain may back away from the use of nuclear energy because of safety fears and a potential rise in costs after the Fukushima disaster. Sir David King, the former government chief scientist, says the UK's nuclear industry is in no shape to cope with a large-scale reactor building programme and must be overhauled if the coalition wants to push ahead with its nuclear expansion plans. April 2011 Government plans to build a new programme of nuclear power stations in England will be delayed by at least three months while a report into what the UK can learn from Fukushima is published. May 2011 The UK government's advisory committee COMARE clears nuclear power plants of causing childhood cancers. A report by the energy and climate change select committee criticises the government for planning to award covert subsidies to nuclear power, betraying the coalition promise that the taxpayer would not foot the bill for a new generation of reactors. In an interim report following Fukushima, Mike Weightman, the nuclear chief inspector, says the UK is not at risk of similar disaster, and there is no need to alter plans for new nuclear plants. The government approves a controversial scheme to dump 250,000 tonnes a year of nuclear waste at King's Cliffe, a traditional landfill site near Peterborough. June 2011 Huhne confirms the list of eight new sites for the next generation of nuclear power stations. The government publishes a consultation on how to select potential storage sites for nuclear waste. July 2011 Fergus Ewing, Scotland's energy minister, says the SNP government is \"open\" to extending the use of the country's two existing nuclear plants, Hunterston and Torness, in a move away from SNP opposition to nuclear power. The government publishes its plans on reform of the electricity market, which will rely heavily on nuclear power. Despite local opposition, officials give the go-ahead for work to begin on Hinkley C in Somerset, the first new nuclear power station for 20 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2009/may/17/safety-scares-at-sellafield","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-17T17:26:03Z","webTitle":"Safety scares at Sellafield threaten to undermine nuclear 'renaissance'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/may/17/safety-scares-at-sellafield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/may/17/safety-scares-at-sellafield","fields":{"headline":"Safety scares at Sellafield threaten to undermine nuclear 'renaissance'","bodyText":"New safety scares at Britain's largest atomic site – including a 14-month radioactive leak and the loss of two toxic containers – are threatening to undermine confidence in the government's nuclear renaissance. Nuclear Management Partners, which runs Sellafield complex, admitted a spillage found in January, the day before Gordon Brown visited, was \"level two\", the worst since a 2005 accident that saw then-owners British Nuclear Fuels Ltd fined £500,000. A board of inquiry has concluded that the drip from a faulty flange went unnoticed \"because managerial controls over the line were insufficient and there was inadequate inspection\". NMP says the leak was small and there was no threat to human safety. NMP has also had to admit it has lost two containers of highly radioactive material. \"The most likely explanation is that the material remains on site and has been moved to a neighbouring facility, and that the anomaly lies within the accountancy procedures,\" it said. \"Environmental and public safety has not been compromised.\" Environmentalists said the latest scares would further undermine public confidence. \"Never mind swine flu, this pandemic of nuclear carelessness poses a far greater risk to us all, and highlights the sloppy housekeeping that is endemic at Sellafield,\" said Martin Forwood of Cumbrians Opposed to a Radioactive Environment.Local anti-nuclear campaigners said they were very disturbed that Sellafield Ltd was \"clinging to the hope\" that the lost cans had been moved to another secure facility on the site. But they were even more worried that the consortium had so far offered no explanation as to how remotely controlled robots could have effected such a removal service unobserved by managers and workers alike, or by the site's security services. A continuing hunt is on to find the materials, which were stored in a \"cave\" with such high levels of radioactivity that the canisters can only be moved only by robots. NMP said it needed to understand how the materials had been moved to ensure that there could be no repeat. \"Sellafield Ltd's new executive took over the running of the company in November and are committed to running the site in a world-class manner. As such, the company recognises that incidents such as this are unacceptable,\" it said. \"We are determined that behaviours will be improved across the board. In the meantime, we will continue to be open and transparent about the issue, and work with both our regulators and stakeholders to this end,\" it added. Sellafield, in Cumbria, is said to be the most polluted industrial site in Europe and is home to power plants and reprocessing facilities such as Thorp, where radioactive waste leaked for months without detection. Areva of France has recently been on the end of serious criticism over cost-overruns and delays on the reactor it is building in Finland – the first new-build in western Europe for 30 years. AMEC shareholders rebelled at what they saw as the excessive executive remuneration when they voted at the UK engineering company's annual general meeting last week. The third member of the consortium running Sellafield is the US-based Washington Group.

At the start of his recent novel, Our Kind Of Traitor, a holidaying couple stumble into the confidences of a Russian gangster. One of the pair learns a secret he cannot tell the other, and everything between them alters. Nick Clegg, caught in a trap over control orders and intelligence information he cannot pass on, would sympathise. In opposition it is easy to be absolute, excluded as you are from complexity. The convictions of shadow office – or of a newspaper columnist – are harder to maintain in power. On these pages last Saturday, Polly Toynbee raged against the prime minister, who she believes has betrayed everything he promised in opposition. Easy to say and easy to find evidence for if you want, but it will not feel like that to David Cameron or Clegg, responding to circumstances they could not predict before encountering them. No one could: whatever it is Ed Miliband believes now, it will not be what he does should he win the next election. But this is not an argument for breaking faith easily with early convictions. Ministers must keep their points of reference even when the current tugs them sideways. Without these, bureaucracy easily overwhelms a politician. \"If only you could know what I now know\" is a poisonous excuse. It marks the separation of elector and elected. \"You don't realise how powerful a pledge is until you break one,\" says one Liberal Democrat campaigner who has made many in his time. It is strange that the circumstances of eight men, held in legally innocent limbo, should have become the latest test: there are bigger worries and bigger compromises for both parties. Lib Dems have recanted on cuts, nuclear power and student fees; the Conservatives on immigration, justice, tax, Europe and votes for prisoners (an issue greatly exercising Tory MPs). Clegg's current frustration is that his search for nuance, when a new party leader, gave way to raucous oppositionalism. Painting things in black and white was the easy way to get a hearing then, but it exposes him now. But on terror laws the Lib Dem manifesto was restrained. It offered to \"scrap control orders, which can use secret evidence to place people under house arrest\". That is essentially what the home secretary will announce this week. What the manifesto was artfully silent about was the scheme needed to replace them. Clegg must persuade people that the regime he has agreed with Cameron and the home secretary, Theresa May, isn't just the old system under a new name. He deserves to succeed; this will be more than rebranding. Labour's law will be repealed and a new one brought in, \"an utterly different beast\", says one of those involved. People subject to this as yet nameless system of surveillance will – as they are not at the moment – be able to use phones, the internet, work, study, see people and move around. Curfews will go, or at least some more limited form of restriction at night will replace them. There will be greater pressure on the police and security services to prosecute, though not everyone will be charged before being put under restriction. Police powers to stop and search will change. Human rights lawyers have been consulted and are said to be content. There is a question whether any of this will reassure those who fetishise control orders: former Labour home secretaries for whom they are one of the few trophies of power, and civil liberties campaigners who want them gone altogether. The government's plans are a compromise, albeit a fair one. If you think the state's job is to round up the usual suspects, regardless of the rule of law, or that there is no terror threat that can't be contained through prosecution, the outcome will not satisfy you; but, to a degree many have not expected, Clegg has held fast to his undertakings. Yet everything he does is being seen through the prism of sellout. In part, this is the fault of his own breathless pre-election rhetoric. On some issues – cuts, for instance – the excuses offered by new facts barely justifies the change of position. There is a gap between what Lib Dems said (and – not always the same – what their supporters believed they said) and what the coalition is doing. This does not mean what the government is doing now is wrong, or that Lib Dems knowingly misled at the time, but that the experience of power adapts people in ways which invite the caricature of betrayal. All sides in the coalition need to stop this impression settling permanently. For every Guardian reader who objects to Lib Dem co–operation with the Conservatives there is a Telegraph subscriber who fears this government has sold out to the liberal left. But power cannot be managed in a staccato series of victories: 70% for the Tories, 30% for the Lib Dems, with no common ground in between. Nor did voters ask for this. There was nothing fair about a Labour decade based on a minority of the popular vote; there would be nothing fair now about Lib Dem triumphalism. The best that can be achieved is the shared improvement of policy through co-operation. That is what has happened on control orders. It is what happened on tuition fees too, though few believe it. It is the point of coalition. Grownup politics must move on from a tale of winners and losers, and think about the territory in between."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/20/japan-nuclear-crisis-fukushima-workers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-20T12:32:27Z","webTitle":"Fukushima workers exposed to high radiation levels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/20/japan-nuclear-crisis-fukushima-workers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/20/japan-nuclear-crisis-fukushima-workers","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima workers exposed to high radiation levels","bodyText":"Six workers at the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been exposed to radiation levels beyond the usual legal limit while carrying out emergency operations to make the complex safe. The news came amid reports that radiation from the stricken plant had found its way into the food supply, raising anxiety in a country already struggling to deal with the aftermath of the worst crisis in its postwar history. Meanwhile Switzerland has announced it will move its embassy in Japan to Osaka because of fears radiation levels in Tokyo could increase. The operator of the Fukushima plant, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), said it would have to vent radioactive gas from reactor 3, but later called off the risky procedure after pressure inside stabilised, albeit at a relatively high level. The Kyodo news agency reported that Tepco said six staff members had been exposed to more than 100 milliSieverts of radiation, but had been assigned to other tasks and were continuing to work because they had not shown any abnormal signs since being exposed. The government earlier increased to 250 mSv the limit for those working in the emergency operation. Japan's fire and disaster management agency said readings of up to 27 mSv were detected on 50 firefighters. They were decontaminated after a 13-hour operation to spray water into the spent fuel pool at reactor 3 ended in the early hours of the morning. On Sunday morning, workers doused a pool at reactor 4, also a cause of concern, for the first time. \"I think the situation is improving step by step,\" the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Tetsuro Fukuyama, told a news conference. Yukiya Amano, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), heralded a \"strengthening\" of work. But Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy-general at Japan's Nuclear Safety Agency, cautioned: \"We are making progress ... [but] we shouldn't be too optimistic.\" Technicians have already restored power lines to reactors 1 and 2. They hope they can restore cooling systems, although the pumps may well have been damaged by the earthquake, tsunami and subsequent explosions at the plant. David Lochbaum of the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US told Reuters: \"The workers need to go through the plant, figure out what survived and what didn't, what can be readily repaired and get the cooling systems back up and running to deal with the cores and the spent fuel pools.\" Tepco's president has made a public apology for \"causing such great concern and nuisance\". The firm has been widely criticised for not being open enough about the problems at the facility and its attempts to remedy them. The government's chief spokesman, Yukio Edano, confirmed the plant would not be used again. The nuclear safety agency said the facility could be buried in sand and concrete, as happened at Chernobyl following the nuclear disaster in 1986, but has said that trying to cool the reactors remains the priority for now. Japan is considering a temporary ban on sales of food products from the Fukushima region after levels of radiation exceeding government limits were found in milk and spinach. The contaminated food and water pose no threat to human health, Edano said, adding that the tainted milk and spinach had not found its way on to the market. \"These levels do not pose an immediate threat to your health. Please stay calm.\" Iodine-131 was present in milk at a farm 20 miles away from the crippled nuclear plant and in spinach grown at farms more than 60 miles away in neighbouring Ibaraki. Tiny amounts of radioactive iodine have been found in tap water in and around Tokyo, about 150 miles away from the atomic plant, and five prefectures near Fukushima. The education and science ministry said traces of another radioactive material, caesium-137, had been identified in tap water in nearby Tochigi and Gunma prefectures, but posed no danger to people even if ingested. The government is to provide daily counts of radioactive materials in tap water from all of the affected areas, as well as levels in atmospheric fallout such as rain and dust. Radiation was also detected on fava beans exported to Taiwan. An official from Taiwan's department of health said a shipment of beans from Japan's south-western Kyushu island had shown slightly higher radiation than naturally occurring trace levels. The department said the radiation, detected only on the surface of the beans, was well below Taiwan's legal limit and not harmful to human health. Radioactive dust and particles were recorded in the greater Tokyo area but posed no risk to health, the government said on Sunday. Edano said someone who drank the tainted milk for a year would receive the same amount of radiation as in a single CT health scan; eating the spinach would be the equivalent of one-fifth. He said the contaminated water, milk and spinach would have to be consumed in enormous quantities over a long period to pose a threat to health. \"If you eat it once, or twice or even for several days, it's not just that it's not an immediate threat to health, it's that even in the future it is not a risk,\" he said. \"Experts say there is no threat to human health.\" Graham Andrew, a senior IAEA official, told reporters in Geneva that Japan was considering halting food sales from the affected region. The spread of radioactivity to the food supply is already affecting Japanese food exports. South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Singapore have started screening food arriving from the country. Local farmers said they were worried that the discoveries would affect other, so far unaffected, produce from the region, which is known for its rice and several varieties of fruit and vegetable. \"There will be damaging rumours,\" said Shizuko Kohata, a farmer who was evacuated from her home near the Fukushima plant. \"I grow things for a living, and I'm worried that I won't be able to carry on after this.\" The government said radioactive iodine-131 present in spinach tested on Wednesday was three to seven times above acceptable government standards. Levels in drinking water from Fukushima were slightly over the limit on Thursday but had decreased significantly by the weekend, the health ministry said. Drinking one litre (1.76 pints) of water with the iodine at Thursday's levels is the equivalent of receiving one 88th of the radiation from a chest x-ray, said Kazuma Yokota, a spokesman for the prefecture's disaster response headquarters. Iodine-131 decays within a matter of weeks, but can pose a short-term risk to health, the IAEA said. \"There is a short-term risk to human health if radioactive iodine food is absorbed into the human body,\" the agency said. \"If ingested, it can accumulate in and cause damage to the thyroid. Children and young people are particularly at risk.\" A potentially greater concern is caesium-137, which caused widespread damage to the food supply in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster. The substance affects cells in the entire body and can increase the chances of developing cancer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/dec/06/reader-faq-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-06T11:43:50Z","webTitle":"The ultimate climate change FAQ: Keep your questions coming | Duncan Clark","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/dec/06/reader-faq-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/dec/06/reader-faq-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"The ultimate climate change FAQ: Keep your questions coming","bodyText":"Last week we launched The ultimate climate change FAQ, a collaborative project designed to create the best and most useful online guide to all aspects of climate change. We kicked off by inviting readers to submit questions that they wanted to see answered – and to tell us how they would like to see the project develop. The response was fantastic. Hundreds of people submitted questions (more on those in a second) and various people got in touch to offer expert advice, help with fact-checking or suggestions for partnerships. A few commenters such as DavidCU and SimonCBCooper encouraged us to link up with Skeptical Science in some way, since that site has already done such a good job of creating clear explanations about various aspects of climate science, with the facts footnoted back to peer-reviewed scientific papers. Happily, Skeptical Science has just joined the Guardian Environment Network, which paves the way for using some of their content in the FAQ. Inevitably, not everyone was 100% convinced of the value of this whole project. For example, bananachips asked what a team of journalists without training in climate science could add to the debate. I replied that we were enlisting experts to help with questions of science, and that what we hoped to offer was a group of people are who good at absorbing a complex topic and presenting the facts in a clear and balanced way. Generally, though, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, with a great haul of thoughtful and articulate questions that run the gamut in terms of topic and complexity. Fittingly, given our plan to eventually assemble our answers into a browsable background guide, some readers encouraged us to start right at the beginning with the most fundamental question of all: what is the climate? • \"Is there a difference between 'climate' and 'weather'?\" Kate Durbin • \"Is there any qualitative difference between weather and climate, or is climate merely weather considered over a long period?\" Tiresias At the other end of the scale are questions about specific parts of the climate system and the various phenomena that can affect it. To pick out just one example: • \"What is 'the Odden feature' and what effect does it have upon the Gulf Stream?\" John Maher Perhaps inevitably, given the bone-chilling cold snap we're currently experiencing in the UK, there were a few questions about if and how such freezing weather can be reconciled with a warming world: • \"Why are winters getting colder if there is climate warming?\" SWDoughty • \"Do the cold winters suggest that melting polar ice is sucking heat out of the weather?\" James Greyson And there were quite a lot of questions about the basic workings of and evidence for man-made warming, too. For instance: • How do we know whether increasing greenhouse gas levels cause global temperature rise, or vice versa? There seem to be examples of both in the geological record. Archipet • With or without human intervention, there has been climate change in the past. How can scientists be sure the current climate change is attributable to manmade causes? josekyle All of which are crucial questions that I'm sure we'll answer soon. But we said at the outset that we wanted the FAQ to be about more than just the science of global warming, so it was good to see questions touching on issues ranging from economics… • What are the estimated economic costs to the UK and global economy of failing to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions and allowing climate change to continue? And, how do the costs of a transition to a low-carbon economy compare to these forecasts? Iain Vincent …through to national security: • Is it true the Pentagon regards climate change to be a serious threat to the national security of America? @futheist There were also a great spread of questions about targets and solutions, both at the macro and micro levels: • How does the political goal of 2 degrees relate to the science target of 350 ppm? fitzpaul • Is nuclear power a viable alternative to wind/solar-generated energy for the UK? Val Clements • What are the five most effective steps we as western consumers can take to cut our environmental footprint? Does the purchase of green electricity from a retailer really make a difference? Does recycling, riding instead of driving, buying local organic produce change anything? sean spain That's just a small sample, obviously. I'm in the process of digesting the rest to understand which topics were the most frequently mentioned. That will help us decide where to focus our energies during the first stage of this project. My next post will be our first answer. In the meantime, thanks to everyone who submitted a question and got in touch to offer help. This whole project is starting to feel like it has a real momentum behind it.

But a handful of UK companies managed to buck the decline, notably Next ahead of its results a week on Thursday. The retailer rose 37p to £19.05 after cotton prices - whose recent surge put pressure on its margins - eased back, along with a general decline in commodities on worries about a Japan-induced global slowdown. A couple of positive broker notes also helped, with Morgan Stanley advising clients to buy Next shares on a two year timeframe and Credit Suisse issuing an outperform rating on the business. The latter's analyst Tony Shiret said it appeared Next had been cutting prices in its Directory to attract customers, rather than trying to pass on cost increases to the consumer and seeing what happened. He said: We have studied various elements of Next Directory to throw some light on the group's broader trading strategy to cope with rising input costs in 2011. This has thrown off a result we did not expect. Contrary to the prevailing view among commentators we believe that Next has planned to take its average selling prices down, not up in Spring/Summer 2011. Our examination of nearly 20% of the current Women's wear range shows average selling prices down 7% year on year. This makes sense in the context of tightening consumer spend and points to sensible risk management in our view (albeit the re-mix of product involved is likely to have been achieved through some de-specification of product). We have also analysed the balance of Next's retail profit between Next Retail (shops) and Next Directory and conclude that Directory has been more profitable on an underlying basis than generally supposed and that this has supported the declared profitability of Retail. As Directory is entering another growth phase these favourable dynamics should continue to under-pin forecasts. The analysis also highlights potentially a greater gearing to better sales performance at Retail than is currently supposed in our view. We conclude that Next is perhaps better set up than investors realise for the short and medium term. Scottish and Southern Energy also moved higher, up 5p to £11.89 on hopes that any delays to nuclear construction would benefit the company's gas, oil and coal-fired power plants. Capita climbed 3p to 757p after S&amp;P Equity Research raised its recommendation on the outsourcing group from sell to hold, while G4S rose 1.7p to 258.6p following a 4% rise in the security company's full year profits. But elsewhere the picture remained grim for most of the day, as investors spooked by the escalating crisis at Japan's nuclear plants in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami decided to head for the exit. Following a 10.6% decline in the Nikkei 225 index overnight, the FTSE 100 finished 79.96 points lower at 5695.28. But it came off its worst levels - it fell as low as 5591 at one point - on signs that radiation levels were falling, with Nikkei futures pointing to a 300 point opening rise. Nevertheless in Europe, Germany's Dax lost nearly 3% and France's CAC fell 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down almost 200 points or 1.8% by the time London closed. Metal prices fell on fears of lower demand if Japan's problems led to a global slowdown, and even the traditional safe haven of gold failed to attract investors. So mining companies were among the main FTSE fallers, with Fresnillo falling 66p to £14.33 and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation down 32p at 872p. Despite concerns about the turmoil in Libya and the Middle East - with news during the day of further unrest in Bahrain - the price of oil also fell from its recent highs. Brent crude dropped nearly 3%, helping push BP 8.05p lower to 451.25p. Heritage Oil fell 47p to 285.2p despite news that the Ugandan government had reached an agreement with Tullow Oil, off 21p at £13.49, over a tax dispute related to Tullow's purchase of Heritage assets in the country. GKN dropped 4.5p to 189.7p as the car parts maker warned it may cut the number of components it makes because of falling demand from Japanese automotive manufacturers. Around 7% of its revenues come from Japan, and of course a number of the country's car companies including Honda and Nissan have closed down plants in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami damage and power blackouts. Still with cars, distributor Inchcape lost 12.1p to 354.7p on worries about its exposure to the region. Nick Bubb at Arden said: We spoke to the company about Japanese car production, given its reliance on Toyota etc…Toyota has three plants in the earthquake zone, but they are largely for domestic/North American supply and there has basically been no direct impact on the export plants that supply Inchcape for their Asian markets. But Toyota has suspended all production until tomorrow for health and safety reviews. The other manufacturer Subaru (big for Inchcape in Australia) has no plants in the earthquake zone. Given six weeks stock cover, Inchcape does not think first quarter trading in Asia will be affected (group sales to be reported on 12 May), but it is too early to tell about the second quarter, given the threat of power cuts because of the loss of so much nuclear power supply. Burberry continued to decline, down 13p to £11.10 on concerns about a slowdown in the luxury goods market in Asia - Japanese sales account for around 5% of the company's revenues, according to analysts. But RBS reckons the fall in its shares has been overdone and added: Burberry has a legal provision in place to enforce a minimum guarantee payment from its Japanese licence partner of around £50m. At this juncture, it is unclear as to whether Burberry will go ahead and enforce this payment under the circumstances and we would question the impact on the brand and future sales should Burberry enforce the provision if the status quo in Japan deteriorates over the coming months. International Airlines Group - formed from the merger of British Airways and Spain's Iberia - lost 9.1p to 220.7p on worries about flight cancellations and consumer reluctance to fly to Japan under the current circumstances. Insurers came under more pressure, as estimates of their possible liabilities continued to rise, with Prudential down 23p to 695p. Finally Mears, the social housing and domiciliary care group dropped 21.75p to 280.25p, despite reporting a 27% rise in full year operating profits to £31.3m and a record order book of £2.7bn. The company believes it can benefit from the coalition's plans for the public sector, as well as the changes to the NHS including giving more commissioning power to GPs. It is on the lookout for acquisitions, and is keeping an eye on further opportunities to gain contracts from the collapsed Connaught group, as well as monitoring the activities of privately owned rivals. Joint broker Investec said: With Mears' proven ability to save the public sector costs in its core sectors, the order book supporting continued growth and reasonable valuation multiples, we remain positive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/feb/08/saudiarabia-oil1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-08T22:00:02Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Saudi Arabia tackles western shift towards energy independence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/08/saudiarabia-oil1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/feb/08/saudiarabia-oil1","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Saudi Arabia tackles western shift towards energy independence","bodyText":"Cable dated:2009-11-23T14:44:00 UNCLAS SECTION 01 OF 04 RIYADH 001557 SENSITIVE SIPDIS DOE FOR S2, AL HEGBURG, AND BILL BRYAN DEPT FOR S/CIEA, EEB/ESC DAS HENGEL, AND NEA/ARP E.O. 12958: N/A TAGS: ENRG, EPET, PREL, SA SUBJECT: SCENESETTER FOR VISIT OF DOE DEPUTY SECRETARY PONEMAN TO SAUDI ARABIA REF: A.

(SBU) Saudi officials are eagerly awaiting your visit, which they expect will begin a new chapter in our bilateral energy dialogue. You will arrive at a time when Saudi Arabia is confronting a number of difficult challenges. While it has managed to weather the international financial crisis, Saudi officials are keenly aware of the need to foster economic development quickly to provide jobs for its rapidly growing population (more than 2% per year). They are also anxious to diversify the base of the economy away from its current predominant reliance on hydrocarbons, which directly provide close to 50% of GDP and indirectly account for much of the rest of Saudi industry. Saudi officials understand the challenges they face, including the need to make Saudi education more relevant to today's workplace and the need to increase the role of women in the economy, both of which are controversial in the socially conservative Kingdom. Saudi officials are looking to the U.S. to help them meet these challenges, both through increased engagement at the government level, including educational exchanges, and more Foreign Direct Investment, particularly in energy, high tech, and manufacturing. Saudi officials strongly welcomed the President's Cairo speech and its promise of greater outreach, which provides a good context for your visit. 2. (SBU) Saudi officials feel under the gun, as they are aware that a number of other countries are years ahead of them in pursuing the same strategy. They are very concerned by the tenor of discussion in the West about shifting away from reliance on oil and gas, and moves to develop \"energy independence.\" While they, too, want to develop a more sustainable economy and address environmental degradation, they are concerned that the world will turn away from their main source of livelihood before they have a chance to catch up. In that regard, your visit offers a great opportunity to reset our energy dialogue with Saudi Arabia and explore areas of energy interdependence, rather than energy independence. Your visit will also demonstrate our continued interest in helping Saudi Arabia fulfill the King's vision of developing a knowledge-based economy, which dovetails nicely with the agenda of the President's Cairo speech. It also offers the opportunity to encourage the Saudis to be more forthcoming in areas of concern to us, such as climate change. Schedule -------- 3. (SBU) We have scheduled meetings for you in Dhahran with Minister of Petroleum Ali Al-Naimi, CEO for Saudi Aramco Khalid Al-Falih, and in Riyadh with the President of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST, Saudi Arabia's Science Ministry) Abdullah Al-Suweil and the Governor of the Electricity and Co-Generation Regulatory Authority (ECRA) Fareed Zedan. We have also scheduled your participation in the quarterly review of the critical infrastructure protection initiative with the Ministry of Interior. You will also have an opportunity to meet leading members of the Eastern Province's business community in Dhahran in a dinner at the Consulate, and informally meet Ministry of Petroleum Officials at a dinner in Riyadh. Saudi Aramco ------------ RIYADH 00001557 002 OF 004 4. (SBU) On your first day, you will meet Minister Al-Naimi and Aramco CEO Al-Falih in Aramco's offices in Dhahran, which will give you an opportunity to tour this fascinating facility, including Aramco's advanced technology operations center. In the 20 years since its amicable nationalization, Aramco has developed into one of Saudi Arabia's most efficient and modern institutions, developing several generations of world-class leaders, like Al-Falih and his predecessor once removed, Al-Naimi. It is noteworthy that, when the King wants something done quickly and right, like completion of his signature project of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), he turns to Aramco. It is also noteworthy that Aramco continues to enjoy very close relations with the USG and with American companies, based in part on the fact that many top officials studied in the U.S. Direction of markets -------------------- 5. (SBU) Saudi Minister of Petroleum Ali Al-Naimi is most interested in pursuing two topics with you, a discussion of current oil market issues and the potential for future cooperation. In terms of current issues, Al-Naimi and Aramco CEO Al-Falih will be very interested in your views of the long-term direction of international oil and gas markets. They will be particularly interested in your sense of what policies the Administration will introduce to improve energy efficiency and reduce overall demand, as well as your sense of the prospects for a Climate Change bill from Congress. You may wish to elicit their views on long-term prospects for Asian markets, especially China, which has become a more important destination for Saudi crude. Recognizing the long-term prospects for this market, on November 11, Aramco and Exxon opened a multibillion dollar joint venture with SINOPEC in Fujian, China, to add 8 million tons of annual refining capacity. Chinese firms are also performing significant engineering and construction work in the Saudi petroleum and petrochemical sectors. Saudi officials have recently reaffirmed to us that they continue to value being a major crude supplier to the U.S. market, although they are watching the direction of future demand carefully, and will make sure they retain a significant position in all the major Asian markets. 6. (SBU) Saudi officials (including Saudi Finance Minister Al-Assaf and Al-Naimi) have made it clear both publicly and privately they do not support moves to shift oil pricing away from dollars. They are concerned, however, about volatility in oil markets, which they believe are unduly influenced by speculation. Saudi officials explained to us (septel) that they will shift in January from reliance on the WTI benchmark to the Argus Sour Crude Index because they believe ASCI is less subject to speculative price swings, which in turn will help protect their revenue stream. Saudi officials are keenly interested in keeping the world economy on track for sustainable recovery, and therefore support a continuation of stimulus measures, coordinated through the G20 process. They also want to avoid any undue shocks to the international economy, and support the current price level, which the King has declared is \"fair.\" Saudi Arabia is committed to maintaining sufficient reserve capacity to stabilize prices. Aramco is completing its $120 billion worth of projects to increase production capacity towards 12.5 million barrels a day, an investment that Saudi officials have noted the Kingdom made at the peak of prices for engineering and construction services. The Kingdom is also exploring other projects to bring non-conventional oil on line to meet the evolving needs of the international market and expand reserves, such as Saudi Arabian Chevron's project in the Partioned Neutral Zone with Kuwait to steam flood heavy oil in limestone cavities (septel). Thanks to this project, which Al-Naimi strongly supports, Chevron is the only International Oil Company producing oil upstream in the Kingdom. Future cooperation on renewables and efficiency projects -------------------------------- 7. (SBU) Al-Naimi is keen to discuss potential areas of cooperation, particularly on solar energy (ref a). He has publicly called for Saudi Arabia \"to become the Saudi Arabia of solar energy.\" Al-Naimi also supports biomass energy projects, including involving algae. As Chairman of the RIYADH 00001557 003 OF 004 Board of the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (KAUST), he will want to brief you on research projects in these areas going on at KAUST, and invite DOE participation in joint projects. Al-Naimi is very much looking forward to escorting Secretary Chu to meet the scientists involved in these projects early in the new year when the Secretary visits the Kingdom. 8. (SBU) Saudi officials in several ministries have explained their interest in developing renewable energy projects, which they expect to play a major role in meeting the Kingdom's future energy needs (electricity demand is growing at 8-10% per year, ref b). Developing renewables will reduce the need to divert increasing amounts of crude from exports to fuel domestic electricity generation. It will also help the Kingdom deal with growing pollution. KACST plays a major role in researching renewable energy potential. As part of our bilateral Science and Technology dialogue, KACST and Aramco expressed interest in holding an energy working group to explore opportunities for joint projects and cooperation in a number of areas, including renewables and in oil production technology. Your visit offers an ideal opportunity to explore in greater detail their areas of interest. KACST would like to identify key players for a working group in January or February, which could schedule scientific exchanges over the next year and agree on a list of joint research projects by December 2010. 9. (SBU) The Electricity and Co-generation Regulatory Authority (ECRA) is working hard to maintain a difficult balancing act between meeting the rising demand for electricity, which is fueled by a heavily subsidized price, and encouraging private investment in new generating facilities. ECRA is the main driver behind the moves to unify the electricity grids of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, which formally happened this year. This linkage will help national power generation authorities meet peak demands in other countries, which ECRA estimates will make the whole system more efficient and reduce the need for new generation plants in the short-term. Over the longer term, ECRA is acutely aware that it must continue to scramble to meet projected increases in demand. ECRA is very interested in any potential cooperation on efficiency projects, both for generation and for transmission. It has recently persuaded Saudi authorities to approve differentiated prices, which it hopes will begin to moderate residential demand. Civilian nuclear program ------------------------ 10. (SBU) KACST also supervises Saudi Arabia's civilian nuclear energy program. Saudi Arabia is actively considering the development of a civilian nuclear program, which a number of analysts believe is the only possibility the Kingdom has to generate sufficient electricity to meet projected demand from economic and population growth and increasing affluence without wastefully burning large quantities of fuel oil. In May 2008, the United States signed an MOU with Saudi Arabia on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and offered to exchange technical experts to discuss areas for potential cooperation. Since that time, the French and other potential suppliers have actively talked about supplying Saudi Arabia with a nuclear power plant. Regional energy experts believe that only two plants are likely to be needed to meet the needs of the entire GCC, and expect that the UAE is likely to be the first country to announce a contract to build a plant, perhaps as early as January 2010. It would be useful to ask your interlocutors about their plans to develop nuclear power, noting our willingness to exchange technical experts. The importance of the IEF ------------------------- 11. (SBU) The International Energy Forum (IEF) has provided a forum for producers and consumers to talk frankly for more than 20 years. Al-Naimi and his senior officials strongly support this organization. At the December 2008 London energy meeting, later referenced in the G-20 Pittsburgh Summit leader's statement, the IEF was asked to prepare a report on the causes of oil price volatility and potential measures to deal with them, which would be considered at the next IEF energy minister's meeting in Cancun in March 2010. The IEF selected a group of experts who prepared a report in October that suggested the formalization of the IEF RIYADH 00001557 004 OF 004 secretariat. Saudi officials made it quite clear that they consider it critical that the U.S. remain involved in the IEF. They offered the U.S. a blank sheet of paper to suggest what the organization's goals should be. We strongly recommend that we take the Saudis up on this offer and provide specific suggestions reflecting our key priorities. Our constructive participation in this organization would demonstrate that we take seriously Saudi Arabia's long-term economic and political concerns, set a precedent for engagement on other USG priorities, and steer the IEF in a direction that better supports U.S. interests. Climate change -------------- 12. (SBU) Despite sharing similar interests in developing renewable energy and viable technological solutions to mitigate carbon emissions, such as Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS), the Saudi delegation has been very unhelpful in technical talks leading up to the Copenhagen summit. The delegation has insisted that no changes be made to the structure of the UNFCCC (UN framework convention on climate change) agreement, despite the fact that the underlying economic condition of a number of developing countries has changed since the agreement was drafted. Saudi delegates have insisted that any such change would represent a diminution of developed countries' commitment to help developing countries cope with the requirements of new technology. They also have pushed for some form of compensation for energy producers. Privately, Saudi officials have stressed their interest in capturing investment credits for clean development mechanisms in the Kingdom. They believe that no agreement can be reached without a U.S. commitment to cut emissions. Your visit offers an important opportunity to engage one of the leading Saudi decision-makers, Al-Naimi, on what the U.S. will be looking for in Copenhagen and beyond. Eastern Province merchants -------------------------- 13. (SBU) Several of the powerful business family groups that dominate the EP trace their origins to modest but industrious Saudi employees of Aramco, encouraged by their American managers to become private contractors in the late 1940s and 1950s. Many of the younger generations of these families have been educated in the U.S. These families often have informed and insightful views on a host of issues. The Consulate in Dhahran has arranged a dinner in your honor that will include several notable merchant families, which will give you a flavor of the commercial operating environment in this important part of the Kingdom. OPM-MOI ------- 14. (SBU) In May 2008, the Secretary of State and the Saudi Interior Minister signed an agreement creating the Office of Program Management - Ministry of Interior (OPM-MOI). OPM-MOI is a State-led interagency effort to assist the Saudi MOI with protection of critical infrastructure, including Aramco's petroleum production and transport facilities, which were the subject of a terrorist attack on the Abqaiq production facilities in Dhahran in 2004. OPM-MOI is developing projects in a number of areas, which will improve the security of Saudi Arabia's critical ports, electricity transmission lines and oil pipelines. OMP-MOI is also training a new 35,000-man Facilities Security Force, largely trained and equipped by DOD elements, which will protect key critical infrastructure sites throughout the Kingdom. The Ministry of Interior has invited you and your delegation to participate in the quarterly review, which will give you an up-to-date understanding of the project. MOI officials are very appreciative of DOE's very constructive role in this important, high-profile initiative.

Companies need to invest £32bn by 2020 to plug thousands of wind farms, mainly in Scotland, into a grid capable of distributing the electricity to where the country needs it. The money is also needed to build \"smart grids\" which move electricity and gas around new local networks to meet flexible demand. But chief executive Alistair Buchanan admitted that the £6 a year extra on consumer bills did not cover the £8bn it will cost to build huge new offshore grids for wind farms out to sea. Nor may the £40bn total cost to \"rewire Britain\" be enough to connect new offshore wind farms built after 2020, or if tidal and wave energy – still in its infancy – takes off, he added. To hit the targets, the rate of investment in the energy network over the next decade must double, with £35bn having been spent over the last 20 years. In total, by 2020 £200bn needs to be spent on new energy infrastructure like wind farms, nuclear power stations and gas plants as well as the networks. Energy bills will rise even more if Ofgem's calculations about the cost of investment falling over time are inaccurate. In its worst case scenario in the event of an energy supply crunch, it estimates that bills will rise by 60% by 2016. The average annual electricity and gas bill today is just under £1,200. Ofgem said the new regulatory regime would provide companies with the incentives to make the necessary investments in the network. Since the industry was privatised in the 1980s, companies have succeeded in driving down costs but have not made the necessary investment to replace the UK's ageing infrastructure. The new regime covering the UK's electricity and gas networks would reward innovation and be more flexible, Ofgem said. It would also fix the charges network owners can levy to power station and wind farm operators for eight years, rather than the existing five year term. Buchanan said that the longer period would make investment more attractive by providing more certainty. Buchanan told the Guardian: \"RPI-X [the old model for calculating charges using the retail price index] was a brutal cost-cutting weapon. It had run out of steam.\" He added that regulated assets, such as the UK's energy networks, which earn a return guaranteed by the regulator, was attractive for investors. \"There is no shortage of money globally to go into regulated assets. The UK is one of the most secure investment markets in the world.\" Trade group the Energy Networks Association said that its members had welcomed the proposals but Ofgem would have to come up with concrete figures before they began to invest. The remaining £170bn of investment required by 2020 – mostly to build new generating capacity – will be much harder to achieve because electricity and gas prices are not regulated. This means profits are dependent on volatile wholesale energy markets. Some experts believe Ofgem should also regulate electricity prices to make investing in power stations more attractive. Steve Holliday, chief executive of National Grid, added: \"Ofgem's review of the future of network regulation has been vital as the new challenges are very different to those of the past. Huge investments are needed to maintain security of supply and move to a low carbon energy system. The proposals are very much in line with the changes we need. But getting the detail right, ensuring investors can earn the returns they require, will be key. In particular, the extended eight-year price control periods will mean the mechanisms that ensure a balance between risk and reward will have to be robust.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2010/nov/30/cancun-carbon-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-30T16:14:03Z","webTitle":"Cancún climate summit: Let's look beyond carbon | Tim Yeo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/nov/30/cancun-carbon-growth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2010/nov/30/cancun-carbon-growth","fields":{"headline":"Cancún climate summit: Let's look beyond carbon","bodyText":"A new approach is needed at the climate talks starting today in Cancún. Distrust, ideology and vested interests block the path to a binding deal to limit emissions after Copenhagen ended in frustration and stalemate. Europe is willing to act, but nervous of going it alone. President Obama wants to sign up, but is ham-strung by a sceptical public and a Senate which won't ratify a deal that doesn't include developing countries. China is moving rapidly forward on green technology, but refuses to concede any potential limits to its economic expansion. So, how do we proceed? The perfect outcome would be a binding agreement to drastically reduce emissions – reflecting what the science tells us we need to do to avoid disaster – with all nations ending up with a fair share of rights to the atmosphere. The political reality post-Copenhagen, however, means this just isn't going to happen. We shouldn't give up on the idea of a binding cap on global emissions in the long term. But right now we need interim measures that countries can agree on, which will ensure we start moving in the right direction. The best must not become the enemy of the good. Dogmatically held positions should be set aside to find solutions. It's unlikely that countries will sign up to binding limits on carbon dioxide unless growth can be decoupled from the use of fossil fuels. One way to do that would be to introduce rules to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies first. Instead of trying to agree binding emissions caps on whole countries, negotiators could agree Emissions Performance Standards (EPS) across specific industries and sectors – placing limits on the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy. A natural place to start would be electricity generation. Coal-burning power stations in the UK currently emit about 900 grams of carbon dioxide (gCO2) per kilowatt hour (KWh) of electricity produced – but could be brought down to 130 gCO2/ KWh if fitted with CCS technology to capture the carbon and store it. Gas plants are cleaner at roughly 400 g per KWh, but could get as low as 60 g if CCS becomes viable. Nuclear power emissions are as low as 20g per KWh and some renewables even lower. Introducing Emissions Performance Standards would stimulate the development of CCS and other low-carbon technologies by showing investors, manufacturers and energy companies that the future is in clean energy. If similar standards agreed by individual countries could be extended to a regional or global level we could break the link between growth and carbon. The standards should not be set prohibitively tight at first, to avoid forcing countries to close existing power stations immediately, but could be ratcheted up progressively, driving innovation and efficiency. Of course, like any new idea there are drawbacks. We must take care not to lose sight of the science. An EPS would not guarantee global emissions are reduced to safe levels. It would, however, ensure that all new investment in energy infrastructure had to be low carbon and that's a lot better than where we are at the moment. It would also be argued that countries with a high proportion of low-carbon nuclear – such as France – would have an inbuilt advantage. But of course, that is also the case if binding emissions caps are introduced. One big plus of applying an EPS to electricity generation, is that coal-fired power stations can't simply move to another country in the way that some manufacturing industries can. A global EPS would create a level playing field when it comes to energy intensity. It would also help developing countries avoid locking themselves into dirty high carbon infrastructure – and protect them against future rises in the price of carbon. The NGOs of course wouldn't like it. But some of them have taken a damaging stance at the climate talks, blaming rich countries for every failure. One has to wonder whether calls for \"climate justice\" have more to do with soothing Guardian readers' post-colonial guilt complex, than with actually solving the problem. Political reality means we should stop banging our heads against the wall and find a new way. Decoupling growth from carbon emissions is a big prize. China has already said it would reduce carbon intensity by 43%, so it may be willing to meet us halfway on this. Even the arch sceptic George Bush was willing to reduce the carbon intensity of the US economy. The Senate may swallow this if Obama can persuade them it would also improve US energy security.

The short answer is doubtful, though more because of the intensity of public opposition than because costs could not actually be reduced. The Nuclear Decomissioning Authority declined to comment, saying it only implemented existing regulations, and companies seeking to build new nuclear power stations were unable to respond. Possibly all were sensitive to being seen even to consider less stringent rules on radiation. On the construction and operation of nuclear power stations, Professor Gordon MacKerron, director of the energy group at the University of Sussex and frequent government adviser on the economics of nuclear power, said: \"I am certain it is possible to build cheaper reactors: the Russians and Chinese are doing this now.\" But, he added, it would not be possible to reduce UK costs in the next decade at least, firstbecause of the challenge of overturning the \"huge bureaucratic machinery\" governing safety standards and then, because of those standards, no one is marketing low-cost reactors internationally. Other experts saw less opportunity for cost reductions in construction and operation. Cutting the amount of protective concrete laid, for example, would save very little, according to Ian Jackson, author of Nukenomics: The Commercialisation of Britain's Nuclear Industry. Also, the operation of modern plants makes use of remote handling, robotics and sensing, meaning even if workers were permitted to spend more time in the plant, no real benefit would accrue, said Professor Robin Grimes, at Imperial College. On the decommissioning of retired nuclear plants and storage of waste, MacKerron argues that the vast past costs are no guide to the future. \"The cost of waste management is very high historically,\" he said, due to the primary purpose of early reactors being to produce plutonium for bombs, and mismanagement. He thinks the cost of decommissioning and waste storage for future plants will be much lower, about 5%-10% of the total cost. Nonetheless, the industry is arguing that for low and very low level waste, the current containment requirements are overly cautious and costly. The NDA is currently consulting on whether the nuclear industry should be allowed to use ordinary landfill sites for disposing of low level radioactive waste more extensively and allowing the major waste dump at Drigg in Cumbria to reduce costs by scaling back the level of containment. Jackson argues that the future storage of higher level waste could be made less expensive by a reassessment of risk, but only if a large new fleet of nuclear reactors was built in the UK. That is because the waste from up to 10 new reactors could be accommodated by the expansion of existing repositories at marginal cost. Above 10 reactors and a new repository would be needed at significant cost, which would depend on the level of containment deemed necessary. The final factor, and perhaps the most contentious, is public opinion. Jeremy Gordon, analyst at the trade body, the World Nuclear Association, says: \"Any incident involving radiation is front page news and is out of proportion to the risk. Stricter and stricter rules are placed on the industry which are not applied elsewhere, in medical settings, the chemical industry and oil and gas industries. That is unfair and not based on a full assessment of the risk and benefits.\" Gordon argues that the key impact is in lost opportunity: \"Overly strict regulations can be a barrier to entry in using nuclear power. This would close off one of the significant technologies that can generate low-carbon power. Real health effects would follow from increased air pollution, fuel poverty and climate change.\" Cost savings in places seem possible, according to the experts, but what is clear is that the current strength of public opposition means any reassessment of radiation risk is unlikely to occur in the first place. \"When people are as suspicious as they are of this issue, it is not because they are scientifically illiterate, but that they don't trust those involved due to bad decision making, and indeed lying, in the past,\" said MacKerron. \"But if you can get trust, people are willing to accept the science.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/dec/17/bad-science-review-of-the-year","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-17T19:01:41Z","webTitle":"Dodgy dealings in tough year for whistleblowers | Ben Goldacre","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/17/bad-science-review-of-the-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/17/bad-science-review-of-the-year","fields":{"headline":"Dodgy dealings in tough year for whistleblowers","bodyText":"It's been a marvellous year for bullshit. We saw quantitative evidence showing that drug adverts aimed at doctors are routinely factually inaccurate, while pharmaceutical company ghostwriters were the secret hands behind letters to the Times, and a whole series of academic papers. We saw more drug companies and even regulators withholding evidence from doctors and patients that a drug was dangerous – the most important and neglected ethical issue in modern medicine — and that whistleblowers have a rubbish life. Bias is everywhere. Academic papers from people who get money from tobacco companies are vastly more likely to say that cigarettes prevent Alzheimer's, and we saw the first good quantitative evidence describing how academics routinely mislead readers about their negative results in academic papers, by spinning them as positive. Dodgy facts aren't the only reason clever people believe stupid things, as demonstrated by a gale of research on irrationality. Superstitious rituals really do improve performance. What women musicians wear affects listeners' assessment of their skill. Antibiotics don't work for a sore throat, but if you're prescribed them, you come away thinking they do. You can find mysterious alien patterns in ancient sites on a map of the UK, but you can find similar patterns in the locations of former Woolworths stores. More chillingly, if a piece of information which reinforced your prejudices is corrected, this only reinforces your prejudices; and we think crimes are less serious, when they have more victims. Newspapers continued to bravely make false claims about the efficacy of fish oils despite the negative trial data. There was the usual round of \"Facebook spreads syphilis\" that is barely worth still documenting, though the Sunday Times distortion of figures to claim the public sector pays more for the same job was particularly elaborate. Many more misleading news stories torpedo themselves with a caveat hidden in paragraph 19, so we reviewed the evidence showing how few people ever read that far. The PR community delivered some traditional joy. Rentokil produced a dodgy story on \"2,000 bugs in every train compartment\" which turned out to be based on some foolish figures about an absurd imaginary idealised insect-breeding train compartment, which still helped build sales. Stonewall's dodgy survey on coming-out ages contained a mathematical quirk and really only found that on average, as people get older, they get older; and EDF's dodgy survey found that if you first scare people with threats of unemployment then they will say yes to the offer of a local nuclear power station. Where science meets culture, we found the weirdly inverted solipsism of brain-imaging stories that claim pain is only real if you can see it in blood flow changes; while researchers claimed that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is caused by genes, and that knowing this will reduce stigma, when the evidence overwhelmingly shows (to my surprise as much as yours) that believing a mental health problem has a biological cause increases stigma. Evidence-based policy remains a distant dream. We saw politicians incompetently failing to produce evidence on whether their policy of compulsory drug treatment orders worked, and sacking David Nutt as chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs when the evidence was available but the results unwelcome. There were dodgy government figures on how many children were \"saved from abuse\" by some new rules, while the London mayor, Boris Johnson, announced that instead of a simple, well-conducted randomised trial to find out which of two teaching methods is best, he would answer the question with a public competition between schools that choose each method. If you need an explanation of why that is dumb, you could work in government. Meanwhile we saw an election where data could truly inform voting decisions, although everyone changed their policies once they got in power. Attacks on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) continued, because it dares to make difficult decisions. David Cameron claimed they rejected a drug which they didn't; the Mail claimed Nice rejected 15 drugs, when 10 on their list were approved; and everyone used dodgy miracle cure anecdotes on a costly cancer drug that really isn't all that. When Nice is neutered, resources will go to those who shout loudest in local newspapers: enjoy that. Andrew Wakefield, the doctor at the centre of the MMR vaccine scare, was found to have behaved dishonestly and unethically. Science was messy, but pointing out flaws remains a risky enterprise. We saw the reputation car crash of chiropractors who unsuccessfully sued Dr Simon Singh over a newspaper article in which he suggested they lacked evidence to support their medical claims. Then there was the dodgy website of the medical device firm NMT, who have chased a NHS cardiologist Peter Wilmshurst through the courts for daring to make comments about their clinical trial. Idiot-taxing cosmetics firm Rodial made legal threats against a doctor who dared to say that their breast enlargening cream was highly unlikely to work, and I was incompetently libelled, in a blast from the past, by Gillian McKeith, or to give her full medical title, Gillian McKeith. Finally, legendary moron-baiter Martin Gardner died aged 95. He wrote a book about pseudoscience like mine, but his was published 60 years ago: nothing has changed.

Expected to be the last to settle before the 20 October comprehensive spending review, partly because Lord Browne's review of higher education funding won't be completed until about then. High-profile cuts include £74m from winding up the regional development agencies, £233m from the UK Centre for Medical Research and £80m from Sheffield Forgemasters which supported that firm in building parts of nuclear power stations. Cable has fought a battle over proposals to cut 40% from his £4.5bn budget for adult skills. Work &amp; pensions £9bn Iain Duncan Smith is having to make savings of £2.25bn from his annual budget of £9bn. He wants to reform the benefits system but this will require upfront costs of, according to Labour, £7bn. Looking at significantly reducing the amount paid in universal benefits. Climate &amp; energy change £3.1bn Chris Huhne has had to find 25% savings from an annual budget of £3.1bn but big ticket capital items such as the carbon capture and storage and nuclear programmes are not due to be settled before the spending review. Instead the imperative – already delivered – was for Huhne to be brought on to the star chamber, which will examine departmental spending plans, in order to put pressure on Cable. That said, the bio-energy capital grants scheme is reported to be about to go, and £1m will come from funds to support development of deep geothermal energy generation; with the Carbon Trust also being reduced by £12.6m. It looks as if the fund for low-carbon technology could be cut by £34m. Culture, media &amp; sport £2bn Jeremy Hunt is seeking 25% savings from a £2bn budget. The £25m visitor centre at Stonehenge has had its funding cut, as has the UK Film Council (£15m). There is likely to be a move into the Department for International Development's offices to save costs. Defence £46.1bn budget Liam Fox is trying to find cuts of 10%-20% from a £46.1bn budget. His task has been made more difficult by George Osborne's insistence that the cost of the £20bn replacement of the Trident nuclear deterrent should be met by the MoD. Communities &amp; local government £33.6bn A quarter of the £33.6bn budget is to go. Regional governments will be axed with as many as 11 quangos. Eric Pickles, the secretary of state, was one of the first ministers to join the star chamber. Education £57.6bn Cuts of 10%-20% from an annual £57.6bn. The most high-profile casualty is the Building Schools for the Future programme. Michael Gove has also frozen grants to 132 councils for playgrounds. Foreign Office £2.2bn William Hague is already a member of the star chamber, having agreed cuts to his £2.2bn budget. Will sell overseas assets. Health £104bn The government is committed to giving Andrew Lansley's £104bn health budget an increase in real terms. Some savings are being found to redirect money towards increasingly costly drugs and treating an aging population. There will be no more bonuses for NHS managers and NHS Direct has been scrapped to be replaced with a cheaper alternative. Replacing strategic health authorities and 152 primary care trusts will cost £1.7bn. Cuts to social care could swallow 40% of £200m budget. Home Office £10.2bn Theresa May has a budget of £10.2bn and 25% cuts would require her to lose £2.55bn. She has already had to make savings of £367m, including £135m in police efficiency. Transport £13.6bn Philip Hammond has been told to make £683m cuts from a budget of £13.6bn. His department could lose 600 jobs, and grants may be cut with Transport for London getting £108m less and Network Rail also possibly in line.

In that period the ruling elite in Britain bought off its discontented masses with just enough reform to avoid being revolution. Thomas Macaulay's well-known proclamation of 1831 encapsulates the idea: \"Reform that you may preserve\". In his own way that's the sort of thing fluent English speaker and London-educated Assad has been trying to do since Arab unrest spread to Syria in recent weeks. The trouble is that he didn't see the Arab revolt coming in time and has only introduced limited reforms belatedly as a knee-jerk response to this dire threat to his authority. It remains to be seen whether he will be swept aside because his untimely reforms are seen as too little, too late by the angry masses seeking his removal. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Saving the rainforests In Tony Juniper's Green bargain of the century (8 April), there is no mention of any explicit commitment from Guyana to reduce or even stabilise emissions of forest carbon from deforestation and forest degradation. The second tranche of Norwegian cash for avoided deforestation was given because Guyana did not exceed a greatly inflated reference level, which the Norwegians have just halved in a revised agreement but is still perhaps five times greater than actual deforestation. A recent study suggests that deforestation tripled in 2009-2010 compared with the reference period 1990-2009. Only a small fraction of the Norwegian cash is destined for forest-dwelling communities. Most is destined for a hydropower dam whose strategic value is being questioned. None of the first tranche of Norwegian money can yet be spent because the government of Guyana has failed in 17 months to present more than a single weak proposal to the fund steering committee. The two tranches together ($70m) are equivalent to almost 9% of the national budget of Guyana for 2011. Guyana is ranked at 116 out of 178 countries in the most recent (2010) corruption perception index of Transparency International, with a score of 2.7 out of 10. And 2011 is election year in Guyana. Janette Bulkan Chicago, Illinois, US • The Norway/Guyana agreement to preserve the latter's forests would be a commonplace, rather than the \"green bargain of the century\", if there was effective international legislation governing climate change and environmental degradation. The developed world's highest proportional rate of native forest destruction, that of Tasmania, is only now being curbed by international agreements prohibiting trade in unsustainably logged native forests, but that hasn't stopped the island's woodchip industry seeking to market its chips for power generation abroad. Commercial fishing is a notorious example where the lack of a cohesive global jurisdiction is seeing both the industry and the supremely critical marine ecosystem heading for collapse. The extractive industries and their political partners have been very successful at portraying the environment as nice, but peripheral to the main business of society. We don't have for ever to correct this illusion. John Hayward Weegena, Tasmania, Australia Canadians aren't jaded Sure, I will relish re-quoting Richard Adams's line about Canada's prime minister wannabe, Michael Ignatieff, \"going around the country stirring up apathy\", but I take serious exception to the way he downplays Michael Harper's contribution to this apathy (Jaded Canadians face another trip to the polls, 1 April). Harper's egregious abuse of democracy is no \"mini-scandal\". His government first won its plurality on a promise of openness and fiscal responsibility in contrast to preceding years of Liberal scandals. Instead, Canadians have seen a rise in cronyism, a decline in parliamentary civility and several cases of backroom decision-making. We have seen expenses of over $1bn incurred by an extravagant and over-policed G20 conference and the decision to purchase those \"hugely expensive\" F-35 fighter jets was made without due process and at a declared cost 50% less than the true one. There have been several \"mini-scandals\" involving, for example, one minister's denial of a \"NOT\" handwritten on an official committee document in order to reverse its finding, and for another example, the abrupt and still (months later) unexplained dismissal of one of the members of his caucus. As for the truly \"maxi\" scandal, Harper's government was dismissed on a no-confidence vote following the speaker's ruling that there was a historically unprecedented case against the government for contempt of parliament. Canadian apathy for the democratic process would perplex today's Libyans, Egyptians and Syrians, but it has been hard-won by successive governments. Maybe Adams is correct in predicting more of the status quo, but there are signs that some Canadians long for a return to integrity and passion. Could those freedom fighters re-inspire us? Peter Scott Elora, Ontario, Canada • Richard Adams' article missed the main point of the Canadian crisis, despite alluding to some mini-scandal. The fact is Harper's government was defeated because it was found to be in contempt of parliament: first by a committee, then by the speaker, and then by the House itself. This has been touted by the Canadian media as a Commonwealth first. In any case, some of us are ashamed that our government has (deservedly) been brought down this way. John Stonehouse Victoria, BC, Canada Clean, green reputation The bad news from Japan (No schedule for nuclear safety, 1 April) is a reminder that New Zealand has been wise to avoid nuclear power, but for how long? As a food exporter the benefits of our clean, green reputation and isolation may be our greatest asset. Yet research by the marketing department of Otago University claims to have proven that abandoning our nuclear-free and GM‑free status would not harm New Zealand's reputation. The research follows sponsored visits by US academics calling for GM to be used in organics, and pressure for free trade negotiations based on forced acceptance of GM foods and lowering of biosecurity standards. Despite Fukushima, the Japanese government are not the only ones in denial about the risks of catastrophic technology failure. Jon Carapiet Auckland, New Zealand It's hard to define art Annie Stevens in her piece, It's so bad that it's good (1 April), though obviously written with tongue firmly in cheek, reminds me of those folks who, when they see the word \"art\" affixed to anything, automatically assume that it is, even on the slimmest of evidence. Nowhere is this better proven than in the failure nowadays to distinguish between vandals wielding cans of spray paint and legitimate muralists. Many people still insist on referring to both as \"graffiti artists\", though only muralists painting walls with permission or on commission deserve to be called artists; graffiti vandals or taggers squirting paint on walls illegally and on the run are not, but instead possess what Stevens in her own words would call \"the unhinged self-belief\" that they are. Richard Orlando Montreal, Canada • In America in my generation we were similarly regaled by the campy likes of Slim Whitman (Indian Love Call), Tiny Tim (Tiptoe Through the Tulips) and Mrs Miller, another operatic autodidact, like Florence Foster Jenkins. Were they for real, or put-on? That was their quiddity and their charm. Nowadays – thanks to political correctness – such formidable tremolo, yodelling and caterwauling seem to have been supplanted by the serenading of feline and canine quadrupeds on YouTube. R M Fransson Lakewood, Colorado, US Briefly • The review of Sex Before the Sexual Revolution (1 April), very Britain-orientated, immediately brought to mind the early 70s research on industrial relations and the eventual branch into the comparative field. One asks, for example, how such a book could have been written about, say, Sweden or France, or Kyrgyzstan, for that matter. Surely this is a rich vein that could be tapped. E Slack L'Isle Jourdain, France • George Monbiot's article (25 March) made very good reading. However, his reference to the \"fair fuel stabiliser\" should have been referred to as an acronym rather than an abbreviation.

An £80m investment to build parts for nuclear power stations in Sheffield and the flagship Labour policy of free swimming for children and pensioners will be scrapped while work on new libraries, hospitals, job schemes for young people will be suspended. The government said it was forced into difficult cuts by the \"irresponsible planning\" of its predecessors, but Labour accused the coalition of being ideologically driven to reduce the size of government and its involvement in stimulating the economy. Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the treasury, announced that £2bn worth of projects would be scrapped following a review of spending. They include the £80m loan to Sheffield Forgemasters, the £450m North Tees and Hartlepool hospital and the government's £25m contribution to a new Stonehenge visitor centre. A further £8.5bn of projects are suspended including the libraries modernisation programme, the Sheffield retail quarter, a Department of Health funded wellbeing centre for Leeds and a new magistrates court for Birmingham. The bulk of the potential savings comes from nearly £7bn worth of defence ministry contracts for new search and rescue helicopters. Alexander revealed that he had identified a £1bn black hole made up of Labour pledges that either depended on unspecified underspending in other areas of government or on drawing on government reserves. \"We have found another spending black hole in the previous government's plans – projects had been approved with no money in place to pay for them. I am determined to deal with this problem head-on and ensure we never see this kind of irresponsible financial planning in government again,\" Alexander said. A review of the school rebuilding programme, which has effectively been frozen, will be revealed within days but Alexander described it as \"heavily over-committed\" and warned of tough decisions ahead. Liam Byrne, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the projects amounted to 0.05% of government spending, \"nailing the myth\" that Labour had operated a \"scorched earth\" policy in the run-up to the election. \"Both the country and the Liberal Democrat party beyond will be aghast this afternoon at your attack on jobs, your attack on construction workers, your attack on the industries of the future and the cancellation of a hospital,\" he told Alexander. \"Let me ask you: what could be more front line than this? In five minutes this afternoon you have reversed three years of Liberal Democratic policy of which you were the principal author. What a moment of abject humiliation.\" In total 217 projects worth £34bn were resubmitted for reapproval. The £80m loan to Sheffield Forgemasters was agreed by the then business secretary Lord Mandelson. Today the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, whose constituency is in Sheffield, said: \"Sheffield Forgemasters is a great British company and as a Sheffield MP I regret that the government cannot afford to support its expansion. \"The truth is that this loan was promised by the outgoing Labour government as a calculated ploy to win support in Sheffield just ahead of the election, when they knew all along that there simply wasn't the money to keep to that pledge in the first place.\" Union leaders have warned that withdrawing the loan would lead to thousands of job losses and jeopardise preparations to build a new generation of nuclear power stations. The Unite leader Derek Simpson, who is from Sheffield, said the decision was a \"colossal error of judgment\", adding: \"The company is unique, there is not another company in the world that has its skills and expertise.\" Alexander announced an urgent review of spending commitments for 2010-2011, but the review will exclude those for military operations and the financial package agreed with the Northern Ireland executive to support the devolution of policing and justice powers.

Former business secretary Lord Mandelson and Labour's current spokesman Pat McFadden spent an hour at the Department for Business in London examining papers related to the Sheffield Forgemasters loan. The previous Labour administration pledged the loan to the leading engineering company, but it was axed by the new government as part of its drive to reduce public spending, on the grounds that the loan was unaffordable. Mandelson said reading the papers again reminded him of the project's importance, which he believed would have boosted the civil nuclear supply chain across the country. He accused ministers of deciding to cancel the loan without considering all the facts and said the work could go to firms in Japan or Korea. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has already rejected calls to rethink the decision, claiming that the problem is one of \"affordability\". The former business secretary rejected claims he had written a cheque that would have bounced, saying that the loan had been agreed with the Treasury after consultations on the firm's expansion plans with independent experts. McFadden, the shadow business secretary, said: \"Looking at the papers, they make clear that the government's accusations about the decision to grant the loan to Sheffield Forgemasters are wrong. \"The papers confirm that the project had important potential benefits for the civil nuclear supply chain, that it had Treasury approval and that it was very carefully considered by the Industrial Development Advisory Board, the external body that looks at such decisions. They concluded that it represented good value for money. Rather than continuing with wrongful statements about the project, the government should look again at this decision.\" Sheffield Forgemasters said it has shelved plans to buy the equipment to make parts for nuclear power stations. Chief executive Graham Honeyman said efforts to secure funding for the metal press would be suspended \"for the time being\". About 200 jobs would have been created, but the loan was cancelled as part of a package of spending cuts designed to save £2bn. The matter engulfed the government in its first sleaze row since the general election, when it was revealed last week that secret Whitehall documents showed a Tory donor successfully lobbied for the cancellation of the loan. Downing Street denied ministers had acted improperly when the loan was cancelled weeks after Andrew Cook, who has subsidised some of David Cameron's flights, warned the government it could be illegal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/damian-carrington-blog/2010/dec/16/electricity-energy-reform","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-16T17:05:38Z","webTitle":"Electricity market reforms: two cheers | Damian Carrington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2010/dec/16/electricity-energy-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2010/dec/16/electricity-energy-reform","fields":{"headline":"Electricity market reforms: two cheers","bodyText":"Cost, reliability and carbon: those are the three crucial factors that must be considered in any analysis of a new energy policy, like the proposals on electricity market reform put forward today by the government. Cost naturally hits the headlines, with a £500 a year hike in household bills featuring prominently. The Department for Energy and Climate Change's (Decc) own estimate is a £160 a year rise in electricity bills by 2030, from an average of £500 today. A 32% rise over 20 years is little more than inflation. Decc also estimates that no change on policy would lead to slightly higher rises in bills. The higher headline figure touted by some appears to include gas bills – not part of today's proposals, and use what an Ofgem spokesman calls \"an extreme scenario\". But \"bills to rise by slightly less than otherwise\" is not much of headline. There are real concerns about the affordability of energy for the poorest in the UK, especially since Decc announced yesterday (without emailing the press release to journalists) that the £345m Warm Front scheme has now run out of money and won't take new applications till April. That's a political scandal, but not a reason to oppose the electricity market reform proposals. Lastly on cost, the £110bn of investment is a vast sum of money. But a good chunk of that is replacing the 25% of today's capacity that will have to be retired in the next decade - ie, we'd be spending it anyway. The balance is for the additional cost of low-carbon plants, though they will get cheaper as more are built, and new grid connections. And the £110bn isn't burned inside new power stations, it goes to the operators and suppliers, ie jobs, which are in short supply at the moment. On reliability, there's two sides: intermittency of supply and security of supply. Low-carbon electricity from wind and solar is more intermittent than fossil fuels but more secure. Russia can't refuse to allow the wind to blow over the UK. With investment in the grid, plus new nuclear power stations, the lights are not going to go out. The third factor is carbon. The new proposals set the UK on the right track to meet its legally binding targets on greenhouse gas emissions, and will help to UK play a responsible international role in combating global warming. If you are wondering why on earth the UK should cough up a bit extra for a low-carbon energy supply while the rest of the world happily smokes away, the answer is that the rest of the world is simply not doing that. Consider these recent stories from newspapers which can hardly be described as treehuggers: Financial Times China has surged ahead of the rest of the world in renewable energy, creating a \"new world order\" in the low-carbon sector. The rapid growth of Chinese investment has prompted venture capital and private equity companies in Europe to call for more regulation and greater government assistance, warning that without such help, the European economy will fall behind. The country's spending on wind energy in the second quarter of 2010 amounted to about $10bn, or about half of the global total of $20.5bn. Wall Street Journal: India is on track to add 1.1 gigawatt of grid-connected solar-power generation capacity by 2013, as part of its target to reach 20 gigawatt of solar power by 2022. The country has set an ambitious target for solar energy generation to help cut down carbon emissions, trim peak-hour power shortages and bring electricity to millions of rural households Lastly on carbon, these electricity market reforms are good but the government is failing badly in other areas, and we'll need every tool in the box to meet the UK's carbon targets. While Chris Huhne has grasped the need to enable investment in the UK's neglected energy infrastructure, he has failed to win the argument on the need for a fully functioning green investment bank (GIB) which can help provide that investment. Thanks to Treasury trolls, the GIB now seems doomed to be a feeble fund. The government's other major green policy – enabling loans for home energy-efficiency improvements that pay for themselves – remains reliant on trusting the big energy companies to eat their own lunches, and cut their customers' demand for energy. Another more technical but important problem is the U-turn that the government has performed since taking office on \"emissions performance standards\", ie the maximum carbon emissions that power stations will be allowed to emit. In opposition they promised to cap pollution a the level of a modern gas plant - about 300-400g of CO2 per kilowatt hour. In government, they are consulting on a level of between 450-600g CO2/kWh. So, overall, two cheers for the new proposals. • Note: My original post said the Warm Front announcement was made on Thursday, the same day as the electricity market proposals, and asked if it was a good day to bury bad news. In fact the press release I linked to was posted on Decc's website on Wednesday. No email was sent about it, whereas I got three about the electricity proposals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/dec/04/sellafield-nuclear-contamination-fine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-04T17:41:40Z","webTitle":"Sellafield fined £75,000 for exposing staff to nuclear contamination","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/04/sellafield-nuclear-contamination-fine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/dec/04/sellafield-nuclear-contamination-fine","fields":{"headline":"Sellafield fined £75,000 for exposing staff to nuclear contamination","bodyText":"The operator of Sellafield, Britain's biggest nuclear complex, was today handed a fine and legal costs totalling more than £100,000 following safety lapses which led to the radioactive contamination of staff. The successful prosecution of Sellafield Ltd by the Health and Safety Executive will tarnish the reputation of an industry trying to win public confidence for a new generation of power plants. The business, controlled by state-owned British Nuclear Group when the incident occurred in July 2007, has since been taken over by three private contractors, Amec, Areva and URS Washington, who work under the Nuclear Management Partners banner. Carlisle crown court fined Sellafield Ltd £75,000 with a further £26,000 costs. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, which owns the Sellafield site which the consortium manages, said the fine would be paid by insurers. Mark Bassett, the HSE's superintending nuclear inspector, said he was satisfied with the \"relatively high\" penalty imposed. \"Although the radiation doses in this case were below the statutory dose limits, they could potentially have been higher. They should have been zero,\" he said. \"The incident highlights the importance of Sellafield Ltd following its own arrangements for protecting workers, when undertaking potentially hazardous work with the risk of exposure to radiation. Sellafield Ltd should have properly assessed those risks, and then appropriately planned, organised and carried out the work.\" Two contractors were drilling an area of floor, under Sellafield Ltd's supervision, when they were contaminated with plutonium by the dust produced from the drilling, some of which they inhaled. There was no immediate impact on their health although they received a significant radiation dose. A spokesman for Sellafield Ltd said last night: \"This incident happened more than a year before Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) took over control of Sellafield Ltd, bringing with them a wealth of experience and expertise from around the globe. \"Since arriving on site, the new management team has introduced a range of initiatives aimed at improving safety and performance and has focussed on ensuring disciplined professionalism in all that we do.\" In the past Sellafield Ltd has been fined up to £500,000 for more serious safety lapses and the HSE recently warned that the chances of a major incident were still too high."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/nov/05/barack-obama-visits-india","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-05T17:07:57Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama heads to India on trade mission","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/05/barack-obama-visits-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/nov/05/barack-obama-visits-india","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama heads to India on trade mission","bodyText":"The troops are deployed in the city parks, the carefully selected venues have been repainted and the specially trained monkey-catchers are at their posts. Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive in India tomorrow, the fifth US president to visit India. Obama and officials have been careful to underline the benefits of the trip for the US economy. \"The primary purpose is to take a bunch of US companies and open up markets so that we can sell in Asia, in some of the fastest-growing markets in the world, and we can create jobs here in the United States of America,\" Obama said yesterday. Officials also hope the trip – the longest Obama has undertaken as president – will reinforce ties with \"major democracies that share ... values\" and mitigate Indian fears of being marginalised as America seeks a way out of Afghanistan. Obama will land in Mumbai, the Indian commercial capital, and will make his first public statement at a memorial to the civilians killed in an attack by Islamist militants from the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba group on targets in the city in November 2008. The president and his wife, Michelle, will stay at the Taj Mahal hotel, which was badly damaged in the attack. All 570 rooms have been booked, with an entire floor set aside for the president. The hotel's seafront has been a high-security zone for several days. \"Going [to Mumbai] first will send a very strong signal on US solidarity against terrorism and will help reassure India,\" said C Raja Mohan, a respected Indian foreign affairs analyst. One point of recent friction has been question marks over the extent to which US agencies shared intelligence with Indian counterparts about David Headley, an American-Pakistani drug trafficker turned militant who carried out surveillance for the Mumbai attacks. Delhi is also concerned by the flow of aid, subsidies and military technology to Pakistan's military, as well as the role its hostile neighbour is playing in Afghanistan. \"If the price to secure some incremental Pakistani co-operation [in facilitating the withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan] is to go slow on a blockbuster strategic alliance with India then [the American attitude is] 'so be it',\" Ashok Malik, a political commentator, noted in Hindustan Times newspaper last week. While Indian officials and diplomats are looking for signs of a new US strategic vision for South Asia giving them a central role counterbalancing China, US officials have restricted themselves to noting the \"emergence\" of India and its middle class and observing that \"regional dynamics will change fast\" over coming years. Obama's entourage is crammed with top officials from departments of commerce and agriculture, and contains 250 prospective investors. In Mumbai the president will meet leading businessmen and visit a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi. In Delhi, in addition to a visit to a Mughal-era Islamic tomb, an address to parliament and a state dinner, there will be a series of meetings to finalise, it is hoped, multibillion-dollar defence deals and other commercial agreements. India is expected to spend at least $52bn (£33bn) on new fighters, artillery systems, transport planes and helicopters in coming years. US officials are hoping for measures ranging from reforms of ownership regulations to changes in intellectual property law, which would ease access to Indian markets. The Indians want restrictions on the transfer of dual-use technology lifted and an explicit statement backing India's bid for permanent membership of the UN security council. The former is considered possible by analysts, the latter extremely unlikely. On a visit in 2006, George Bush controversially gave formal blessing for India's civil nuclear power programme. Few expect the same kind of breakthrough this time. \"High on show, short on substance,\" said a headline in the Daily News Analysis last week. But no one predicts an upset either. \"At the end, it will look good. The Indians understand they need to be seen to be helping the US with some decent economic deals. Obama understands he needs to reassure India that the momentum in relations generated by Bush is still there,\" Mohan said. After a few shaky first steps, Obama has established good relations with Manmohan Singh, the 78-year-old Indian prime minister. \"I don't think [the Obama adminstration] is looking for an immediate response to any gestures. This is being seen as a long-term relationship. We are just putting money in the bank for the future,\" said Richard Fontaine, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Centre for a New American Security."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2011/oct/14/terry-pratchett-life-writing","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-14T21:55:00Z","webTitle":"A life in writing: Terry Pratchett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/14/terry-pratchett-life-writing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2011/oct/14/terry-pratchett-life-writing","fields":{"headline":"A life in writing: Terry Pratchett","bodyText":"Terry Pratchett is having a statue made. It's a statue of a goddess, and he thinks she ought probably to be smoking a cigarette, and to be showing one breast. \"There should be an urn, too. If there's an urn it's not porn – that's a Discworld cliché,\" he says, a bubble of laughter in his voice. The goddess is one of Pratchett's own invention: Narrativia, the deity of narrative who smiles on writers (and perhaps especially sunnily on her creator). Discworld, created by Pratchett 28 years ago, is the fantasy world held up by four elephants balanced on the back of a giant turtle. It's a concept which started out as an affectionate lampoon of the sword-and-sorcery fantasy genre, but it has, over the years, become an increasingly sophisticated swipe at contemporary society, pointing out the ridiculousness of everything from Hollywood to the postal service, newspapers, banks and football. And Narrativia has been beside him all the way. \"If you've been a good boy and worked at what you're doing, then the goddess Narrativia will smile on you,\" he says, recounting his delight at a particular piece of her work, when he was writing Thief of Time more than a decade ago. He decided to call one of his characters Ronnie Soak. Soak is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse – the one who left before they got famous. His name was picked at random, so Pratchett was astonished when he noticed what it sounded like backwards. Suddenly, he knew of what this particular horseman would be a harbinger. \"I thought chaos – yes! Chaos, the oldest,\" he says. \"Stuff just turns up like that.\" In typically ebullient fashion, Thief of Time also contains a sprinkling of yetis, a clock which will stop time and the Monks of History, whose job it is to manage time, moving it from where it isn't needed (underwater) to where it is (cities). AS Byatt said on the book's publication that it should have been nominated for the Booker prize. But it was a fantasy novel; it was funny; it was a bestseller. Unsurprisingly enough, it wasn't.And despite Pratchett's immense popularity (75 million copies sold of his 67 books), it took a while for the literary establishment to notice – apart from Byatt. She is, she says, still a fan today, calling him \"a great storyteller, and splendidly inventive with the English language – both as farce and as comedy and as (successful) dreadful jokes for teenagers. I also think he's wise and morally complicated. And grown up, although he appeals to the young.\" It wasn't until 2001 that Pratchett won his first major literary prize, the Carnegie medal, for his first Discworld novel for children, the Pied Piper-riffing The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents. He's since been knighted for services to literature (\"I think they must have had a bit of a snigger. Let's give a fantasy writer a knighthood, he should have some fun with that\") and received a handful of honorary degrees, with Trinity College Dublin making him a professor. Today, Professor Sir Terry Pratchett is sitting in his local pub, a half of Ferret in front of him, awaiting his bubble and squeak. He's happy to be talking about his books; ever since he announced to the world in late 2007 the \"embuggerance\" that is his early onset Alzheimer's – or posterior cortical atrophy – he has been swamped with media attention as he fights to raise awareness of the disease. Attention has only increased since he publicly backed assisted dying, making the moving BBC documentary Choosing to Die about a man's last moments at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland earlier this year. The interviews, though, tend to focus on the disease, and he says he often has \"to fight to get the fact I actually write books in\". His latest, Snuff, is the 39th Discworld novel and a take on the police procedural. It has moments of snort-out-loud laughter (the paddle steamer named the Wonderful Fanny, the Jane Austen vignette – see below). But it is a remarkably dark novel, with a beleaguered, despised race of goblins at its heart. \"Snuff says everyone knows goblins are bad, but if you see them as bad and treat them as such, then they will be bad. And our society could actually take a few words of advice from that,\" says Pratchett. \"It's just a way - a very light-hearted way – of commenting about society but seeing it from the outside.\" Some of the book was \"quite harrowing\" to write, but \"you need the dark and then the light shows up\". Revealing his Alzheimer's in 2007, Pratchett said: \"I think there's time for at least a few more books yet.\" Snuff's publication brings the number to three since the announcement, and he's currently in the middle of writing three more – his autobiography, a science-fiction tale he's co-authoring with Stephen Baxter and a historical novel set in Victorian London, with shades of George McDonald Fraser. They're all a step away from his usual fantasy zone, but \"I could write a book and I could set it in Tombstone, Arizona, I could have cowboys and stage coaches, and the moment I put in one fucking dragon, they'd call me a fantasy writer. You can take out the fucking for the newspaper. But once you are a fantasy writer it's always going to be fantasy.\" Born in 1948 and growing up in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire with two \"very good parents who didn't quite understand what it was they were growing but did all the right things, like pushing me\", Pratchett got his \"first sniff of the grease paint\" aged 13, when he published a story in the school magazine. It told of the fallout after the devil employed estate agents to make hell popular; the teenage writer was later paid £14 for it from a science-fiction magazine, buying his first typewriter with the proceeds. In writing his autobiography, he admits he may be putting a writerly shine on his past, but he believes his literary fate stretches back to when he first picked up a copy of The Wind in the Willows, aged 10. \"Mole, Rat, Toad, Badger. All different sizes. All can go inside one another's houses. All wear clothes. The toad, by no means a looker, can pass as a washerwoman. That enthralled me,\" he says. Beaconsfield library was \"the cannabis\", \"the coke\" came when he discovered a nearby secondhand bookshop, \"the right kind, it smelt of secondhand books\", and devoured the Molesworth books, Sellar and Yeatman – all the best humorists. \"And that was it. I was mainlining that stuff.\" He also became obsessed with Punch magazine, working his way through from its beginnings in the early Victorian era right the way through to the 1960s. There is an eclectic collection of books scattered around his office, from Prehistoric Animals of Australia and New Guinea to the English-Tibetan Dictionary, a tome on Scots dialect, a history of clocks and watches and an exploration of London's Victorian sewers. \"You read a book about feeding Nelson's navy and you come up with something very interesting about potatoes. It's not learning, it's QI learning, which we mostly have these days. But mine is a bit more joined up.\" Conversation with Pratchett is filled with facts and trivia, from lead poisoning and honey wagons in wild west silver mines to toshers and Joseph Bazalgette, the Victorian engineer who created a sewer network for London. \"Do you know what a tosher was? In a few seconds you will. Toshers were the young men, mostly, who went down into the sewers, pre-Bazalgette.\" Pratchett left school one year into his A-levels, after he was offered a job on the local paper, the Bucks Free Press, aged 17. He believes \"there can be no better grounding for a lifetime as an author than to see humanity in all its various guises through the lens of the reporter for the town. All the court cases, such crimes as there were. You got to know the coppers, they told you stuff – for a young man with a pencil, you could do what you wanted, really.\" The most hated job on the paper was the children's corner, which included a birthday list and writing a little story. Pratchett took it on – \"I thought, stories, I can do stories\" – and began to write what would be his first novel, The Carpet People, as a short series. He met a publisher, Colin Smythe (now his agent), told him about the story, and ended up with a book deal. The Carpet People was positively, if quietly, received when it was first published 40 years ago, and Pratchett continued as a journalist for various papers while publishing two science-fiction novels. He had moved to a job as a publicity officer for the Central Electricity Generating Board with responsibility for three nuclear power stations when the first Discworld novel, The Colour of Magic, was published in 1983. Pratchett has, in the past, called it both a plundering of and a tribute to Tolkien and the other fantasy writers – from ER Eddison to Ursula Le Guin. His popularity began to snowball, and he recalls the phone call he received from his agent telling him he'd just landed a six-book deal, meaning he could write full time from 1987. \"I remember sitting on the lawn – and a bit like in an old-fashioned Disney cartoon, I can see little bluebirds around my head – and thinking if I play my cards right I will never need to do an honest day's work again. It was a moment of pure happiness.\" What Discworld does best, Pratchett believes, is to put forward the proposal \"that it ain't necessarily so\". It's the GK Chesterton view of fantasy, that it can \"take that which is familiar and everyday and therefore no more seen, and pick it up and turn it around and show it to the reader from a new point of view, so that once again they see it for the first time\". He points to the first appearance of the witch Tiffany Aching, a central character in his young adult titles – the precocious nine-year-old puts various fairy stories through the wringer of her enquiring mind. Hansel and Gretel? \"Excuse me? No one has an oven big enough to get a whole person in, and what made the children think they could just walk around eating people's houses in any case?\" he writes in The Wee Free Men. Tiffany looks at a children's book, says Pratchett, \"and it says 'in the middle of the forest there was a wicked witch', and she says: 'where's the evidence?' and turns things on its head\". The earlier Discworld novels are all about the jokes; as Pratchett has matured as a writer, they have become less jokey and more funny. \"The further back you go the more juvenile they appear,\" he says. \"There's funny and joking, the two are different … As things progressed, both with adult and junior books, I found that in subtle kinds of ways, without being preachy at all, you could suggest rather interesting things.\" Neil Gaiman, with whom he wrote Good Omens (1991), agrees: \"He's got better and better over the years – he now follows the story, not the jokes, while I think the early books followed the jokes … He makes it look easy. He never writes ugly sentences, or wastes a word, and at his best he says something in a way which means you can never again see it in the way you saw it before.\" Like his books, Pratchett \"seems to have become more himself as the years have gone on,\" Gaiman says. They have been friends for almost 30 years. \"I like the white-bearded incarnation. If we had a proper old-fashioned queen she would undoubtedly have Terry as her advisor, and then only the right people would have their heads cut off … He's funny, generous, tetchy, very moved by a sense of fairness. He would have been a good master criminal I think.\" Snuff is the third novel Pratchett has written using voice-recognition technology rather than a keyboard: he is no longer able to touch type, although he can prod words out letter by letter. When we go back to his home, nestled in a valley in the Wiltshire hills, Pratchett is keen to show off the software. \"Save work,\" he thunders at the six ranked screens on which he works. \"Get spell box,\" he demonstrates, and is immediately obeyed – although with a selection of words to choose from, rather than anything magical. \"It's a great nerdy thing to play with. The first thing they did was put all my books in electronic form through the computer, and overnight it made a pretty good fist at words like Granny Weatherwax and Rincewind. I have to teach it new words. I think the most abstruse one we've put in here is ferkidoodle.\" If writing in this fashion has changed his work at all, it has made it \"more conversational\", he believes, but \"it's actually just kept me being a writer\", and without writing \"I suspect I'd have bogged off to Switzerland otherwise. Well not really but you know what I mean – I'd have been useless to live with. But with this – it just keeps going as long as I can speak.\" As for bogging off to Switzerland, \"we have the papers here and that's that\". He's not keen to commit himself further. \"I'm slightly hesitant – someone told me when I was diagnosed, someone in the bizz, that I'd probably got about two years. That was rather a long time ago … It's certainly something I would contemplate, but at the moment I have absolutely no reason whatsoever to do it.\" Posterior cortical atrophy, he says, \"sits on top of Alzheimer's – you have to go all the way through PCA before you hit the Alzheimer's\". Yes, he gets memory lapses, but even then he isn't certain it's because of the disease. \"I mean I'm 63 now, and on top of that you get things like sciatica and all the things of getting older, so you're never really certain what is what, you've got no control to measure yourself against.\" He's still backing the campaign for assisted dying, though. \"The people who are opposed to it – you wouldn't want to print the word I use about them … I'm in it for the fight, rather than anything to do with me.\" But despite the attention, and acclaim, this latest battle has brought him, Pratchett is not sure about his oft-cited new designation as national treasure. \"I don't know if it's national treasure. There are some people who hate my guts. But that goes with the territory.\" He grins with pleasure at the thought of their loathing. \"And the more I can make them hate my guts the better.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2008/jul/17/rollsroycegroup.nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-07-16T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Power: Rolls-Royce seeks role in UK's nuclear power revival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/17/rollsroycegroup.nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/jul/17/rollsroycegroup.nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Power: Rolls-Royce seeks role in UK's nuclear power revival","bodyText":"Rolls-Royce, one of the most prestigious names in manufacturing, has thrown its weight behind the nuclear power renaissance by unveiling plans for a division it believes could become one of its biggest. The company, best known for its aircraft engines, said it was already working for companies with nuclear businesses such as EDF of France and wanted to act as a supplier in the construction and operation of new plants in both Britain and emerging markets such as China. Sir John Rose, chief executive, said: \"Our experience is directly applicable to all phases of new-build programmes that are planned in the UK and globally, and also to the upgrade of existing plants. Our capability is unique in the UK and matched by only a handful of companies worldwide.\" Rolls-Royce stressed that while nuclear power stations could overtake its highly successful marine operation, which has 7,000 staff and annual revenues of £1.5bn, this could take many years. The company is carrying out peer-review work on two nuclear power station design assessments for EDF and Westinghouse in the US. They are being put forward to the British government as part of an expected nuclear building programme in this country, which could see as many as eight plants built with the first ready to start in 2018 if all goes well. Rolls-Royce has appointed a new president of civil nuclear and is set to establish a team of managers and staff to build up the business, which will be based in Derby, where it already has 1,200 staff. The company claims to have been involved in the atomic business for half a century, largely through providing design, safety justification, nuclear manufacture and in-service support for the Royal Navy's nuclear reactors and operates atomic sites at Devonport and Dounreay. Rolls-Royce also has some civil nuclear experience, having supplied components to Sizewell B in Suffolk. It also provides safety critical instrumentation to EDF's 58 nuclear plants in France and through the Data Systems &amp; Solutions business it established in 1999. The decision by Rolls-Royce to enter the nuclear arena will be welcomed by the government as it brings a credible British manufacturing name to a local market that could be dominated by the French through EDF and Areva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/nov/18/david-cameron-green-matters","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-18T18:19:55Z","webTitle":"David Cameron breaks silence on green matters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/18/david-cameron-green-matters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/18/david-cameron-green-matters","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron breaks silence on green matters","bodyText":"The \"greenest government ever\" should be a type example of a phrase that casts a hostage to fortune. But the statement, made by David Cameron just days after taking office in May, was then followed by near deathly silence on all green matters. Today, in front of the massed ranks of the House of Commons liaison committee, he broke that silence. The key thing he revealed is how brilliant a political performer he is: affable, unflappable and unpindownable. But here's what he revealed – and did not – on green issues. (Watch it all here, from about 15:24 onwards.) Green investment bank: On the face of it crystal clear here. Asked by Labour's Joan Walley whether it would really, truly be a bank, and not a fund, whether a dispute was likely between the department of business and the treasury, and whether he would take a personal interest, he said: \"Yes, yes and yes, to all of those questions.\" But as Tim Webb elegantly reveals here, there a lot of wriggle room in a simple word like \"bank\". A government-backed bank could leverage vastly more investment than a private bank for low-carbon energy, energy efficiency and other major projects to cut the UK's greenhouse gases and tackle climate change. Criteria of success for being the \"greenest government ever\": The conservative Tim Yeo asked what these might be. Cameron replied that the structural reform plans for each department would \"give you the weapons to beat us with if we don't perform\", while acknowledging that the plans themselves were \"not a thrilling read\". The plans – also called business plans by officials – set out a timetable of action for departments, and Cameron rattled off the list of things in Decc's plan (PDF): the green investment bank, carbon capture and storage funding, electricity market reform, 10% cuts in government's energy use in a year, the renewable heat incentive and more. Impeccable command of detail from the prime minister, but given that the business plan is almost entirely devoid of numbers, it's hard to see how that can be used to hold the coaltion to account. Sustainable development: Walley took on Cameron on how he was weaving the need for sustainable development into the business of government, ie making sure environmental and social impacts were considered when making decisions, not purely economic ones. Why abolish the Sustainable Development Commission, she asked? \"Obviously we made difficult decisions in the spending round,\" was the bland reply, before claiming many green plans had been protected and that environment groups had given the whole package a \"warm reception\". Cameron said the UK's carbon budgets and his pledge to \"transparent information\" on the government's own green performance would keep the coalition honest on its green pledges. Carbon capture and storage: Very clear here, with Yeo asking had the government worked out how to pay for the three demonstration plants not funded in the comprehensive spending review. No, said Cameron. The first demonstration has got £1bn of public money, the rest will, I think, be funded by a levy on electricity and gas bills. The power to raise the levy was in the energy bill passed just before the election. Flood defence funding: The Conservative MP Anne McIntosh tackled the PM on this, amid accusations of cuts. Cameron said that £2.1bn would be spent over the next four year, roughly the same as the last four years, and that it should be possible for local communities to \"top this up\" from their own pockets. Forestry Commission land sell-off: No holding back here from the PM in the face of fears over whether sold-off forests would preserve access and wildlife: \"I don't think it is absolutely vital who owns it,\" and \"I think the innovative financing we are looking at shouldn't worry people.\" I'd humbly suggest that in the wake of the great banking crash, the idea of \"innovative financing\" is utterly terrifying. Nuclear power: Cameron backed new nukes – no surprises there – but used a telling phrase: \"no specific subsidies\". Both parties in the coalition have pledged no subsidy to the nuclear industry but his phrase today does not rule out subsidies that apply to all low-carbon energy, even if nukes will be the biggest benefactor. Energy prices and market reform: \"Prices are on an upward trajectory,\" Cameron said. Why? \"Because so much of our electricity infrastructure is out of date, because so much of our nuclear industry is about to come to the end of its life.\" He also articulated the government's desire to pull back from the fully liberalised free market that Labour created and go for a \"slightly more planned view\".

Iberdrola – which owns Scottish Power – has joined rival energy supplier Scottish and Southern and the French utility firm GdF in paying £70m for an option to buy the 190-hectare (469-acre) site, following an auction run by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. The money will go towards the NDA's £75bn clean-up operation, which is funded by taxpayers. The Scottish executive has banned the construction of new reactors in Scotland, which is already home to six ageing nuclear reactors. But the UK's \"big six\" energy suppliers – including the two Scottish companies – are desperate not to be frozen out of the new nuclear programme earmarked for England and Wales. They are preparing to invest billions in return for the rights to supply the reactors' electricity to their customers. The Scottish-led consortium said it was looking to build reactors with a total capacity of up to 3.6gw – enough to power 3.5m homes. If it receives planning permission, it would begin construction in around 2015. It is the third group to have acquired sites suitable for new reactors – German firms RWE npower and E.ON have teamed up and earlier this year bought three parcels of land from the NDA near existing nuclear reactors for almost £400m. EDF Energy last year bought nuclear generator British Energy, which experts say holds the best sites for new build. Centrica has now taken a 20% stake in the venture. The land adjoining Sellafield is the least commercially attractive, a fact which is reflected in its much lower price tag. The grid connection would have to be significantly upgraded to connect a modern reactor. It is also a remote site far from big cities and other potential electricity customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/may/11/us-climate-bill-deepwater-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-11T09:57:44Z","webTitle":"White House aims to use Deepwater disaster to win votes for US climate bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/11/us-climate-bill-deepwater-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/may/11/us-climate-bill-deepwater-disaster","fields":{"headline":"White House aims to use Deepwater disaster to win votes for US climate bill","bodyText":"Senators are set to take a last run at producing a climate and energy law tomorrow, betting on the spectre of environmental disaster raised by the BP oil spill to build support for a comprehensive overhaul of America's energy strategy. But despite a strong push from the Obama administration, there are concerns the debate about the energy future could be lost in the wrangling about offshore oil drilling permits. The official roll-out by Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman caps eight months of negotiations with political figures and industry executives aimed at getting broad support in Congress for shifting the economy away from coal and oil and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate legislation passed by the US Senate could unblock a major obstacle which prevented agreement on a binding global deal at last year's Copenhagen summit. \"We are more encouraged today that we can secure the necessary votes to pass this legislation this year in part because the last weeks have given everyone with a stake in this issue a heightened understanding that as a nation, we can no longer wait to solve this problem which threatens our economy, our security and our environment,\" Kerry and Lieberman said in a joint statement. The White House is also trying to use the disaster to make a case for a bill. \"This accident, this tragedy, is actually heightening people's interest in energy in this country and in wanting a different energy plan,\" Carol Browner, the White House climate adviser told Bloomberg television at the weekend. Time is fast running out for climate and energy legislation, with Democrats expected to suffer heavy losses in the mid-term elections. But the thinking in Congress is that the economic disaster in the Gulf is more likely to hurt, than help, such efforts in large part because offshore drilling was a key part of the proposals. The two Senators deliberately gave a boost to offshore drilling under a strategy that saw the Obama administration and the White House working to build support among Republicans and industries that stood to be affected by the new regulations. Early drafts promised to build more nuclear power plants and expand offshore oil drilling. The pro-business message was further underlined in plans for a roll-out originally scheduled for last month, which envisaged a public show of support from big oil companies, including BP. The proposal is expected to require a 17% cut in emissions levels from 2005 levels by 2020. Earlier versions suggested a sector-by-sector approach to emissions cuts. Electricity producers would face a cap in 2012, with heavily polluting industries such as steel and cement manufacturers winning a delay until 2012. In addition to financial incentives for nuclear power and offshore oil and gas drilling, the proposals would have created funds for carbon capture and storage. The proposals would also have curbed the powers of the Environmental Protection Agency to acting on emissions, and would have stopped states, such as California, from imposing more stringent environmental regulations. Such concessions to the nuclear and oil industry, while angering environmentalists, do not appear to have created a solid bank of Republican support. Kerry and Lieberman lost their lone Republican ally, Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Senator, who initially withdrew his support over a dispute about immigration, now argues the spill in the Gulf has wrecked any chance of success. \"There are not nearly 60 votes today and I do not see them materialising until we deal with the uncertainty of the immigration debate and the consequences of the oil spill,\" he said in a statement. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, also cast doubt this week on the likelihood of getting a comprehensive climate and energy bill through the Sentate. He told Spanish language Univision network a limited energy-only bill — that would not cap emissions — stood a better chance. Meanwhile, the battle lines are being drawn on offshore drilling. Some Democratic Senators are now threatening to vote against any climate bill that allows expanded drilling. \"I will have a very hard time ever voting for offshore drilling again,\" Senator Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat told reporters. Others, including Graham, remain adamant in their support for drilling. Environmental organisations are also expanding their campaigns against drilling, both in the Gulf of Mexico, and new projects scheduled for Alaska. That could force yet another revision to the proposal by the time it sees the light of day on Wednesday. \"The one part we are still talking about is the offshore drilling,\" Lieberman told reproters. \"The other parts are really in pretty solid shape.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/oct/27/hugh-muir-diary-bnp-dowson","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-26T23:15:00Z","webTitle":"Hugh Muir's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/27/hugh-muir-diary-bnp-dowson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/oct/27/hugh-muir-diary-bnp-dowson","fields":{"headline":"Diary","bodyText":"• Difficult to do justice to the many twists and turns that confront and confound Nick Griffin in the twilight of his short time in public life. His people are leaving, the finances of his British National party – £500,000 in debt – are unravelling, and he just can't get the Equalities Commission off his back. How to keep up with it all? Observers suggest a BBC News-style ticker. And it would say that these are the darkest days yet because, in recent times, the beleaguered Griffin has left much of the heavy lifting within the party – the fundraising, admin etc – to his very good friend, the virulent anti-abortionist and Orange lodger Jim Dowson. And that was fine. But now that things are getting sticky, Dowson is moving on, it seems. Thus, the BNP operations centre in Belfast, which was run by Dowson, is no longer available. This may be a particular irritant to Griffin's daughter, who was deployed there as his eyes and ears. Dowson was also the mastermind of the party's Troops Out of Iraq petition, which harvested valuable data about potential members. But as he has moved on, there is, sources say, no guarantee that Griffin will see any of it. Reviled, friendless; it wasn't supposed to end like this. But, poor Nick: it seems it will. • Happy days, by contrast, for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which, amid the general retrenchment, will have its budget protected. The money will continue to flow: around £3bn a year. That calls for a celebration. But then some would say the authority has already had one, for last month it held a two-day conference at the five-star Lowry Hotel in Manchester. The conference cost £52,000 – that's £500 for each delegate. Exactly the sort of expenditure we must protect. • And we will, for one might argue that those in favour of \"clean, green\" nuclear have never had it so good. There is the coalition, keen to go ahead with more nuclear power stations. Then the leader of the opposition, Ed Miliband – whose partner, Justine Thornton, an environmental lawyer, did stuff on renewables for the German energy giant E.ON, one of the biggest players in the nuclear industry. Meanwhile, developing Labour's brave new policy on waste is Jamie Reed, MP for Copeland. He was once a PR man for Sellafield. • And it is possible that the French had never heard of the British Ukip MEP Derek Clark before this week. But they know him now, for his Euroscepticism. And because, according to translators at the European parliament, he is the man no one can hear when he speaks. This somewhat limited view of Clark's abilities emerged as two French interpreters left their microphones on, so private discussions about him were broadcast to the chamber. \"I did not hear,\" one said to the other. \"He has something in his mouth. He has a problem of false teeth.\" But that's not so, says Derek, in a letter to the paper Libération. I may be 77, but \"they are my real teeth and they still allow me to eat apples throughout the day, thus giving me a youthful complexion\". Liberation may be of the left, but it recognises a good sport when it sees one. \"Derek Clark, 77, still young and loves apples,\" is how it describes the East Midlands MEP. And its verdict on his decision to set the record straight: \"So British.\" • Finally, an apology from Father Ed Tomlinson, the conservative priest in Kent who has been having a few problems with his parish blog. \"When putting up a link to the Forward in Faith assembly entitled 'Listen Again' I searched for images of people engaged in the process of listening,\" he says. \"In the end I opted for a black and white shot of some old buffers with amusing moustaches listening to the wireless. Unfortunately, and to my embarrassment, it turns out that they were Nazis who, after someone took time to research this picture, were listening to an address given by Adolf Hitler.\" I didn't know, says Father Ed. And maybe he didn't, but one who reacted to his apology remains puzzled. \"I did draw this to your attention (first comment on that thread), but would you listen to me…?\" says the poster ruefully. He did indeed. \"Is that Hitler's bunker?\" was the question he posed at the time. There was a clue there surely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/aug/04/britishenergygroupbusiness.nuclearpower","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-03T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Energy: Centrica may reactivate plans to bid for nuclear power generator","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/04/britishenergygroupbusiness.nuclearpower","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/aug/04/britishenergygroupbusiness.nuclearpower","fields":{"headline":"Energy: Centrica may reactivate plans to bid for nuclear power generator","bodyText":"Centrica could dust off plans for a merger with British Energy if France's EDF abandons its attempt to take over Britain's nuclear power generator. Centrica, which owns British Gas, looked at the prospect of an all-paper offer for British Energy this year but put its hopes on hold as the odds mounted that a big continental European player would make a cash bid. Last week EDF came within a whisker of agreeing a deal with the British Energy board but the 765p-a-share price failed to meet the expectations of two key shareholders, Invesco and M&amp;G, forcing the board to turn the bid down. Centrica yesterday declined to comment on a report in the Sunday Telegraph that chief executive Sam Laidlaw would use the traditional round of post-results meetings with the group's leading shareholders to sound out the likelihood of their supporting an all-paper deal. In addition to holding key stakes in the nuclear generator Invesco and M&amp;G are both shareholders in Centrica. Industry sources said it would be natural for the question of British Energy to be raised in discussions with investors having a foot in both camps, but they were cautious about the extent to which Laidlaw would want to push the issue at this stage. Centrica is keen to be involved in the UK's nuclear new-build programme and was tipped to take a 25% share in British Energy in the event of a successful bid from EDF. It is understood to have put its own merger plans on hold because it did not have the firepower to launch a cash offer - seen as more attractive to shareholders than a share-swap deal. If it did revive the scheme Centrica would need the backing not only of British Energy's institutional shareholders but also that of the government, which owns a 35% stake. British Energy is central to the government's hopes of a nuclear new-build programme as the sites of its existing plants are seen as the most suitable for new nuclear capacity. The government expressed its disappointment on Friday that the EDF deal had not come to fruition. Though business and enterprise secretary John Hutton said then that the strategy did not hinge on a single deal, the government is understood to be keen to see the EDF/British Energy deal revived. However, if EDF did walk way from a deal with British Energy and no one else emerged with a cash bid Centrica may feel an all-paper offer could have a chance as the only deal available. \"If the EDF offer did disappear I'm sure that Centrica would be interested, but that is a long way down the track,\" said one observer. \"There is no guarantee British Energy would want to discuss it.\" Neither EDF nor British Energy would comment yesterday on whether they planned to hold further substantive talks in the immediate future. Both are expected to want to take several days to \"allow the dust to settle\", as one source put it. EDF is said to be neither ruling anything in nor out at this stage. It is, however, facing a series of difficult decisions if it does decide to press ahead with a renewed approach. Though it knows that the 765p is not enough for all shareholders, it is unclear what level would be acceptable and the company is thought to be reluctant to bid again only to run into a further rebuff. There have been suggestions that the state-controlled group could need to make a bid of more than £8 a share - a far stretch from its initial approach of less than £7 and its more recent 765p. EDF and British Energy both have alternative strategies. The French firm has been acquiring potential sites and British Energy could seek to develop individual sites through a series of joint ventures with different partners."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jan/26/state-of-the-union-address-obama-sputnik-moment","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-26T08:08:00Z","webTitle":"Obama's state of the union address: US must seize 'Sputnik moment'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/26/state-of-the-union-address-obama-sputnik-moment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jan/26/state-of-the-union-address-obama-sputnik-moment","fields":{"headline":"Obama's state of the union address: US must seize 'Sputnik moment'","bodyText":"Barack Obama warned of the threat to US economic power and global influence from China's rise as he appealed for Republicans to abandon demands for huge budget cuts and back the biggest government investment programme since the 1960s space race. In the annual state of the union address, the US president appealed for the Republicans to co-operate to \"win the future\" and said the present generation faces its \"Sputnik moment\", requiring government investment in research, infrastructure and education. He said that would be paid for, in part, by eliminating subsidies to hugely profitable oil companies. \"Half a century ago, when the Soviets beat us into space with the launch of a satellite called Sputnik, we had no idea how we'd beat them to the moon,\" he told congress. \"The science wasn't there yet. Nasa didn't even exist. \"But after investing in better research and education, we didn't just surpass the Soviets – we unleashed a wave of innovation that created new industries and millions of new jobs. This is our generation's Sputnik moment. At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country or somewhere else. \"It's whether the hard work and industry of our people is rewarded. It's whether we sustain the leadership that has made America not just a place on a map, but a light to the world.\" The president's call – in a speech that ostensibly called for unity but laid bare the ideological divide with the Republicans – was swiftly rejected by his opponents, who said that the real threat to US global dominance was the country's rapidly deepening debt. They said that what Obama called investment, they call borrowing and spending. But instant polling on CNN showed a rise in support for the president's policies, with more than three-quarters of respondents saying they had a favourable view of the speech. A similar number said they were more optimistic after the address. The president said the US faced a changed world, adding: \"The rules have changed. In a single generation, revolutions in technology have transformed the way we live, work and do business. \"Meanwhile, nations like China and India realised that, with some changes of their own, they could compete in this new world. And so they started educating their children earlier and longer, with greater emphasis on maths and science. \"They're investing in research and new technologies. Just recently, China became home to the world's largest private solar research facility, and the world's fastest computer.\" Obama said he would send a budget to congress that invested in research – especially clean energy technology, which he said could see 1m electric vehicles on US roads within four years and break dependence on fossil fuels, although his clean energy commitment involves a heavy reliance on nuclear power. But he did not directly speak about climate change or global warming. He also called for a leap forward in educational standards, saying: \"Think about it. Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree. And yet as many as a quarter of our students aren't even finishing high school.\" While appealing for co-operation, the president laid bare the ideological divide with the Republicans. In the face of a Republican leadership demanding spending cuts and action on the deficit, he proposed a five year freeze on non-security related spending that would require \"painful cuts\". But they come nowhere near those proposed by his political opponents who instinctively recoil from the idea of greatly increased government spending on research, education and promises to greatly improve internet access and expand high speed rail. Hours before Obama's speech, House Republicans passed a resolution in support of rolling back spending to levels to where they were before Obama came to power – something requiring far deeper cuts than those he is proposing. Obama attempted to pressure the Republican leadership over its threat of obstructionist tactics by appealing for it to consider the national good. \"With their votes, the American people determined that governing will now be a shared responsibility between parties,\" he said. \"New laws will only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans. We will move forward together, or not at all – for the challenges we face are bigger than party, and bigger than politics. \"Cutting the deficit by gutting our investments in innovation and education is like lightening an overloaded airplane by removing its engine. It may feel like you're flying high at first, but it won't take long before you'll feel the impact.\" Republicans, however, spurned Obama in a response by congressman Paul Ryan, who said the real threat to US dominance was the country's huge budget. \"We are at a moment where, if government's growth is left unchecked and unchallenged, America's best century will be considered our past century,\" he said. \"This is a future in which we will transform our social safety net into a hammock, which lulls able-bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency.\" Ryan said that, if the government did not address spending, the US would face the same sort of crisis as those gripping Ireland, Greece and Britain. \"Depending on bureaucracy to foster innovation, competitiveness and wise consumer choices has never worked – and it won't work now,\" he said. \"The facts are clear: since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25% for domestic government agencies – an 84% increase when you include the failed stimulus. \"All of this new government spending was sold as 'investment'. Yet, after two years, the unemployment rate remains above 9% and government has added over $3tn to our debt.\" Obama defended his controversial healthcare reforms – which Republicans are attempting to overturn – saying he was open to improving them but would not abandon the principle of ensuring healthcare for almost every American. Members of Congress wore ribbons in support of Gabrielle Giffords, their colleague who was wounded during an assassination attempt in Tucson in which six other people were killed, and applauded the mention of her name. Several members of both parties moved over to the other side's seating in a demonstration of bipartisanship in the wake of the debate over aggressive political rhetoric following the Tucson shootings.

Emerson fired the latest shot in the bidding war for Chloride by offering to pay 375p per share for the group, valuing it at £997m. This is 15% more than the 325p per share that Swedish engineering group ABB has put on the table. Shares in Chloride jumped 11% to 387p, indicating hopes among City traders that ABB might come back with a counter offer. Chloride has already accepted ABB's £860m bid, which was made three weeks ago, but Emerson hopes it can tempt the company's shareholders to back its proposal instead. \"We are today making what we believe to be a very attractive all-cash offer to Chloride shareholders,\" said Emerson chairman David Farr. Farr argued that merging Emerson and Chloride made sense because both are already leading players in the market for uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems. In contrast, ABB hopes to integrate Chloride's products into its existing power and automation technologies. \"The UPS market has become a place where specialist industry knowledge, geographic access and global scale are more important than ever before. The geographic reach and offerings of Emerson and Chloride are highly complementary and highlight the strategic importance of the transaction,\" said Farr. Chloride's UPS systems are used worldwide by nuclear power stations, transport hubs, major companies and even football grounds. The company has four offices in the UK and Ireland, in Southampton, Bedford, Aberdeen and Dublin. The battle for Chloride began nine weeks ago when Emerson launched a hostile bid for the company, worth £723m. This was swiftly rejected by Chloride, and sparked fresh concern about overseas companies buying up British firms. Chloride's UPS systems are used by Heathrow, London Underground, HSBC and BP, and some politicians questioned whether such important technology should be allowed to fall into foreign hands. Farr also said today that Emerson expects to deliver £33m of operational cost savings per year through buying Chloride, which may indicate that a deal could lead to job losses. Emerson admitted that it \"can no longer be certain that a combination with Chloride will result in a net addition of skilled jobs in the UK.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/aug/24/unison-court-nhs-shake-up","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-24T17:49:00Z","webTitle":"Unison goes to court to block planned NHS shake-up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/aug/24/unison-court-nhs-shake-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/aug/24/unison-court-nhs-shake-up","fields":{"headline":"Unison goes to court to block planned NHS shake-up","bodyText":"The public sector union Unison today said it would go to court to try to block the coalition government's plans for a radical reorganisation of the NHS. The union is applying for a judicial review on the grounds that the consultation process conducted by the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, is a sham. Consultation on plans to give GPs control of £80bn NHS spending runs until October, but the Department of Health has already indicated the plans are non-negotiable. Unison claims this makes the process unlawful. The government said it would be fighting Unison's legal action. Lansley announced his plans in a white paper in July. The following day, Sir David Nicholson, the NHS chief executive, wrote to NHS executives telling them to start work on the reforms \"immediately\". Unison said this meant the consultation process was pointless. Nicholson responded by saying the reforms should not be implemented until after the consultation process. But he also said the consultation would only cover the way the conduct of the reorganisation, not whether it was correct in principle. In a statement today, Karen Jennings, Unison's head of health, accused the health department of ignoring a legal duty to consult patients. \"I find it incredible that the NHS chief executive says he believes there is no legal duty on the secretary of state to consult on the merits of the proposals in the white paper.\" she said. \"The white paper contains sweeping changes to the NHS and how it should be run. The NHS constitution enshrines the principle that the public, staff and unions have an absolute right to be consulted.\" And that means not only on how the proposals are to be implemented, but also whether they should go ahead in the first place. \"The Department of Health's refusal to recognise this clear and important legal duty leaves us no option but to issue legal proceedings as a matter of urgency.\" But the government rejected the claim that it was acting illegally. \"The government is engaging fully with the public, healthcare professionals, local authorities and unions on how its proposals will be implemented,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Health said. \"The government has already launched public consultations on specific elements of the white paper, and further documents will be published this year. The department's position is that its decisions on consultation are lawful, and it will be defending the claim by Unison.\" The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, a Labour leadership contender, backed Unison's stance. \"There is no democratic mandate for the breakup of the NHS,\" he said. \"I don't believe there are many, if any, of the seven million people who voted Lib Dem who support the government's plans. \"As the coalition agreement explicitly ruled out a top-down NHS reorganisation, these dangerous plans represent one of the biggest and quickest U-turns in political history.\" Unison is basing its case on the grounds that the government has made promises that create a \"legitimate expectation\" that the reorganisation proposals will be subject to consultation. It is also arguing that the NHS constitution and section 242 of the NHS Act give the public a right to be consulted about changes to services. Three years ago, the Labour government had to rerun a consultation exercise on nuclear power after Greenpeace successfully used judicial review to obtain a court ruling saying the government consultation was flawed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/aug/25/britishenergygroup.centrica","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-08-24T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: British Energy's largest investor presses for its merger with Centrica","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/25/britishenergygroup.centrica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/aug/25/britishenergygroup.centrica","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: British Energy's largest investor presses for its merger with Centrica","bodyText":"The biggest shareholder in British Energy is pressing the nuclear power generator to merge with Centrica, the owner of British Gas, it emerged yesterday. Invesco, which owns a 15% stake in British Energy and a 5% stake in Centrica, told a newspaper that a merger between the two would be the \"obvious solution\" for the future of the companies. Neil Woodford, the head of investment at Invesco, has already taken his proposal to both companies and is stepping up his campaign to broker a deal by meeting tomorrow with the Shareholder Executive in Westminster, which manages the government's assets. The government still owns 36% of British Energy and will be instrumental in any deals over the nuclear firm's future. British Energy came within a whisker of agreeing terms for a £12bn takeover by the French utility Électricité de France but the deal was blocked by two leading shareholders, including Invesco, who argued that the price of 765p a share was not high enough. Woodford believes that EDF could still play a role. He told the Sunday Telegraph: \"A combination of British Energy and Centrica solves the problems facing both companies today. Together they can work out a joint venture with EDF to build nuclear sites.\" EDF has said it remains committed to building new nuclear generators in Britain but it remains unclear whether British Energy and the French utility can break the current impasse. At its results two weeks ago, British Energy only said that it was continuing to hold advanced discussions. Centrica confirmed shortly after the EDF deal was scuppered that it might revive proposals to merge with British Energy, creating a company worth £22.5bn, first mooted at the beginning of the year. The British Gas owner is keen to get involved in nuclear power and had looked at the prospect of an all-share offer for British Energy but the proposals were put on ice when it appeared that one of the big European utilities might come in with a cash bid. When the EDF bid did emerge, Centrica agreed to invest as a junior partner and was thought to be planning to take a 25% stake. In a statement issued in the first week of August, Centrica said that in the event of the EDF deal falling apart it would consider a number of options regarding British Energy. It said they might include long-term power contracts, working in partnership with the firm on new-build projects or \"a possible merger of Centrica with British Energy, if terms could be agreed and all parties are fully supportive\". The government preferred the EDF bid because it preferred to take cash rather than shares. But there is now a suggestion that Centrica could revise its offer so that cash is offered to the government and shares to other investors. Analysts reckon that the state-controlled EDF would need to make a bid of more than £8 a share to win the backing of British Energy shareholders and possibly as much as £9 - a far stretch from its initial approach of less than £7. British Energy two weeks ago said profits had fallen from £253m to £129m in the three months to the end of June, the first quarter of its financial year. It blamed lower output and the higher cost of remedial work at two nuclear stations for the decline. But the company said it was encouraged that the role for nuclear new-build within Britain's energy policy was now firmly established. British Energy owns eight nuclear power stations and one coal-fired plant. Problems at a number of the nuclear plants have forced it to cut output although the company claims to have made \"good progress\" in resolving the issues that have dogged the plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/aug/03/china-overtakes-us-energy-consumer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-03T11:34:19Z","webTitle":"China overtakes US as world's biggest energy consumer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/aug/03/china-overtakes-us-energy-consumer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/aug/03/china-overtakes-us-energy-consumer","fields":{"headline":"China overtakes US as world's biggest energy consumer","bodyText":"Declarations of love do not get much more highly charged than the one Zhao Xiuxia received from her husband recently on an LED screen bigger than a football pitch. \"Dear wife, I adore you. You work so hard for our family. Let's struggle together for a better life,\" scrolled the giant letters on an electronic ceiling above one of Beijing's glitziest new shopping centres. As well as being a message of devotion, the mobile phone text message – magnified by 5m pixels – highlights the dramatic increase in the wattage of China's economy. The giant 250 metre-long screen at The Place retail centre is one of the most conspicuous symbols of an increasingly affluent and energy-hungry nation, which was said last week to have overtaken the United States as the biggest consumer of energy in the world. According to the respected International Energy Agency, China's use of coal, oil, wind and other sources of power more than doubled in the past decade to reach the equivalent of 2.26bn tonnes of oil in 2009, creeping past the US total of 2.17bn tonnes (see graphic below). This is a major turning point. Energy use is closely related to carbon dioxide emissions, economic expansion and the global balance of power. The US has been the world's biggest energy user since records began. The Chinese government has challenged the figure, but the trend is unmistakable. While most developed nations suffered flat or negative economic – and energy – growth last year, China's GDP rose by 8.7%, putting it on course to soon overtake Japan as the world's second biggest economy, and its emissions – already the highest of any nation – increased 9%, while those of most industrialised nations fell. The bulk of China's energy demand comes from industry and infrastructure, but individual consumption is also rising, albeit from a low base. China has a great deal of ground to make up before it can provide its 1.3bn citizens with a lifestyle comparable to those in the US or Europe. But its people are plugging in more air conditioners, microwave ovens, TV sets and computers than ever before. They are also driving more vehicles. Last year, China surpassed the US as the country that sold the most new cars. Cityscapes are being transformed. Several Beijing skyscrapers have transformed themselves into 30- and 40-storey LED screens in the wake of the ancient capital's Olympic makeover into a super-modern urban metropolis. The Place, which boasts the biggest single screen display in Asia, is among the most eye-catching and energy intensive. Modelled on a still-bigger screen in Las Vegas and designed by Emmy-winning Hollywood designer Jeremy Railton, it intersperses custom-made films about the stars, undersea creatures and famous landscapes with personal messages, which can cost as little as 1 yuan for a single text message or 20,000 yuan (£1,850) for a dedicated marriage proposal video (more than one suitor has gone on his knees before his girlfriend, while the screen above shows photographs of the couple). Such ostentation is the exception rather than the norm in China, where the average person's energy use is still only a quarter that in the US. Zhao Xiuxia received her husband's giant love message while working as a waitress at a nearby juice bar – one of two jobs that together give her a 14-hour working day and a monthly income of just 3,000 yuan (£300) a month. Along with her husband's salary, this allows the couple – who have recently migrated from a poor farming village in the Hebei countryside – to afford a computer, freezer, air conditioner and motorbike. Their parents have none of these commodities. \"My village is still very dark. We only turn on the road lamps once or twice a year at festival times,\" Zhao said, contrasting this with her current place of work. \"When I first saw the giant screen at The Place, I was astonished. It was so big and beautiful.\" This man-made beauty has an environmental cost. According to the management company, the screen consumes about 1,500 kW , around 150,000 times that of a 10-watt energy-saving bulb. The government is trying to reduce the impact of this and similar expansions by promoting renewable energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal power. Last week, the state media said China would spend about 5 trillion yuan on clean energy in the next decade and reduce its dependency on coal from 70% to 63% by 2015. Domestic scientists also claimed a breakthrough in the development of a new generation of nuclear power plants. \"They are doing everything they can to increase the supply of energy,\" said Paul French, coauthor of a book about China's growing impact on oil shipping routes. \"They are building nuclear plants, making photovoltaic panels like you can't imagine. Same for wind, hydro and biomass ... The trend is that they will continue to consume more energy.\" The impact on global markets is increasingly apparent. China's dependency on imported oil reached 50% for the first time last year and is forecast to rise to 75% by 2030. In recent years, it has also become a major importer of coal from Australia and its nuclear power plans have helped to push the price of uranium to unprecedented highs. \"When China sneezes, the whole world panics,\" said Wu Changhua, China director of The Climate Group. \"There are contradictory attitudes about China's rise in international society. On one hand, people want China to boost the global economy. On the other, they hope China will not emit too much greenhouse gas. Decision-makers here have a clear idea that they want to pioneer a new path away from the current dangerous model of development. But it is unprecedented in human history for a nation to deal with this challenge, while coping with a huge population and relatively little land and resources.\" The shift to a low-carbon economy is still a work in progress. Across the road from The Place, a new shopping mall is being constructed that aims to pioneer a shift to greener values. Parkview Green, a triangular structure of steel and glass with triple-glazed windows, claims to set a new standard for energy efficiency in Beijing. A spokesman for the project said state-of-the-art technology, materials and design would save a fortune on heating and cooling. \"Our building can actually breathe,\" said Leo Hwang, the executive director of Parkview Green. \"We need to understand what we get from the environment and what we need to give back. We need to try to find the balance. Some buildings consume a lot of energy and resources. We hope to use them better.\" It remains to be seen whether the new shopping mall is any more successful in promoting greener, energy-efficient values than its neighbour, The Place. • Additional reporting by Cui Zheng • To order Jonathan Watt's book, When a Billion Chinese Jump, for £9.99 (rrp £14.99) call 0330 333 6846 or visit guardianbookshop.co.uk. • This article was amended on 4 August 2010.

My colleague Damian Carrington has already filed a story based on what she will be saying, but I interviewed her in her office in the Commons yesterday, and we covered some of the tricky questions facing the Greens. Here are the main points: • Lucas said developed countries like Britain should give up economic growth. \"Advanced industrialised economies like ourselves cannot afford to go on growing, particularly if we want to give people in poorer countries a chance of being able to at least meet their basic needs,\" she said. It was a mistake to make growth an economic objective, she added, saying: \"Growth is a side issue. The end goal is about prosperity in terms of greater wellbeing, in terms of greater equality, in terms of having a cleaner environment, in terms of having more security for your kids in the future.\" But she stressed that giving up growth as a policy goal needed to be accompanied by many other social changes. \"If you simply said let's throw growth out of the window, and didn't change anything else, then you would see unemployment rise and you would see some chaos ensue.\" • She said she \"seriously\" thought there was a chance of the Greens being able to form a government over the next 20 years or so. \"If we are serious about the depth of the climate crisis that I believe we face, then if we don't have Greens of some kind in government pretty quickly, if we're not going to change our policies pretty quickly, then in many ways the future looks quite grim,\" she said. She also claimed the odds of having \"serious Green influence\" in a government within her lifetime were \"extremely high\". • She said people should consider the environmental impact when deciding how many children to have. \"I do think that if people are taking the time to think about their environmental footprint when it comes to how many flights they take, whether or not they have a 4X4, whether or not they are going to have a patio heater, then putting the question to themselves about how many kids they are going to have is a reasonable thing to do,\" she added. • She said she did not think that the campaign for proportional representation was dead. Although many commentators assumed that the no vote in the alternative vote (AV) referendum had killed any prospects of PR for the foreseeable future, she said she thought pressure for PR would return if the next election resulted in another coalition. • She blamed Nick Clegg for helping to contribute to the yes campaign's defeat in the AV referendum. \"It's an incredible irony that it's the Lib Dems own unpopularity that helped sink the referendum result,\" she said. • She said she would like to see MPs sitting in a new, \"more effective\" chamber. The House of Commons was \"a deeply frustrating and inefficient place that actually acts an obstacle in so many ways to getting the things done that need to be done\", she added. As Damian reports, Lucas and her party are trying to appeal to people who have voted Lib Dem. At one point during the interview, I made the mistake of saying \"Lib Dems\" instead of Green – a slip that tells you a lot about the way Westminster journalists such as myself habitually think about the smaller parties. For a long time, the \"what hope have you got of being in power\" question was one that always went to the Lib Dems. That was in the days when I didn't write about them much. Now things are different, of course, and I write about them every day. If Lucas is right, at some point in the next few years her own party could make a similar breakthrough. Is she being realistic? Here's the transcript – you can decide for yourself. The Greens and their electoral prospects Q: Can we start with elections? Where do you think the Green party are in terms of electoral strength, and where can you go by the time of the next election? A: Obviously we are riding high at the moment after the success in Brighton, and so the challenge is to make sure we can try and replicate that in other parts of the country. The signs are looking good. We've got more and more people joining the party. People from other parties are joining us; it's no accident that our conference is in Sheffield, and we're making a bid, in particular, to Lib Dem voters. Q: The Lib Dem vote has collapsed. But what's the evidence that that is helping the Greens, either in terms of membership or votes in local elections? A: We are seeing that. In a sense, that's not so surprising. If you look at some of the reasons people would give for joining the Lib Dems – whether that's to do with environmental concerns, social justice, or electoral reform or whatever – on many of those issues, they are not getting what they thought they were going to get. The Liberal Democrats are propping up the government on a whole range of policies that weren't in their manifesto. For example, where do you go if you still want an NHS that is true to its original principles? If you want an alternative that isn't being offered by any of the other political parties, which have all brought in to a greater or lesser extent to the marketisation and, increasingly, privatisation of the NHS, then it's the Greens. Q: But what's actually happened to your membership over the last 12 months, or your performance in local elections? Can you put some figures on that? A: We can get you some. [Later, the party sends me an email saying membership has gone up from about 10,000 to about 14,500 in the last 18 months – an increase of 45%.] I don't know how systematically we ask people where they have come from, so more of that is anecdotal. But, as an example, we've got a byelection in Highgate next week, which is Ed Miliband's ward. It has been a Green seat in the past. We lost it in 2010 because of the general election effect, but our candidate now there is somebody who has been an active Lib Dem councillor and who has now joined the Greens out of frustration at the direction of the Lib Dems. So we've got a really good chance of winning that seat back. Q: Are there any parliamentary seats that are good prospects at the next election on the back of a fall in the Lib Dem vote? A: One of the places that was a target last time was Norwich South where our deputy leader, Adrian Ramsay, was a candidate and is likely to be again. That was won by the Lib Dems by a tiny majority, and all of the others were clustering quite closely together [You can see the full results here – Ramsay was actually fourth]. Now we're the main opposition party on Norwich City council – we've got a huge track record there. I think we could do incredibly well in somewhere like Norwich at the next election. And down in the south-west as well, we are relooking at our strategy down there, where there are so many Lib Dem seats. Q: Your conference is in Sheffield. On the \"what do you want to ask Caroline Lucas\" blog that I posted, someone (oresme) asked when the Greens were likely to win Sheffield Hallam (Clegg's seat). A: I think that's probably in our next tier of aspiration. There are certainly some other places that we are more likely to get first [Lucas is smiling at this point, because she's being diplomatic. The Greens only got 2% of the vote in Clegg's constitutency in 2010]. Q: In the past (for example, in this Guardian interview), you've talked about the fact that, 24 years after Labour got their first MP (in 1900), they were forming a government. How realistic do you think are the chances of the Greens making that kind of breakthrough within your lifetime (Lucas is 50)? A: I seriously think so. I've been in the Green party for a very long time – when was it, 1986 – and I joined the party because I seriously wanted the party to have influence. I'm impatient for that. And if we are serious about the depth of the climate crisis that I believe we face, then if we don't have Greens of some kind in government pretty quickly, if we're not going to change our policies pretty quickly, then in many ways the future looks quite grim. So there's an external urgency to this, as well as, yes, we would like to get our hands on some levers of influence. One of the driving forces for the whole Green party's raison d'être is around the environmental crisis, and that crisis is getting worse by the day. Q: Labour made the breakthrough from a minor party to a major one because the Liberal party collapsed. Who's going to collapse this time? A: I think it's hard to predict exactly how it's going to happen. I don't think the debate about PR is dead – I think, if we have another coalition government, people will again start raising questions about first past the post. If first past the post is delivering us coalitions, then at least let's try and make those coalitions more accountable and more representative of the people that elected them. So I think that debate about PR will come back. And I'm very interested in that whole Compass-led debate about realignments of the left, and trying to find ways in which coalitions are possible. So we don't necessarily need to see the collapse of one party before we come forward with some serious influence. There are a range of different ways it might happen. Q: What are the odds of a Green government happening in your lifetime? A: I'm not going to put a figure on odds. What I want to talk about are the odds of serious Green influence. And that, I would say, is extremely high. The alternative vote referendum Q: Who do you blame for the fact that the referendum on AV went as badly as it did? A: The first thing to acknowledge is that selling something that is not a very attractive proposition essentially is very difficult. The problem with the AV referendum is that nobody was wholeheartedly saying this is really what we want. Nobody was saying that. So, if you want to try and persuade other people to buy into something that even the people who are trying to sell it think is not that great, it's not surprising that it didn't actually resonate with people. It would have been much easier to have won a referendum on a genuine PR system. Q: Would it have been much easier to have won the referendum if Nick Clegg had taken a holiday during the campaign? A: Of course. Yes, it would have been. It's an incredible irony that it's the Lib Dems' own unpopularity that helped sink the referendum result, which is very sad because, although AV is not what we ideally wanted, it would have been a step further forward. Green policy and growth Q: Can we move on to growth, because there were a lot of good questions about this on the \"what do you want to ask\" blog. In the Green party election manifesto, you said: \"Only the Green party is willing to … say that limitless economic growth without thinking about the consequences is a dangerous and careless fantasy.\" What do you mean by that? Do you have a view as to what level of growth is appropriate and what isn't? A: What we're saying is that we need to be thinking about the economy as a subset of the overall ecology, of planetary constraints, and the constraints will be different as to whether or not you are talking about water, or CO2 or what the resources are. What we're saying is that the turbo-consumerism that is being driven by successive governments, where we are being encouraged to measure our wellbeing solely in terms of whether or not GDP is going up or down, isn't actually a very effective way of measuring anything. Absolutely, we need jobs right now. We need investment and employment. But when the government talks about growth, that's not really what it's talking about. It's just talking about more and more people consuming. It doesn't matter what they are consuming as long as that leads to a growth in GDP. Q: But there is a connection between growth and jobs, isn't there? A: It depends. You've got the chancellor saying he wants to lift the 50p tax rate because that's going to led to more growth and jobs. Actually, what that's going to led to is people who are earning a lot maybe saving more. It's not actually going to be translated into productive investment in the economy. What we have said is that we want to look back to Roosevelt and his New Deal in the 1930s. When we were in a recession, he built lots of roads and bridges. I don't think we need lots of roads and bridges. But if we have a bit of space in which to have some investment and growth, it needs to be in that transitional phase so that we can put in place the green infrastructure that we need for the 21st century. Q: But Roosevelt would have given his right arm for \"limitless economic growth\". A: I'm saying that our response to austerity is not to say: \"Do not invest, do not grow.\" Our response to the austerity challenge, to the recession challenge, is to say we need investment – but that investment needs to go into productive areas of jobs where we can begin to see a greener economy emerging. And that's not where it's going at the moment. Q: One of the people who posted a question on this (skintnick) wanted to know if you think \"the era of economic growth is over\". Would you put it like that? A: I would say that, increasingly, economic growth is becoming uneconomic. And by that I mean if you look at the costs associated with our current growth model in terms of the environmental destruction that it causes and some of the social inequalities that it gives rise to, the overall costs associated with our growth model are actually costing us more than the amount of money that the current growth model is producing. If you build lots more roads and so forth, the environmental damage that you are doing with that – with air pollution, health problems – is outweighing what this growth is supposed to be producing. That's why we want to get away from simple measures of wellbeing like GDP and instead look at a basket of different measures, in terms of whether or not we are having greater levels of well being as a society, instead of thinking that, just because GDP has gone up, we're all miraculously going to feel 10 times better. Q: Does that mean, as someone called Bressy asked on the blog, if GDP isn't going up, that's a positive? A: Both of those questions are still making it sound as if growth is the end goal. I think growth is a side issue. The end goal is about prosperity in terms of greater wellbeing, in terms of greater equality, in terms of having a cleaner environment, in terms of having more security for your kids in the future. Those are the kinds of outcomes we want to be trying to pursue in this society, rather than being obsessed about whether or not GDP is going up or down. Q: Do you have an index for measuring that? Of the various international happiness indices, are there any that you can point to and say \"that's a good way of measuring a prosperous society\"? A: I think that's still a work in progress. You've had the Sarkozy commission, which has started to set out a range of different criteria that you could use. What is clear is that you can't just aggregate everything into one single number, so that you have GDP of 2% versus one single number. The New Economics Foundation has probably come closest to beginning to put together a basket of different things that you could be measuring. The government itself is beginning to think along these lines, not as a replacement for GDP measurements, but as a parallel to it. So there's a debate happening. But I don't think anybody right now would say, yes, that's the answer. Q: Mainstream policymakers have, for the last 50 or 100 years or so, worked on the assumption that there is a trend rate of growth and that's a good thing and that, in normal circumstances, economies should grow. Do you think economies should grow? A: No. I think that advanced industrialised economies like ourselves cannot afford to go on growing, particularly if we want to give people in poorer countries a chance of being able to at least meet their basic needs. The bottom line is if we all lived as we do in the west, we would need an extra three and a half planets to provide the resources and absorb the waste. No matter how much we talk about producing things more efficiently, and trying to decouple our production from its environmental impact, no one is talking about a zero relationship. If you producing more and more stuff, even if you are doing it more efficiently, when you have got a rising population the impact of that is still going to be upwards. So the bottom line is – I would argue – that, in a world where population is growing and people in the poorer countries quite rightly and legitimately expect to be able to have more growth and development themselves, then that means that, in the end, advanced countries need to be getting away from growth as our objective. We need to be moving towards steady state economies. Q: So that doesn't just mean slower growth than before, then. That means throwing away the expectation that the economy will normally grow bigger, year by year, on a GDP measure? A: It means finding another way of looking at it. But it's really important to say that, in order to do that, you would need to change an awful lot of things in society. Because if you simply said let's throw growth out of the window and didn't change anything else, then you would see unemployment rise and you would see some chaos ensue. Q: Someone (Haroonsaad) posted a question asking whether the Greens are an anti-capitalist party. I'm assuming from what you are saying that the answer is yes. A: Yes. It's anti-capitalist not just from a narrow ideological point of view. We're saying that a capitalist society, as far as we can see, depends on more and more production and consumption of stuff, without much thought as to how you are doing that. And that is not compatible with moving towards a more stable economy. Being an MP Q: You've been an MP for more than a year now. Some people come to parliament and fall in love with it. Some people come here and decide that it's a wretched, terrible place. What do you feel about it? A: I feel that it's a deeply frustrating and inefficient place that actually acts an obstacle in so many ways to getting the things done that need to be done. By that I mean I find that parliament is still bogged down in ways of doing things that are deeply inefficient. I'm thinking of everything from, if I look at the other parties, the powers of the whips, the amount of time that's wasted in filing through the lobbies rather than moving towards something more effective like electronic voting, and some of the ways in which what we do is still obscure to people outside parliament. If you are trying to follow a debate in parliament, even if you've got access to the internet, you are really going to struggle to make any sense of it because there's no obligation, when you put down amendments, for example, to explain the purpose of those amendments. Q: You covered these points in a paper you wrote last year [pdf]. A: I did. And what was exciting about that is that the paper then led to a debate in Westminster Hall, and it was one of the best attended Westminster Hall debates that we've had, apparently. We had over 40 MPs there. And what's interesting is that there's an appetite, particularly from this new intake of MPs, to try to change the way that we do things. I know there are people who will say, as Margaret Beckett did, \"Don't worry, don't try and change things too fast, you'll get used to it.\" The fact that people get used to it is precisely the problem. Q: If you were prime minister tomorrow, would you tear down the place and start again? A: I think this is a very beautiful building. I wouldn't like to tear it down. But I would perhaps make the chamber somewhere else where we could have a more effective way of business rather than this adversarial facing one another, shouting at each other. There's only room for 450 people to sit down in that place. There are 650 MPs. What's that about? I think we could organise the way we do things in a much more effective way. Q: What do you feel that you have personally by being here that you would not have achieved by being leader of the Greens outside parliament? Is there anything specific you can point to? A: I think there are two ways of answering that question. The first is to say that one MP out of 650 is very rarely going to be in a position of swinging majorities, and I can't say I've swung a majority with my vote. But I also think it's been effective and important in two ways. One is about the credibility and authority that comes with being in this place. We could have had 30 or 40 members of the European parliament but, because the media is not very interested in what happens in the European parliament, because our whole political life is so centralised and focused on Westminster, the importance of being there shouldn't be underestimated, just in terms of the way in which people think, \"Oh, the Greens are serious, they've got an MP.\" So there's that element of it. In terms of what I've been able to do in terms of the work that I've done here, it's about putting things on the agenda that otherwise might not have been there. In the health debate this week I was the only MP who stood up and went right back to the basics of what the NHS used to be about. When it came to a debate about Afghanistan, my amendment was the only one that was in tune, I would argue, with the vast majority of people in this country who want to see an immediate withdrawal of our troops. The coalition and nuclear power Q: In a Huffington Post interview a few weeks ago you predicted that there would be a coalition split \"quite soon\" on nuclear power. What did you mean by that? A: At the moment the coalition is saying they will support nuclear energy if there is no public subsidy. They have found a form of words that they can more or less sell to some of the Lib Dems in the coalition. But the point is that to say that you will only have nuclear if it does not have a public subsidy is so disingenuous, to put it politely. Nuclear has never survived without public subsidy. Today, even, there is no proper liability insurance for nuclear. God forbid, if there was a Fukushima-type accident here in Britain, are we saying the government would just sit on its hands and say \"We're not bailing that out\"? We constantly bail out nuclear. It is impossible for nuclear to happen without a subsidy. Chris Huhne Q: How do you rate Chris Huhne as an energy secretary? Do you think he's a proper environmentalist? A: I think that in many ways he has tried to do the right thing - although obviously I disagree with him strongly over nuclear - but it's interesting that time and again his department is over-ruled by more powerful departments in Whitehall. I can't seriously believe that he thought it was a good idea to cause chaos in the solar industry by changing the Fits [feed-in tariffs] regime so that those slightly larger installations would no longer get the kind of support they were expecting. The Greens and environmentalism Q: On the blog someone [michaelswann] accused you of playing down the environmentalist aspects of Green policy. Do you see the Greens still as mainly an environmental party? Or are you actually now a broader, socialist party? A: We have always been a party that has had policies on everything, from education to the economy to the environment. We have always said that, if you are serious about the environment, then the policies that you need to change most are the economic policies. There's no point in having an economic system which works on the basis of \"business as usual\" and then putting some green trimmings around the edges. It's actually about changing the whole way the economy works. Curbing population growth Q: We had various questions on the blog about curbing population growth. You said recently: \"We need to have a far greater public debate about population.\" What do you mean by that? A: Population has been an elephant in the room when it comes to many environmental debates. It is clear that, if we are trying to reduce our overall impact on the planet, it is going to be much harder if there are more of us than if there are fewer of us. Having said that, we are a world away from any kind of draconian, mandatory policies. We're not suggesting that for one moment. But I do think that, if people are taking the time to think about their environmental footprint when it comes to how many flights they take, whether or not they have a 4X4, whether or not they are going to have a patio heater, then putting the question to themselves about how many kids they are going to have is a reasonable thing to do. It's not about me sitting here lecturing people. But I think we do need that debate about what is the impact of a growing population in the industrialised countries. Greenham Common Q: Finally, I wanted to ask you about Greenham Common (where campaigners recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of the creation of the peace camp). You've said (for example, in this Guardian interivew), that the Greenham Common protests brought you into politics. Looking back on them now, what do you think they achieved? A: I think they achieve a huge amount in terms of changing people's consciousness, how they thought about things. Although I have talked about the importance of being here in parliament, I think the extra-parliamentary activity is still vitally important too, and I think the Green party as a whole has that sense that we need to be part of a broader movement. Q: But nuclear weapons are still here. A: But I think that the Greenham Common protest reached people in terms of their concern about nuclear weapons in a way that reports from parliament didn't. And, as well as getting the message about nuclear weapons to people who would not normally have followed it, it really was consciousness-changing. I can't say it any differently to that. It was about what happens when you have a lot of people together, all of whom believe something strongly and feel they can really make a difference. It made people understand that politics was not just something done by men in grey suits behind doors in Westminster, but that politics was something you can do whoever you are and wherever you are."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2011/apr/19/letters","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-19T12:59:01Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 22 April 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/apr/19/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2011/apr/19/letters","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 22 April 2011","bodyText":"Political expediency can make for strange bedfellows, especially on occasions of regime change – be they ethical or unethical (Defections and dilemmas, 8 April). Starting from scratch is doomed to failure; this was the US's recipe for Iraq – a \"government in a box\", completely disenfranchising the tainted Ba'athists, who despite their politics were talented people. As the second world war wound down in Italy with General Patton marching north, it became critically necessary to install a bureaucracy with the wherewithal to maintain order and resurrect industries. Oddly enough, the state department turned to Lucky Luciano, capo di tutti capi, who – albeit in federal prison – was still actively running his organisation both in the US and abroad, with extensive networks in Italy and Sicily. As \"loyal an American as the next guy\", Luciano volunteered his contacts to set up an interim government in return for his own paroling and deportation (and thence to Cuba). Lucky for himself and for the allies, the enterprise ran smooth. Sometimes, in extremis especially where time is the critical factor, realpolitik can work wonders. R M Fransson Lakewood, Colorado, US • Having lived outside the US many years, I appreciate Dave Diss's anger at my country and frequently share it (Reply, 8 April). I write often to my president and representatives in government. As an Australian, whose country is also involved in this warring madness in Libya, I hope Diss is doing the same. Many Americans are confused about why we are involved in Libya, who the \"rebels\" are, where this is all supposed to be leading. We are already in two wars too many, and war doesn't solve anything in the long term. Well-coordinated development aid would do better. But in our current budget crisis, Americans are saying \"cut foreign aid\" because they don't know better. This is immoral, and any of us who do know and aren't speaking up are the truly irresponsible ones. Isabel Best Belmont, Massachusetts, US • Apologise? Why should we apologise? Don't the Libyans understand we want them to have a democracy just as wonderful as ours: that we're raining missiles and bombs on them, and even-handedly, on rebels too, collaterally, for their own good. A bit like old-style medicine: letting blood in order to improve health. Though of course, western medicine and pharmacology have more effective methods now, which we'll also be providing, after the bombing. Just give us a bit more (blood-letting) time. John Cadet Chiang Mai, Thailand The limits to empathy What seems to be a single empirical phenomenon may actually have two distinct personality drivers ('Evil' is in reality a lack of empathy, 8 April). Empathy in some may have the same effect as duty for others. But the operating mindsets may be miles apart. Duty done can make one feel good or may have the sense of internalised coercion. Empathy may have another sort of depth and another location in the brain that leads one to be helpful or just keenly share the disturbance – or happiness – of the person or situation observed. The military must be the prime culture of duty. Empathy may even get in the way. But it is certainly what the world needs more of now. The concept of \"the other\" – as Barack Obama is seen by Tea Partyers – seems to set a boundary to empathy, where harm to the other – not only physical pain – is at best a matter of indifference, or just as likely, gives satisfaction in observing or even inflicting it. One suspects that cultures, subcultures and socialisation may affect where a representative individual fits on Simon Baron-Cohen's bell curve of empathy. What do scientists have to say about that? Al Edgell St Louis, Missouri, US • So the Nazis were guilty of \"empathy erosion\"? So Nazi Germany was borderline? So \"immersion experiments\" on Jews in Dachau were part of \"unethical research\"? Sorry, but I don't buy it. Evil is as evil does, and calling it by another, more \"civilised\" name is in fact a form of denial. Some things defy explanation. The Holocaust is one of them. Alexandra Chapman Paris, France Regaining Labour's past After Labour lost its time-honoured purpose and pampered position as democratic and market-friendly bulwark against evil socialism, the threat of which disappeared in 1990, and after the attempt to gain a new role in the years following by doing neoliberalism better and flashier than the Tories proved self-defeating, time has obviously come for Labour to try to regain its past (It's time to regain the past, 8 April). But apparently we cannot stop around 1914, but have to go back to the middle ages in search of this past. Labour's newly promoted ideologue Maurice Glassman, hailed by Ed Miliband, sees the deep roots of Labour in the Anglo-Saxon villagers' resistance against the baronial conquest in 1066, and endorses the English village with its communitarian and faith-based values and local anchoring as the ideal to regain. This squares with Madeleine Bunting's call for nostalgia, but—thinking of detective Barnaby's Midsomer – she is probably right in saying that much \"could go awry with these ideas\". Still, the notion is completely apt. After global finance capital has been given a free rein, wealth erodes democracy and public institutions are taken over by moneyed elites, the economy more and more comes to resemble the feudalism of yore, with the whole package from absentee landlords and local overseers to indentured servants and serfs. So the protection the village may offer is most welcome, but may we suggest that Robin Hood is deterred as well? Niels Engelsted Copenhagen, Denmark Err on the side of safety Engineering design conventions involve compromising between the probability of failure and the cost of reducing that probability, in both monetary and humanitarian terms (No schedule for nuclear safety, 1 April). All possible causes and their effects, including interactions, must be considered. In coal-, oil- and gas-fired power plants, the effects of a failure do not greatly affect things beyond the plant boundary and its electrical connections, and this is a valid approach. Nuclear plants are different. Any failure introduces the possibility of radioactive contamination, and some failures can lead to widespread emissions of waterborne and airborne contaminants that can affect food supplies, among other things, as well as being direct health hazards. The effects can persist for years and affect large areas. In siting a nuclear power plant a catastrophic failure (worst-case scenario) should always be considered, irrespective of any calculated probability. The location should be selected with a view to minimising the impacts. This approach would eliminate sites such as Fukushima and also the siting of multiple units in close proximity. It is not clear whether all the existing nuclear facilities meet the proper conditions for siting, but it is not too late to make some realistic evaluations. D Anson Worthington, Ohio, US Briefly • I'm truly impressed with the positive articles that Guardian Weekly has published over the last year or so, for example, New dawn over Africa and When tyrants are toppled (11 March). Perhaps in response to the surveys filled by readers, the paper has also given its front pages to a great variety of issues from around the world in contrast to a few years ago when we were bombarded with page upon page on the US. Now I read it almost cover to cover. Wendy Lund Kitwe, Zambia • It occurred to me how much I appreciate the Guardian Weekly when I noted in a header for Thomas Sotinel's article When nightmares turn real (1 April) that the word \"real\" had not been punned \"reel\" to reflect the content. I for one am heartily ill of this distracting journalistic device. NH Clarke Kingston, Ontario, Canada • It is little wonder that all those apartments in Valdeluz and elsewhere in Spain are empty (8 April). With the poor buggers who own them spending \"1,775 hours in the office each month\" to quote your side-story, they would never have time to live in them. Even those lazy Germans at 1,432 hours a month must be in the office for nearly 48 hours a day. That alone would be the reason for a low birthrate. Robert C Keogh Crawley, Western Australia • Three cheers for the Dutch (1 April). If this \"typically Dutch Lutheran and Calvinist backlash\" is what it takes to ban banker bonuses, I'm all for it.

Executives said the planned takeover – which will see GDF Suez's non-European power stations combined with International's Power's 45 plants around the world – will allow the new group to invest more heavily in building plants. Access to the balance sheet of GDF Suez, part-owned by the French government, should secure an investment grade credit rating and reduce the cost of borrowing. Through its other businesses, GDF Suez already has close links to North Africa, whose economies, particularly those in oil-producing countries, are proving resilient to the global downturn. Both companies had already planned to invest a combined £6.9bn in new power plants in developing markets over the next three years. If the deal is approved by shareholders, management will look at scaling up the plans. The French company, the second largest utility in the world, will own 70% of International Power, which will remain listed on the FTSE 100. Gérard Mestrallet, chief executive and chairman of GDF Suez, said that International Power's head office would remain in London. But job losses among the combined group's global workforce of 11,000 are inevitable. International Power, which owns six plants in the UK, was one of the last remnants of the privatisation of the electricity industry in the 90s. All but two companies – Centrica and Scottish and Southern Electricity – remain independent. Some of International Power's advisers tried to insist the deal did not amount to a takeover by GDF Suez. But Philip Cox, the current chief executive of International Power, who will retain his position, admitted: \"Clearly it's a change of control. International Power's majority shareholder will be GDF – that's clear and fine.\" He denied he was worried about the French government being the largest shareholder. Chairman Sir Neville Simms insisted the company would be run \"in the interests of all shareholders not just the majority shareholder\". If existing International Power shareholders vote in the favour of the deal, they will receive a one-off special dividend of £1.4bn, as well as retaining shares in the new group. The tie-up would create the world's largest independent power producer by generating capacity. As part of the deal, the new International Power has agreed not to compete with parent company GDF Suez in continental Europe. GDF Suez is putting 32 of its 100 power plants into the venture. The remainder are mostly in France and Belgium. Because GDF Suez has several nuclear power joint ventures – including one in the UK – and a large liquified natural gas business, the new International Power is not allowed to move into these areas either. The new group is unlikely to build more plants in the UK, as it instead targets fast growing economies thirsty for power. The International Energy Agency estimates that the current rate at which new capacity is being built will have to almost double over the next decade to meet growing demand and to replace ageing plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2010/oct/05/energy-bills-double-next-decade","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-05T06:00:04Z","webTitle":"Energy bills 'may double over next decade'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2010/oct/05/energy-bills-double-next-decade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2010/oct/05/energy-bills-double-next-decade","fields":{"headline":"Energy bills 'may double over next decade'","bodyText":"Householders face a massive price hike which could see their energy bills doubling over the next ten years to help pay for the £32bn cost of upgrading Britain's dilapidated energy network, they were warned today. Ofgem, the industry regulator claimed that the upgrade of pipes and wires – necessary to guarantee supplies to UK homes while moving to a low-carbon economy – would add an average of £6 a year to consumers' gas and electricity bills over the next decade. But online energy price comparison websites and consumer groups warned that this official estimate was \"the tip of the iceberg\", and suggested that householders were facing increases of between 50% and 100% – taking the average annual bill to over £2,000 – over the next ten years. Ofgem (the Office of the Gas and Electricity Markets) said the hike in bills would support a revamping of Britain's \"ageing networks\", which were mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s. It added that energy networks need replacing as demand increases and consumers change the way they use energy – such as charging electric cars overnight. The regulator also revealed a new pricing model, which it said represented the \"biggest change to the regulatory framework for 20 years\". The new model moves away from previous inflation-tied controls to an incentive-driven approach that rewards more efficient companies. Ofgem chief executive Alistair Buchanan told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the investment would be supported by a 6% increase on the current average household's total annual electricity and gas bill over the next decade, adding: \"It is going to be basically £6 a year over the next 10 years.\" The warning followed a report from Ofgem last week that indicated that bills could increase as suppliers were seeing big rises in wholesale costs. The watchdog expects wholesale prices to increase by 13% by next spring, which, if passed on in full, would see annual gas bills surge by about £81 to £706. Tom Lyon, energy expert at uSwitch.com, commented: \"This is about having an energy system that is fit for purpose – unfortunately it comes with a hefty price tag and mounting concern over who should be footing the bill. Much of the network that we rely on is from the 50s and 60s and can't keep up with increased demand.\" He added: \"The £32bn needed to improve Britain's pipes and wires network alone could equate to £123 for every household over the next 10 years. This is however only a fraction of the overall cost of the investment programme, which equates to £769 per household [a year].\" That figure would take the average annual household energy bill to over £2,000 – a huge 67% rise. Mark Todd, the director of energyhelpline.com, said: \"The Ofgem prediction of energy bills rising £60 over 10 years looks to be the tip of the iceberg. We would expect to see bills rise by 50-100% overall, meaning the bill for an average home would rise from £1,150 now to £1,725-2,300 by 2020. This rise of up to £1,150 is because Ofgem is only talking about transporting gas and electricity. Actually buying the fuel will rise over time too as gas becomes more scarce and it becomes increasingly difficult to extract from remote locations.\" He said the gradual move towards green power also had a price tag: \"It is going to be much more expensive to produce green electricity rather than just burning goal or gas. Renewable supplies will need investment and the government has committed to a nuclear power station building programme that will cost tens of billions of pounds.\" Ofgem's new pricing model, dubbed RIIO, will set pricing controls every eight years, rather than the current five-year period, and will offer incentives to efficient companies while clamping down on poorly performing firms. Mr Buchanan said the RIIO model would \"ensure investment but at a fair price for consumers\" and would \"financially penalise laggards\" in the industry. The regulator said \"smarter networks\" were required to deal with more complex methods of supply, such as energy recycling methods, including combined heat and power generation. The plans have been developed over the past two years and will be rolled out from the end of 2012, Ofgem added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2010/mar/17/nuclear-landfill-plans-rejected","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-17T16:27:35Z","webTitle":"Labour's nuclear ambitions hurt as councillors reject landfill waste plan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/mar/17/nuclear-landfill-plans-rejected","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/mar/17/nuclear-landfill-plans-rejected","fields":{"headline":"Labour's nuclear ambitions hurt as councillors reject landfill waste plan","bodyText":"Government plans to further its wider nuclear ambitions by allowing waste to be disposed of in ordinary landfill sites have fallen at the first hurdle with a council rejecting a proposal supported by its own planning officers and the Environment Agency. Villagers in King's Cliffe fought a vocal and successful campaign to convince Northamptonshire county councillors they should prevent waste company Augean from turning a former local clay pit into the country's first low level radioactive dump. The decision, which was taken on Tuesday night, is a setback for ministers who believe public support for a new generation of nuclear power stations partly depends on developing a credible way of dealing with waste. Britain's one purpose-built repository – at Drigg in Cumbria –is beginning to fill up and the government wanted to relieve pressure on it by opening up landfill for very low level materials such as rubble. But the council's development control committee unanimously voted against a scheme that could have seen 250,000 tonnes a year of nuclear waste put into landfill close to the historic hamlet of King's Cliffe on the border with Cambridgeshire. Ben Smith, a Conservative who chairs the committee, said he was a supporter of nuclear power but it was \"crazy\" to cart rubble and contaminated soil 90 miles from the former atomic research centre at Harwell in Oxfordshire to be stored in Northamptonshire. \"The treatment should take place on the site where the problem arises and quite frankly this must surely send a message out to anybody contemplating nuclear energy,\" he added. The meeting heard that more than 200 letters of objection had been received and a petition of more than 3,000 names collected, with several people speaking at the meeting itself. Clare Langan, 45, who lives in King's Cliffe and campaigned against the plans, said: \"It really is a victory for common sense and I think the councillors who debated the matter today and the chairman should be commended. I think they have put people's health ahead of a company's wealth. \"People felt very strongly about it because, yes, it's our backyard, but what's really important was it was a precedent for the rest of the country. \"You can't dispose of this material on an ad hoc, piecemeal basis. There's got to be a proper plan in place,\" she added. Augean, which has been hit by fines for breaching environmental regulations in the past, has not given up yet on its plans, according to Gene Wilson, Augean's technical director, who added: \"Naturally we are disappointed that Northamptonshire county council was not able to support our application. We will be considering how best to take these important proposals forward.\" The decision will be watched carefully in Cumbria where waste companies are also pushing to use a landfill site at Lillyhall and a disused strip mine at Keekle Head for radioactive waste. Labour councillor John McGhee said the committee had a duty to protect the people of Northamptonshire but added: \"We will be setting a precedent, not just for King's Cliffe, not just for the north of the county, or Northamptonshire, but for the whole country.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/188773","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-02T12:30:18Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Berlusconi  accused of 'profiting personally and handsomely' from energy deals, according to US ambassador","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/188773","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/188773","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Berlusconi  accused of 'profiting personally and handsomely' from energy deals, according to US ambassador","bodyText":"Monday, 26 January 2009, 11:48 S E C R E T SECTION 01 OF 05 ROME 000097 NOFORN SIPDIS DEPT FOR INR/I EO 12958 DECL: 01/19/2019 TAGS PREL, PGOV, ENRG, EPET, RS, IT SUBJECT: ITALY-RUSSIA RELATIONS: THE VIEW FROM ROME (C-RE8-02675) REF: A) 08 STATE 134386 B) ROME 451 Classified By: Ronald P.

Italy's relationship with Russia is complex, encompassing historical ideological sympathies, geostrategic calculations, commercial pressure, energy dependence, and personal relationships between top leaders. The combination of these factors creates a strong tendency for Italy's foreign policy to be highly receptive to Russian efforts to gain greater political influence in the EU and to support Russia's efforts to dilute American security interests in Europe. In its relationship with Russia, energy is the most important bilateral issue and the quest for stable energy supplies from Russia frequently forces Italy to compromise on security and political issues. A not insignificant concomitant factor is PM Berlusconi's desire to be seen as an important European player on foreign policy, leading him to go where others dare not. End summary. Roots of Italian Russophilia: Ideology on the Left, a Long-Standing Market Opportunity on the Right - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3. (C/NF) Until the 2008 parliamentary elections, the Italian Communist party and various leftist splinter groups were a permanent fixture of the Italian political scene. Throughout the Cold War members of the Italian communist movement maintained close ties with the Soviet Union, other communist countries, and many communist revolutionary movements. Unlike many other communist parties around the world, the Italian communist movement remained unapologetic in its continued belief in Marxism-Leninism as a viable economic alternative to capitalism. While many European leftist intellectuals recognize that -- aside from an authoritarian approach to governing - - Putin's Russia bears little resemblance to Communist ideals, this fact has not deterred Italian communists and other radical left politicians from being openly pro-Russia on the basis of ideological solidarity. This, combined with the advanced average age o most high-level Italian politicians (65-70), prevents many in the far left of Italy's political spectrum from moving beyond a worldview developed (and apparently frozen) during the Cold War. 4. (C/NF) Throughout the Cold War, Italian business interests frequently skirted the line of what was appropriate in their pursuit of the Soviet market. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the explosion of consumer wealth in Russia created massive deman for high-end and luxury Italian exports. From 1998 to 2007 Italian exports to Russia grew by 230 percent, from 2.7 billion Euros to 9.5 Billion. Many of Italy's leading businessmen began to see Russia as a limitless market that could substitute for loss of export revenue from other parts of the world. These businessmen maintain strong ties to the pro-business, free-market-oriented politicians on the right, including the most visible patron of Italy's business elite: PM Silvio Berlusconi. Putin Most Influential Figure in Italy's Russia Policy - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - 5. (C/NF) While Italy's political parties, the MFA and ENI exert some influence on Italy's Russia policy, by far the most importan factor is the personal attention Putin devotes to the relationship. By our reckoning, Putin has held more bilateral meetings with sitting Italian PMs in the recent past than any other world leader. He was the first world leader to meet with Berlusconi after the 2008 elections, arriving in Sardegna to visit the PM designate before the latter had even been sworn in. Berlusconi believes that Putin is his close and personal friend and continues to have more contact with Putin than with any other world leader. During the Georgi crisis, Berlusconi spoke to Putin on a daily basis for a period of almost a week. The basis of the friendship is hard to determine, but many interlocutors have told us that Berlusconi believes that Putin, a fellow 'tycoon', trusts Berlusconi more than other European leader. (A contact in the PM's office told us that their frequent meetings are accompanied by exchanges of lavish gifts). Berlusconi admires Putin's macho, decisive, and authoritarian governing style, which the Italian PM believes matches his own. From the Russian side, it appears that Putin has devoted much energy to developing Berlusconi's trust. 6. (S/NF) Contacts in both the opposition center-left PD ROME 00000097 002 OF 005 party and Berlusconi's own PdL party, however, have hinted at a more nefarious connection. They believe that Berlusconi and his cronies are profiting personally and handsomely from many of the energy deals between Italy and Russia. The Georgian ambassador in Rome has told us that the GOG believes Putin has promised Berlusconi a percentage of profits from any pipelines developed by Gazprom in coordination with ENI. Whenever we raise the issue of Russia and the P with our contacts in PdL, Berlusconi's own party, they have usually pointed us to Valentino Valentini, a member of parliament and somewhat shadowy figure who operates as Berluscon's key man on Russia, albeit with no staff or even a secretary. Valentini, a Russian-speaker who travels to Russia several times per month, frequently appears at Berlusconi's side when he meets other world leaders. What he does in Moscow during his frequent visits is unclear but he is widely rumored to be looking after Berlusconi's business interests in Russia. Our contacts uniformly deem Valentini, a multilingual former interpreter, close to Berlusconi with regard to Russia, but not a polic person. 7. (C/NF) All of our interlocutors - in the MFA, PM's office, PdL party, and even ENI - report that Berlusconi determines Italy's policy on Russia single-handedly, neither seeking nor accepting counsel. Virtually all are reluctant to confront the PM even when he is at his worst on Russia. In November 2008, after a disastrous press conference in which, inter alia, the PM described NATO expansion, recognition of Kosovo's independence, and missile defense as \"U.S. provocations\" of Russia, GOI officials did a classic duck- and-cover. In response to our objections, MFA and PM staff sheepishly directed us to the PM himself, rather than deliver the unpleasant news to him that he had angered not only the Americans but other members of the Contact Group for the Balkans, not t mention the Czechs and Poles. Even FM Frattini admits to wielding no influence on Berlusconi on Russia. During an early September visit to Italy, former VP Cheney confronted Frattini on Italy's very public and unhelpful stance on the Georgia conflict. A subdued Frattini noted that, while he had strong opinions on the issue, he nevertheless received his marching orders from the PM. 8. (C/NF) Distressingly, Berlusconi treats Russia policy as he does his domestic political affairs - tactically and day-to-day. His overwhelming desire is to remain in Putin's good graces, and he has frequently voiced opinions and declarations that have been passed to him directly by Putin. One such example: in the aftermath of the Georgia crisis, Berlusconi began (and continues) to insist that Georgia was the aggressor and that the GOG was responsible for several hundred civilian deaths in South Ossetia. No Institutional Leadership on Russia - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 9. (C/NF) Trying to determine who might have some influence on Berlusconi's Russia policy is not an easy task. One thing is certain, however - it is not the foreign policy institutions of the GOI. FM Frattini is widely seen as only the messenger for PM Berlusconi's Russia policy - indeed he termed himself as much to VP Cheney during the latter's September 2008 visit to Rome. Within the professional ranks, resources and expertise are scant. Italy's MFA contains only one full-time diplomat assigned to cover Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union: the Office Director. The Deputy Office Director position and single Desk Officer position assigned to cover all the countries of the FSU are vacant. Italy's dire budget situation is likely to prevent the hiring of additional staff at the MFA for at least two years, according to one MF source. The Office Director's direct supervisor - the A/S equivalent - is also responsible for the Balkans and the rest of Europe, but she, like Frattini, appears to have little or no input to GOI Russia policy. The PM's staff does not fare much better. The Office of the Diplomatic Advisor is thinly staffed - with only one officer assigned to each geographic region. The position covering Russia is staffed by a midlevel diplomat who is in the process of being transferred. No replacement is likely to be named. As a result, the officer covering the Middle East (also the deputy for the office) will be forced to take on those duties in addition to his already overwhelming portfolio and management duties. 10. (C/NF) In 2008 the MFA undertook an effort to produce a long-term foreign policy strategy for the GOI. In a paper entitled \"Rapporto 2020\" the MFA outlined its strategic vision for the next decade and a half. The document notes that geostrategic realities have created the need for Italy to adapt its foreign policy with regard to Russia and calls for Italy to seek 'a privileged relationship' with Moscow in order to press its overwhelmingly preeminent bilateral concern: energy. ROME 00000097 003 OF 005 Energy Becomes Key Bilateral Issue - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 11. (C/NF) With virtually no domestic energy reserves, no domestic nuclear power, and an ambitious parastatal energy company, Italy's key bilateral concern with Russia has become the quest for long-term guarantees of energy supplies. The GOI has supported ENI and other energy giants' efforts to create a unique partnership with Russia and Gazprom for long-term cooperation. ENI, Italy's most prominent energy parastatal, wields immense political power; its business strategy has focused on complicated geopolitical environments generally perceived as overly risky by many of its international competitors. ENI's lobbying efforts vis-(-vis the GOI are better funded than most government offices. It hosts one diplomatic advisor assigned from the MFA. Going by press reports alone, we would judge that PM Berlusconi grants its director, Paolo Scaroni, as much access as he does his own FM. ENI's director of government affair recently admitted to us that he meets with Gianni Letta, NSA-equivalent and Berlusconi confidant, on a weekly basis. Members of political parties on both sides of the aisle have told us that ENI is one of the leading financial contributors to Italy's many think-tanks - many of which produce public diplomacy discussions and events on the importance of Italy-Russia relations. At one such event in 2007, a conference on Central Asia, representatives from ENI and Edison were given 30 minutes each to speak, while the four Foreign Ministers and Deputy Foreign Minister of five Central Asian former Soviet states were all crammed into a single hour. There is even suspicion that ENI maintains journalists on its payroll. 12. (C/NF) Members of political parties from both sides of the aisle have told us that ENI does not limit its dialogue with the government to energy issues. One member of the opposition center-left PD party told poloffs that ENI's presence in Russia exceeds that of Italy's understaffed embassy. While it is unclear how much policy coordination occurs between ENI and the Russian political structure, the same PD party members noted that ENI had as much contact with Russian political and economic leaders as the embassy, if not more, and political messages were frequently passed through such commercial/economic channels. Back in Rome, ENI maintains strong contacts with members of the Italian parliament - something the MFA does not do (apart from requested briefings to members of the foreign affairs committees). An Energy Policy without the Policy - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 13. (C/NF) ENI and other energy giants have managed to press their case quite effectively within the highest ranks of the GOI. Italian leaders on both sides of the aisle seem strangely unconcerned about dependence on Russian energy. They point out that Italy depended on Russian coal during the darkest days of the Cold War with n dire consequence. Italians are also lulled into complacency by the fact that geographic proximity to North African resources means that they are far less dependent on Russia than are the Germans or the former Eastern bloc countries. 14. (C/NF) During a March 2008 visit to ENI Headquarters embassy staff were given a briefing on ENI's Russian energy operations (available on Embassy Rome's Classified web site). ENI's view of the European energy situation was disturbingly similar to that of GAZPROM and the Kremlin, and at times laced with rhetorical flourishes reminiscent of Soviet-era double-speak: according to ENI, the real threat to Western Europe's energy security is not Russia -- it is Ukraine. The real solution to Europe's energy insecurity, according to ENI, lies in more direct pipeline connections to Russian gas fields and a need for pipelines that do not go through Ukraine - the rationale for the South Stream and Nord Stream pipelines (ref b). ENI's engineering arm hopes to construct both pipelines using experience gained in the construction of the Blue Stream pipeline that connects Russia and Turkey under the Eastern portion of the Black Sea. Additionally, ENI seeks full partnership with Russia on the South Stream project. GOI and ENI contacts have reported that the company was having trouble getting a firm Russian commitment to this South Stream partnership. The plummeting price of hydrocarbons may have reduced the economic incentives for this project, but many analysts believe that Russian geo-strategic concerns will trump business considerations on this project. The most recent Russia- Ukraine gas dispute seems to have revived interest in the Nord Stream and South Stream projects, especially among those who see Ukraine as the problem. ROME 00000097 004 OF 005 15. (C/NF) Italy is not totally blind to the dangers of its dependence on Russia, however, and it is taking some steps that may prevent an increase in the percentage of their energy that they get from Russia. Upon returning to power, Berlusconi announced that he would return the country to nuclear power. While the GOI seems serious, this project will require eye-popping expenditures, long- term commitment, and the resolution of thorny environmental problems. Some fear that the nuclear project was launched in response to an oil price of $140 per barrel, and wonder if the Italian commitment to nuclear power will recede if oil prices stay low. Italy is also increasing its use of Liquid Natural Gas and is finishing work on a new terminal in the Northern Adriatic. While less-than-enthusiastic about the EU's complex Nabucco pipeline, the GOI seems to be supporting the smaller-scale Turkey-Greece-Italy pipeline project designed to bring Caspian gas to Western Europe. Edison, a French company with Italian roots, is trying to determine if it should commit to this project. While Azeri gas supplies and Turkey's willingness to allow the gas to flow West are unresolved issues, Edison believes its project has a chance of succeeding because unlike Nabucco, it is small enough -- it believes -- not to provoke opposition from Russia. The GOI -- especially powerful Minister for Economic Development Scajola -- supports the TGI project (in fact GOI officials complain if the U.S. sometimes seems to imply that Nabucco should have priority). There is fear that a successful launch of South Stream would -- by promising to meet demand -- doom both South Stream and Nabucco. A Foreign Policy Designed to Deny Russia Nothing - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 16. (C/NF) The combination of historical ideological sympathy, energy dependence, lack of institutional influence, and a close personal relationship between Berlusconi and Putin serve to provide Russia with an apparently trusted ally, overtly willing to work overtime within the EU on Moscow's behalf. Russia can count on Italy to support its efforts to remove irritants in its relations with the West, including: - pressure on/within OSCE to overlook Russia's lack of compliance with its legally binding Istanbul commitments on frozen conflicts, - weak support or even opposition to NATO efforts to build closer ties to Georgia and Ukraine, - weak initial support for international efforts to recognize Kosovo's independence, - unhelpful comments on U.S. bilateral Missile Defense plans with Poland and Czech Republic, - support for Russian President Medvedev's plans to redefine European security architecture to undermine OSCE and NATO. - support for Russian efforts to undermine EU and US energy security initiatives for Europe. 17. (C/NF) In the past, Berlusconi's highly-prized personal relationship with U.S. President Bush was an important counterweight to Russian influence, but many pro-U.S. Italian party officials on both sides of the aisle have worried to us that Bush's departure could tempt Berlusconi to move closer to Russia. For his part, Berlusconi has publicly stated that he would like to become a bridge between the U.S. and Russia and to \"educate a young and inexperienced new American president\" on how to deal with the Russians. If the past is any guide, this will likely mean an intensified effort to press the Russian agenda with the U.S. Mitigating the Problem: Pushing Back on a Corrosive Influence - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 18. (C/NF) To tackle the problem head-on, Post has deployed a robust diplomatic and public affairs strategy targeting key figures inside and outside government. Our aim is two-fold: educate our interlocutors more profoundly on Russian activities and thus the context for U.S. policy, as well as build a counter- weight of dissenting opinion on Russia policy, especially within Berlusconi's political party. . Since the beginning of the summer, wit Berlusconi's return to power and the Georgia crisis, we have been engaging with GOI leaders aggressively at all levels. Pol, PA and Econoffs have engaged party members, GOI contacts, think tanks and even press to provide an alternative narrative to the Berlusconi insistence that Russia is a democratic and stable country that has been provoked by the West. The effort seems to be paying off. The opposition has begun taking jabs at Berlusconi by portraying him as choosing the wrong side of the debate. Some in the PdL have begun to approach us privately to say that they would like greater dialogue with us on the Russia issue, and have indicated their ROME 00000097 005 OF 005 interest in challenging Berlusconi's giddiness about Putin. While we have a long way to go in changing the narrative, unfortunately, we have help - in the form of a PM who appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of Putin. Comment - - - - 19. (C/NF) The bilateral relationship between the U.S. and Italy is excellent and encompasses tremendous cooperation on many levels and on many fronts. Unfortunately, Berlusconi efforts to \"repair\" the relationship between the West and Russia (which as he told the Ambassador in their farewell meeting on February 23, \"sticks in my gut as a large undigested mass\") are threatening his credibility and becoming a real irritant in our relationship. We can help get him back on the right track by sending him a clear signal that the U.S. does not need an interlocutor for its important bilateral relationship with Russia and that his insistence on undermining existin structures and channels based on common interests and shared values within the alliance in exchange for short term stability is not a strategy Washington wishes to pursue.

He has made barely any policy announcements on business. His conference speech was regarded in the business world as indecisive. He said he understood the need for wealth-creation, but gave few details away. Fairly or not, Miliband and his team have created the impression that they haven't thought about economic and business policy. He needs an agenda – so how about this one: 1. Redefine what it means to be pro-business. As Vince Cable has demonstrated, this is not easy. But Cable is right about the greed of the banks and the need to reposition the UK economy towards advanced manufacturing and engineering. Miliband has to become interested in the micro issues – small businesses, problems faced by the regions, and the role of the state in establishing secure energy supplies, a science base and more manufacturing. There is no shame in borrowing Cable's clothes – Miliband just needs to wear them more stylishly. 2. Appoint the right shadow chancellor. That means Ed Balls. He is the candidate capable of sowing confusion in coalition ranks. Balls's Bloomberg lecture, warning Britain was making an historic economic mistake by pursuing over-aggressive fiscal retrenchment, drew praise from surprising quarters, such as Boris Johnson. What's more, his diagnosis that major cuts should wait until the recovery is secure stands a good chance of being right. If the coalition, in the face of stagnant economy, is forced into a policy U-turn in a year or two, Balls is the chancellor who will be able to shout \"I told you so\" across the dispatch box. 3. Get an industrial strategy. Peter Mandelson was virtually the first business secretary to make a success of the job since Michael Heseltine. He did so by showing willingness to intervene. As a first step, Miliband should go to Sheffield, stand outside Sheffield Forgemasters and denounce the coalition's axing of the firm's £80m loan to fund presses to make parts for nuclear power plants. Even some Tories think that decision was a mistake. 4. Get a green investment policy. The last Labour government, in its final budget, bequeathed the Green Investment Bank. The coalition doesn't seem to know what to do with it. Miliband should propose giving it more money if the UK is serious about funding green projects and building 21st century infrastructure. £1bn is not enough for a bank – the body risks becoming a quasi-investment fund. 5. Don't go soft on the banks. In a year's time, Labour could be presented with an open goal. The Independent Banking Commission will report its findings on several highly sensitive matters – should the retail and investment divisions be separated and should the likes of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland be broken up? If the commissioners give radical answers to either question, George Osborne has to decide whether to implement them. If he doesn't, Miliband could say he would. In the meantime, keep up the pressure on the bonus front. The coalition is terrified about the next bonus season, when the banks will be paying big bonuses as the spending cuts bite. Miliband should be arguing that £2bn – Osborne's bank levy – is simply not enough. 6. Make some boardroom friends. Tony Blair – whose general election record, let's not forget, was 3-0 – pinned part of the blame for Labour's defeat in May on the lack of support for the party from the business world. He had a point. Chairman and chief executives were queuing to write letters to newspapers to support Tory policies; Labour tried and failed to return fire. It's too much to hope that a celebrity chief executive will declare themselves for Labour at this early stage. But the boardrooms of Britain are stuffed with executives who agree – in private – that the financial services industry has grabbed too great a share of the national wealth. In time, some could be tempted out of the closet if they can see a credible alternative policy that encourages the rebalancing of the economy. But early schmoozing is the best way to get results later."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-climate-change-report-ar5-live-coverage","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2013-09-27T16:01:21Z","webTitle":"Climate change report: live reaction to IPCC conclusions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-climate-change-report-ar5-live-coverage","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2013/sep/27/ipcc-climate-change-report-ar5-live-coverage","fields":{"headline":"Climate change report: live reaction to IPCC conclusions","bodyText":"I'm wrapping up the liveblog now. The two key headlines from today's IPCC report were: • Scientists are 95% certain that human are responsible for the 'unprecedented' warming experienced by the Earth over the last few decades • Global temperatures are likely to rise by 0.3C to 4.8C, by the end of the century depending on how much governments control carbon emissions Here are six of the things we've learned today. We'll cover further reaction to the report and analysis of the document on our IPCC page – head there for the latest updates. The Met Office blog has a good post today about whether climate models should have predicted the 'pause' in warming that's been discussed in light of the IPCC report: The IPCC model simulations are projections and not predictions; in other words the models do not start from the state of the climate system today or even 10 years ago. There is no mileage in a story about models being ‘flawed’ because they did not predict the pause; it’s merely a misunderstanding of the science and the difference between a prediction and a projection. As the IPCC states in line with our three papers on the pause, the deep ocean is likely a key player in the current pause, effectively ‘hiding’ heat from the surface. Climate model projections simulate such pauses, a few every hundred years lasting a decade or more; and they replicate the influence of the modes of natural climate variability, like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) that we think is at the centre of the current pause. For more on this subject, see this earlier post, which includes the same point from our head of environment, Damian Carrington, on the role of the oceans. Suzanne Goldenberg notes that the head of the Heartland Institute in the US has rubbished the IPCC while at the same time admitting he hasn't even read today's summary report yet. She writes: The Heartland Institute,which has been spreading doubt about climate change for years, has come out with its response to the IPCC report. No surprises. Heartland which is funded by the oil billionaire Koch brothers and ultra-conservative interests, has for years put out a rival, spoiler non-IPCC report denying the existence of climate change. Its president, Joe Bast, said he had not yet read the report and did not directly address any of the findings but noted: “Over the history of the IPCC, each report has expressed a higher level of alarmism and a higher level of confidence in its certainty that man-made global warming will be harmful.” Suzanne Goldenberg in the US has been digging into this question of how much carbon we can 'safely' burn. She writes: One of the most striking findings of the IPCC report is the idea of a carbon budget, and how quickly time is runniing out before we are locked into dangerous climate change – just 30 years. Advances in climate-carbon models since 2009 mean that scientists are now able to draw a direct relationship between cumulative carbon emissions and temperature change. Burning more carbon dioxide over time leads to a certain temperature. Burning more than about 1tr tonnes of carbon – the carbon budget – would push warming over the danger point of 2 degrees. The IPCC said humans have already burned about halfway to 2 degrees. The World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank, in a blog post this morning said that the rest of that carbon budget will be exhausted by the end of 2044: \"Do the math, and the world only has 469 PgC (petagrams of carbon) left in the budget. This balance puts us on track to exhaust our remaining carbon budget before the end of 2044 under a carbon intensive trajectory. For context, consider Earth’s increasing pace of emissions: While the first half of the entire global carbon budget was used up over 250 years, the second half of the budget would be used up in only about three decades if emissions continue unabated.” Kelly Levin, the WRI associate who wrote the blog post, put it in even simpler in a conversation just now. “This is kind of like a chequing account and when you have spent it all you have no money left. But unlike a bank, where there is a small fee for bouncing a cheque, the climate has much more significant consequences,” Levin said. She said the finding underscored the need for early climate actions to meet 2020 and 2030 reductions targets which would help slow down emissions, and buy more time. And to carry the personal finance analogy even further, Levin notes that there is actually less in the account than it might seem. The carbon budget does not take into account greenhouse gas emissions from non-carbon sources. “The trillion tonne budget is just with CO2. When you add in non-carbon dioxide emissions the budget drops to 800 PgC of carbon which leaves us only with 269PgC in the budget, which means we exhaust the budget 10 years earlier,” Levin said. Here's some more reaction from a business perspective, with PwC dryly noting that questions such as as how much heat is being absorbed the oceans are still \"not the language of business decisions\", and that the \"communication divide\" between science and business needs to be bridged. Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which represents more than 80 of Europe's largest investors, said the report reconfirmed the need for urgent action to tackle global warming: “The IPCC’s report re-confirms the necessity of urgent action on climate change. Business as usual is not an option. Unchecked climate change will increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, harming societies and causing ever steeper economic losses. “The substantial and sustained cut in greenhouse gas emissions called for by the IPCC to avert dangerous warming will only be achieved with determined leadership at a policy level. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy requires strong, long-term climate and energy policies which breed confidence and spur investment. At the moment, inconsistent and unreliable policy signals are deterring investors and hampering investment in low-carbon energy solutions. “The report also serves as a clear reminder that climate change poses a serious and growing risk to the pensions and investments of people everywhere. As preparations continue for the meeting in Paris in 2015 at which a global deal is expected to be agreed, policymakers have a real opportunity to show bold leadership on climate change ahead of that date. Tom Delay, chief executive of the Carbon Trust, which advises businesses on cutting carbon, said: \"When it comes to climate change the world is like a 40 year old smoker. It's not too late for us to give up but it will get harder and more costly each year we delay. When scientists proved the link between smoking and cancer the message was clear: stop smoking. But when it comes to climate change and burning fossil fuels the scientists' warnings have to date been by and large ignored. Progress has been made but not at the pace required by the science. “We welcome this latest scientific assessment from the IPCC and encourage businesses to look at the enormous commercial opportunities from taking early action and putting sustainability inside their operations. We know from our work with thousands of companies around the world that those that do act early are benefiting in lower energy costs and new business opportunities from a move to a sustainable, low carbon economy. ” Celine Herweijer, partner, sustainability &amp; climate change, PwC, said: “There’s no doubt that the communication and the language of climate change play a part. Science debates have alienated many from the real issues. In reality, when working on climate risk assessments with companies, I don’t hear much debate about climate sensitivity or the heat of the ocean in 50 years’ time. It’s not the language of business decisions. Instead, companies talk in terms of operational performance, asset management, business continuity, security of supply of commodities, energy and water, workforce health and well-being. How will investment in resilience and climate mitigation today, show a rate of return in the future? It’s okay that there are many uncertainties - businesses are experts at making decisions around uncertainty, and in scenario planning. Bridging this communication divide will be critical for action.” We've just published some video highlights of this morning's IPCC press conference, which includes Ban Ki-moon's message, the IPCC's chairman Rajendra Pachauri and co-chair of the report, Thomas Stocker Jennifer Duggan, our Shanghai-based blogger, has been interviewing Ma Jun, arguably China's best known environmental activist. He had this to say: \"In China we need to do our own part to try to combat global climate change. We also have to take measures to adapt to this [the impacts of climate change] just like many other countries.\" \"One thing most people would agree is that climate change would add further uncertainties to our already quite tight water supply situation in China.\" “I hope to see an integrated solution created to deal with both the local pollution problem and the global climate change problem. Much of these two problems have a similar source, fundamentally it is our energy source that is predominantly dependent on coal, China burns half of the world’s coal. That is the source of the problem for our local smog problem and also for our climate change contribution. We need to deal with the coal issue.\" Duggan has previously explored whether China can really claim to be a climate change leader, on her blog. Here's Greg Barker, the UK's Conservative climate minister, on whether doubts should linger after today: There are very few people now who deny that climate change is happening at all. The overwhelming majority of the world's leading scientists have come together, scientists that specialise in climate science to produce this comprehensive report that's more authoritative than any report that's gone before it. When every country signed up the UN agrees climate change is happening and all the major economies agree that we are causing that to happen and that we need to take action, I think we need to be listening to them, rather than the one or two sceptical voices. The full clip, where he also talks about fracking, is below. In case you were wondering what all this means for the UK, Fiona Harvey has been talking to the Met Office to find out. While today's IPCC report doesn't specifically go into the impact of climate change on the UK, the Met's Peter Stott has parsed what its projections mean – and it's basically a lot more rain. Stott said: \"There is an increased risk of extremes. As the atmosphere warms, it can hold more moisture, so there is more to fall when there are conditions that produce rain.\" Those extremes would be reflected in temperature rises too, he said: \"The warmest days will become hotter than they would have been.\" A lot of the press conference questions today revolved around whether or not there's been a \"hiatus\" in global warming over the last 15 years (the Daily Mail's coverage today takes the same line). My colleague Damian Carrington has written a blow-by-blow post tearing the argument apart: This willful idiocy is based on the fact that air temperatures at the Earth's surface have more or less plateaued since the record hot year in 1998. What critics choose to ignore is that of all the extra heat being trapped by our greenhouse gas emissions - equivalent to four Hiroshima nuclear bombs every second - just 1% ends up warming the air. By choosing to focus on air temperatures critics are ignoring 99% of the problem. Are scientists certain that global warming has continued unabated over the last 15 years? Yes. \"The best satellite data we have shows that there is still more energy going into the climate system than is going out, because of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,\" said Ed Hawkins, at the University of Reading. Another Reading scientist, William Collins, said: \"The climate has warmed over the last 10 years, the models are not wrong on the total heat being added.\" So where is all the heat going? About 93% goes into the oceans, much of which were largely unmonitored until the 2000s, 3% into land and 3% into melting ice. Undue focus on the air temperature plateau is cretinous for several more reasons. It's worth reading the whole thing if you have time. A Downing Street source tells me that \"the prime minister welcomes the report, and has noted what it has to say about 95% certainty [that human activities are responsible for the warming the planet has experienced].\" Here's the Liberal Democrat energy and climate secretary, Ed Davey, whose official statement, a Lib Dem spokesman tells me, can be taken as representative of the party's position: The message of this report is clear - the Earth’s climate has warmed over the last century and man-made greenhouse gases have caused much of that global warming. The gases emitted now are accumulating in the atmosphere and so the solutions must be set in motion today. The risks and costs of doing nothing today are so great, only a deeply irresponsible government would be so negligent. Following Ed Miliband's tweet of support earlier, Luciana Berger, the shadow energy and climate secretary, has put out this longer statement, having a pop at environment secretary Owen Paterson's climate beliefs in the process: Today's IPCC report is a stark reminder from the world's leading climate experts of the scale of the challenge we face to preserve our planet for future generations. David Cameron promised his would be the greenest government ever, but he is failing to show the leadership we desperately need to tackle climate change both at home and abroad. On his watch we have an environment secretary who doesn't believe in climate change, our carbon emissions are rising rather than falling and the government has failed to set a target a clean up our power system by 2030. With the 2015 Paris climate conference only two years away, it is vital that Britain makes every diplomatic effort in the coming months to help secure a new global and legally binding climate change agreement. Scientists have reached an agreement. Governments and policymakers must show they can do the same and take action now. Some more reaction from the world of finance, courtesy of Suzanne Goldenberg in the US: Mindy Lubber, president of the sustainable investor network, Ceres, said the report provided even greater certainty about climate change risks, which would push companies to act. She said companies with global supply chain, such as apparel companies which rely on cotton, would look to the report to guide their response to climate change. “The key is beyond the science, climate change disrupts every aspect of the global economy including supply chains, global commodities, and the insurance industry which is seeing exponentially larger losses because of the weather,” Lubber said. ... “ Smart companies who have to depend on commodities are starting to care more and more about climate change. Their bottom line now depends on that,” she said. “The IPCC report for all of us should be a statement of the urgency to take action not just by activists, but by companies and by investors.” The report is the top item on all the major newspapers and news sites in the UK, except for the Daily Mail, which is leading with photos of topless feminist protesters, and has buried the story down four or five screen’s worth of scrolling. BBC IPCC climate report: humans 'dominant cause' of warming The BBC are leading on the line that scientists are 95% certain humans have caused the global warming experienced so far. Matt McGrath, the reporter, highlights a good line I missed from the press conference: “Speaking at a news conference in the Swedish capital, Prof Thomas Stocker, another co-chair, said that climate change \"challenges the two primary resources of humans and ecosystems, land and water. In short, it threatens our planet, our only home\". ” The Times Scientists blame man for climate change and warn of more freak weather The paper's Ben Webster focuses on certainty regarding humanity's role in warming we’ve seen so far. Later on, the story goes into the impacts the IPCC spell out: The study predicts that temperatures are set to rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century without ambitious action to tackle emissions, and could rise by over 4C if emissions continue to increase. Storms will become more intense and frequent, sea levels will rise by between 26cm (10in) and 82cm (32in) by the end of the century and the oceans will become more acidic, the assessment projects. The Telegraph IPCC report: global warming is 'unequivocal' The Telegraph leads on humanity's role in warming, with none of the paper's usual note of climate scepticism, which often worms its way into news stories. For example, a Telegraph news report last week described the IPCC report as “seen as the gospel of climate science and is cited to justify fuel taxes and subsidies for renewable energy.\" Today's story has some insight into the discussions this week on the summary report's final wording: “The discussions, which took place at a brewery-turned-conference facility in central Stockholm were frustratingly slow but there is understood to have been little of the infighting between nations that has characterised past meetings. One delegate told the Telegraph on Thursday night: \"The good news is that the Saudis are not objecting to every word like used to happen [at previous meetings]. \"It is pretty tame compared to the early years of the IPCC when you used to have a real scrum between people like the Chinese, who could be quite difficult. There is no-one in there saying climate change isn't real.\" Daily Mail Climate change is on ice: UN scientists reveal the world's barely got any hotter in the last 15 years - but say they are now 95% certain man is to blame for global warming Except, if you were following our coverage of the press conference earlier or have looked at the report, you’ll see that’s not what the IPCC has “revealed” at all. David Rose’s story for the Mail says the IPCC “still could not explain why the world has barely got any hotter in the last 15 years,” though that’s not quite the whole picture. While Thomas Stocker, the co-chair of today’s report, said that there was not enough published scientific literature on the subject of a 'slowdown', he did speculate on why the rate of warming has slowed in recent years. Independent Sceptics silenced: Scientists are 95% certain humans are causing climate change [frontpage headline] The Indy's take focuses on how certain scientists are that humans are behind warming. One interesting line here: “Scientists involved in the talks said governments have been particularly careful about the wording of this report to make it as difficult as possible for climate sceptics to capitalise on any errors.” Though it's not clear whether today's report will silence doubters. Pachauri admitted as much earlier at the press conference, when asked if the report would silence climate sceptics: “Our job is to do an assessment of the science What impact that has on the public... is not for us to comment” And the climate sceptics have been busy, lashing out. I should that the FT has also given the story pretty big billing, given its business focus, putting its story second behind new productivity figures. Suzanne Goldenberg writes: The IPCC summary for policy holders released this morning is prepared specifically for government, but it will also guide decisions in the business community. Nick Robins, who heads the climate change centre at HSBC, said business leaders will be studying the findings closely – especially those involved in managing risk. “The key thing now is taking this very high quality science and then translating it into a risk management strategy for business which is question both of size of impact and the probability of impact,” he said.”We actually need to avoid not just the most likely scenarios but those long tail high impact scenarios as well.” Even if warming is kept to 2C – which the IPCC report made clear would only happen with extreme effort – the risk of climate disruption was still too high for the insurance industry and for investment managers, Robins said. “If you look at those sectors they are well in advance of many sectors thinking about this issue. Those are the people in the economy we pay to manage risk for us,” he said. Robins said the report is likely to provide further impetus for the move to a low-carbon economy – despite all the talk of a brief hiatus in warming. “There are multiple drivers now that give us more confidence that we are going to accelerate the drive to a low carbon economy. We have much better science, and we are in a much better position to deploy solutions.” Meanwhile, costs of solutions – such as solar panel technology – are also coming down, Robins said. “That means that rather than a pause in action we can go much quicker.” The climate sceptics have started to lash out, our environment editor John Vidal observes. Peter Miller, writing on the Watts Up With That blog says: “I am watching the IPCC farce right now, North Korea would be proud of this type of stitch up. Interestingly, there is absolutely no applause for any of the speakers.... Natural climate cycles remain a heresy. ..This is little more than a jamboree for quasi-government bureaucrats. In Britain, James Delingpole the Telegraph’s attack dog went ballistic even before today's summary report was published: One thing is clear: the version of events you will see and hear in much of the media, especially from partis pris organisations like the BBC, will be the opposite of what the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report actually says.... At the heart of the problem lie the computer models which, for 25 years, have formed the basis for the IPCC’s scaremongering: they predicted runaway global warming, when the real rise in temperatures has been much more modest. So modest, indeed, that it has fallen outside the lowest parameters of the IPCC’s prediction range. The computer models, in short, are bunk. I've seen various other bits and bobs in the climate sceptic blogosphere, but no one there seems to have plucked a 'gotcha' from today's report, yet. UK-based Bishop Hill, run by Andrew Montford, has this, labelling the reporters at the IPCC press conference \"environmentalists\" except for the Mail's David Rose (see earlier post): The general theme of obscurantism runs across the document. Whereas in previous years the temperature records have been shown unadulterated, now we have presentation of a single figure for each decade; surely an attempt to mislead rather than inform. And the pause is only addressed with handwaving arguments and vague allusions to ocean heat. From the questions asked by journalists at the press conference, few cared about the science and the contradictions in what they were being told. The press corps are, almost to a man (and woman) environmentalists and only interesting in decarbonisation. The exceptions were David Rose and the guy from the Economist. So it is very uncertain that the problems in the WGI report will make the mainstream of public discourse. Marc Morano, of US-based Climate Depot, which is funded by a rightwing US thinktank, said: I doubt many will be frightened by the UN IPCC, simply a political body masquerading as a scientific group. The thrill is gone. Suzanne Goldenberg has rounded up what US environmental organisations and politicians have to say (see also John Kerry's statement earlier): Environmental campaigners in America saw the IPCC report as a chance to encourage Barack Obama's efforts to act on climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency last week for the first time proposed limits on carbon emissions from future power plants. The rules are a central pillar of Obama's climate plan and are facing an onslaught of opposition from the coal industry and Republicans in Congress. From Michael Brune, director of the Sierra Club: “The U.S. is already making real progress in the fight against climate disruption by reducing America’s dependence on dirty fossil fuels like coal and oil, while boosting clean energy like wind and solar. These are common sense climate solutions that benefit our economy, health and future, but we need to do more to speed the transition to clean energy and keep dirty fossil fuels, including natural gas, where they belong - in the ground. “The findings in this report confirm that we need the safeguards to curb climate-disrupting carbon pollution from new power plants that the Obama Administration proposed last week. And we cannot stop there. To cement his legacy and protect future generations, President Obama must reject the expansion of dirty fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas -- as well as dangerous nuclear power -- and move full-speed ahead to grow the job-creating clean energy economy.” Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defence Council, also had a shout-out for Obama “The science is clear: We are altering the climate. That must be corrected. President Obama’s common-sense climate action plan will help. His administration is setting limits on carbon pollution from new power plants. That’s a critical step to fulfilling our obligation to protect our children from climate change.” Democrats in Congress also saw the IPCC report as a chance to support Obama's climate plan. Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who is the biggest champion of climate action in the Senate, said: “We have seen the dangerous impacts of climate change all around us – from record high temperatures in the U.S., to severe wildfires in California and other western states, to flooding of biblical proportions, to shrinking Arctic sea ice and rising sea levels. This landmark report underscores the importance of the Obama Administration’s efforts to curb carbon pollution, and I will do everything in my power to support the Administration in their efforts to address the dangerous impacts of climate disruption.” Damian Carrington has been talking to climate scientists at a briefing in London. He asked them what the biggest change has been since the IPCC’s last major report in 2007: Prof Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office Hadley Centre: \"The clear cut statement by the IPCC that the \"human influence on the climate is clear\" is a landmark\" Prof Tim Palmer, Royal Society research professor, University of Oxford: \"The report is further reinforcement that there is an unequivocal risk of dangerous climate change\" Prof Joanna Haigh, professor of atmospheric physics at Imperial College London: \"Carbon dioxide has probably not been this high in the atmosphere for 3 million years. We understand the greenhouse effect, so what more information do people want?\" Carrington also notes that Prof David Mackay, chief scientific adviser to the department of energy and climate change, has been in place for four years but never met David Cameron, George Osborne or Owen Paterson. Saleemul Huq, senior fellow in the thintank International Institute for Environment and Development’s climate change group and coordinating lead author in Working Group II of the IPCC says: The IPCC has confirms what many millions of people in the developing world are already well aware of, namely that the weather patterns have already changed for the worse. People in richer countries are vulnerable too, as recent floods, droughts and storms in Europe, North America and Australia have shown, but because of political inertia and powerful vested interests that have dominated media narratives for decades, they are less aware of the links between these impacts and their carbon emissions. Climate change affects us all and we must tackle it together. Paul Nurse, president of the Royal Society says: It is becoming increasingly clear that we are responsible for warming of the Earth primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels. Predicting the implications of this or how the picture will change in the future are big challenges for scientists and today’s report by the IPCC, whilst recognising uncertainties, gives us the best possible insight into what may lay ahead. Those who predict imminent disaster are probably overstating the case, but equally those who claim that we can carry on regardless are likely to be burying their heads in the sand. Nick Sanderson, a spokesperson for the UK Youth Climate Coalition, says: Today’s report shows the last 30 years were the warmest in 800 years. In that time our generation have grown up and scientists the world over have worked tirelessly to explain the problem. World leaders have barely lifted a finger. Our generation is organising a powerful global movement for change and we need world leaders to follow. Here's a little roundup of our other pieces on today's report. • Graham Readfearn, one of our bloggers in Australia, has broken the IPCC report down by numbers, from 0.85 to 2,000,000,000,000 • Alexander White, also blogging from Australia, reports on the volume of misinformation the media has spread about the report • Emma Bryce, our food and environment blogger, has taken the IPCC report and a report from the UN'S FAO earlier this week as an opportunity to ask: do the UN's new numbers for emissions from livestock kill the environmental argument for vegetarianism? • Then and now - a graphic guide to how the world has changed since the last IPCC report, from population to concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere • For a simple primer to the subject of climate change, delve into our Ultimate Climate Change FAQ, which answers such basics as what the main greenhouse gases are, and what the greenhouse effect is Labour leader Ed Miliband tweets that the IPCC report shows the \"urgent need for long-term policy to tackle it.\" I'm sure I'm reading too much into it and it's pretty clear what Miliband means here, but \"long-term\", seems a slightly odd choice of phrase given today's report highlights is the urgency for short-term action, though obviously carried on through to the longterm. Pachauri, the IPCC's chairman, said earlier: \"There is a need for us to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, substantially, if we want to stabilise the Earth's climate.\" Our US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg, has been speaking to Michael Oppenheimer, a scientist at Princeton University, who she describes as \"one of the leading voices for climate action in America for the last 30 years.\" He was a co-author on the next section of the IPCC report due out in the spring. He said the report had a clear message for governments: Taking the big picture view it says the earth has become significantly warmer and that it is extremely likely that most of the warming of the past 60 years is due to human made building up of greenhouse gasses. The most important message probably is that at the current rate humanity is going to blow through the 2 degrees celsius target governments have set as an indicator of where the warming gets dangerous. One of the most important points of the report is that without extreme effort we are just going to land in the danger zone. Goldenberg adds: Oppenheimer said this report goes out of its way in emphasising that humans have already reached the halfway point in terms of the trillion tonne limit, the cumulative amount of carbon emissions that would raise temperatures above 2C. Once that trillion tonne limit is crossed, the risks begin to pile up: very high sea-level rise, threats to food supply, frequency of heat waves, he said. Finally, Oppenheimer says: We have already emitted about half that amount, and we could emit the other half in the next 25 years. We are on the proverbial supertanker. It's going to be very difficult to turn it around, and the report does make the point very starkly that the 2 degree target is not going to be avoided if we just keep doing what we are doing. Foreign secretary William Hague, who has been perhaps one of the most progressive voices on climate change in the coalition since it came to power in 2010, has put out this statement. My emphasis in bold. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s latest assessment of the science confirms that climate change is already happening, as a result of human activity. The odds of extreme weather events, which threaten lives and property, have increased. Sea levels are rising, and ice is melting faster than we expected. The IPCC’s report makes clear that unless we act now to reduce carbon emissions, all this will continue to worsen in coming decades. Governments, businesses and individuals all have a responsibility to tackle climate change. The longer we delay, the higher the risks and the greater the costs to present and future generations. Hague recently appointed former government scientific adviser Sir David King as his climate adviser. King's approach to the UN climate talks, which today's science will feed directly into, is controversial in some quarters, as we reported earlier this month: King's reappointment to a government role – primarily to guide the UK's stance in international climate negotiations, but he also to advise on aspects of the UK's greenhouse gas reduction – will cause consternation among some green campaigners, because of his controversial views on the progress of UN climate negotiations. He does not believe that the current style of talks, aimed at producing a global agreement similar to the Kyoto protocol of 1997, will bear fruit in the way their backers hope. His view is that the US, which declined to ratify the Kyoto protocol, will not sign up to a legally binding international treaty on climate change because that would require a majority in favour in Congress, which he sees as unlikely. At the same time, he notes, China – the world's biggest emitter – is refusing to countenance a global agreement if the US stays outside. King said that a \"considerably more creative\" solution was needed. This would be most likely to take the form of a \"bottom-up\" arrangement by which each country could set its own targets on greenhouse gas reduction, and meet them at a national level, rather than having to submit to internationally set goals. Former US vice-president Al Gore calls today's report \"an important milestone.\" Here's more reaction from Twitter: Our latest story, from Fiona Harvey in Stockholm, is up now. Here's the top: World leaders must now respond to an \"unequivocal\" message from climate scientists and act with policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the United Nations secretary-general urged on Friday. \"The heat is on. We must act,\" said Ban Ki-moon, as he invited world leaders to a special summit next year to forge a global agreement on emissions. The world's leading climate scientists, who have been meeting in all-night sessions this week in the Swedish capital, said there was no longer room for doubt that climate change was occurring, and the dominant cause has been human actions in pouring greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. In their starkest warning yet, following nearly seven years of new research on the climate, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said it was \"unequivocal\" and that even if the world begins to moderate greenhouse gas emissions, warming is likely to cross the critical threshold of 2C by the end of this century. That would have serious consequences, including sea level rises, heatwaves and changes to rainfall meaning dry regions get less and already wet areas receive more. In response to the report, the US secretary of state, John Kerry, said in a statement: \"This is yet another wakeup call: those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire.\" This is useful. It's easier to read than the update I posted earlier. Scientists are more certain than ever that humanity is to blame for rising temperatures. The head of the UN WMO said \"it is extremely likely that changes in our climate system in the past half century are due to human influence.\" The report says: \"Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system.\" We're likely to go over rises of 2C by 2100, the threshold of warming that governments have pledged to hold temperatures to and beyond which dangerous consequences including drought, floods and storms are expected. \"What is very clear is we are not\" on the path to keeping temperatures below 2C, said Thomas Stocker, one of the co-chairs of today's report. Global temperatures are likely to rise by 0.3C to 4.8C by the end of the century, the report said. Sea level rises are coming. \"Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century,\" says today's report, by a further 26-82cm by 2100, but Stocker said \"there is no consensus in the scientific community over very high sea level rises.\" Scientists said that claims that the rate of temperature rises in the last 15 years has slowed did not affect the big picture and temperatures are going up in the longterm. Climate trends \"should not be calculated for periods of less than 30 years,\" said Stocker. The amount of carbon the world can burn without heading for dangerous levels of warming is far less than the amount of fossil fuels left in the ground. \"The IPCC carbon budget to stay below 2C is 800-880 gigaton carbon. 531 GTC had already emitted by 2011. So we have 350GTC left, which is much less than the carbon stored in fossil fuel reserves,\" notes our correspondent Fiona Harvey. Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, has this to say. I've not seen any statements from the big three parties yet. The IPCC conclusions are clear. The scientific debate is over: the scientific conclusion is we need to take action now to avert catastrophic climate change. \"What needs to begin now is a serious, urgent debate about political and policy action. \"With the Climate Change Act in place, Britain is in a position to be a global leader, which also gives us the opportunity to benefit from a range of new low-carbon industries.\" Alison Doig, Christian Aid's senior climate change adviser, said: Scientific evidence confirms that man-made climate change is a reality and that, without urgent action globally, the impacts will get worse. The time for debate is over, it is time to act. \"Rising temperatures will bring enormous economic and human cost. We need to support countries and communities most at risk in preparing to cope with disaster, to lessen the impacts of extreme weather events and help communities recover more rapidly when they do occur. \"The implications of melting ice caps and rising sea levels for people and economies around the world will be enormous, but it is the poorest and most vulnerable people who depend on the land and sea for their living who will be most affected.\" Lord Deben, aka John Gummer, the former environment secretary and current chair of the government's climate advisers, the Climate Change Commission, tweets that: If you haven't had a play already, try this interactive guide by my colleague Duncan Clark, which shows you what today's report means for temperature rises in your lifetime and for children born today. It illustrates pretty starkly the enormous challenge of avoiding temperature rises below 2C – something that Pachauri and others alluded to at the press conference this morning. Connie Hedegaard, the EU's climate action commissioner, is referring here to the fact today's IPCC report says human activities are 95% likely to be behind the warming we're experiencing, up from the 90% the IPCC said in 2007. Here's our blogger Dana Nuccitelli, explaining why the change is about more than just the number: The fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report states with 95% confidence that humans are the main cause of the current global warming. Many media outlets have reported that this is an increase from the 90 percent certainty in the fourth IPCC report, but actually the change is much more significant than that. In fact, if you look closely, the IPCC says that humans have most likely caused all of the global warming over the past 60 years. The Economist asks: how can we be more certain about human role in the warming? Stocker says simply: \"Becuse we have multiple lines of independent evidence.\" The press conference has just finished. I'll have more reaction for you soon. These are taken straight from the report - I think I've got all of them: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. In the Northern Hemisphere, 1983–2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence). It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0−700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971. Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass, glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide, and Arctic sea ice and Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover have continued to decrease in extent (high confidence) The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia (high confidence). Over the period 1901–2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. CO2 concentrations have increased by 40% since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions and secondarily from net land use change emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification Total radiative forcing is positive, and has led to an uptake of energy by the climate system. The largest contribution to total radiative forcing is caused by the increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO since 1750 Human influence on the climate system is clear. This is evident from the increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, positive radiative forcing, observed warming, and understanding of the climate system Climate models have improved since the AR4. Models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (very high confidence) Observational and model studies of temperature change, climate feedbacks and changes in the Earth’s energy budget together provide confidence in the magnitude of global warming in response to past and future forcing. Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes. This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century is likely to exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850 to 1900 for all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. It is likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, and more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Warming will continue to exhibit interannual-to-decadal variability and will not be regionally uniform Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform. The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. Heat will penetrate from the surface to the deep ocean and affect ocean circulation. It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin and that Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover will decrease during the 21st century as global mean surface temperature rises. Global glacier volume will further decrease. Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century. Under all RCP scenarios the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed that observed during 1971–2010 due to increased ocean warming and increased loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets. Climate change will affect carbon cycle processes in a way that will exacerbate the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere (high confidence). Further uptake of carbon by the ocean will increase ocean acidification. Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped. This represents a substantial multi-century climate change commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2. Pilita Clark at the FT says the summary's reference to the slowdown in temperatures over the last 15 years appears to have been changed this week. Stocker says: There was made a change in placement or messages regarding this issue of climate change I can tell you in these four days all of my colleagues present here in Stockholm were challenged Challenged on a really high level but the governments to tell in simple words what our assessment is I am extremely proud to say we have kept the 18 key messages We have also kept all the figures that were proposed to inform in a comprehensive way policymakers but also the wider public What we have come out with has clearer and more understandable language, but the essence of what we have come out with has not changing whatsoever Pachauri is leaving but says: Wanted to bring to your attention Two years ago we brought out two special reports One on extreme events and disasters The second was on renewable energy sources and climate mitigation Some of the broader questions you are asking, go far beyond temperature changes, so I want to bring those reports to your attention as well Some more reaction to the report, from climate scientists. Professor Corinne Le Quéré, Director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research and a lead author on AR5, said: \"This is not just another report, this is the scientific consensus reached by hundreds of scientists after careful consideration of all the available evidence. The human influence on climate change is clear and dominant. The atmosphere and oceans are warming, the snow cover is shrinking, the Arctic sea ice is melting, sea level is rising, the oceans are acidifying, and some extreme events have increased. CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels need to substantial decrease to limit climate change.\" Prof Matthew Collins, Joint Met Office Chair in Climate Change at the University of Exeter and Coordinating Lead Author of Chapter 12 in today’s report, said: “Further emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further global warming. The Arctic will warm most rapidly and the land will warm more than the ocean. There will be more hotter and fewer cold days. Mid-latitude areas that currently experience high rainfall will get more. Sea levels will continue to rise and snow and ice will melt back. If we follow the highest scenario of future greenhouse gases, the Arctic is expected to be ice-free before the middle of the 21st century. “Avoiding 2 degrees of warming since preindustrial times will be very tough. We have already ‘spent’ more than two thirds of the CO2 emissions that we can afford to spend.” Bloomberg says if a 15 year period is less relevant and 30 years is what you'd normally look at, why did the IPCC even bother mentioning a 15 year period in the report? Stocker answers: It's important to look at the longer term The financial crisis has reduced emissions by just a year \"I've been up for 52 hours with 6 hours sleep\", Stocker repeats. Currently what is very clear is we are not on that path [to 2C] It is clear that this question [of how much the rate of warming has slowed down in the past 15 years] is very interesting for the scienitsts, but there are not many studies that would enlighten us... but when one analyses longer periods, it's not such an unusual case In particular it's worth noting 1998 [when observers are counting the 15 year period from]... was characterised by the second strongest El Nino year in the twentieth century [which has a warming effect]... that, coinciding with a series of medium to low strength volcanic eruptions over the last 5-10 years, plus La Nina [which both have a cooling effect], we are just in a situation where if you cast three dice, you get three faces of six or three faces of one Jarraud reiterates that picking 1998, an exceptionally hot year, is not a meaningful way to measure recent warming. There is no consensus in the scientific community over very high sea level rises This science report has a big impact on Chinese way of life If every Chinese person has a lifestyle like a US person, it would... be catastrophic WWF Samantha Smith, leader of WWF’s global climate &amp; energy initiative, says: “There are few surprises in this report but the increase in the confidence around many observations just validates what we are seeing happening around us. Since the IPCC issued its last big report in 2007, terrestrial glacier loss and sea-level rise has dramatically accelerated; the Arctic summer sea ice losses are higher than originally projected and the last decade was the warmest since 1850... Whichever facts may be discussed, debated or distorted, we cannot ignore the reality that we must act or face frightening new impacts. We know that most of the pollution that causes climate change comes from burning fossil fuels. WWF calls on governments and investors to stop investing in dirty energy and start an immediate and just transition by investing in renewables.\" Greenpeace Stephanie Tunmore of Greenpeace International, says: \"The only logical response to a warning of this magnitude is immediate action. Unfortunately those who are taking this action are now in prison in Russia, while those that are most responsible are protected by governments around the world.\" Friends of the Earth Their executive director, Andy Atkins, brings it back to what the report means for the UK: “Scientists are now as convinced that humans are causing climate disruption as they are that smoking causes cancer - politicians can’t continue to stand idly by while the world goes spinning towards climate catastrophe. “Tough action is urgently needed to end the planet’s dangerous fossil fuel fixation and to develop the huge job-creating potential of renewable power – with developed nations like Britain taking the lead. “The Coalition Government must seize the initiative, starting with a 2030 decarbonisation target for the power sector. “Faced with overwhelming scientific evidence, supported by the public, there is no excuse for failing to act on climate change.” Jarraud chips in to reply to Rose, says it is an \"ill-posed question.\" You should distinguish the ability to predict temperature 10 years in advice, from the ability to predict 20-30 years in advance. The best timescale to look at at is 30 years, he says. Rose is referring to the last 15 years. David Rose of the Mail on Sunday asks: How much longer will the current hiatus [in temperature rises] have to continue for you to conclude there is something wrong with your models? Stocker answers: These climate models have shown remarkable agreement with the longer term trends that we have observed This gives us confidence There is an entire chapter in our assessment that concludes models have improved in their performance Estimates are extremely unlikely to be below 0C This report has now declared a best estimate [of temperature rise] Rose says his question has not been answered. Stocker replies that he cannot give a number today. Rose was the journalist who wrongly claimed earlier this month that the rate of warming experienced recently had been half of what scientists had predicted. He had to retract the claim. On this question of how much more carbon we can burn without having dangerous levels of warming (carbon budgets), Fiona Harvey points out: The IPCC carbon budget to stay below 2C is 800-880 gigaton carbon. 531 GTC had already emitted by 2011. So have 350GTC left, which is much less than the carbon stored in fossil fuel reserves. Stocker is talking more on carbon budgets: Certainly at the level of this SPM [summary for policymakers], we did not communicate specific numbers for when and how emissions should be reduced. We given total amount of carbon that cannot be exceeded to stay below, say, 1.5C or 2C These values need to be taken in the context of the carbon emitted already, up to now We know for example to stay below 2C, another target that is negotiated or discussed at the UNFCCC, we cannot emit more than 1,000 billion tonnes of carbon, of which already 54% have been emitted Pachauri notes that working group 3, which publishes its work next year, will home in on this area. Our Fiona Harvey asks Pachauri and Stocker: on the question of carbon budgets [i.e. how much carbon can be burned if the world wants to keep temperatures between certain limits, such as 2c], it has the clear implication we cannot burn our fossil fuel reserves, doesn't it? Pachauri replies: An extremely effective instrument would be to place a price on carbon To some extent, regulations, informing the public would make a difference But in the ultimate analysis it is only through the market we could get a large enough and rapid enough response We cannot advocate [the solutions] It's for decision-makers Next question: How does AR5 better inform the ongoing UN climate negotiations? Stocker responds: In this report, we have available a large number of climate model simulations Unfortunately the scenarios as they were defined several years ago Were not defined with the goal of informing precisely about warming targets that were being discussed in the policymaker community Nevertheless we could make assessments that numbers such as 1.5C and 2C would be exceeded by the end of the twenty first century Some more heavyweight reaction coming in. Climate and water scientist Peter Gleick, tweets: How can we be sure of predictions over longer term if models could not predict the 'warming hiatus' of late, a journalist asks. Stocker answers There are not sufficient observations of the uptake of heat, particularly into the deep ocean, that will be one of the possible mechanisms that would explain this warming hiatus. Likewise, we have insufficient data... to establish a relationship between the causes of the warming The assessment has shown... that there is a large amount of natural variability And the shorter the time period you determine trend Climate relevant trends should not be calculated for periods of less than 30 years These periods are less relevant for projections of changes in the future AFP asks if the report silences climate sceptics. Pachauri says: Our job is to do an assessment of the science What impact that has on the public... is not for us to comment There is a need for us to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, substantially, if we want to stabilise the Earth's climate AR4 was overall an excellent report But what we have now goes several steps beyond that, because we have a wealth of new knowledge and we have worked much harder Suzanne Goldenberg writes that the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has just come out with a statement calling for action, saying those who ignore or deny the IPCC findings are 'playing with fire'. “Boil down the IPCC report and here’s what you find: Climate change is real, it’s happening now, human beings are the cause of this transformation, and only action by human beings can save the world from its worst impacts. This isn’t a run of the mill report to be dumped in a filing cabinet. This isn’t a political document produced by politicians. It’s science.” She says that Kerry also promised US action on the back of the report. The State Department said in a report on Thursday it was on track in its commitment to cut emissions by 17% from 2005 levels. “The United States is deeply committed to leading on climate change,” Kerry said. We have concluded that in order to limit climate change, it will require continued and substantial reductions of emissions Another parameter, or variable, that has been very carefully assessed, is sea level. These curves [for future sea level rises] go up, of course it depends on the scenario, on our choices today, whether sea level rise will be 24cm for the best estimate for the lowest scenario... or the higher value of 40cm or 63cm by 2100 Stocker says of the 18 headlines in today's report, this one is key: Human influence on the climate system is clear You see how nuanced the language of the IPCC is We don't go for headlines, we go for scientific assessments He says it's \"unfortunate\" measurement systems do not yet permit full and global coverage [of temperature rises] This report consists of over a million words This report is a report that has undergone thorough review I can assure you that during the four days, the 110 governments have looked at every single word, at every number that is in this [summary] report Sometimes paragraphs were discussed over an hour What I am most proud of is we've gone another step to condensing our messages - we give 18 headline messages on less than two pages in simple, understandable language This is an achievement 110 governments have found consensus over 18 short headlines Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time That says the Cancun agreement [of 2010] He says they've only had a few hours sleep over the last two days This is the first of three assessment reports Will close with synthesis report in November 2014 In 2009, WG1 has produced an outline of content scientists together with governments approved It was like a task given to scientists of the world - please tell us what you know of observed climate change More from Fiona Harvey, who says the scientists have addressed one of the sceptics' favourite aguments against climate change - the \"mediaeval warm period\" or medieval climate anomaly of the years 950 to 1250. The scientists say: continental scale surface temperature reconstructions show with high confidence multidecadal periods during the medieval climate anomaly that were in some regions as warm as in the late 20th century these regional warm periods did not occur as coherently across regions as tghe warming in the late 20th century (high confidence) Today's report has not been as well attended by media as the IPCC's 2007 report in Paris, says Fiona Harvey: far fewer jounalists, notably more low-key She adds: Groups are standing outside the conference centre holding placards saying: Stop the IPCC genocidal agenda and \"what the IPCC does not understand: human creativity!\" These are sceptics campaigning against IPCC Pachauri has just highlighted this passage in the report, which he calls a \"succinct summary of what we are doing to the system:\" Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased He adds: I also want to highlight that each of the last three decades has successively warmed at the earth's surface [AR5] Authors are bringing in fresh perspectives, they're bringing in new knowledge We carried out citation of 9,200 scientific publications, roughly two thirds published since 2007 He says they also had over 50,000 comments provided by over a thousand reviewers. Some of the findings of this report go far beyond what we were able to provide in AR4. I want to pay the highest tribute to scientists who have worked on this report. Symbolic of that is what we have been through in the last four days, we have worked two nights, fairly late at night. We've come a long way [since AR4] In 2010, Ban Ki-moon and I requested the InterAcademy council to carry out a detailed assessment of IPCC's processes and procedures. They come up with an excellent report. And the governments of the world who are essentially members of the panel, accepted and implemented the measures fully, except for one which had procedural issues. Here's our story from 2010 on that InterAcademy report Achim Steiner, the head of the UN's environment programme, Unep, is talking now: It is always a tribute to the IPCC that is has found a means of expressing what is certainty and what is uncertainty The report is... once again a very dramatic reminder of the significance, the pace, and increasingly our ability to understand what is happening to the planet For humanity to take decisions, perfect knowledge can never be the condition I hope the world will take from the IPCC's report in this cycle, AR5, a very clear message: you may never know everything but you will know enough to act Despite this really overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change, we need further assessment, further projection In particular to downscale this information at the local and regional level This is essential investment for fuure generations This certainly affirms the importance and need for the IPCC The decade 2001-2010 was the warmest on record Continuing the trend of global warming More temperature records were broken than in any other decade The rate of increase would have been even greater if not for the influence of La Nina and ocean cooling Jarraud says: It is extremely likely that changes in our climate system in the past half century are due to human influence It should serve as another wakeup call that our activities will have a profound impact on society not just for us but for generations to come The world's eyes are on Stockholm today Since 1990 the IPCC has provided regular unbiased assesments of the mounting impacts fo a warming planet. You are the world's authority on climate change. This new report will be essential for governments as they work to finalise an ambitious legal agreement on climate change in 2015. To add momentum to this process, I will convene a climate summit in September 2014 at the highest level... The heat is on. Now we must act. Is now working - it's here John Vidal has reported on what consequences the IPCC report spells out for developing countries: Low-income countries will remain on the frontline of human-induced climate change over the next century, experiencing gradual sea-level rises, stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains, and larger and longer heatwaves, according to the most thorough assessment of the issue yet. The last major UN assessment, in 2007, predicted runaway temperature rises of 6C or more by the end of the century. That is now thought unlikely by scientists, but average land and sea temperatures are expected to continue rising throughout this century, possibly reaching 4C above present levels – enough to devastate crops and make life in many cities unbearably hot. As temperatures climb and oceans warm, tropical and subtropical regions will face sharp changes in annual rainfall, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released on Thursday in Stockholm before online publication on 30 September. Okay, the IPCC has published the report, the summary for policy makers of working group one (PDF). The full version is out on Monday, but today's summary is the one the world will read. Fiona Harvey has filed this story on the report, which should be available online in the next few minutes: The world is warming, and we are to blame. Already some of the results of this are \"unprecedented\" and dangerous. If we continue to pour greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the levels of warming will cause severe problems around the globe, and could soon be catastrophic. That is the \"unequivocal\" message from the world's leading climate scientists, who have been meeting in Stockholm this week to thrash out the most comprehensive review to date of our knowledge of climate change. If the message seems one that has been heard before - scientists have been reporting for more than two decades on the threat of climate change - the import is still of huge significance. Forging a clear agreement on the science of such a vast and complex issue as the whole future of the planet and its life-support systems is no small endeavour, and the report from Stockholm draws on the work of more than 800 scientists and hundreds of research papers. The scientists also put paid to claims that global warming has \"stopped\" or \"paused\". They said: \"Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850 in the northern hemisphere [the earliest date for reliable temperature records for the whole hemisphere].\" The scientists have faced sustained attacks from so-called sceptics, often funded by \"vested interests\" according to the UN, who try to pick holes in each item of evidence for climate change. The experts have always known they must make their work watertight against such an onslaught, and every conclusion made by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change must pass scrutiny by all of the world's governments before it can be published. So their finding that human influence on the climate can no longer be doubted, that the evidence for this is clear in most regions of the globe, and that only drastic cuts in emissions can save us from disastrous consequences is still a powerful one. \"Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system,\" said Thomas Stocker, co-chair of the IPCC's working group on the physical basis for climate science. \"Limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.\" Their warning on Friday was sent out to governments around the globe, who convene and fund the IPCC. It was 1988 when scientists were first convened for this task, and in the five landmark reports since then the research has become ever clearer. Now, scientists say they are certain that \"warming in the climate system is unequivocal and since 1950 many changes have been observed throughout the climate system that are unprecedented over decades to millennia\". That warning, from such a sober body, hemmed in by the need to submit every statement to extraordinary levels of scrutiny, is the starkest yet. Climate science has been under attack in recent years, as never before, and the clear statement by the world's foremost experts in the field is the starkest warning to date. Sceptics are likely to seize on aspects of the IPCC report, such as taking the very lowest range of the estimates it has produced for future warming. The central estimate is that warming is likely to exceed 2C, the threshold beyond which scientists think climate change will start to cause catastrophic and potentially irreversible changes, by the end of this century. That threshold is likely to be reached even if we begin to cut global greenhouse gas emissions, which so far has not happened, according to the report. \"Heatwaves are very likely to occur more frequently and last longer. As the earth warms, we expect to seee currently wet regions receiving more rainfall, and dry regions receiving less, although there will be exceptions,\" Stocker said. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are now at levels \"unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years\". The oceans have acidified as they have absorbed about a third of the carbon dioxide emitted. Qin Dahe, also co-chair of the working group, said: \"As the ocean warm, and glaciers and ice sheets reduce, global mean sea level will continue to rise, but at a faster rate than we have experienced over the past 40 years.\" Here's more insider info from Fiona Harvey in Stockholm: The Guardian understands that one critical issue that has been satisfactorily resolved is that of the \"pause\" in the rise in global temperatures in recent years, which has been seized on by sceptics as evidence that warming is not happening. The report will say that transfers of heat to the oceans are partly responsible, and that the observed slowdown in the upward march of temperatures is well within the range of projections from the climate models, which reflect the natural variability of the climate as well as the effects of human interference. Another key point is the question of a \"carbon budget\" - the amount of carbon that can be emitted if the world is to avoid the most dangerous levels of warming. The report will quote a figure of 270 petagrams of carbon, equating to 990 gigatons of carbon dioxide, that can be emitted globally by the end of the century. This would require deep cuts in emissions. But the main discussion of carbon budgets will have to wait for the next instalments of the report next year. Leo Hickman examined the question of a pause in temperature rises for us earlier this year, concluding: The \"global warming has stopped\" line from climate sceptics has always hung its hat heavily (and conveniently) on the freakishly anomalous warm year of 1998 as its starting point or baseline. As has been pointed out repeatedly by the Met Office and many climate scientists, this is tantamount to picking the sweetest of cherries. The rate of decadal rise in average global temperatures has clearly slowed over the past decade or so, compared to the previous couple of decades, but to say it has \"stopped\" altogether seems to be a misleading statistical sleight of hand. It also strikes me as complacent, or even reckless, to assume that any slowing is proof that global warming is nothing to worry about. As many scientists in the field point out, there are several likely causes - both natural and anthropogenic variables - that could be masking or absorbing the so-called \"missing heat\", not least the oceans and/or soot released by the burning of coal in fast-industrialising nations such as China. To assume global warming has been falsified is, in my view, a very cavalier, wrong-headed display of long-term risk analysis. And here's our head of environment, Damian Carrington, on the fact scientists were discussing this issue several years ago: Why is this report so important? Mark Walport, the government’s chief scientist, was on Radio 4’s Today programme this morning, talking about its significance: Extremely important moment The evidence is absolutely rock solid There is actually a right answer to the question of whether humans are contributing the climate change I think the terminology of global warming, climate warming isn't the right one it is actually climate disruption We do know that we've emitted half a trillion tonnes of carbon dioxide The issue is that scientists have got to communcate this There are some people who don't want to confront the policy decisions and the easiest way to do that is to rubbish the science Today also had Jeremy Leggett, the founder and executive chairman of solar power company SolarCentury, talking about the business implications of the report. He mostly spoke about what's being described in some circles as the 'carbon bubble'. That's the idea that if governments acted as seriously as the science being presented today requires, then the investment bubble around fossil fuel companies would be popped, wiping off trillions of dollars in value and causing another financial crash. Our correspondent, Fiona Harvey, writes this from Sweden, where the report's press conference is due to begin within the hour: The world's media started arriving long before 8am at the old brewery in Stockholm where the world's leading climate scientists have been holed up all night, and for the past four days, hammering out the final details of their message to the world on climate change. As media and NGOs arrived at the Stockholm waterfront in a grey dawn, the scientists were still locked in their hall making their final deliberations, which were supposed to finish before 8am CET (7am BST). At shortly after 8.30am CET (7.30am BST), the message came that the gavel had come down. The marathon meeting, intended to be produce the most comprehensive assessment yet of our knowledge of climate change, was finally over. At 10am (9am BST), the scientists will speak. Here's our latest news story on the key finding of the report: By 2100, the average projection for how much warming will occur is expected to be slightly above the 2C threshold, considered to be the temperature above which it is considered that climate change will damage the global environment. And here's why the report is so important: It is a crucial forum, not only because it is peopled by the most distinguished scientists in their field, but it was set up and works under the auspices of every one of the world's governments, who all have a say in its construction. Our Australian environment correspondent, Oliver Milman, has reported on the potentially calamitous impacts the report spells out for Australia – where temperatures could rise by as much as 6C on the hottest days. Remember, this is the country that experienced such extreme heat in January that its weather agency had to add a new colour, purple, to their charts. From Milman's story: Australia is expected to experience a 6C average temperature rise on its hottest days and lose many reptile, bird and mammal species as well as the renowned wetlands of Kakadu by the end of the century, the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report will reveal on Friday. IPCC figures obtained by Guardian Australia show that Australia will experience an average overall increase of 2C by 2065, with that figure slightly lower at the coast. Beyond that, the temperature is expected to rise another 3C-4C by 2100. The number of days that don't fall below 20C is projected to rise to 100 a year, with most of these warmer days in the north and on the east coast. The vice-chair of the IPCC, Jean Pascal van Ypersele, has confirmed that the report has been formally approved. He's also confirmed the report will be available for download at 9am BST. Scientists were working into the night on the final wording, our correspondent Fiona Harvey says. This morning, scientists will publish a landmark report on the state of climate change science, a huge undertaking that’s years in the making and whose influence will be felt for years to come. The report, by the UN’s climate science panel, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is being presented in Stockholm at 9am. Our environment correspondent, Fiona Harvey, will be on hand and reporting from the press conference in Sweden, which will be webcast live. I’ve written a little background guide on the IPCC and today’s report, which is actually just the first sliver of a vast body of work on climate change that’ll be published this year and in 2014. Here’s what we're getting today: The summary of the first part of the so-called fifth assessment report (AR5), which focuses on the scientific evidence behind climate change and the human role in it. The IPCC has been meeting in Stockholm this week to discuss the final wording of the summary of Working Group One (WG1), which assesses the physical science, such as concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, temperature rises and climate models. The IPCC’s last big assessment in 2007, AR4, was front-page news globally, with its warnings of future temperature rises that would have devastating impacts worldwide such as floods, drought and sea level rises, and its conclusion that humans were “very likely” warming the planet. I’ll be covering today’s report as it’s published and rounding up the reaction which will come from all quarters - scientists, politicians, civil society, economists, climate sceptics, and beyond. Damian Carrington, our head of environment, will be alongside several IPCC authors in London, while our US environment correspondent, Suzanne Goldenberg, will be talking to leading figures in science and business. John Vidal, our environment editor, will be reporting on the report’s reception in the developing world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/aug/16/iran-plans-new-uranium-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-16T19:02:53Z","webTitle":"Iran outlines plans for new uranium plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/16/iran-plans-new-uranium-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/aug/16/iran-plans-new-uranium-plants","fields":{"headline":"Iran outlines plans for new uranium plants","bodyText":"Iran is to start building the first of 10 new uranium enrichment plants in protected mountain sites early next year – defying international efforts to rein in its controversial nuclear programme. Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, as well as a vice-president, announced that the search for sites for the facilities had ended, state media reported today. \"Finding the location for the construction of 10 more uranium enrichment plants in Iran is over now,\" Salehi told the broadcaster IRIB. \"The construction of one of these sites will start by the end of this [Iranian] year [March] or the beginning of the next year. The new enrichment facilities will be built inside mountains.\" Iran is already enriching uranium at its main, internationally-monitored plant at Natanz and is building a second enrichment facility run by the Revolutionary Guards inside a mountain at Fordo, near Qom, southwest of Tehran. Iran insists its nuclear activities are purely peaceful and argues that as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) it has the right to peaceful nuclear technology. But the UN last month imposed a fourth round of sanctions because of fears it may be secretly developing nuclear weapons. The US and Israel – an undeclared nuclear power outside the NPT – have both refused to rule out military action against Iran. Enriched uranium can be used as fuel to power nuclear reactors as well as to make the fissile core of an atom bomb. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced plans to build the 10 new plants in late 2009, days after the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, rebuked Iran for concealing the Fordo plant. The Islamic Republic has said it needs 20 large-scale sites to meet domestic electricity needs of 20,000 megawatts in the next 15 years. Salehi's announcement, made on Sunday, fits a pattern of statements that ignore international anxiety about Iran's nuclear activities and signal determination to continue in the face of pressure. David Cameron's spokesman called Salehi's announcement a cause for concern. \"The reports that we have seen certainly do not give us any comfort that Iran is moving in the right direction,\" Steve Field told reporters. Ahmadinejad also officially notified the government of the implementation of a new law allowing only minimal cooperation with the IAEA. The law, seen as a retaliation for the latest sanctions, also includes a provision authorising Tehran to retaliate against any countries that attempt to search Iranian ships or planes for dual-use materials with inspections of their own. UN Security Council resolution 1929 calls on but does not require all countries to cooperate with inspections if there are \"reasonable grounds\" to believe the items could be used for nuclear purposes Stewart Levey, the US Treasury under-secretary, meanwhile urged all countries be vigilant about Iranian attempts to evade sanctions, included repainting or renaming ships, falsifying documents and assigning vessel ownership to front companies outside Iran. Last week the US imposed sanctions on three Malta-based shipping companies owned directly or indirectly by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, the national carrier. \"We must redouble our vigilance over both their [Iran's] domestic shipping lines, and attempts to use third-country shippers and freight forwarders for illicit cargo,\" Levey wrote in the Financial Times. \"All shippers should exercise enhanced vigilance, particularly where shipments may involve Iran.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/dec/14/ratcliffe-coal-james-hansen-evidence","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-14T12:34:06Z","webTitle":"Ratcliffe coal trial: James Hansen gives court a crash course in climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/14/ratcliffe-coal-james-hansen-evidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/dec/14/ratcliffe-coal-james-hansen-evidence","fields":{"headline":"Ratcliffe coal trial: James Hansen gives court a crash course in climate change","bodyText":"Nasa's top climate scientist Jim Hansen told a jury at the trial of 20 environmental activists that he had begun speaking out about climate change again in the past five years because of his grandchildren. \"I did not want them to say: 'Pa you understood what was happening but you never made it clear',\" the 69-year-old told the trial last Monday. The activists were found guilty of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass by the court today, and could now face suspended prison sentences. Hansen had flown overnight from his home in the US to give evidence about the science of climate change and in particular the threat posed to humanity by the burning of coal at plants such as E.ON's at Ratcliffe-on-Soar. During his two-hour testimony and cross-examination, Ed Rees QC, for the defence, stopped him repeatedly to ask him to explain the technical terms he was using. But the message he delivered was the clearest – and starkest – crash course in climate change the jury, the judge and members of the public in the gallery are ever likely to get. Hansen, whose speech to Congress in 1988 is seen as pivotal in first bringing climate change to the world's attention, is well-versed in speaking out against the coal industry. Nottingham is not the first British court where he has given evidence. He testified last year in the case of the \"Kingsnorth Six\", who had climbed up E.ON's coal plant. They also used the climate change defence – that their actions were designed to prevent immediate harm to human life and property from climate change – and were acquitted. The day after last Monday's trial, he flew to Switzerland from East Midlands airport to try to dissuade the government there from building a new coal plant. In the past 18 months, he has been arrested twice in the US in protests against coal mining. In his witness statement submitted for last week's case, he argues that if the burning of coal continues to grow at its current rate, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will rise to between 500 and 600 parts per million. This is way above the current level – of about 389ppm – and the maximum level considered safe by an increasing number of scientists of 350ppm. The Guardian interviewed Hansen at his hotel in Nottingham after the case. He was tired after his overnight flight and two-hour testimony and mindful of his 4.45am wake-up call the next morning. But he spoke passionately about his recent trip to Beijing for an energy conference. It is China that is doing the most to avert catastrophic climate change, he says, and has made him a lot more optimistic about the future. He no longer believes that \"the solution to the problem requires an agreement between China and the US as the two big emitters\". He believes that support is growing in China to introduce its own carbon tax to penalise the use of fossil fuels and make renewables and nuclear more economic. \"What I realised is that the most important thing is China,\" he says, cradling a beer and still wearing his trademark cowboy-style wide-rimmed hat. \"They have shot past the US as the biggest emitter by far and they are going to go higher still. It's to their advantage to put a price on carbon. They stand to suffer more from climate change than most places. They have air and water pollution which is horrendous. They don't want to follow the path of the US where the country becomes addicted to fossil fuel and has to protect the supply lines around the world. They have taken the right first step. They are now the number one producer of solar cells, wind and nuclear power.\" He is hopeful that Europe could follow suit and introduce its own carbon price. \"I tend to be naive and gullible I guess but I try to believe that governments believe what they say. And European governments say the right things.\" He also acknowledges the recent progress made in the UK on coal, after coal plants which do not capture some of their emissions were banned last year. But he is scathing about discussions at the UN climate talks in Copenhagen last year and Cancún, which reaches its climax today, over agreeing emissions targets, based on a cap-and-trade system. \"Cap-and-trade with offsets will not work. Because by definition they are trying to trick you. By saying you can put a cap on but it's not going to make energy much more expensive – if it doesn't make energy much more expensive it's not going to be effective.\" He is less positive about his own country. He points to the legal battle in the US in 2007 over tough new car emission restrictions which demonstrated the susceptibility of federal government to lobbying by big business he says. \"The government stood in court alongside the automakers resisting improved vehicle energy efficiency. It's not democracy the way it was intended to be. It's money democracy where $1 is what counts rather than one vote.\" If the US does not start weaning itself off fossil fuels soon, he believes the country is \"headed for second- or third-grade status in decades to come\". Hansen is also critical of how the media often gives climate change sceptics prominence to ensure a \"balanced\" debate even though they are unrepresentative of the mainstream scientific community. Such media distortion of the argument – and powerful lobbying – means that in democracies \"the public is misinformed\". Asked if it was more a case of the public not wanting to believe the frightening realities of climate change, he adds: \"There is some of that. But the majority would go along.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/jul/13/sweden-nuclear-waste-environment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-13T13:00:51Z","webTitle":"Sweden leads the way in burying its depleted nuclear waste","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/13/sweden-nuclear-waste-environment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jul/13/sweden-nuclear-waste-environment","fields":{"headline":"Sweden leads the way in burying its depleted nuclear waste","bodyText":"The bus stops after travelling 3.5km underground, taking us to a depth of 500 metres. We are near the Oskarshamn nuclear power station in south-east Sweden. Water is dripping steadily from the crystalline rock. \"It is pumped out at a rate of 1,700 litres a minute,\" says Jenny Rees, the spokeswoman for SKB, a company set up by Swedish electricity utilities to manage nuclear waste. In 1995, Sweden launched a project to study ways to store depleted fuel from its 10 nuclear plants. Whereas France is obsessed with finding rock formations that stop water from circulating, here the approach is based on a moist environment. \"Other rock formations would be preferable, but we don't have them,\" says Björn Dverstorp, of Sweden's Radiation Safety Authority (SSM). So the Swedes adapted their system to suit local conditions. They plan to encapsulate depleted fuel rods – unlike France there is no reprocessing here – in copper-coated cast-iron canisters. Some 6,000 of these boxes will be required for the waste from existing power stations, but their number is due to increase following the decision by Sweden on 17 June to gradually replace its 10 reactors. After being stored for 40 years in special pools, where part of the residual heat wears off, each canister will be set into a cavity, subsequently plugged with bentonite, a rock that swells up in a moist environment and stops water from circulating. But will that be sufficient to contain the radiation for 100,000 years? All over the world a strange slow-motion race is on to answer the tricky question of how to dispose of waste, some of which will remain radioactive for millions of years, without endangering future generations. The US will have to look for a new site, having abandoned its Yucca Mountain repository where a crack has appeared. Germany has 43,000 cubic metres of waste stacked up without additional protective measures in a leaking salt mine. In Belgium a decision has been postponed for 10 years to enable an underground laboratory to continue investigating how clay reacts to heat released by the storage canisters. So Sweden is among those that have made the most progress. At the end of the year SKB will file a formal application to build an underground storage facility and in 2025 it will launch the transfer of waste fuel currently cooling in ponds at Oskarshamn. Finland, which is working on a similar technical solution, could follow suit shortly. France also hopes to commission a repository by then but seems to have made less progress at the administrative level. Only in 2014 will nuclear authorities be filing an application to build a storage facility near the Bure underground laboratory in eastern France.This article originally appeared in Le Monde"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/13/japan-earthquake-tsunami-survivors-grief","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-13T22:11:12Z","webTitle":"After the tsunami comes  the grief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-earthquake-tsunami-survivors-grief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/13/japan-earthquake-tsunami-survivors-grief","fields":{"headline":"After the tsunami comes  the grief","bodyText":"Harumi Watanabe rushed home to her elderly parents as soon as the earthquake struck. \"I closed my shop and drove as quickly as I could,\" she said. But there wasn't enough time to save them. \"They were old and too weak to walk so I couldn't get them in the car.\" They were still in the living room when the tsunami hit. Though she gripped their wrinkled hands with all her might, the force of the water was too strong. Her mother and father were ripped from her grasp, screaming that they couldn't breathe before they were dragged down. Her last words to them as the surge filled their family home with water, mud and carnage had been a desperate cry to \"stay together\". Watanabe was then fighting for her own life. \"I stood on the furniture, but the water came up to my neck. There was only a narrow band of air below the ceiling. I thought I would die.\" Watanabe is one of the fortunate few residents to survive in Shintona, a coastal town near the centre of Japan's biggest earthquake since records began and one of the worst affected by the tsunami. The nearby bay is filled with cars, concrete and half-sunken homes that have floated away from their foundations. A railway line has been ripped from the ground and twisted vertically like a garden fence. Cars and motorbikes lie broken and so roughly reparked by the tsunami that some balance precariously on their bonnets. Emergency and media helicopters buzz overhead and the bereaved sob by the side of the road. The air is rich with the rotting smell of disaster and death. Japanese army personnel and rescue workers search for bodies amid the mud. Their work is sporadically interrupted by earthquake alerts and tsunami warnings, but they do not have to look far. The dead are wrapped in blue plastic sheeting and laid on military stretchers. Their numbers rose as quickly as the dozen or so rescue workers were able to find and carry them. \"We have found 50 bodies here today and there'll be more,\" said an officer in the self defence forces as his team took a quick lunchbreak. \"We're putting more efforts into rescue elsewhere as there is very little chance of anyone surviving here.\" The death toll in and around this area looks certain to rise. Drive east from Sendai and there are several stretches of devastated coastline. Helicopters buzz above Xintomei and Nobiru, where hundreds of bodies have reportedly been discovered. Further round the coast in Minami Shirazu, close to 10,000 people are reportedly missing after their town was engulfed by the tsunami. The full impact is still to be revealed. Rescue operations have been hampered by disrupted communications and ruptured roads. Travellers to the region are confronted by long traffic jams, broken fuel supply systems and diversions around broken nuclear power plants. Since Friday's earthquake, which has been upgraded to magnitude 9.0, the confirmed toll from the multiple calamities has climbed to more than 1,300 deaths, 1,700 injuries and at least 1,000 missing people, according to the National Police Agency. Many believe that is just the start. The beleaguered residents of Japan's north-east have been exposed to a cocktail of terror that would seem far-fetched even in a disaster film. Following the massive quake and a biblical flood, hundreds of thousands of residents have also been evacuated from the site of three broken nuclear reactors. Chemists have been inundated with previously unheard of requests for potassium iodide, which can help minimise the risk to the thyroid glands in the event of a release of radioactivity. So many aftershocks ripple across the region each day that many locals ignore the official advice that they hide under tables until the tremor has finished. This is dangerous, according to Takashi Yokota, director of the Earthquake Prediction Information Division of the Meteorological Agency, which warns of a 70% chance of a further quake of 7.0 magnitude or greater in the next three days. Much of the concern is focusing on of the elderly. At Shintona, about 90% of the victims were described as old, suggesting this might become a defining characteristic of the disaster. After the Sichuan earthquake in China, in which an estimated 90,000 people died, the focus was on building design and the large numbers of children who died in collapsed schools. In Shintona, however, buildings have – for the most part – been remarkably resilient while the elderly population have proved painfully vulnerable. Several locals said the young had been able to flee quickly after the tsunami warning was issued, but the old found it harder to run. \"There are many old people here,\" said Jiro Saito, head of the local disaster countermeasures committee. \"We have evacuation drills, but people could not get to the meeting place in time. The tsunami was beyond our expectations.We must reflect on our shortcomings.\" Japan is proud of having the world's longest life expectancy, which is particularly evident in rural areas. Shintona's large elderly population is evident in the intimate belongings now scattered in the muddy streets – 12-inch vinyl albums of Enka (Japanese blues) classics, a walking stick and tatami mats. This community is home to one of Miyagi's first old people's homes. The care manager, Kiyoko Kawanami, said she was able to confirm only 20 of the 90 residents as safe. \"We don't know what happened to them. The tsunami hit while we were trying to organise an evacuation,\" she said. Kawanami took one group to the emergency shelter in Nobiru primary school. \"On the way back I was stuck in traffic. There was an alarm. People screamed at me to get out of the car and run uphill. It saved me. My feet got wet but nothing else.\" The fate of the other residents remains unclear. Shigejiro Murayama had come to look for his lost brother. While his wife cried and sighed beside him, he silently progressed as quickly as he was able with a walking stick. But he had to turn back when he saw what had happened. \"There is no road left,\" he laughed darkly. \"This is a mess. Look at what has happened.\" In the nearby city of Sendai, smoke continues to billow across the sky from the fire at a petrochemical factory. The air is filled with the sound of sirens and birdsong. Ai Matsuhashi is showing signs of post-traumatic shock. \"I can't sleep. I feel like the world is shaking all the time. I heard that is normal after a big earthquake, but I'm still worried,\" she said . In a first step towards rebuilding her life, she has tried to tidy up and repair the broken furniture and belongings. But it is a frustrating task because each time she cleans up, there is another aftershock that tilts everything back over again. Since the electricity was restored on Saturday night, she has left the television on for comfort, but there are other worries \"My biggest problem is the lack of a toilet. The authorities tell us we should use plastic bags. But I can't bring myself to do that.\" Shortages of water, fuel and food are a major concern. The city and surrounding areas are filled with long lines of people and cars queueing up for water and petrol. \"We evacuated to high ground and a strong modern building so we are safe, but we haven't had water or electricity since the quake,\" said Yuta Kimura as she waited for her turn to use a well at a shrine in Matsushima. The authorities have established refugee centres in municipal schools and gymnasiums, but several people said they were reluctant to go. \"There is no point going to Sendai,\" said Toshinobu Abe. \"They have just as little food and electricity as us. The refugee centres there are too crowded. We are better off seeking shelter at the temple near our home,\" he added as he tried to salvage some clothes and blankets from the mud, weeds and fishing nets in his now uninhabitable home."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-climate-change-laws","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-02-16T21:31:56Z","webTitle":"Big firms drop support for US climate bill","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-climate-change-laws","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/feb/16/barack-obama-climate-change-laws","fields":{"headline":"Big firms drop support for US climate bill","bodyText":"Barack Obama suffered a setback to his green energy agendatoday when three major corporations – including BP America – dropped out of a coalition of business groups and environmental organisations that had been pressing Congress to pass climate change legislation. The defections by ConocoPhillips, America's third largest oil company, Caterpillar, which makes heavy equipment, and BP rob the US Climate Action Partnership of three powerful voices for lobbying Congress to pass climate change law. They also undercut Obama's efforts to cast his climate and energy agenda as a pro-business, job-creation plan. Only hours earlier, Obama and other cabinet officials had made a high-profile announcement that $8.3bn (£5.3bn) was being awarded in loan guarantees for a company building the first new nuclear reactors in America in nearly 30 years. But the loan decision in favour of Southern Company, which was framed by the White House as a kick-start for new nuclear plants, was upstaged by the departure of the big three firms from the climate partnership. Officials from BP and ConocoPhillips said that the proposals before Congress for curbing greenhouse gas emissions did not do enough to recognise the importance of natural gas, and were too favourable to the coal industry. The house of representatives passed a climate change bill last June, but the effort has stalled in the Senate. \"House climate legislation and Senate proposals to date have disadvantaged the transportation sector and its consumers, left domestic refineries unfairly penalised versus international competition, and ignored the critical role that natural gas can play in reducing GHG emissions,\" said the ConocoPhillips chairman and chief executive, Jim Mulva, in a statement. \"We believe greater attention and resources need to be dedicated to reversing these missed opportunities, and our actions today are part of that effort.\" Opponents of climate change legislation said the departure of the big three companies had all but killed off Obama's last chances of pushing his agenda through Congress. \"Cap-and-trade legislation is dead in the US Congress and that global warming alarmism is collapsing rapidly,\" said Myron Ebell, director of global warming for the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Obama this week is stepping up White House pressure on Congress with a series of events intended to show the job-creating potential of his green energy agenda. His announcement at a Maryland job training centre of the new nuclear loan guarantees was a key part of the strategy. \"Even though we haven't broken ground on a new nuclear plant in nearly 30 years, nuclear energy remains our largest source of fuel that produces no carbon emissions,\" he said. \"To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we'll need to increase our supply of nuclear power. It's that simple.\" The guarantees would commit the US government to repaying Southern's loans if the company defaulted. They cover some 70% of the estimated $8.8bn cost of building two reactors at the company's Vogtle plant, east of Atlanta. White House officials said today'syesterday's announcement reinforced Obama's pledge in his state of the union address last month to expand America's use of nuclear energy and to open up offshore drilling. Obama has also asked Congress to triple loan guarantees for the nuclear industry, to $54bn from the current $18.5bn. The pledge to the nuclear industry was seen as part of a strategy to win Republican support for the climate and energy bill. Expanding nuclear power, which supplies about 20% of the country's electricity, is one of the few elements of Obama's energy and climate agenda to win broad-based support. A number of Republican senators have demanded Obama help fund the construction of 100 new nuclear plants over the next decade. Lindsey Graham, the Republican who is working closely with Democrats to draft a compromise cap and trade bill, is also on board with a greater role for nuclear power. His state, South Carolina, gets nearly half of its electricity from nuclear power. But the subsidies have made some senators as well as environmental organisations uneasy. \"It's a heck of a lot of money,\" said the Vermont senator, Bernie Sanders, who is an independent. \"The construction of new nuclear plants may well be the most expensive way to go.\"The administration is also stuck on a solution for nuclear waste, after shutting down plans to bury the waste in the Yucca Mountain range in Nevada. The administration last month set up a panel to recommend new waste disposal solution. Obama acknowledged those controversies , saying: \"There will be those who welcome this announcement, and those who strongly disagree with it. The same has been true in other areas of our energy debate, from offshore drilling to putting a price on carbon pollution. But what I want to emphasise is this: even when we have differences, we cannot allow those differences to prevent us from making progress. On an issue which affects our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, we cannot continue to be mired in the same old debates between left and right; between environmentalists and entrepreneurs.\" The Southern projects must still win licensing approval. White House officials said the new reactors could come on line by 2016 or 2017, and would generate 2.2GW. Construction alone would create 3,500 jobs, and the plant itself would create 800 operations jobs. The loan guarantees are the first of some $18.5bn in funding originally approved by Congress in 2005. Steven Chu, the energy secretary, said the loans were the first of \"at least half a dozen, probably more\" loans for new nuclear reactor construction. \"We have a lot of projects in the pipeline\", he told reporters, but did not indicate a time for further announcements. The Southern reactors are to be built with the new Westinghouse AP1000 design, which Chu said was safer and more economical than the older generation of reactors. \"If you lose control, it will not melt down,\" he said. \"Three Mile Island was a partial melt down. It was serious, but on the other hand the containment vessel held.\" Chu also disputed a report from the Congressional Budget Office that put the risk of default on loans to the nuclear industry as high as 50%. \"We are looking at ways to increase ways of building these projects on time and on budget,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/nov/02/73-months-counting","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-02T18:30:01Z","webTitle":"73 months and counting … | Andrew Simms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/02/73-months-counting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/02/73-months-counting","fields":{"headline":"73 months and counting …","bodyText":"Coincidence? It must be. It just feels that the world is trying to tell you something. Beware that point when you see patterns everywhere. Cue, on the same day in late October: a) a staged photograph of celebrities, wealthy retailers including Philip Green, and defender of City excess the London mayor, Boris Johnson, all smiling and walking boldly through the London West End laden with expensive-looking bags of shopping; b) a shiny new shopping mall for bankers and traders opens in the shadow of St Paul's Cathedral, brash consumerism openly competing for people soul's with the building next door (its called One New Change, although looking at the list of retailers, \"Same Old Crap\" might be more appropriate; c) chief executives of the FTSE 100 largest companies report an average pay rise of 55% over the previous year. Meanwhile, as a result of the October comprehensive spending review, the outlook elsewhere is, well, a little bleaker. There are massive cuts to public spending that will disproportionately hurt the poor and women in society. There's the unweaving of safety nets, housing benefit rules that are more restrictive and feared to lead to \"social cleansing\". Counterproductively, creating no-go areas for the poor and more divided cities will probably lead to higher social costs. Policies sold as pragmatic are successively being revealed as ideologically motivated. Big cuts also hit the two key government departments dealing with the environment – the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) – of 18% and 30% respectively over four years. Feeble start-up funds were announced for a green investment bank, one sixth of the minimum £6bn thought necessary, and there was a tragic-comic increase in one area after the government underestimated the cost of decommissioning nuclear power stations (\"late and over-budget\" will be carved on the concrete sarcophagi of the industry). National natural assets like swathes of our forests, too, look set to be sold off. The wisdom of that very active day in October is a little, well, questionable, given that the economic and environmental mess we are in was largely brought on by pandering to reckless speculation and debt-fuelled overconsumption. The same month we learned that one fifth of our plant species face extinction due to the pressures of human economic activity, and for similar reasons our overuse of freshwater systems means that the great majority of the human population, around 5 billion, now have questionable water security. There should be a new test for all policies now that we face massive stresses brought on by living beyond our economic and environmental means and social stresses brought on by massive inequality and the structural unfairness of the economy. Whether policy changes enhance or reduce our collective resilience should be their measure. On that basis, October reeked of epic folly, not to mention bad fashion sense also reeking of a 1980s retread. Flamboyance and excess for a few, and the costs of recession dumped on those who did nothing to create it. All this competing for column inches, while life-threatening environmental degradation was pushed back into the margins of public consciousness. Politically there is a strange twist for the environmental movement. For decades greens have been told that the message to consume less and live better is an impossible one to sell. \"Less is more\", went the rule, was just bad politics. Yet somehow, in a different context and with much more dubious reasoning, this is very close to the message that the coalition government have sold to the public. Glossing over the recession's roots in the failure of private financial markets, the cuts have been sold as necessary to correct on overextended public sphere. \"Less\", in terms of public spending is not only necessary, we are told (although this is increasingly being questioned by economists), but will also, they imply, magically lead to better government. History will unpeel these multiple layers of wrong but the current government strategy fails even on its own terms. The unreformed banks look set for a further public bailout. And, if the depth of the spending cuts were not influenced by the fact that the government know, but won't admit this, it would be good to know what their plan actually is. Our energy security is declining, the oil sector is struggling and even Lloyds of London warned that we could be looking at a price of $200 per barrel by 2013. Try pulling an oil-addicted economy out of recession with energy costs that high. David Cameron promised to strain every fibre to focus on jobs, jobs, jobs. Yet the easy and multiple benefits of channelling and leveraging serious resources into job-rich energy efficiency and renewable technologies have been spurned. Experts in the green energy sector were merely relieved that more cuts didn't happen. April may still be the cruellest month, but October got pretty nasty, laying waste to the land for many more months to come. 73 months and counting … • Take action and visit onehundredmonths.org"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/211548","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-09T13:10:41Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: US scorns Venezuela's nuclear ambitions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/211548","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/211548","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: US scorns Venezuela's nuclear ambitions","bodyText":"Thursday, 11 June 2009, 17:24 C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 01 OF 02 CARACAS 000728 SIPDIS HQ SOUTHCOM ALSO FOR POLAD COMMERCE FOR 4332/MAC/WH/JLAO TREASURY FOR RJARPE NSC FOR RKING EO 12958 DECL: 04/21/2019 TAGS ECON, PGOV, PREL, ETRD, EINV, ENRG, TRGY, EMIN, PTER, PINR, ASEC, MOPS, PARM, VE SUBJECT: VENEZUELA INCAPABLE OF SUBSTANTIVE NUCLEAR COOPERATION WITH IRAN/RUSSIA REF: A. CARACAS 26 B. LA PAZ 806 Classified By: Economic Counselor Darnall Steuart for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 1. (C) SUMMARY: A plain-spoken nuclear physicist told Econoff that those spreading rumors that Venezuela is helping third countries (i.e. Iran) develop atomic bombs \"are full of (expletive).\" He said Venezuela is currently unable to provide such assistance particularly as the Chavez administration \"does not trust scientists.\" He added that Venezuela's nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia finalized May 4 is pure political theater as Venezuela is incapable of cooperation with Russia on the development, design, construction and operation of nuclear reactors. Also contrary to the agreement with the Russians, to the knowledge of the scientific community, there is no exploration or exploitation of uranium, ongoing or planned, in Venezuela. The scientist contended that, even if the Venezuelan government used all Cuban scientists, exploring for commercially viable uranium deposits in Venezuela would require a large taskforce and news of such an effort would leak quickly. END SUMMARY. ------------------------------------------- RUSSIAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT POLITICAL THEATER ------------------------------------------- 2. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX told Econoff June 3 that the agreement between Venezuela and Russia on nuclear cooperation has no real substance. The agreement, signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in November 2008, but approved and formally issued by Venezuela's National Assembly May 4, lays out cooperation between the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy and Petroleum and Russia's Rosatom in the following areas: 1. Basic Nuclear Research; 2. Controlled Thermonuclear Synthesis; 3. Development, design, construction and operation of nuclear reactors; 4. Industrial production of inputs and components for nuclear reactors; 5. Exploration and exploitation of uranium and thorium; 6. Infrastructure development for nuclear energy; and 7. the development of a legal framework in the sector. 3. (C) In a previous conversation XXXXXXXXXXXX stated that the only part of the Russian agreement that had any potential might be the exploration and exploitation of thorium, as he believes Venezuela has significant deposits of that resource (Ref A). XXXXXXXXXXXX emphasized that as to the rest of the agreement, meaningful cooperation is not possible. All Venezuela is currently capable of, he argued, is the purchase of finished materials and technology. --------------------------------------------- ----- URANIUM EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION NOT HAPPENING --------------------------------------------- ----- 4. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX bluntly discounted the idea of cooperation with the Russians on uranium exploration and exploitation, as well as rumors that Venezuela is providing Venezuelan uranium to assist other countries (i.e. Iran) with \"atomic bombs.\" (Note: International press reports citing an Israeli Foreign Affairs Ministry document leaked May 25 alleged that Bolivia and Venezuela are supplying uranium to Iran. For a similar perspective from La Paz on the dubiousness of this claim, see Ref B.) XXXXXXXXXXXX added that former Venezuelan President of the Inter-American Commission on Atomic Energy Julio Cesar Pineda's May 8 statements to the press about Venezuela having more than 50,000 tons of uranium were \"funny\" and \"not too clever.\" 5. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX said that in the states of Merida and Trujillo, there might be uranium deposits ranging between 60 parts per million (ppm) and 2,000 ppm, with 200 ppm being the minimum for an economically viable deposit. He contended that no one could be sure, however, since the last meaningful study CARACAS 00000728 002 OF 002 concluded in 1976. He noted that XXXXXXXXXXXX has conducted a \"yellow cake\" experiment with a few milligrams of Venezuelan uranium, but that it is impossible to extrapolate or even guess at the amount of uranium in Venezuela from such limited testing. 6. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX explained that currently, as with all nuclear related materials, if Venezuela had a need for refined uranium, it would make much more economic sense to simply buy it rather than try to produce it itself. For political reasons, however, the government could decide to refine uranium anyway, XXXXXXXXXXXX suggested. He claimed that no Venezuelan scientists would be involved in such a decision as the Chavez administration \"does not trust scientists.\" Nevertheless, he added, there is no indication of any interest on the part of the government to resume uranium exploration or exploitation. 7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX noted that the last uranium exploration effort involved multiple labs and more than 30 scientists. Such a major undertaking would not be easy to hide for long, he said, even if the government avoided using Venezuelan scientists and opted instead for a 100 percent foreign team consisting primarily of Cuban members. Additionally, there are only three labs in Venezuela that could measure whether or not uranium concentrations are high enough to exploit. All three labs, including the one at USB, XXXXXXXXXXXX reluctantly admitted, either have broken equipment or no nitrogen. None of the three, he said, could currently participate in such a study. ------- COMMENT ------- 8. (C) Although rumors that Venezuela is providing Iran with Venezuelan produced uranium may help burnish the government's revolutionary credentials, there seems to be little basis in reality to the claims. Similar to the conclusions drawn by La Paz in Ref B, it is highly unlikely that Venezuela is providing Venezuelan uranium to third countries. At one point, Venezuela may have been able to make good on Chavez's claims that it would purchase multi-billion dollar nuclear power plants from the Russians, but even that type of \"nuclear cooperation\" is doubtful due to the Venezuelan government's current financial difficulties.

The most extraordinary feature of the police penetration of the green movement was the alleged presence of a woman constable, \"and others … lots of others.\" I looked again at the picture of the Ratcliffe Six, who appeared to be \"greens\" from central casting. It recalled Chesterton's satire on the early Met police special branch, The Man Who Was Thursday, in which all the members of the \"supreme anarchist council\" turned out to be policemen. So, are the greens all policemen, and if so what is their game? Mark Stone, aka Kennedy, clearly had a good job. He could climb trees, buy drinks, sleep with girls, shout at the fuzz and chain himself to nuclear power stations, all on the taxpayer. The only thing that went wrong was a bad attack of Stockholm syndrome. Kennedy fell in love with the enemy. He started worrying about global warming, which was not in the script. Kennedy moved from undercover agent to agent provocateur to plain provocateur. Matters got out of hand. He was cruising round Europe co-ordinating a veritable Baedeker of protest, from Gleneagles to Spain, Iceland to BP, G20, Didcot, Hartlepool, Drax and Ratcliffe-on-Soar. When he and his gang were finally arrested, the game was up. His presence was so prejudicial to the case against the Ratcliffe Six that this week they had to be let off scot free. Running Kennedy – let alone his colleagues – cost the taxpayer £250,000 a year, or £1.75m over seven years. Whether tree-hugging and the occasional trespass constituted threats to national security is moot. A gilded sledgehammer was clearly being deployed to crack a few nuts. They were not a serious terrorist threat. The denouement was a costly fiasco. This is what happens when authority has too much money and no one in charge to impose a sense of proportion. It is significant that Kennedy did not work for any police force. He worked for a murky organisation called the National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPOIU). With a budget of £5m this operates as a branch of the National Domestic Extremism Unit (NDEU) which, in turn, works alongside the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit (NETCU). Ask where this stands, and you will be told it reports to the Association of Chief Police Officers' Terrorism and Allied Matters Committee, codenamed Acpo(TAM). Only those who have tarried in the foggy corridors of the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Metropolitan police can have any notion of the Orwellian extravagance of these places. Agencies, units and groups cruise shark-like round the feet of terrified Home Office ministers. Their staffs, expenses, overtime and accommodation are crammed into London's Scotland Yard and Tintagel House. If challenged, they incant their motto: \"We keep you safe.\" Kennedy's bosses in the NPOIU work for Acpo, but this is not what it seems. It is not, as its name suggests, the police officers' staff club, nor is it a public body of any sort. It is a private company, incorporated in 1997. It is sub-contracted by Whitehall to operate the police end of the government's counterterrorism and \"anti-extremism\" strategies. It is thus alongside MI5, but even less accountable. Acpo was once a liaison group. But, like all bureaucracies, it has grown. It now runs its own police forces under a police chief boss, Sir Hugh Orde, like a British FBI. It trades on its own account, generating revenue by selling data from the police national computer for £70 an item (cost of retrieval, 60p). It owns an estate of 80 flats in central London. While the generous logistical support it offered the greens was doubtless gratis, we do not know if E.ON UK, the operator of Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station, paid for security intelligence from Kennedy. As a private company, Acpo need not accede to Freedom of Information requests and presumably could distribute its profit to its own board. The whole operation is reminiscent of the deals set up by the Pentagon with private firms to run the Iraq and Afghan wars, free of publicity or accountability. There is no more vivid testament to the illiberalism of the Blair regime than these eccentric arrangements. They were all approved by the likes of David Blunkett, Charles Clarke, John Reid and Jacqui Smith. It would be overly cynical to imagine that Acpo was actually sponsoring green activism, to remind ministers of the importance of NPOIU and the terrible things that would happen to power stations if it was cut. But there can be no doubt of the insidious grip that the securocrats' \"social terrorism\" now has on the public's sense of safety. A culture of perpetual fear has become so ingrained in government that nobody dares question any spending to which the word security can be attached. Last month these same agencies gave Britons their annual Christmas present, a day of planted headlines screaming, \"al-Qaida threat to Christmas shopping\". It capped a year of \"cuts threat to child protection\" and \"cuts threat to Olympic safety\". The only consequence of the Christmas stories would have been to scare people off going shopping. They must cost London shops millions in lost or deflected sales. The desire of police lobbyists is to frighten politicians from cutting their budgets, and, in the case of green protesters, to exaggerate the threat they pose to social order. It seems that Acpo and its Whitehall sponsors are aspiring to the realm of Conrad's The Secret Agent. They have a vested interest in fear. The spy and the rebel \"come from the same basket … Revolution and legality are counter-moves in the same game, forms of idleness at bottom identical.\" It is the story of PC Mark Kennedy. The command and control of Britain's police are in chronic need of reform. To have private companies and opaque agencies running undercover operations cannot be right. To delegate responsibility to them for risk assessments, threat levels and safety regulations imposes a cost on society beyond quantification. These costs are beyond public audit. Perhaps the government's proposed new police commissioners – with or without elected mayors – have the answer. For the moment, across the whole range of defence and security, accountability has collapsed. We fight wars for no sensible reason. We spy on greens for no sensible reason. We spend money for no sensible reason. Perhaps we should remember who was \"Sunday\", Mr Big, in Chesterton's novel, the architect of supreme anarchy. He turned out to be none other than the head of special branch himself."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2010/sep/23/barack-obama-appeal-israel-settlement-building","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-23T18:59:24Z","webTitle":"Barack Obama makes direct appeal to Israel over settlement building","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/barack-obama-appeal-israel-settlement-building","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/sep/23/barack-obama-appeal-israel-settlement-building","fields":{"headline":"Barack Obama makes direct appeal to Israel over settlement building","bodyText":"Barack Obama sought to hold the shaky Middle East peace process together today by making a direct appeal from the podium of the UN general assembly to Israel to extend its moratorium on settlement building in the occupied West Bank. With the 10-month freeze due to expire on Sunday, the fledging peace talks relaunched amid fanfare in Washington this month already look threatened. The Israeli coalition government has so far refused to extend the moratorium, and the Palestinians warn that resumption of unencumbered construction by Israeli settlers in the occupied territories may lead them to quit the negotiations. In a half-hour address to leaders of the 192 countries that form the UN general assembly, Obama depicted the crisis over settlements as a test that was fast approaching. \"Israel's settlement moratorium has made a difference on the ground, and improved the atmosphere for talks. ... We believe that the moratorium should be extended. We also believe that talks should press on until completed. Now is the time for the parties to help each other overcome this obstacle.\" To balance the pressure he placed on the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, Obama reiterated the traditional US commitment to the state of Israel and told supporters of an independent Palestinian state to \"stop trying to tear Israel down\". The president's speech was just the visible focus of a mass of diplomatic activity at the UN today aimed at patching the nascent peace process together in the wake of the escalating dispute over the moratorium. The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the US Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, were engaged in numerous one-to-one discussions behind the scenes at the UN. European diplomats were also busy, as well as the British foreign secretary, William Hague, who talked to the Israeli foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, by phone before coming to New York. Netanyahu's problem is that he must find a way to avoid angering the US, the main diplomatic and financial backer of Israel, while holding together the coalition over which he presides, and which is weighted towards pro-settler parties. \"No one is putting money on which way this will go,\" a western diplomat said. Obama said the stakes were high. If agreement was not reached, he said, \"the hard realities of demography will take hold. More blood will be shed. This Holy Land will remain a symbol of our differences, instead of our common humanity.\" Although the Middle East formed the core of Obama's speech to the UN, he also spoke of the stand-off with Iran over its nuclear programme. Obama said Iran would be held accountable if it failed to meet its responsibilities under international conventions. \"The Iranian government must demonstrate a clear and credible commitment, and confirm to the world the peaceful intent of its nuclear programme.\" Obama underlined that the door to talks remained open. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz said it had been told unofficial diplomatic channels between US and Iranian officials had been opened at the UN. The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was expected to give his rejoinder when he took the podium. He has spent all week in New York and has been doing the rounds of TV networks, delivering robust soundbites. On CNN's Larry King Live he accused Netanyahu of being a \"skilled killer\" of women and children, and he predicted to ABC News that there would be a war that would \"know no boundaries\" if the US were to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. International sanctions continue to tighten on Iran. This week Russia banned sales of its anti-aircraft missiles system to the country. The Iranian defence minister, General Ahmad Vahidi, accused Russia of caving in to western pressure. \"We think Russia should show it has an independent stance in choosing its relations with other countries, as well as on international issues,\" he said on Iranian state TV. Russia was party to a fourth round of sanctions imposed by the UN security council in June designed to push the Iranian regime to pulling back from what is an alleged attempt to build an atom bomb. Tehran has consistently denied the charges, saying it is only interested in generating nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/10/green-taxes-trident-pre-budget-report","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-10T12:30:00Z","webTitle":"A light green pre-budget report | Stephen Tindale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/10/green-taxes-trident-pre-budget-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/dec/10/green-taxes-trident-pre-budget-report","fields":{"headline":"A light green pre-budget report","bodyText":"The pre-budget report included some good climate measures, but nothing dramatic. It failed to increase green taxes, and instead increased national insurance contributions, which will make job creation more expensive and is a foolish move at a time of such high unemployment. And it made no mention of the expansion of Trident, which will cost at least £72bn and deliver no obvious security benefits. This money should be spent instead on the low-carbon transition. The chancellor, Alistair Darling, announced a new scrappage scheme to help up to 125,000 homes replace inefficient boilers. This is sensible and welcome. He also announced a doubling of government finance for carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects. This is also welcome, though it would help if the government actually spent the money it already had allocated rather than running endless \"competitions\". The Treasury also said that there would be changes to the climate change levy. This should be turned into a carbon tax, as the Conservatives have said. And there will be tax advantages for those with micro-renewables, which will strengthen the coming feed-in tariff for solar and other micro-renewables, and for the purchase of electric vehicles. And money has been promised for rail electrification between Liverpool, Manchester and Preston. This is good, though not enough. High-speed rail is essential, and would make airport expansion even less necessary than it already is. The recent Green Fiscal Commission report showed that it is possible to increase green taxes without making fuel poverty more widespread and serious. The commission included MPs from the three main parties, business leaders and environmental NGOs, as well as economists. Taxes will have to go up significantly to reduce the deficit. Taxing labour rather than pollution makes no sense. The expansion of Trident will over the next 20 years will not help the armed forces in Afghanistan, which must be the priority for defence expenditure. The Liberal Democrats have said that the expansion should be halted, as it cannot be afforded. Cancellation would save enormous sums of money, some of which could be used on the low-carbon transition, and would also meet the UK's obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. And it would demonstrate that it is possible to be pro-nuclear power without being pro-nuclear weapons. Nuclear power is needed as a low-carbon bridge technology until we can be 100% reliant on renewables for electricity, heat and transport. This will not be cheap, and will need some form of public financial support (for example, a floor price in the EU emissions trading system). This could make fuel poverty worse, so it is good that the Department of Energy and Climate Change is making social tariffs mandatory. Non-proliferation is the strongest argument against nuclear power – how can we say that it is acceptable for us, but not for the Iranians? The best, indeed only, answer is to follow the approach of the Kissinger-Nunn initiative. This proposes an internationally controlled nuclear fuel cycle, and a nuclear weapons-free world. Kissinger has described nuclear weapons as \"past their sell-by date\". It is bizarre to agree with Kissinger, but on this he is right. There is a nuclear non-proliferation treaty conference next May. The UK government should abandon its proposed expansion of Trident, and spend the money instead on supporting the armed forces in Afghanistan, energy efficiency, renewables, CCS and nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2009/nov/08/nuclear-sites-edf-miliband-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-10T00:42:00Z","webTitle":"UK's nuclear future is mapped out as race to tackle climate change hots up","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/08/nuclear-sites-edf-miliband-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2009/nov/08/nuclear-sites-edf-miliband-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK's nuclear future is mapped out as race to tackle climate change hots up","bodyText":"The government identified 10 suitable sites for the next generation of nuclear power plants yesterday, including two new locations, as part of a plan to overhaul Britain's ageing energy infrastructure. The energy and climate secretary, Ed Miliband, said nuclear power was essential to combat climate change and to ensure energy security for Britain in the decades ahead, describing it as a \"proven, reliable source of low carbon energy\". But he drew immediate criticism from environmentalists who warned of the \"deadly legacy\" of radioactive waste and argued that investment should be focused on renewables instead. The 10 sites had been nominated by energy firms hoping to build reactors. Most are on or adjacent to existing plants, but two identified as suitable are on new sites, Braystones and Kirksanton, both in Cumbria and on the \"nuclear coast\". One of the oldest and most efficient windfarms in Britain will be dismantled at Kirksanton to make way for the nuclear plant, to the dismay of some locals. Miliband said the first new plants could be up and running by 2018. The names of the sites were contained in one of six draft national policy statements designed to fasttrack the planning process for strategically important infrastructure projects. The statements cover nuclear energy, renewables, fossil fuels, oil and gas pipelines and storage and the electricity grid, as well as an overarching statement on infrastructure. Further statements are to follow on areas including airports. The statements will establish national policy and act as guidelines for the recently established Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC), a central planning authority, to be run at arm's length from the government, which aims to give developers decisions on schemes within a year of submission. The policy statements, which will go out to consultation until February, also underlined the government's commitment to \"clean coal\" technology. It is pressing ahead with four trials of carbon capture and storage technology, which aims to bury emissions underground, and reiterated that no coal plants would be built without it. The government also reaffirmed its target of 30% of electricity generation from renewables by 2020. \"We think renewables, nuclear and clean fossil fuels are the trinity of low carbon fuels of the future, all of them have their role to play,\" Miliband said. \"We need all of them because the challenge of the low-carbon future is so significant.\" Any projects with proposed capacity of more than 50MW will be decided by the IPC. Miliband said the streamlined planning authority would avoid tortuous decisions. The current system, he said, was characterised by \"duplication and delay\". But critics raised fears that local concerns would be brushed aside by the IPC. Miliband argued there would still be opportunities to object to new developments. \"But while, of course, we need a process that can turn down specific applications, saying 'no' everywhere would not be in the national interest,\" he said. The other sites identified as suitable for new reactors are Bradwell, Hartlepool, Heysham, Hinkley Point, Oldbury, Sellafield, Sizewell and Wylfa. The only site rejected in the draft document was Dungeness, chiefly because of its \"unique ecosystem\". EDF Energy, which plans to build four plants, described yesterday's statement as a \"defining moment\". A further three sites were examined, at Druridge Bay in Northumberland, Kingsnorth in Kent and Owston Ferry in South Yorkshire, and although \"worthy of consideration\", have been rejected for now. Scottish National Party has refused to join the rush for new nuclear power plants, and plans to replace Hunterston and Torness with coal-fired stations. Ben Aycliffe at Greenpeace said: \"You can't justify building more nuclear power stations when there is no solution to radioactive waste and when international regulators are saying there are huge uncertainties surrounding the safety of designs.\" The shadow energy secretary, Greg Clark, acknowledged the need for urgent action, but said the government was riding roughshod over the democratic process. \"It is a national emergency and it's been left far too late,\" he told Radio 4. The targets Overarching energy policy Sets out core objectives - reduced emissions, security of supply, expanding grid capacity, keeping costs down and sustainable development. To meet demand in 2025, a third of the enlarged energy generating capacity needs to be built in the next 15 years. Fossil fuels Reaffirms commitment to 'clean coal' and trials of carbon capture and storage technology, without which there will be no new coal-fired plants. Nuclear power Of 10 sites identified to build plants, only one, at Dungeness, considered unsuitable. Up to 40% of new energy provision could come from nuclear by 2025. Planning commission will focus on location only. Renewable energy Reaffirmed 30% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020, chiefly from wind with smaller amounts of 'bioenergy'. Gas supply and storage Imported gas will become increasingly important as production in the North Sea declines. Electricity transmission and grid Sets out need for a 'smarter' electricity grid to support a more complex system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/20/nuclear-industry-green-credentials","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-20T18:35:10Z","webTitle":"Watchdog gives nuclear industry a clean bill of health","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/20/nuclear-industry-green-credentials","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/20/nuclear-industry-green-credentials","fields":{"headline":"Watchdog gives nuclear industry a clean bill of health","bodyText":"The green credentials the nuclear power industry claims rest on two factors: uranium is effectively inexhaustible and power stations' carbon dioxide emissions are very low. On uranium, Gordon MacKerron, an energy expert at the University of Sussex, says: \"We are extremely unlikely to run short of uranium for a very long time.\" The suggestion that good quality uranium supplies are becoming scarce is fanciful, he adds. Much of the planet's uranium supplies are yet to be surveyed and with new markets emerging in Namibia and Kazakhstan the supply of nuclear fuel is not expected to peak until 2015 at the earliest. Precisely how long this can be made to last remains unclear. \"Some say we have enough to last for 60 years, and others put it at 360 years,\" says Adisa Azapagic, who is heading a sustainability assessment of nuclear power at the University of Manchester. Such uncertainty depends partly on the amount of growth of nuclear power in the coming decades, but also on the kinds of nuclear technology employed – improvements in reactors make it possible to squeeze far more out of each lump of fuel. In fact, according to MacKerron, over the last few decades the burn-up rate has increased so much that a lump of uranium will last up to three times longer than in the 1970s. In terms of emissions, nuclear power is often described as having no CO2 emissions; this is only really true once a nuclear plant is operational, says Azapagic. The mining and preparation of the fuel and the construction of the power plants all carry a carbon price tag. However even when this is taken into account, nuclear comes out looking relatively clean. Plants produce on average 2-20 tonnes of carbon per gigawatt-hour of energy. According to a report by the Sustainable Development Commission, the government's independent watchdog, this makes nuclear power orders of magnitude better than fossil fuels and on a par with wind power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/us-embassy-cables-documents/245181","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-01T08:24:13Z","webTitle":"US embassy cables: Zardari asks UAE to take in family in event of death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/245181","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/245181","fields":{"headline":"US embassy cables: Zardari asks UAE to take in family in event of death","bodyText":"Monday, 25 January 2010, 09:33 S E C R E T ABU DHABI 000033 NOFORN SIPDIS STATE FOR S/SRAP, SCA AND NEA/ARP EO 12958 DECL: 2020/01/25 TAGS PGOV, PREL, PTER, EFIN, AF, IR, YM, AE SUBJECT: UAE FM DISCUSSES TALIBAN FINANCIAL FLOWS AND REINTEGRATION WITH AMB. HOLBROOKE AND TREASURY A/S COHEN CLASSIFIED BY: Richard G. Olson, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 1. (S/NF) Summary: During a January 11 meeting in Abu Dhabi, visiting Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP) Amb. Richard Holbrooke discussed Afghan reintegration with UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan (AbZ). AbZ noted the importance of establishing an effective and transparent reintegration trust fund that includes Saudi support. Amb. Holbrooke urged the UAE to do more to disrupt Taliban financial flows. AbZ discussed his recent visit to Iran, noting Iran is acting more confident even as the country moves backwards. He added that Pakistani President Zardari had asked the UAE to take in his family in the event of his death. End Summary. AFGHANISTAN MEETINGS -------------------- 2. (S/NF) Amb. Holbrooke began by thanking AbZ for hosting the well-timed SRAP meeting in Abu Dhabi on January 12. AbZ said he was looking forward to the Gulf participation, including that of the Jordanian Foreign Minister, particularly following the recent attack in Khost. AbZ said Judeh had told him Jordan plans to send more troops to Afghanistan; Amb. Holbrooke said Judeh had made the same point during his recent visit to Washington. 3. (S/NF) Amb. Holbrooke said the decisions on the Afghan reintegration program and the upcoming elections would be the key deliverables for the Abu Dhabi meeting and would pave the way to success in London. AbZ asked what the role of reintegration fund contributors would be, noting that the UAE did not want to be associated with a fund that Afghans would find ineffective, non-transparent or slow. AbZ said funding must go to programs with clear benchmarks that have strong financial and policy oversight. He added that it is \"very crucial\" Saudi Arabia donate to the fund, for symbolic reasons. Turning to the elections, AbZ suggested a compromise solution, whereby the Afghan government would ask ISAF when it would be ready to support the elections, rather than having any party dictate to President Karzai. DISRUPTING TALIBAN FINANCE -------------------------- 4. (S/NF) Amb. Holbrooke stressed to AbZ the importance of UAE efforts to combat Taliban financial flows through the UAE. Amb. Holbrooke noted the productive meeting he and Treasury A/S Cohen had with UAE National Security Advisor Sheikh Hazaa bin Zayed earlier on January 12 and the UAE's efforts to crack down on bulk cash smuggling. A/S Cohen added that the USG is most concerned about Dubai's central role in regional financial flows. 5. (S/NF) AbZ asked several questions about USG concerns and the UAE's response, including if Taliban financial flows are regional and/or transiting Dubai, what is the suspected value of these flows, why the USG does not intercepting the funds in Afghanistan, if incoming or outgoing cash declarations would help, and if the USG believed the UAE was not effectively enforcing existing regulations. Amb. Holbrooke and A/S Cohen explained that the USG is concerned that Dubai is being used for the facilitation of the flow of Taliban funds, goods and personnel to and from Afghanistan. The USG is working with Afghanistan and Pakistan, but that the UAE should also take steps to enforce and investigate inbound cash declarations and amend laws to require outbound declarations. A/S Cohen noted that the planned DHS/ICE cash courier training in February would focus on identifing and intercepting likely couriers. PAKISTAN - ZARDARI CONCERNS --------------------------- 6. (S/NF) AbZ said he had met with Pakistani President Asif Zardari in Dubai in late December and the latter was \"in better shape\" than AbZ expected. Stressing the sensitivity of the information, AbZ told Amb. Holbrooke that Zardari had asked AbZ to convey a request to UAE President Sheikh Khalifa (AbZ's half-brother) that Zardari's family be allowed to live in the UAE in the event of his death. (Note: The Bhutto family has lived in Dubai for years and in effect this would be a continuation of a commitment late UAE President Sheikh Zayed made to Ali Zulfikar Bhutto. End Note.) IRAN - AND YEMEN ---------------- 7. (S/NF) Turning to his late December trip to Iran, AbZ said it was his first meeting with Ahmedinejad that did not include a cleric (murshid). He interpreted this to mean that Ahmedinejad is now trusted and does not need constant supervision. Noting that Ahmedinejad had cited Western media criticism of Dubai's financial situation as a plot against Dubai, AbZ told Amb. Holbrooke he believes Ahmedinejad is \"crazy but well-educated.\" AbZ said he felt Tehran is going backwards although he was surprised by the number of women \"not covered up properly.\" The Iranians believe that the United States is now preoccupied in Afghanistan and Iraq, which will prevent any US attack on Iran. AbZ said the U.S. message on Iran in the region is \"not loud and clear.\" Many are acting like Iran is already a nuclear power, and Iran sees the United States is not doing anything about it. If Middle East peace was achieved, AbZ said the Iranians would be unable to suggest they are the defenders of the Palestinian cause. 8. (SBU) AbZ said that FM Mottaki was polite and courteous, \"for a change\" during the December visit. He added that Mottaki called him on January 3 to convey that the U.S. had promised democracy and development in Afghanistan, but the result was more smuggling, narcotics and terrorist acts. Mottaki went on to discuss Yemen, telling AbZ that Saudi and US forces are attacking civilians in Yemen. 9. (SBU) Amb. Holbrooke's office has cleared this cable.

But like high-rise architecture, Britpop and Twitter, it was not long before it became apparent that plastic football pitches were dreadfully regressive, systematically ruining everything they purported to be trying to improve – society, music, society, sport – an empty epoch, a despicable sham. The football played on plastic pitches during the 1980s was egregious reductive nonsense, the surface immediately giving the artless a morally dubious advantage over the artisan. In 1989-90, for example, a poor Luton Town side could boast a better home record than both Manchester United and fifth-placed Chelsea, yet on their travels from plastic-clad Kenilworth Road, had the second-worst away record in the entire division and only stayed up on goal difference. Speaking of Luton, here's a little karmic payback for all those sides turned over on the special surface at Kenilworth. Roy Wegerle has put the home side one up with as good a piece of pure striking skill as you'll see, a simple shift inside from the left and a pinpoint belter into the bottom-right corner, Aston Villa's goalkeeper Nigel Spink given no chance. But late in the day Spink launches a long punt upfield, forcing Marvin Johnson into a panicked attempt at a backpass as the ball rears up erratically. The resulting arc, looping over a perplexed Les Sealey, is as unnatural as they come. Or, indeed, as the pitch itself. 2) Bruno Bellone (Brazil 1-1 FRANCE, World Cup quarter final, 1986) But for proper nuclear-power karmic retribution, full-scale fire-and-brimstone stuff, look no further than the greatest tournament of them all. After 116 minutes of a tumultuous 1986 World Cup quarter-final, Brazil and France were tied at 1-1 and facing penalties. It was at this point that Michel Platini stroked a pass down the middle to set Bruno Bellone free on the Brazil goal. The goalkeeper Carlos, about to be rounded on the edge of his area, raced from the box and embraced both Bellone and moral turpitude, intricate samba rhythms making way for Oi! music. Carlos should have been sent packing, but the referee Ioan Igna merely shrugged his shoulders and waved play on. Brazil had survived to make the penalty shoot-out, but the reckoning was not long in coming. Bellone was one of France's penalty takers, and he dispatched his effort against the bottom of the right-hand post. Unfortunately for Brazil, the ball came bouncing back inside, whereupon it met the back of the diving Carlos, who had guessed the right way but was way too late. The ball pinged back into the net, justice done. The freakiest goal in a major international fixture. 3) Roberto Dinamite (BRAZIL 3-1 Poland, World Cup, 1978) Or was it? Because the 1978 World Cup threw up two humdingers to compare, though neither of them led to success for the lucky recipients. The tournament was only a day old when Italy scored a classic of the kind in their opener against France, Roberto Bettega redirecting a wild sliced shot on to the woodwork with his head, before Marius Tresor's clearance ricocheted towards Paolo Rossi, who eventually prodded home. Italy had conceded in the opening 40 seconds of their campaign, but this goal settled their nerves and sent them on a journey that would take them to within 41 minutes of the final, Holland eventually seeing them off with two long-range rakes. Potentially more crucial was the goal hammered in by the splendidly monikered Roberto Dinamite in Brazil's final game of the second group stage that year. The player had been drafted into the team midway through the tournament over the head of the manager Cláudio Coutinho by the CBF's technical committee, and for once the suits seem to have made a decent decision, the player scoring twice in a 3-1 win over Poland. His second came at the end of an amazing sequence, the Polish post being hit twice by Mendonça and the crossbar once by Gil within the space of a few seconds, before our man exploded into action and fired the ball into the net. The goal meant Argentina had to score at least four goals in their final game against Peru to reach the final, and we all know how that ended up, rendering Dinamite's goal effectively a damp squib. 4) Stan Collymore (Blackburn Rovers 2-3 LIVERPOOL, Premier League 1996) What goes round comes around: this is fast becoming a theme of the freaky goal, and a slightly disconcerting one now we come to think about it. Here's Tim Flowers being hoist by his own petard after hacking lumps out of his own penalty area in order to orientate himself. Stan Collymore advances towards the area and unleashes a shot at a speed that would shame a pensioner playing carpet bowls. No matter: just before the ball reaches the waiting Flowers, it rears up off one of the keeper's divots, over his shoulder, and into the net. Later in the year, Steve McManaman hit another David Bryant-style effort against Tottenham, a lame effort that bucked up off the surface just before it reached the diving Ian Walker and apologetically settled into the net. \"It's all thanks to our portable divot,\" laughed the manager Roy Evans, knowing full well Liverpool's luck was in, but would no doubt come back to bite them on the buttocks at some point. It took a while – nearly 13 years, in fact – but Liverpool finally found themselves on the receiving end with Sunderland striker Darren Bent's infamous billiard shot off a beach ball and past a heel-rocking Pepe Reina. Collymore, incidentally, was never the most self-aware of players, but at least he had the good grace to look sheepish when his effort went in. Compare and contrast to the shameless Bent, who raced off as though he'd just recreated Eddie Gray's second against Burnley in 1970, only using a house brick while wearing slippers. 5) Oliver Wiedemann (TSV WIMSHEIM 2-1 TSV Grunbach, Kreisliga Pforzheim, 2010) This is just stupid. 6) Darren Anderton (ENGLAND 3-3 Sweden, 1995) Roberto Dinamite's strike apart – and his was a standard-issue culmination to a strange move, rather than a freak scene of its own – all our goals have been scrappy affairs. We finish with a real peach, though, a once-in-a-million outcome that was both skilful and aesthetically satisfying. Perfectly timed, too. England had been suffering a hellish 1995, which started with the Lansdowne Road riot, followed by a dire goalless draw at Wembley against Uruguay in March. Come the summer, and the four-team Umbro Cup tournament, a dress rehearsal for the following year's European Championships. They didn't start well for England, who required a late winner to see off Japan. Then, in their second game, they went 2-0 then 3-1 down against Sweden at Elland Road, and with two minutes to go were facing their worst defeat on home soil since the infamous thrashing by West Germany in 1972. Paul Gascoigne set David Platt up to ensure England avoided that ignominy, and then in the final throes of the game, Darren Anderton stepped up and lashed a shot towards the left-hand side of goal. The ball twanged off the post, flew in mid-air along the route of the goalline, hit the right-hand post flush, before spinning into the net at speed. England would still take time to improve for Euro 96 – indeed they didn't find anything approaching top gear until 135 minutes of their tournament had elapsed – but this strike snapped the nation out of its depression and gave it a sense of wonder again. A geometric pleasure, one of the loveliest goals ever scored by England."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"environment/2010/dec/01/cancun-climate-change-summit-china","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-01T16:31:49Z","webTitle":"Cancún climate change summit: China's journey from Copenhagen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/01/cancun-climate-change-summit-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/dec/01/cancun-climate-change-summit-china","fields":{"headline":"Cancún climate change summit: China's journey from Copenhagen","bodyText":"As negotiators arrive in Cancun for the next round of global climate talks, speculation once again hovers around China's positions. China is a tough negotiator, and we can once again see it expressing concern about its core issues, including developed country mitigation commitments, technology transfer and the adequacy of financing. But as we look to negotiating positions, it is also worth stepping back for a minute to reflect on what China is doing domestically and how China's efforts to promote energy efficiency and low carbon technologies can contribute to the global effort to combat climate change. China's commitments for emissions control over the next decade – its 40-45% carbon intensity reduction target by 2020, as well as forestry and renewable energy goals – are not contingent on the international negotiations or on commitments by any other country. China bound its commitment domestically through a State Council decision even before last year's Copenhagen meeting, and it has said that the 40-45% carbon intensity reduction target will also be incorporated into its 12th Five Year Plan to be adopted by its National People's Congress in March 2011. The Five Year Plan is the key tool for directing policy at all levels of government. In the past year China has been moving forward on domestic policy implementation, and key developments include: Reforming the Renewable Energy Law to address problems with how new sources are added to the grid by funding more rural grid development and reinforcing fines on grid companies that don't purchase renewables as required. Adding new requirements to improve energy intensity performance. China's goal for the 11th Five Year Plan (2006-end 2010) is a 20% reduction in energy intensity. This has proven a challenge, especially because of China's massive stimulus plan after the global economic downturn. During 2010 the Chinese government has responded by increasing the number of companies under rigorous energy efficiency plans, shutting down additional inefficient plants and equipment, and giving local governments new targets for energy efficiency, among other programs. Major improvements in energy efficient transportation, including the world's largest high-speed rail program and new construction of both subway lines and bus rapid transit systems in dozens of cities. By next year it will be possible to travel the over 800 miles from Beijing to Shanghai by rail in 4 hours or about 200 miles per hour, as compared with 12 hours now. That means that China has made rail genuinely competitive with much more carbon-intensive air travel. Improvement in energy efficiency standards in areas ranging from industry to buildings to appliances. Standard-setting doesn't get the kind of attention that carbon markets and negotiations do, but it is the true nuts and bolts of improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Investing in clean technology. China continues to invest heavily in wind, solar and nuclear power, as well as in experiments in carbon capture and storage. China is widely expected to soon overtake the United States in total installed wind capacity. Exploring new policy options, including carbon taxes and carbon markets. China already uses a range of policy instruments to control the growth of greenhouse gases, including targets and quotas (from goals for renewable and nuclear energy, to the energy/carbon intensity goals), standards, and financial support for new technologies. It is now looking at new market-based mechanisms. It is widely expected that there will be experiments with these new approaches during the 12th Five Year Plan period, 2011 – end of 2015, although most do not expect to see them as early as 2011. Increasing the political support for climate policy . China's Communist Party Plenum included a full paragraph supporting climate policy. While the statement did not break new ground in terms of policy concepts, it raised the political profile of climate policy in a country where local governments pay close attention to the central government's political priorities. Improving its own measurement and information systems. Despite the contentiousness of international discussions about measurement, there is broad political consensus within China that measurement and reporting are crucial for ensuring domestic goals are met. The Party Plenum document lists improving these systems among the climate policies needed, and in fact the Chinese government has been working on these systems over the past year as it gets ready for its new Five Year Plan goals. What is even more striking is that we are now hearing demands for better systems not just from the central government officials charged with monitoring local performance, but from the localities that want to ensure they get credit for the changes they make. I attended a UK-sponsored seminar of central and local officials with climate responsibilities and local officials said, we know what to do, we want to make sure that it is measured properly so we get credit. This reflects a real change in local awareness both of the policies, but also of what they can do and creates bottom-up pressure for these improvements in monitoring. So in arriving at Cancun, China would appear to have quite a bit to offer, and yet it often ends up appearing defensive. Part of the reason is illustrated in the discussion posted by the China Dialogue Beijing Office Director Meng Si on November 29. Meng interviews China's Climate Minister Xie Zhenhua, who speaks frankly about China's growing understanding of the importance of transparency, but also about his frustration in getting China's message out into the press. All sides of the climate debate seem to understand the importance of transparency, and Xie showed interest in using that to help resolve issues surrounding measuring and reporting. One point to keep in mind is that greater transparency is also needed on accounting for developed country emissions reductions and on the financial support to be given to developing countries. My WRI colleagues suggest new approaches to these issues in two new papers on accounting and climate finance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/sep/16/trident-procrastination-weakens-britain-nuclear-deterrent","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-16T16:39:25Z","webTitle":"Trident procrastination weakens Britain's deterrent | Lee Willett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/16/trident-procrastination-weakens-britain-nuclear-deterrent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/16/trident-procrastination-weakens-britain-nuclear-deterrent","fields":{"headline":"Trident procrastination weakens Britain's deterrent","bodyText":"Britain is still a global power. It has worldwide interests (including overseas territories and resource dependencies) and global responsibilities it continues to uphold. Given the fact that nuclear weapons exist and large, upgraded arsenals are retained by several powers with whom the UK does not have any kind of alliance, it is easy to perceive circumstances in which the Britain might need to use the political leverage of its nuclear deterrent. While there may not appear at the moment to be an obvious, direct threat to UK territory, its global dependencies and reliances make it vulnerable to crises elsewhere. And even if Britain found a way to walk away from these dependencies, a deterrent would still be needed to defend the islands. Existing and emerging nuclear powers provide risks that must be mitigated against, and other states could also seek and gain a nuclear weapons capability. If nothing else, the cold war taught the world that nuclear weapons have significant political leverage. In the 2006 white paper, the Labour government explicitly denied that the possession of a nuclear deterrent had anything to do with generating global political influence. Yet later, as prime minister, Gordon Brown showed exactly how nuclear weapons do have influence when offering to trade the UK's nuclear deterrent in the context of multilateral global disarmament. This influence remains so important that, despite fundamental changes in the way the world operates since the dawn of the nuclear age, the five permanent members of the United Nations security council remain the first five nuclear powers. If Britain was to stand down its deterrent, questions would be raised about its continuing right to retain its permanent seat faster than one could say \"India\". The UK is the only nuclear power to deploy its deterrent in a single system. With a minimum force level, a submarine-based ballistic missile is the only credible option. (A cruise missile would have insufficient range and speed to provide a viable alternative, and in any case building a wholly new programme from scratch independently would cost more than the current system.) Discussions of numbers of submarines and deterrent postures are something of a red herring. The warheads are, after all, the nuclear weapon: everything else (submarines, missiles, infrastructure) just delivers them. William Hague, the foreign secretary, has already broken the mould by publicly stating the number of warheads the UK stockpiles. The current operational posture is for the UK to deploy up to 48 warheads on the patrol submarine. The stockpile is large enough to generate 48 warheads for the patrol boat. Yet the scenario of the UK firing such a large number – despite the strategic logic being that this figure allows the UK to address all potential deterrent circumstances – seems so unlikely that there may be scope to reduce warheads, if not on the patrol boat then from the stockpile. Today's news that the government is considering delaying the building of the replacement submarines by extending the life of the current boats is not new – the possibility was discussed actively during the 2006/2007 white paper debate. Given the UK's financial circumstances and the coalition's agreement to examine the deterrent's value for money, it was inevitable that the government would be examining all options within the strategic defence and security review. With the Liberal Democrat party conference looming, deferring the final decision until the next parliament buys the coalition partners political kudos and breathing space up to the next election. The deterrent is, as it always has been, a political tool, and this latest story is just another political twist in its life. However, if the coalition government hopes that by deferring a final decision on the building of four new submarines will kick the debate itself into the long grass, it likely will find itself mistaken. One surety in the debate has been that every time a government has tried to avoid discussing the issue, this has only reignited the debate. All this discussion does have one clear consequence, however. It creates doubt that Britain is committed to its deterrent tomorrow, thus weakening deterrent credibility today."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/sep/12/iran-vanity-flattery-ahmadinejad","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-12T17:59:06Z","webTitle":"Iran's vanity and how to use it | Sohail Jannesari","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/12/iran-vanity-flattery-ahmadinejad","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/sep/12/iran-vanity-flattery-ahmadinejad","fields":{"headline":"Iran's vanity and how to use it","bodyText":"In the west, it is easy to assume that Iran is an isolationist regime, cut off from mainstream international thought and acting regardless of international pressure. However, this neglects the extreme lengths Iran goes to in order to portray itself as a defiant power. Last year Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was the only head of state to attend the Geneva anti-racism conference. The sole reason for his presence was to stir up controversy and to be seen as taking a stand against the might of the west. Iran does not act regardless of international opinion; it deliberately acts with it in mind. This rhetoric of defiance serves the Iranian regime by providing a common enemy which helps garner domestic support. But more than anything, Iran's defiance gives it the image of a player on the world stage. This is what Iran really craves, not because of any tangible benefits such as trade agreements but more simply because of vanity. Iranians believe that Iran should be a world leader given the country's rich culture, resources and heritage. The aspiration is to return Iran to the ancient prestige it attained under the Persian empire. Despite its monarchist foundations, the idea has certainly continued in the current regime. But defiance is just not cutting it. If Iran was content with its place on the world stage then it would simply dismiss western concerns about Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's stoning. Instead, it postpones her sentence and commutes those of several others. Iran seeks to appease the west. This leaves Iran with a split personality of appeasement and defiance. It's a headache for the Iranian establishment and leaves the country particularly sensitive to foreign pressure. Iran can be pushed one way or another. Any foreign pressure which is applied should be extremely cautious not to provoke a reactionary response from Iran which drives it deeper into the psyche of defiance. Such an error is evident in the nuclear issue. Iran feels that it has been unfairly targeted by the west. This was abundantly clear in May when Tehran hosted a nuclear disarmament meeting. Ahmadinejad lambasted US safeguarding of Israel's nuclear arsenal while depriving countries like Iran of peaceful nuclear power. Iran sees international pressure as an attack on its independence and technological capability. It adopts a defiant psyche because appeasement would show it to be subordinate to the west. Iran's aspirations as a world leader are better served by acting defiant. Diplomatic relations and negotiations with Iran would be much more successful if the west appealed to Iran's vanity. This would involve a large amount of flattery. Iran would have to be treated as an equal. This would immediately solve Iran's dilemma of whether to defy or appease because there would be no opportunity to defy. Iran wouldn't be defying anybody by pulling out of mutual negotiations because no one was forcing them to negotiate in the first place. This approach even compels Iran to actively seek and maintain negotiations, because were it to pull out, its international prestige would suffer. It would be a step backwards in its goal of becoming a world leader. Such a move is easy to deride. Many would cringe in disgust at treating Iran as an equal, let alone a leader like Ahmadinejad. It may be especially unpleasant to give him such a propaganda coup. But if international pressure is ever to change Iran, this is the direction it will have to take. It might be surprising to hear, but Iranian leaders have long been thirsting for such a shift. This is no clearer than with Ahmadinejad who has repeatedly offered to hold comprehensive talks with Obama and has even challenged him to a televised debate. The reoccurring theme in Ahmadinejad's offers is that of mutual respect. He wants to talk to Obama \"man-to-man\", \"face-to-face\" and about world issues, not just Iran's problems. What hope is there, really, of such an approach ever being taken up? Obama has already used the correct rhetoric, most notably in his Nowruz address to the Iranian people. He spoke of seeking engagement grounded in \"mutual respect\" and even spoke of the \"true greatness of the Iranian people and civilisation\". If his rhetoric is supported by deeds, then political pressure has a good chance of breeding a more humane and democratic regime in Iran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2010/nov/09/gas-iea-oil-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-09T19:10:02Z","webTitle":"Gas glut threatens investment in renewables sector, IEA warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/09/gas-iea-oil-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/nov/09/gas-iea-oil-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Gas glut threatens investment in renewables sector, IEA warns","bodyText":"A global gas glut which could last a decade will act as a \"major barrier\" to the development of renewable energy, cleaner coal plants and nuclear power, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). \"The golden age of gas\" will lead to cheaper gas prices for consumers, particularly in Europe. But the IEA added that it is also likely to result in a rush to build gas-fired power plants at the expense of much cleaner forms of electricity generation. The IEA's chief economist Fatih Birol also said that \"Big Oil\" – oil majors such as Shell and Exxon-Mobil – are suffering an \"identity crisis\" because they find themselves increasingly shut out of regions like the Middle East where most of the world's remaining oil reserves lie. They are repositioning themselves as gas producers, which companies like Shell are marketing as a cleaner form of energy, he said. \"In terms of climate change, gas is definitely a good solution compared to coal and oil. But it's not very innocent compared to renewables and nuclear.\" The world faces a long term gas glut because of recent technical advances which have made possible the exploitation of previously untapped shale gas, coal bed methane and tight gas deposits, mostly in the US, China and Australia. The IEA, publishing its annual world energy outlook now estimates that 35% of the increase in global gas production to 2035 will come from such unconventional projects. Last year it estimated that unconventional gas production would account for 20% of the growth, although this covered the period 2007 – 2030. Gas is also the only fossil fuel for which it expects demand to grow by 2035. The world is already awash with cheap gas because of a fall in demand after the global economic downturn and unexpectedly high production of shale gas in the US, despite fears that the industry would be held back by environmental regulations. This has coincided with a surge in the construction of new LNG facilities and equipment which liquefies gas so it can be shipped by tankers from remote areas to market rather than having to build new pipelines. LNG capacity will shoot up 47% by the end 2013, the IEA said. As a result of higher gas supplies and lower demand, globally only about two thirds of pipelines and LNG facilities will be full this year. The figure will be even lower in Europe, which could prompt energy companies such as E.ON to try renegotiating their long term contracts with exporters such as Russian firm Gazprom to get a cheaper deal. The IEA said that the utilisation rate of pipelines and LNG facilities will still not have returned to 2007 levels by the end of the decade. This assumes that no new infrastructure is commissioned, which it said was extremely unlikely. It has cut its long term global gas price forecasts, by as much as 10% in the US after 2020. There are environmental benefits to a gas glut because cheaper gas-fired plants are more likely to replace old coal plants, which emit twice as much carbon. But gas plants' low operating cost will make it harder for wind farms and other renewables, including nuclear, to compete and attract investment. \"From the perspective of renewables and nuclear it's not good news,\" Birol said. He also said that despite the £1bn recently committed by the UK government to develop a coal plant fitted with expensive carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), there may be less appetite to invest in CCS. The IEA report also spelt out the predicament faced by international oil companies. Opec, the body that protects the interests of leading oil-producing countries is forecasting to increase its global share of oil production from a third to more than a half by 2035. State controlled oil companies will account for all of the world's increase in global oil production in the next 25 years, while total non-Opec production will start falling after 2025. Birol added: \"Big Oil face an identity crisis. They got used to being able to explore, produce and market oil. But they're not able to do this in the same way any more. Much of the world's oil reserves are out of reach to them. Therefore they have to redefine their business strategy. Gas becomes one alternative for them to redefine their strategy.\" Black gold and greens The International Energy Agency is estimating that average oil prices will hit $113 a barrel in 2035. This is some way short of the record of $147, set in 2008, and current prices are already close to $90. But the agency admitted that in practice, \"short-term price volatility is likely to remain high\" – in other words, prices could be much higher or much lower than $113 in decades to come. The organisation, which advises companies and governments on future energy trends, was also scathing about the Copenhagen climate change summit last December. It said that based on the extremely loose and uncertain commitments made, global oil production would peak soon after 2035. If governments took firm action to prevent the earth's temperature rising by more than 2C by 2050, it reckoned, \"peak oil\" would be reached before 2020."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/may/12/effects-chernobyl-uk-farmers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-12T11:30:01Z","webTitle":"Effects of Chernobyl explained","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/12/effects-chernobyl-uk-farmers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/may/12/effects-chernobyl-uk-farmers","fields":{"headline":"Effects of Chernobyl explained","bodyText":"The world's worst ever nuclear accident, at Chernobyl in 1986, sent a plume of highly radioactive material into the atmosphere first detected outside the immediate region by atomic workers in Sweden. Contamination arrived in Britain through light nuclear rain, and radiocaesium-137 was deposited in mainly upland areas of Wales, Scotland and England where it seeped into the peaty soil used mainly to breed livestock. The European Commission ruled that a maximum level of 1,000 becquerels per kilogram (bq/k) of radiocaesium should be allowed in sheep being reared for meat to safeguard the consumer. Similar guidelines were given for fish affected by contaminated rivers. A continuous assessment of restrictions on British farms has taken place over the last 23 years and the number affected has gradually been reduced. Animals are checked by hand monitors and if lower levels of radioactivity are found throughout a flock then the farm is considered for release from the restrictions. The monitoring work is undertaken by the Rural Payments Agency in England and Rural Inspectorate for Wales, answering to the Food Standards Agency. Britain might see the end of all restrictions within a few years, but some nuclear experts believe there should be no agricultural production around Chernobyl for the next two centuries. The UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation believed there could be 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer in children and adolescents who were exposed at the time in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. A report commissioned by Greenpeace suggested the number of additional deaths due to Chernobyl could be as high as 200,000."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2010/oct/04/business-climate-change-battle","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-04T10:21:55Z","webTitle":"Business is changing the landscape of the climate battleground | Bryony Worthington","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/oct/04/business-climate-change-battle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2010/oct/04/business-climate-change-battle","fields":{"headline":"Business is changing the landscape of the climate battleground","bodyText":"As long-time trackers of climate change policy at Sandbag we readily acknowledge, like George Monbiot, that the record of governments to date has been dismal. It's not that lots of things haven't been tried, particularly here in the UK where we enjoy an overlapping mishmash of climate policies. It's just there hasn't been the political will to implement anything with genuine ambition. The reason? Lobbying to protect vested interests. Civil servants and politicians perceive themselves as rational, balanced people, weighing up the pros and cons of different arguments, eventually settling somewhere in the middle, in an attempt to keep everyone happy. Sadly this system breaks down if the forces of influence are imbalanced. Until very recently it was the woefully under-resourced green groups against the powerful industrial titans. So outflanked were the environmentalists that somewhere in the middle was a long way in favour of industry. This is why we have routinely set weak targets in our emissions trading schemes (PDF), and laboured over introducing household and transport energy efficiency targets that have been ludicrously easily to meet. But if you look around the world today something subtle has shifted. The landscape of the battleground has changed. Take two examples – the fight to save climate legislation in California and the UK's current championing of higher and unilateral emissions cuts for the European Union. Foreign secretary William Hague reiterated in New York this week that the UK wanted Europe to step up to a 30% emissions reduction target regardless of what everyone else in the world is doing. While it would be nice to imagine that this is the result of years of green campaigning (and this has of course played a part), the reality is that in presenting this policy the UK is representing the interests of big business. That business is predominantly nuclear since it more than any other sector has the vested interests, connections and resources to run a successful lobbying campaign. This UK government really, really wants new nuclear power stations in the UK. But without a high carbon price across Europe it will be very expensive for the UK to arrange this on its own. The solution is higher targets. Over in California the vested interests are less hidden. On the one hand you have the oil industry who have been bankrolling a campaign to get rid of climate legislation, that would otherwise begin introducing caps on emissions and challenging targets for renewables in 2012. The infamous Koch brothers, who have no direct interests in California, have also weighed in because this is the new battle ground: what happens in California will ripple out across the States. There is a big fightback from other businesses and fortunately California is home to a burgeoning clean tech industry and to Silicon Valley where, as well as ruling the digital world, companies like Google have been ploughing their millions into trying to solve big problems like climate change. It feels as if the fight to regulate towards a cleaner future is getting more balanced. For this we can thank the fact that industry is becoming increasingly divided. Increasing numbers of companies now see their current bottom line, and their future, as directly linked to increased ambition to reduce carbon. For this we can thank multiple factors - the actions of regulators around the world, who have had the foresight to introduce modest measures to put a price on carbon and create an incentive for clean technology have helped. The growing realisation that any economy that is dependent on imported fossil fuels faces an uncertain future has also played its part. And good old human nature has contributed too – the human mind likes a problem to solve and some at least seem to be predisposed towards innovating. Finally there is nothing like a profit motive to get corporations moving and the nascent carbon market, despite its flaws, has already shown just how effective the market is at sniffing out really cheap solutions. If we keep moving forward on as many fronts as possible, creating incentives and rewards for low-carbon solutions, there will come a tipping point when new industry outweighs the old guard in terms of lobbying power and resources. We may not have reached that point quite yet but we will, and when we do we just have to hope we've left ourselves enough time the prevent the worst impacts of global warming. • Bryony Worthington is the founder of emissions trading think tank sandbag.org.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/jul/10/geo-engineering-weather-manipulation","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-07-09T23:04:08Z","webTitle":"Geo-engineering: green versus greed in the race to cool the planet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/10/geo-engineering-weather-manipulation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/jul/10/geo-engineering-weather-manipulation","fields":{"headline":"Geo-engineering: green versus greed in the race to cool the planet","bodyText":"The alert on the Climate Ark website in January 2009 was marked urgent: \"Take action: A rogue science ship is poised to carry out risky experimental fertilisation of the Southern Ocean. This is likely [to be] the first of many coming attempts to begin geo-engineering the biosphere as a solution to climate change. The chemical cargo is likely to provoke a massive algal bloom big enough to be seen from outer space...\" The response was immediate and vitriolic: \"You morons,\" fumed a woman from a Canadian university. \"That isn't a rogue ship... it's one of the best marine science research groups in the world. You are no different than anti-science religious fanatics. You seek to keep the world ignorant. May you drown in your lies...\" Professor Peter Liss, then chair of Britain's Royal Society's global environment research committee and himself involved in research to see the effect of iron on phtyoplankton, stepped in: \"The [intention] is to find out what role iron plays in marine biogeochemistry. In no way is it an attempt to geo-engineer the planet. Only by knowing the facts can you argue effectively against such geo-engineering proposals. Emotion and opinion will not win the argument; knowledge and understanding will.\" Some hope. Geo-engineering – artificial efforts to mitigate global warming by manipulating weather patterns, oceans, currents, soils and atmosphere to reduce the amount of greenhouses gases – evokes ideological, political and financial passions. For those who have more or less given up on UN climate talks, it is, along with nuclear power, the only practical planetary way to avoid catastrophic climate change; for others, it is an irresponsible move into the unknown by the rich world that will inevitably have unintended consequences, most probably for the poorest. But as attempts to get major economies to agree to reduce emissions through energy efficiency falter, so groups of scientists, universities and entrepreneurs are coming together, patenting ideas and pressing the case with governments and the UN to back experiments as the first step towards wide-scale deployment of a suite of technologies. From just a few individuals working in the field 20 years ago, today there are hundreds of groups and institutions proposing experiments. They fall broadly into two camps: one aims to remove greenhouse gases from the air and store them underground; the other, more controversially, tries to cool the Earth down by reflecting sunlight from the atmosphere or space in a process known as solar radiation management. The range of techno-fix ideas is growing by the month. They include absorbing plankton, growing artificial trees, firing silver iodide into clouds to produce rain, genetically engineering crops to be paler in colour to reflect sunlight back to space, fertilising the ocean with iron nanoparticles to increase phytoplankton, blasting sulphate-based aerosols into the stratosphere to deflect sunlight, covering the desert with white plastic to reflect sunlight and painting cities and roads white. There are serious proposals to launch a fleet of unmanned ships to spray seawater into the atmosphere to thicken clouds and thus reflect more radiation from Earth. Most controversial of all is an idea to fire trillions of tiny mirrors into space to form a 100,000-mile \"sunshade\" for Earth. Most are unlikely to be seriously considered but some are being pushed hard by entrepreneurs and businessmen attracted by the potential to make billions of dollars in an emerging system of UN global carbon credits. Research by ETC, the Canadian-based watchdog, shows at least 27 patents have been granted to inventors and assignees including Bill Gates, Dupont, the US government and various corporations. Chemical engineer Michael Markels has four patents, Professor Steven Salter of Edinburgh University and climate change scientist David Keith have two. \"If geo-engineering techniques move towards actual deployment, the existence of patents could mean that decisions over the climate will be effectively handed over to the private sector,\" says Diana Bronson of ETC. In what is shaping up to become a deep, ideological division along the lines of pro- and anti-nuclear or GM crops, the scientists, corporates and entrepreneurs are being broadly opposed by environment groups and developing countries, but backed increasingly by the UK and US governments, as well as businessmen such as Richard Branson. And in a strange new grouping, free market environmentalists such as Mark Lynas in Britain, Stewart Brand in the US and Bjorn Lomborg in Denmark have joined high-profile US conservative politicians and thinktanks to say geo-engineering is a step forward. \"Geo-engineering holds forth the promise of addressing global warming concerns for just a few billion dollars a year,\" said Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the US House of Representatives, in 2008. \"We would have an option to address global warming by rewarding scientific innovation. Bring on American ingenuity. Stop the green pig.\" Such people have decided that re-engineering Earth for survival, or for profit, is just an intellectual skip away from what we have been doing for centuries and what has got us into the mess in the first place – cutting down most of the world's forests, converting the savannas, diverting and damming rivers and plundering the seas. With no evidence that mankind is prepared to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases, it has become necessary to have a plan B, an insurance policy for the situation in which Earth hits a tipping point, they argue. But to do that requires experiments and money, says Andrew Lockley, moderator of the geoengineering group Google site that brings together many of the world's leading scientists working in different areas. His own area is finding geo-engineering ways to capture methane on a vast scale from melting tundra landscapes. Lockley says: \"We just do not know if a catastrophic methane release could be 50, 100 or 10,000 years away. Different scientists are saying different things. We could be sleepwalking into a climate disaster. What is needed is the support of academe to do further research. We need basic research done on which models might work.\" But with most major research institutions scared of the public reaction and hesitating to put money into geo-engineering, it is being left to corporations and billionaire entrepreneurs. Bill Gates has put in $400m (£250m) into two projects and is named in a group of people holding a patent to employ a fleet of vessels to suppress hurricanes through various methods of mixing warm water from the surface of the ocean with colder water at greater depths. Richard Branson's \"carbon war room\" is backing carbon capture and storage technologies. Behind the scenes, airlines, GM and chemical companies are believed to be cautiously investigating the potential. Britain now leads the world's public funding, by providing research money and intellectual backing from scientific institutions such as the Royal Society. Last week, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, a British government funding agency, released over £3m for two geo-engineering research projects. The most controversial project is for an artificial mini-volcano to block sunlight and lower temperatures. Inspired by the way eruptions can spew particles into the stratosphere dimming the sun and lowering temperatures, the scientists from Bristol, Cambridge and Reading Universities propose to launch a massive balloon system 20-25km into the stratosphere to spray millions of sulphate particles. The prototype will put a balloon just 1km into the sky. Their work is being mirrored in the California where Philip Rasch, chief scientist for climate science at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a research group with the US Department of Energy, has proposed fleets of aircraft continually spraying tons of reflective sulphur dioxide into the stratosphere. Geo-engineering critics are appalled, saying the diffusion of the sunlight might result in ozone depletion, reduced plant growth, more humidity in the atmosphere, less energy and even potential damage as particles fall to Earth. \"We just do not know how to recall a planetary-scale technology once it has been released. Techniques that alter the composition of the stratosphere or the chemistry of the oceans are likely to have unintended consequences as well as unequal impacts around the world,\" says Pat Mooney of ETC. Scientists are also divided on the deployment of planetary-scale geo-engineering but united on the need for research – if only to show that many of the proposed schemes may be rubbish. \"I am actually pretty scared of putting things in space. Some people are planning to do it [but] it is much harder to check what is going on in the stratosphere. We may need to regulate the experiments. We know very little about secondary consequences. To talk about doing it is naive. To do research is different,\" he says. \"The case for experimentation is not the case for going ahead with major implementation. You cannot consider [these things] until you have done the research. Maybe it goes no further. A first step does not presume a second. That would be for politicians to decide.\" But the technologists are at many different stages. According to ETC, there are now several groupings, including the pragmatists, such as Branson, Lomborg and the American Enterprise Institute, which argue that geo-engineering is faster and cheaper than carbon taxes and emissions reductions, so just get on with it; and the theorists, such as the Royal Society and the Carnegie Institution for Science in the US which say we must have an emergency Plan B because we are heading for a certain climate catastrophe; meanwhile, businesses such as the Ocean Fertilisation Company and the Biochar Initiative see dollars. In the background is the military. According to US science historian James Fleming, control of the climate gives the military an advantage and so it seeks to \"weaponise\" every technology, providing a stream of resources for scientists. Star Wars architect Lowell Wood argued in the 1990s that by spending about $1bn per year, the US could put enough particles in the stratosphere to reduce sunlight by about 1%. \"It is not easy to see how a serious geo-engineering programme could move forward without some degree of military involvement,\" says Jeff Goodell, journalist and author of How to Cool the Planet. The immediate battle, though, is being fought in the media, where the scientists are hoping to be hailed as social visionaries, and in the UN and scientific establishments, where they are seeking intellectual underpinning. According to Bronson: \"The geo-engineers have worked hard to conquer the western scientific establishment and are now moving into Brazil, India and China because they know that the northern orientation of everything so far is a huge liability.\" There is growing awareness that geo-engineering is not going away, adds Bronson. \"Many NGOS and social movements in Latin America have started to get involved and interest in south-east Asia and some parts of Africa is growing. Combined with lacklustre climate talks and rising emissions, though, many environmentalists end up with some kind of reluctant endorsement of the 'more research' agenda. Indigenous peoples and farmers' organisations have proved particularly strong in their opposition. Women's groups are also starting to get interested and alarmed.\" Above all, it will be the governments of poor countries which are likely to object to any planetary-scale project. Two years ago, all countries except the US agreed to a de facto voluntary moratorium on geo-engineering projects and experiments. Apart from the unpredictability of the science, there was mistrust that western-northern-driven technological solutions to climate change would be fair or equitable. Two weeks ago, 160 organisations from around the world sent an open letter to Rajendra Pachauri, the Nobel prize-winning chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, after it had hosted a meeting of geo-engineers in Lima, Peru. \"Geo-engineering is too dangerous to too many people and to the planet to be left in the hands of small group of so-called experts,\" they warned. \"The IPCC has assured us it will go forward carefully in this work. We will be closely following the process.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/video/2009/may/19/bartons-britain-sizewell-suffolk","type":"video","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2009-05-19T13:43:00Z","webTitle":"Video: Barton's Britain - Sizewell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/video/2009/may/19/bartons-britain-sizewell-suffolk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/video/2009/may/19/bartons-britain-sizewell-suffolk","fields":{"headline":"Barton's Britain: Sizewell","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/25/experts-condemn-nuclear-waste-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-24T23:07:10Z","webTitle":"Energy fears over nuclear waste dumps","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/25/experts-condemn-nuclear-waste-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/25/experts-condemn-nuclear-waste-plan","fields":{"headline":"Energy fear over nuclear waste dumps","bodyText":"Former senior government advisers on nuclear power have accused ministers of being \"cavalier\" and \"cherry-picking\" their advice to bolster the case for a new generation of nuclear power stations. They and other industry experts say the government should not embark on building any new atomic facilities without properly tackling the unsolved problem of how to deal with radioactive waste from existing power plants. In 2006 the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management published recommendations on how the UK should dispose of nuclear waste. A key idea was that long-term disposal would be best carried out by identifying suitable sites at which the waste could be buried, a process called deep geological disposal. The conclusions were used by the government to bolster the case for the building of new nuclear power stations. But Gordon MacKerron, chair of the committee until 2007, said the recommendations were meant for legacy waste and were not a \"carte blanche\" to think that radioactive waste from a new generation of power plants could be dealt with in the same way. \"Although the government was getting more enthusiastic about nuclear power in July 2006, it wasn't as concrete about it as it has since become. My main quarrel is not that it hasn't taken those considerations seriously in relation to legacy waste, but it has unjustifiably extended the conclusions which we put forward for legacy waste alone as if they applied equally to any new-build waste.\" In a 2007 consultation report on the future of nuclear power the government cited this committee recommendation. \"The government believes that new waste could technically be disposed of in a geological repository and that this would be the best solution for managing waste from any new nuclear power stations,\" it said. \"The government considers that waste should be stored in safe and secure interim storage facilities prior to a geological repository becoming viable.\" MacKerron accused the government of being \"cavalier\" in extending the committee's recommendations to new waste. \"The government has too readily said, because the committee has found what seems like a credible way of managing legacy waste we can automatically extend that to new waste,\" he said. Another former committee member, Peter Wilkinson, went further to say that the government had \"cherry-picked\" ideas from the 2006 report to highlight deep geological disposal. \"The government has used that as the fig leaf for radioactive waste management and, on the back of that, have gone ahead with this programme of new build. I don't think they should even be thinking about a new-build programme until such time as the deep geological repository has been demonstrated as scientifically proven, and that's a long way off,\" he said. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said it took nuclear waste \"very seriously\". He said: \"We do not agree that the committee's findings have been unjustifiably extended to new-build wastes. The NDA [Nuclear Decommissioning Authority] has recently completed a detailed assessment of the disposability of new nuclear waste. They are providing advice to the independent regulators, who are responsible for making sure that any new nuclear power station built in the UK meets the highest standards of safety, security, environmental protection and waste management.\" An NDA spokesman said that the European Commission had reported that safe geological disposal of high-level nuclear waste was technically feasible. \"Also, of the 39 countries with significant nuclear waste, 25 have taken final decisions on long-term policy and all have opted for geological disposal.\" Wilkinson said that waste from a new generation of power stations would be \"far hotter and more radioactive than anything we've hitherto had to deal with\". Both former committee members said the government's plans would put an already creaking interim storage infrastructure under strain. Nuclear waste is currently stored in interim facilities at decommissioned reactor sites or, in the case of the most radioactive waste, at Sellafield in Cumbria. Many of these stores were never designed to last for the amount of time they will eventually be expected to be in service.\" The government now suggests the lifetime of any future stores which will be necessary should be around 100 years,\" said MacKerron. \"It may be that these [existing] stores have been designed so robustly that they will last that long, but that's not the basis under which they were constructed.\" According to independent nuclear consultant John Large, the nuclear industry does not have enough storage facility and there is not enough money to build what is required. The long-term issue of waste still cast a shadow over any future nuclear ambitions. \"So far as putting in new nuclear power plants, we are as ill-prepared to handle the radioactive waste as we were in the 1960s.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/aug/22/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-iran-bomber-drone","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-08-22T14:58:56Z","webTitle":"Iran unveils long-distance bomber drone","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/22/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-iran-bomber-drone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/aug/22/mahmoud-ahmadinejad-iran-bomber-drone","fields":{"headline":"Iran unveils bomber drone that aims to deliver peace and friendship","bodyText":"Iran has unveiled an unmanned, long-distance bomber drone described by the country's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as \"an ambassador of death\" to Tehran's enemies. At a ceremony today, Ahmadinejad said the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) – named Karrar, meaning \"striker\" in Persian – had \"a main message of peace and friendship\" but was intended to deter aggression \"and keep the enemy paralysed in his bases\". The presentation came as technicians began fuelling the Islamic republic's first nuclear power station, at Bushehr, in a development Israel has described as \"totally unacceptable\". The US and Britain say the Bushehr plant, which is monitored by the UN's nuclear watchdog, poses no proliferation threat because Russia is supplying the nuclear fuel and will remove the spent fuel rods, minimising any risk that they could be used to make nuclear weapons. Iran is under UN sanctions to force a halt to uranium enrichment because of fears that it secretly plans to build nuclear weapons. It flatly denies having any such intention. Ahmed Vahidi, the Iranian defence minister, said the Karrar had a range of up to 620 miles, which is not far enough to reach Israel. Iranian state TV reported that the UAV could carry four cruise missiles, two 250lb bombs or one 500lb bomb. The drone was the latest item of military hardware to be inaugurated by Iran against a background of continuing tension over the nuclear issue. On Friday, Tehran test-fired a new surface-to-surface missile called the Qiam (meaning \"rising\"). It has already developed long-range missiles capable of hitting Israel and eastern Europe and of carrying a nuclear warhead. Earlier this month, the Debka file website, which appears to have links to Israeli intelligence, reported that the father of Iran's UAV programme, Reza Baruni, had been assassinated in a bomb attack in his home town of Ahwaz, in Khuzestan. There has been no confirmation of this unattributed claim from any other source. It is widely believed that western intelligence services, Israel and perhaps Arab countries have been seeking to sabotage the Iranian nuclear programme. Experts say the programme appears to have suffered setbacks. The Iranian media has previously reported the successful test of a radar-evading \"stealth\" drone with bombing capabilities. In March 2009, US fighter jets in Iraq shot down an unmanned Iranian spy drone, generating concern in Washington. Yesterday, Ahmadinejad warned that any attack against Iran would be \"suicidal\". Still, the threat of pre-emptive military action that could ignite war across the Middle East may be receding. Obama administration officials were reported last week to have told Israel they believe Iran is still a year away from being able to build a nuclear weapon. The New York Times quoted Israeli officials as saying that their assessments were coming into line with Washington's view, but they remain suspicious that Iran has a secret uranium enrichment site yet to be discovered – after one was revealed in a mountainside near Qom last September as sanctions moves intensified. Israel, an undeclared atomic power which, unlike Iran, has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), has often warned that it cannot live with a nuclear-armed Iran and hinted that it may attack it, as it did Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981. Iran has repeatedly declared a willingness to return to nuclear talks with the EU, but the exact nature of any negotiations has yet to be defined. Nothing has happened since October. Ahmadinejad was quoted in a Japanese newspaper on Friday as saying Iran would be prepared to stop higher-grade uranium enrichment if it was guaranteed nuclear fuel supplies for a research reactor. But the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – who makes all key national security decisions – said last week that Iran would not talk to the US unless sanctions and military threats were lifted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/apr/13/general-election-david-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-13T21:16:55Z","webTitle":"General election 2010: David Cameron launches do-it-yourself revolution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/13/general-election-david-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/apr/13/general-election-david-cameron","fields":{"headline":"General election 2010: David Cameron launches do-it-yourself revolution","bodyText":"David Cameron set out his political vision for Britain today with a bold attempt to cast himself as a unifying national figure and a promise to floating voters that the Conservative party had abandoned its nostalgia for \"bygone days\". In a lengthy address that eschewed traditional right wing themes, Cameron claimed politicians had been treating the public without respect for the past 40 years by pretending that passing new laws or spending more money would cure the ills of society. \"It's a lie, it doesn't work like that,\" he said. \"You only really change things if you bring people with you and if they play their part.\" He used the premise to press home his big political contention that society is not the same as the state, and that the only way to address the problems the country faces is to empower people with a huge devolution of responsibility away from central government. Cameron pitched directly to \"working people\" who feel abandoned by Labour and idealists who would be disappointed by the Liberal Democrats. Holding up the Tories' 130-page manifesto, published in a blue hardback book, Cameron invited voters to join him in governing Britain. \"We can restore faith in our shattered political system, but only if millions of people are fired up and inspired to play a part in the nation's future,\" he said. \"Yes, it is an invitation to the whole nation: we'll give you the power, so you can take control.\" With no major new policy initiatives, the Tory manifesto set out plans to give people the powers to run schools, elect police chiefs, sack MPs and petition for repeated local referendums. However, they were immediately criticised by teachers and academics. In a letter to the Guardian 51 headteachers, some of them Labour party members, warn that the Tories, unlike Labour, are not committed to keep schools' spending increasing. They claim the Tory proposals \"are not about steady investment in the whole system but the threat of across-the-board cuts coupled with boutique experiments borrowed as a result of naive educational tourism. These experiments will involve taking millions of pounds from existing schools to create artificial surplus places.\" Experts on the public sector said the Tory pledge to hand control of public services to private individuals might inflame social division and increase corruption. Colin Talbot, professor of public policy and management at Manchester Business School, said devolution of powers to start new schools, take control of parks and libraries and run health services would not save money. Tony Travers, professor of local government at the LSE, said encouraging the public to take over services might only work in areas with sufficient numbers of entrepreneurs willing to take on the responsibility. \"In other areas people won't be interested,\" he said. A recent Mori poll found that only 47% want \"to get involved in decisions affecting their local area\". Lord Mandelson described the Tory manifesto presentation as style over substance. \"When the Tories say 'we're all in this together' what they really mean is 'you're on your own',\" he said. Critics also noted that the Tory manifesto had quietly dropped a specific pledge to fund 220,000 school places in the poorest communities by redirecting the school capital budget. On the environment, the Tory manifesto did not mention a previous commitment that would in effect have blocked the planned Kingsnorth coal-fired power station, and there appeared a softening over the party's attitude to nuclear power. The manifesto said the party would clear the way for nuclear power stations, provided they receive no public subsidy. With two new national polls showing Tory leads of three to eight points, shadow cabinet members admitted large parts of the electorate are still switched off from the campaign. Today's Times Populus poll, conducted before the Conservative manifesto launch, has the Tories down three points on 36% and Labour up one at 33%. In a sign of the impact of the US on Tory thinking, Cameron borrowed the opening words of the US constitution – \"we, the people\" – as he challenged both the left and the right. \"It's time to say to Labour: it's not about you, the government. It's about we, the people. And it's time to say to those who think it's all about unchecked individualism: no, it's not about me, the individual. It's about we, the people.\" Cameron, who needs to secure the biggest swing to his party since 1931 to win a parliamentary majority of just one, said the Tories could now appeal beyond their core support. \"In every area, on every issue, our modern Conservative values are clear,\" he said. \"No more narrow focus on a few issues. No more harking back to bygone days.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/jun/13/extreme-weather-flooding-droughts-fires","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-06-13T18:59:00Z","webTitle":"Warning: extreme weather ahead","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/13/extreme-weather-flooding-droughts-fires","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/jun/13/extreme-weather-flooding-droughts-fires","fields":{"headline":"Warning: extreme weather ahead","bodyText":"Drought zones have been declared across much of England and Wales, yet Scotland has just registered its wettest-ever May. The warmest British spring in 100 years followed one of the coldest UK winters in 300 years. June in London has been colder than March. February was warm enough to strip on Snowdon, but last Saturday it snowed there. Welcome to the climate rollercoaster, or what is being coined the \"new normal\" of weather. What was, until quite recently, predictable, temperate, mild and equable British weather, guaranteed to be warmish and wettish, ensuring green lawns in August, now sees the seasons reversed and temperature and rainfall records broken almost every year. When Kent receives as much rain (4mm) in May as Timbuktu, Manchester has more sunshine than Marbella, and soils in southern England are drier than those in Egypt, something is happening. Sober government scientists at the centre for hydrology and ecology are openly using words like \"remarkable\", \"unprecedented\" and \"shocking\" to describe the recent physical state of Britain this year, but the extremes we are experiencing in 2011 are nothing to the scale of what has been taking place elsewhere recently. Last year, more than 2m sq km of eastern Europe and Russia scorched. An extra 50,000 people died as temperatures stayed more than 6C above normal for many weeks, crops were devastated and hunderds of giant wild fires broke out. The price of wheat and other foods rose as two thirds of the continent experienced its hottest summer in around 500 years. This year, it's western Europe's turn for a mega-heatwave, with 16 countries, including France, Switzerland and Germany (and Britain on the periphery), experiencing extreme dryness. The blame is being out on El Niño and La Niña, naturally occurring but poorly understood events that follow heating and cooling of the Pacific ocean near the equator, bringing floods and droughts. Vast areas of Europe have received less than half the rainfall they would normally get in March, April and May, temperatures have been off the scale for the time of year, nuclear power stations have been in danger of having to be shut down because they need so much river water to cool them, and boats along many of Europe's main rivers have been grounded because of low flows. In the past week, the great European spring drought has broken in many places as massive storms and flash floods have left the streets of Germany and France running like rivers. But for real extremes in 2011, look to Australia, China and the southern US these past few months. In Queeensland, Australia, an area the size of Germany and France was flooded in December and January in what was called the country's \"worst natural disaster\". It cost the economy up to A$30bn (£19.5bn), devastated livelihoods and is still being cleaned up. In China, a \"once-in-a-100-years\" drought in southern and central regions has this year dried up hundreds of reservoirs, rivers and water courses, evaporating drinking supplies and stirring up political tensions. The government responded with a massive rain-making operation, firing thousands of rockets to \"seed\" clouds with silver iodide and other chemicals. It may have worked: for whatever reason, the heavens opened last week, a record 30cm of rain fell in some places in 24 hours, floods and mudslides killed 94 people, and tens of thousands of people have lost their homes. Meanwhile, north America's most deadly and destructive tornado season ever saw 600 \"twisters\" in April alone, and 138 people killed in Joplin, Missouri, by a mile-wide whirlwind. Arizonans were this week fighting some of the largest wildfires they have known, and the greatest flood in recorded US history is occurring along sections of the Missouri river. This is all taking place during a deepening drought in Texas and other southern states – the eighth year of \"exceptional\" drought there in the past 12 years. \"I don't know how much more we can take,\" says John Butcher, a peanut and cotton farmer near Lubbock, Texas. \"It's dry like we have never seen it before. I don't remember anything like this. We may lose everything.\" The impacts of extreme weather are greater in poorer countries, which this week are trying to secure a climate deal in the resumed talks in Bonn. In Mexico, the temperature peaked at 48.8C (119.8F) in April, the warmest anywhere in the world that month, and nearly half the country is now affected by drought. There have already been 9,000 wildfires, and the biggest farm union says that more than 3.5 million farmers are on the brink of bankruptcy because they cannot feed their cattle or grow crops. \"We are being battered by the adverse impacts of climate change,\" says a negotiator for the G77 group of developing countries who wants to remain anonymous. \"Frontline states face a double crunch of climate heat and poverty. But the rich countries still will not give us the cash they promised to adapt or reduce their emissions.\" Wherever you look, the climate appears to be in overdrive, with stronger weather patterns gripping large areas for longer and events veering between extremes. Last year, according to US meteorologist Jeff Masters, who co-founded leading climate tracker website Weather Underground, 17 countries experienced record temperatures. Colombia, the Amazon basin, Peru, Cuba, Kenya, Somalia and many other countries have all registered far more or less rainfall or major heatwaves in the past few years, he says. Temperatures in Bangladesh have been near record highs, leaving at least 26 people dead in the past week; Kuwait has seen temperatures in excess of 50C and Rajasthan in India 49.6C, while parts of Canada, including Toronto, have been sizzling at a record 33C. Rich countries may be more or less immune in the short term because the global trading system guarantees food and access to electricity allows air conditioning, but in parts of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, millions of people this year have little or no food left after successive poor rainy seasons. Last week, international aid agencies warned of an impending disaster. Sceptics argue that there have always been droughts and floods, freak weather, heatwaves and temperature extremes, but what concerns most climate scientists and observers is that the extreme weather events are occurring more frequently, their intensity is growing and the trends all suggest long-term change as greenhouse gases steadily build in the atmosphere. Killer droughts and heatwaves, deeper snowfalls, more widespread floods, heavier rains, and temperature extremes are now the \"new normal\", says Nikhil da Victoria Lobo of the giant insurance firm Swiss Re, which last month estimated losses from natural disasters have risen from about $25bn a year in the 1980s to $130bn a year today. \"Globally, what we're seeing is more volatility,\" he says. People in the most affected areas are certainly not waiting for climate scientists to confirm climate change is happening before they adapt. In Nepal, where the rain is heavier than before, flat roofs are giving way to pitched roofs, and villagers in the drought-prone Andes are building reservoirs and changing crops to survive. New analysis of natural disasters in 140 countries shows that climate is becoming more extreme. Last month, Oxfam reported that while the number of \"geo-physical\" disasters – such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions – has remained more or less constant, those caused by flooding and storms have increased from around 133 a year in 1980s to more than 350 a year now. \"It is abundantly clear that weather-related disasters have been increasing in some of the world's poorest countries and this increase cannot be explained fully by better ways of counting them,\" says Steve Jennings, the report's author. \"Whichever way you look at the figures, there is a significant rise in the number of weather-related disasters. They have been increasing and are set to get worse as climate change further intensifies natural hazards. \"I think that global 'weirding' is the best way to describe what we're seeing. We are used to certain conditions and there's a lot going on these days that is not what we're used to, that is outside our current frame of reference,\" says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University. New trends have been emerging for a decade or more, says the UN's World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). \"In Europe, a clear trend is emerging towards drier springs. This year's drought follows exceptionally dry years in 2007, 2009 and 2010,\" says a spokesman. While no scientist will blame climate change for any specific weather event, many argue that these phenomena are textbook examples of the kind of impact that can be expected in a warming world. Natural events, such as La Niña and El Niño, are now being exacerbated by the background warming of the world, they say. \"It is almost impossible for us to pinpoint specific events . . . and say they were caused by climate change,\" says William Chameides, atmospheric scientist at Duke University, who was vice-chair of a US government-funded national research council study on the climate options for the US which reported last month. \"On the other hand, we do know that because of climate change those kinds of events will very, very likely become more common, more frequent, more intense. So what we can say is that these kinds of events that we are seeing are consistent with climate change.\" He is backed strongly in Europe. \"We have to get accustomed to such extreme weather conditions, as climate change intensifies,\" says Friedrich-Wilhelm Gerstengarbe, assistant director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. \"Heavy storms and inundations will happen in northern Germany twice or three times as frequently as in the past.\" \"We've always had El Niños and natural variability, but the background which is now operating is different. [La Niña and El Niño] are now happening in a hotter world [which means more moisture in the atmosphere],\" David Jones, head of climate monitoring and prediction at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology in Melbourne told Reuters after the Queeensland floods. David Barriopedro, a researcher at Lisbon University's Instituto Dom Luiz, last month compared last year's European heatwave with the one that struck in 2003 and calculated that the probability of a European summer experiencing a \"mega-heatwave\" will increase by a factor of five to 10 within the next 40 years if the warming trends continue. \"This kind of event will become more common,\" he says. \"Mega-heatwaves are going to be more frequent and more intense in the future.\" But there may be some respite coming from extreme weather because the El Niño/La Niña episodes are now fading fast, according to the WMO. \"The weather pattern, blamed for extremely heavy downpours in Australia, southeast Asia and South America over late 2010 and early 2011, is unlikely to redevelop in the middle of 2011,\" it advises. \"Looking ahead beyond mid-year 2011, there are currently no clear indications for enhanced risk of El Niño or La Niña in the second half of the year\" The WMO concludes, tentatively, that global weather will now return to something approaching normal. The trouble is, no one is too sure what normal is any more."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2010/jul/28/britain-nuclear-technology-india","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-28T06:45:43Z","webTitle":"Britain to allow export of civil nuclear technology to India","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/28/britain-nuclear-technology-india","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/jul/28/britain-nuclear-technology-india","fields":{"headline":"Britain to allow export of civil nuclear technology to India","bodyText":"Britain is to follow the example of the US and allow the export of civil nuclear technology and expertise to India. The move, which is the most dramatic illustration of a new special relationship David Cameron is hoping to forge with India, will prove controversial because New Delhi is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Labour backed away from offering co-operation to India on civil nuclear power amid fears that there would be leakage to its military nuclear programme. Cameron is on a three-day trade mission to India, which starts today. As part of the visit, British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce signed a £700m deal to supply 57 Hawk trainer jets to India. But the nuclear issue is likely to prove more controversial. The US sanctioned the use of civil nuclear technology to India in 2008 and Britain's business department has lobbied for an equally open approach. The Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office have been wary of exporting civil nuclear technology to India for fear of upsetting Pakistan and because of fears about links between New Delhi's civil and military nuclear programmes. Vince Cable, the business secretary who has championed the move, announced the change in Britain's position this morning. \"There is already a declaration under which a certain amount of modest research takes place,\" he said. \"We want to take this to a higher level. There are British companies like Rolls-Royce, Serco and others which potentially could do a large amount of business in India. \"There are obvious security sensitivities. We are conscious of those, as are the Indians. But within those constraints we really want to push ahead with civil nuclear co-operation. That would be quite a big sector within which we could really make progress.\" The prime minister agreed to the change in Britain's position, which will allow the granting of export licences for civil nuclear expertise and technology, after Cable wrote to the cabinet in June. The prime minister summoned the relevant ministers – Cable, William Hague and Liam Fox – after a recent cabinet meeting to agree the shift in policy. Government sources said that Hague and Fox had not resisted the move. \"The long-term institutional position of the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence has been cautious. That has been the institutional position of those departments. You should separate that from the ministerial positions,\" one source said. The sources stressed that export licences would be examined carefully. \"We will manage the risks with care,\" one said. Britain believes the agreement is compatible with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which bans the sale of nuclear technology to nuclear powers that are not signatories. The Nuclear Suppliers Group, of which Britain and the US are members, has granted India a waiver which allows the transfer of technology. The British Aerospace deal is worth around £700m. Of that, £500m will go BAE Systems and up to £200m to Rolls-Royce. The deal will support more than 200 jobs in the UK. The jets will be built in Bangalore by the BAE subsidiary, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Cameron said: \"This is an outstanding example of India-UK defence and industrial partnership, and this agreement will bring significant economic benefits to both our countries. It is evidence of our new, commercial foreign policy in action.\" The deal follows an agreement in 2004 in which BAE supplied 66 Hawk aircraft to India."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2008/jun/23/nuclear.greenpolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-06-22T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Lack of engineers puts government's nuclear power ambitions at risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/23/nuclear.greenpolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/jun/23/nuclear.greenpolitics","fields":{"headline":"Lack of engineers puts government's nuclear power ambitions at risk","bodyText":"Government plans for a new generation of nuclear power stations risk delays after warnings by its own inspectors that no decision can be made on reactor designs because of a shortage of skilled engineers. Delays in receiving documentation from various parties and the difficulties of talking to overseas regulators and receiving final reactor designs are referred to in a letter from Mike Weightman, chief inspector at the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), to the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The note follows a demand from the department's nuclear unit that the inspectorate begin the third stage of the generic design assessment (GDA) of various reactors put forward by companies such as Areva of France, needed to kick-start plans for a new generation of atomic power. \"There have been difficulties in all these areas, less so on enhancing our relationships with overseas nuclear regulators, but the main concern we have is the continuing lack of an adequate build-up of resources,\" writes Weightman, who also cites the risk of rising costs. \"This is working against timely completion of GDA and, while we remain determined to complete GDA process as close to the original programme as possible, there is a risk of this not being achieved. Therefore we cannot commit to a firm completion date.\" A similar letter to the department from Joe McHugh, head of radioactive substances regulation at the Environment Agency, refers to other potential delays caused by the Health and Safety Executive. \"We note that HSE has stated there is a risk that it may not complete the GDA process to its original programme.\" He adds: \"We will need to review our programme should HSE's programme be extended.\" The skills shortage threatens not just Britain's planned nuclear renaissance but also other projects such as Crossrail and the building of a new generation of green power generators. John Denham, secretary for innovation, universities and skills, said last month that the government would provide funding for industry to train up to 2 million more workers in finance, construction, science, engineering and IT by 2014. Critics have repeatedly voiced concerns that costs can rise rapidly if skill shortages arise. An Areva project to construct the first new European reactor for 30 years, in Finland, has already seen major time and cost overruns. Last week two peers, Lady Wilcox and Lord de Mauley, called for a new clause to be inserted into the energy bill calling on the secretary of state to report annually \"his assessment of the appropriate levels of staff and resources in the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, the progress that has been made towards reaching that target, and the effect on progress towards approval of new nuclear reactors\". The business and enterprise secretary, John Huttton, recently told a conference that Britain aims to become the number one location for nuclear investment, and outlined plans for an Office of Nuclear Development and a Nuclear Development Forum. But questions have been raised about the appetite of private-sector investors because of dwindling interest in buying up the UK's premier nuclear power generator, British Energy, whose ownership would give purchasers access to the best sites for building new plants. EDF of France put in a bid that was rejected and Iberdrola of Spain, the owner of Scottish Power, said it was pulling out because the £10bn price tag was too high. RWE of Germany was expected to put in a bid but has so far failed to do so."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2010/oct/15/renewableenergy-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-15T10:32:20Z","webTitle":"Renewables policies must be improved, not undermined with cuts | Robert Gross and Jim Watson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/oct/15/renewableenergy-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2010/oct/15/renewableenergy-energy","fields":{"headline":"Renewables policies must be improved, not undermined with cuts","bodyText":"In the run-up to the comprehensive spending review in less than a week's time, there have been repeated rumours that Britain's policies to promote renewable energy and other carbon-reduction technologies are under threat. There are compelling reasons why such cuts should be resisted. Firstly, though abandoning clean energy policies may be presented as essential cost-cutting, this simply isn't the case. For example, \"feed in tariffs\" (FIT) which pay homeowners to generate their own renewable electricity, aren't paid for by the Treasury. They never have been. Neither will the levy to fund the demonstration of carbon capture and storage on coal-power plants. Arcane accounting rules mean that such policies are viewed as taxes. In fact they are funded from our energy bills via power companies. Abandoning them won't do anything to cut the deficit, so why wield the axe? Some people question these policies on behalf of consumers, since anything which turns up in our bills is bad news for the poor. It is essential that policymakers are honest about the cost of policies, no matter how they are funded. But the cost per person is relatively small and protecting lower-income consumers is perfectly possible. Some of the policies are specifically designed to do so. The planned \"green deal\" for home insulation, for example, puts money back into our pockets and is designed to help poorer households. With careful thought, the FIT could do the same. Secondly, we must support technologies directly. Tidy-minded economists in the Treasury might be tempted to sweep away policies to promote solar, biomass and wave power. Some people may ask, why not just price carbon and let the market decide? Policy Exchange, David Cameron's favourite thinktank, argued for just such an approach in a recent report. But such simplicity over carbon-pricing is misleading and it won't work. After all, high oil prices might encourage us to drive less (or feel poorer), but the sky high prices of the 1970s, 80s and 2000s patently failed to usher in a low-carbon revolution. Anyhow, in the real world, can we really imagine politicians imposing a high carbon tax? Today's policies aren't perfect, but the goal of change must be to improve policies, not undermine them. So what can we do? Putting a price on carbon is important, but it's not a one-stop-shop solution. Creating markets is vital. Few technologies go straight from the laboratory to widespread use; rather they go into \"niche markets\" where people pay a premium for a new technology. As costs come down more people buy in. This has worked for mobile phones since the 1980s. Hybrid cars popular with noble-minded Hollywood stars also provide a recent example. But electricity isn't a phone or a car; it's just electricity no matter how it's made. There are no niches for \"early adopters\" and nothing to allow the green-minded the opportunity to show off. So policy needs to intervene to give a start to wind, solar and the rest. The prize is terrifically important – lower costs, better products and ultimately green energy that is cheaper than fossil fuels. Past policies helped the current set of technologies along the road. The giant gas turbines we use to make electricity today started their journey in the 1940s when governments supported jet fighter planes. State support for aerospace has helped them ever since. Nuclear power also got its first niche in the military, modern reactors having their roots in submarine engines. We need to replicate this for renewable energy. It is vital to avoid the \"valley of death\" where new technologies never reach the mass market. This means support for deployment, not just people in lab coats. Sadly, Britain has a history of abandoning innovative concepts at the very stage they begin to offer commercial prospects, leaving competing countries to reap the rewards. Policy must also create conditions international investors can buy into. This means tailored policies delivering real world technologies, not imaginary ideals of market-based instruments. Evidence from around the world suggests that bankable policies (such as feed-in tariffs) to create markets for key technologies are more attractive to investors than technology-neutral schemes. Investors are keen on clean technologies but nervous about political risks. There is no shortage of countries competing for clean investment with the UK. Britain enjoys an almost unique degree of political consensus on the need to tackle climate change. How ironic therefore that Britain's tax accounting rules might be allowed to consign effective policies to the dustbin, along the way making the UK a politically risky place to invest. • Robert Gross is the director of the centre for energy policy and technology, Imperial College London.

The Kalahari covers eastern Namibia, Botswana and northern South Africa. The new mining projects currently planned in Namibia are further west in the Namib desert, in the area of the Namib-Naukluft National Park. The hidden cost of Britain's new generation of nuclear power could be the destruction of the Kalahari desert in Namibia and millions of tonnes of extra greenhouse gas emissions a year, the Observer has discovered.= The desert, with its towering sand dunes and spectacular lunar-like landscapes, is at the centre of an international uranium rush led by Rössing Uranium, a subsidiary of the British mining giant Rio Tinto, and the French state-owned company, Areva, which part-manages the nuclear complex at Sellafield and wants to build others in Britain. Tomorrow, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, will release a batch of plans covering every aspect of Britain's strategy to replace its ageing nuclear power stations. The documents are expected to set out the government's case on the need for nuclear power, based on the demand for secure, low-carbon energy supplies, the suitable sites and designs for new reactors, and how the decommissioning and safe storage of radioactive waste can be guaranteed. It is not expected to consider the source of the fuel needed for the new reactors. But Rössing is expanding its existing giant mine – which already provides nearly 8% of the world's uranium – into the Namib-Naukluft national park. Areva has leased hundreds of square kilometres of the desert near Trekkopje, where it plans to build one of the world's largest uranium mines. At least 20 other mining companies from the UK, Canada, Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere have also been given licences to explore thousands of square kilometres of the national park and its surrounds, and six new mines, several of which would be in the park, are at the development stage. Namibia has some of the planet's richest uranium deposits and expects to become the third largest uranium producer and largest exporter within five years. The mines are all expected to be in open pits up to 200 metres below the desert sands. With their waste heaps, acid plants and giant slurry ponds, they will extend over hundreds of square kilometres. \"Large areas of the desert will be inevitably devastated,\" says Bertchen Kohrs, director of the Namibian environment group Earthlife. \"They will do immense damage. We fear that there will be major contamination of the ground water supplies.\" Britain's claims that a new generation of nuclear power will be low-carbon are also dented by the Namibian government's plans to build a coal-fired power station to provide electricity for the mines. This will use more than 2.4m tonnes of coal a year from South Africa, and could produce more than 10 million tonnes of CO2 emissions a year. The UK has justified its planned expansion of nuclear power partly on the basis that it provides low-emission energy. However, the energy used in drilling, blasting, excavating, separating and transporting the uranium to Britain are not taken into account. Documents seen by the Observer suggest the mines would initially consume about 53 million cubic metres of water a year, more than 75% of the water presently supplied by the Namibian state water company. The water will need to be pumped more than 56km to the mines from the coast. The proposed expansion of the uranium mining would create mountains of waste radioactive sand. But an Areva spokesman said: \"Our post-mining decommissioning plan will ensure that most of the Trekkopje mining area will return to its former wilderness state. The technical process applied to extract the ore will not cause any pollution to the underground water. The desalination plant will be powered by electricity produced from different sources, including non-CO2-emitting sources such as hydroelectricity.\" Rio Tinto said it was addressing the carbon emissions of the mining operations. \"Rössing has a greenhouse gas management plan to minimise emissions through improved energy efficiency,\" said a spokesman. The demands of global warming and energy security will increase in intensity in the future, and many nations are turning to nuclear power for the solution: more than 450 new nuclear reactors are currently planned around the world. As a result, the outlook for uranium demand remains strong, as does the economic future of the Rössing mine.

Reverence for nature is anathema to the nuclear industry. Two wildlife officers are employed on site at Sellafield to \"humanely\" destroy birds and nests. On site, freezers hold hundreds of dead birds and mammals, classified as nuclear waste. Nuclear power is promoted as a solution to climate change, but the likelihood is that it will make the problem worse by diverting resources to an expensive technology which can only ever tackle a very small proportion of greenhouse gas emissions. We strongly oppose new nuclear build, especially at Sellafield, which holds the world's most ferociously volatile stockpiles of high-level liquid nuclear wastes. We oppose the deep disposal of high-level nuclear waste in Cumbria – the uncertainties about how quickly it will leak and arrive back at the surface are just too huge.

However, in the early hours EDF released a statement saying that the conditions were not right for a big UK deal. \"After in-depth discussions, EDF considers that the conditions for a major development in Great Britain are not met to date,\" EDF said. The company added that it would still hold today's news conference in Paris as planned, but the subject would instead be its half-year results. The British government had hoped the landmark deal would signal the start of construction work on a new generation of nuclear power stations. British Energy, which is 35% owned by the government, operates one coal-fired and eight ageing nuclear power stations, including Hinkley Point, Torness and Dungeness. Together, they produce one sixth of Britain's electricity. The takeover, worth 765p per British Energy share, had been central to plans to replace the current reactors, which are due to be retired from service over the next few years. Most, if not all, of the new stations are due to be built on sites of, or next to, existing nuclear stations. EDF had previously said that it wanted to build four nuclear power stations using French reactor technology.

The pub is overlooked by the fading dark green corrugated hulk of Forgemasters, the engineering firm dealt a blow by the coalition government today when it scrapped an £80m loan to make steel presses. Forgemasters worker Gary White, 46, said many staff were demoralised. Sat with a friend watching Germany play Serbia during a lunchtime break from his shift, White said: \"I am sure we will bounce back and weather this little storm, but I would have thought the government was trying to support manufacturing rather than undermine it.\" White was critical of Nick Clegg, whose constituency is in the city. \"He has forgotten about the city and is on a little power trip,\" said White. \"I would have thought he would have fought hard for his own area.\" White, who is a family man, says he has always been wary of Clegg and feels bitter that, as the leader of a minority party, Clegg has been able to make such a decision. \"Like many people in South Yorkshire, I feel betrayed,\" he added. \"It is a bitter pill to swallow.\" Pub landlord Anthony Szunski, 45, said: \"Faces just dropped yesterday when the news was announced. I think it will affect trade in the pub – we are busy, but if people haven't got jobs they won't be able to afford to come out. \"There is a lot of anger in Sheffield towards Nick Clegg as he is supposed to be an MP and people feel he should have fought harder to oppose the cuts. But he's truly buggered it up. \"If Forgemasters ever closes, then this pub will go,\" he added. The loan would have allowed the company, which manufactures components to nuclear power stations, to build a new 15,000 tonne press. Its withdrawal was one of three separate blows for Sheffield on Thursday, when a £12m retail project for the heart of the city was shelved along with £13m for an industrial park on brownfield land. Jon Wilson, 38, a father of two who is an engineer at Sheffield city council, said he is fearful of cuts in local government under the new regime. \"We feel as if Sheffield has had it knocked out of it with these three announcements,\" he said. \"The loan to Forgemasters had the potential to bring a lot of money into the city.

He took a tough line with Republicans over the so-called fiscal cliff, as Ewen MacAskill reports. • Also in his press conference, Obama promised to take a lead on tackling the effects of climate change. Our US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg has a report on that here • Obama set up a potential confrontation with Senate Republicans over Susan Rice, the ambassador to the UN who he is believed to favour for secretary of state. It was the one moment of the press conference when Obama appeared to get rattled, describing as \"outrageous\" the attacks on Rice over her television interviews on the Benghazi attack. If Obama nominates Rice – which must now be more likely – some Republican senators have promised to block the nomination. Chris McGreal reports on that here. • House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said she will stand for the position again. Here's Emma Keller on that. Mitt Romney - remember him? - is working through his stages of grief at losing the election campaign, and resurfaced in a call to his lucky donors in which he blames his defeat on Barack Obama's \"gifts\" of free stuff like healthcare and education to women and people of colour. The Los Angeles Times's Maeve Reston appears to have heard the conference call, and reports: Mitt Romney told his top donors Wednesday that his loss to President Obama was a disappointing result that neither he or his top aides had expected, but said he believed his team ran a “superb” campaign with “no drama,” and attributed his rival’s victory to “the gifts” the administration had given to blacks, Hispanics and young voters during Obama’s first term. Obama, Romney argued, had been “very generous” to blacks, Hispanics and young voters. He cited as motivating factors to young voters the administration’s plan for partial forgiveness of college loan interest and the extension of health coverage for students on their parents’ insurance plans well into their 20s. Free contraception coverage under Obama’s healthcare plan, he added, gave an extra incentive to college-aged women to back the president. Would that be the 47% by any chance, Mitt? But there's a happy schadenfreude ending (for Democrats): The former Massachusetts governor said he was trying to turn his thoughts to his plans going forward. “But frankly we’re still so troubled by the past, it’s hard to put together our plans for the future,” he said. Signs of life inside the Republican House caucus: Cathy McMorris Rodgers has been elected chair of the House Republican conference – a slap in the face for Paul Ryan and others who had championed the more conservative Tom Price for the job. That makes McMorris Rodgers the number four in the Republican House leadership overall, and the most senior Republican woman in Congress. The Hill reports: Senate Republicans elected a slate of white men to their top five leadership positions on Wednesday, and some GOP lawmakers feared the House would follow suit at a time when Republicans have said they need to find ways to reach out to women and minorities. Speaker John Boehner (Ohio), Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Virginia) and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (California) will remain in the top three slots among House Republicans in the upcoming Congress. What John McCain says is a \"salient point\" of the Benghazi events is, believe it or not, an interview that UN ambassador Susan Rice gave on Face The Nation on 16 September, five days after the attacks on the consulate that killed four Americans. Here's the transcript of Rice's appearance, and it doesn't appear to justify the importance McCain is placing upon it: Bob Schieffer: And joining us now, Susan Rice, our UN ambassador. Madam Ambassador, [Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf] says this is something that has been in the planning stages for months. I understand you have been saying that you think it was spontaneous? Are we not on the same page here? Susan Rice: Bob, let me tell you what we understand to be the assessment at present. First of all, very importantly, as you discussed with the President, there is an investigation that the United States government will launch led by the FBI, that has begun and – Schieffer: But they are not there. Rice: They are not on the ground yet but they have already begun looking at all sorts of evidence of various sorts already available to them and to us. And they will get on the ground and continue the investigation. So we'll want to see the results of that investigation to draw any definitive conclusions. But based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy – sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent. Schieffer: But you do not agree with him that this was something that had been plotted out several months ago? Rice: We do not not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned. Schieffer: Do you agree or disagree with [the Libyan president] that al-Qaida had some part in this? Rice: Well, we'll have to find out that out. I mean I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine. Rice does say there was a \"spontaneous protest\" outside the Benghazi consulate but says that after that, \"extremist elements\" later arrived with heavy weaponry, which led to the violence that followed. So quite what Rice's crime in McCain's eyes is here is hard to discern. John McCain is on the floor of the Senate right now, fulminating on the subject of the deaths in Benghazi – his demand, and that of his fellow Republican Lindsay Graham, is for a joint select committee of various Senate committees to conduct an investigation. It's very unlikely to happen, for the simple reason that the Democrats running the Senate will block it out of the box. McCain makes a brief reference to the president \"taking some umbrage\" at his earlier comments. McCain says that Susan Rice's appearance on the Sunday news shows was \"one of the most salient points\" in the whole Benghazi affair. That seems silly, not to mention syntactically incorrect, although McCain also says: \"We're not 'picking on' anybody.\" Meanwhile, Lindsay Graham is also speaking in what's known as in the Senate as a colloquially – there are ruder references that have no place here but they both involve a circle of people – in which he and McCain ask each other questions. Graham's role is what on the internet is known as \"concern troll\". Here's the transcript of President Obama's answer on immigration today, following a question from Telemundo's Lori Montenegro: Question: Exactly what do you envision is broad immigration reform? Does that include a legalization programme? And also, what lessons, if any, did Democrats learn from this last election and the Latino vote? Obama: Well, I think what was incredibly encouraging was to see a significant increase in Latino turnout. This is the fastest-growing group in the country and, you know, historically what you've seen is Latino vote – vote at lower rates than the broader population. And that's beginning to change. You're starting to see a sense of empowerment and civic participation that I think is going to be powerful and good for the country. And it is why I'm very confident that we can get immigration reform done. Before the election, I had given a couple of interviews where I predicted that Latino vote was going to be strong and that that would cause some reflection on the part of Republicans about their position on immigration reform. I think we're starting to see that already. I think that's a positive sign. This has not historically been a partisan issue. We've had President Bush and John McCain and others who have supported comprehensive immigration reform in the past. So, we need to seize the moment. And my expectation is that we get a bill introduced and we begin the process in Congress very soon after my inauguration. And, in fact, some conversations I think are already beginning to take place among senators and congressmen and my staff about what would this look like. And when I say comprehensive immigration reform, it's very similar to the outlines of previous immigration reform. I think it should include a continuation of the strong border security measures that we've taken. Because we have to secure our border. I think it should contain serious penalties for companies that are purposely hiring undocumented workers and taking advantage of them. And I do think that there should be a pathway for legal status for those who are living in this country, are not engaged in criminal activity, are here simply to work. It's important for them to pay back taxes. It's important for them to learn English. It's important for them to potentially pay a fine, but to give them the avenue whereby they can resolve their legal status here in this country, I think is very important. Obviously making sure that we put into law the first step that we've taken administratively dealing with the Dream Act kids is very important as well. The one thing that I'm very clear about is that young people who are brought here through no fault of their own, who have gone to school here, pledged allegiance to our flag, want to serve in our military, want to go to school and contribute to our society, that they shouldn't be under the cloud of deportation. That we should give them every opportunity to earn their citizenship. And so, you know there are other components to it, obviously. The business community continues to be concerned about getting enough high-skilled workers. And I am a believer that if you've got a PhD in physics, or computer science who wants to stay here, and start a business here, we shouldn't make it harder for them to stay here, we should try to encourage him to contribute to this society. I think that the agricultural sector, obviously has very specific concerns about making sure that they've got a workforce that helps deliver food to our table. So there are going to be a bunch of components to it, but I think whatever process we have needs to make sure border security's strong, needs to deal with employers effectively, needs to provide a pathway for the undocumented here, needs to deal with the Dream Act kids. And I think that's something that we can get done. Here's the transcript of President Obama's response to the attacks on UN ambassador Susan Rice, from this afternon's press conference: Question: Senator John McCain, and Senator Lindsey Graham both said today that they want to have Watergate-style hearings on the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, and said that if you nominate Susan Rice to be secretary of State, they will do everything in their power to block her nomination. Senator Graham said, he simply doesn't trust Ambassador Rice after what she said about Benghazi. I'd like your reaction to that. And would those threats deter you from making a nomination like that? Obama: First of all I'm not going to comment on various nominations that I'll put forward to fill out my cabinet for the second term. Those are things that are still being discussed. But let me say specifically about Susan Rice, she has done exemplary work. She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill, and professionalism, and toughness, and grace. As I've said before, she made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her. If Senator McCain and Senator Graham, and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. And I'm happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the UN ambassador who had nothing to do with Benghazi, and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received? And to besmirch her reputation is outrageous. And, you know, we're after an election now. I think it is important for us to find out exactly what happened in Benghazi and I'm happy to cooperate in any ways that Congress wants. We have provided every bit of information that we have and we will continue to provide information. And we've got a full-blown investigation, and all that information will be disgorged to Congress. And I don't think there's any debate in this country that when you have four Americans killed, that's a problem. And we've got to get to the bottom of it and there needs to be accountability. We've got to bring those who carried it out to justice. They won't get any debate from me on that. But when they go after the UN ambassador, apparently because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me. And should I choose, if I think that she would be the best person to serve America in the capacity at the State Department, then I will nominate her. The Barack Obama on display at today's press conference was a far cry from the presidential candidate of a week ago, writes the Guardian's Washington bureau chief Ewen MacAskill: The press conference, the first in eight months, shows a newly-confident president, freed by the constraints of having to fight another election. The best example of this came in his feisty response to a threat by Republican senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham to block the appointment of UN ambassador Susan Rice in place of Hillary Clinton at he state department. Obama said he had not decided yet but he would choose whoever he wanted. He accused McCain and Graham of besmirching Rice and that her statements about Benghazi had been made with the backing of the White House. Instead of going after an easy target, they should come after him, Obama warned. The president was just as defiant over the looming \"fiscal cliff,\" offering an unequivocal promise that he will not back down, as he has before, on extending tax cuts to the top 2% of wealthy Americans. The press conference passed extremely quickly. Previous ones could be laboured, with Obama largely sticking to his talking points, often ending up going on too long and becoming repetitive. Not this time. One of the loudest complaints from Democratic activists and supporters over the last two years has been that Obama was often too weak in dealing with the Republicans. It sounds as if he might have heard them. President Obama gave a full and fascinating answer on the subject of climate change – reinvigorated as a political issue since Hurricane Sandy – and the Guardian's US environment correspondent Suzanne Goldenberg gives her take: Today's press conference produced the fullest statement in some time from Barack Obama on climate change – not that that is saying very much after an election campaign in which he mentioned the words only at safe gatherings such as San Francisco fundraisers or campus rallies. But Obama went beyond his earlier assertions that climate change is real and caused by humans, and said he was going to look for short-term and long-term solutions. The newly-elected president also indicated he was going to expend his own political capital on climate change by holding “wide-ranging conversations between scientists, engineers and election officials to find out what more we can do in making short-term progress”. That is a greater level of involvement than Obama's first term, when he basically left the effort to pass a climate bill to Democratic members of Congress. That said, Obama also made it very clear there are limits to how hard he is going to push on climate. The solutions will have to have bipartisan support, he said. And they can't get in the way of his main agenda. “If the message is somehow that we are going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anyone is going to go for that,” Obama said, adding: \"I'm not going to go for that.\" While Obama's press conference was going on, the Federal Reserve's open markets committee made its scheduled release of the minutes of the committee's last monetary policy-setting meeting. The minutes contain little news on the Fed's outlook for interest rates, but it did have this rather gloomy conclusion on the outlook for job creation: Members viewed the information on US economic activity received over the inter-meeting period as suggesting that the economy was, on balance, expanding moderately, with a pickup in household spending and further improvement in housing markets offset to some extent by a slowdown in the business sector. Although the unemployment rate declined in recent months, monthly gains in nonfarm payroll jobs remained modest, and many members noted that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in the labor market. There we have it: 11 questions, all dealt with fairly robustly by President Obama. The White House press corp even managed not to go too far down the rabbit hole on the Petraeus affair questions, which is unusually restrained of it. The highlight was Obama's rather macho calling out of republican senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham's posturing over UN ambassador Susan Rice and the Benghazi deaths – a business that goes back to an appearance Rice made soon after the attacks that killed four Americans, and blamed it on protests against the toxic video – a scenario that has now been largely discredited. Eleventh question: Syria, and would the US arm the Syrian rebels? \"We have been extensively engaged with the international community,\" says Obama and claims to be \"constantly consulting with the opposition\" as well as Turkey, Jordan and Israel on the matter. The recent coalescing of the Syrian opposition – which Obama says isn't yet a \"government in exile\" – is a positive step. He then goes on to warn about \"extremist elements\" within the opposition, and says that the US has to be careful about arming the rebels for that reason. \"We're constantly probing and working on that issue,\" Obama says. That's it – although a young buck from Bloomberg loudly shouts out a question that catches Obama's attention. \"That's an excellent question,\" says Obama, \"but it would set a terrible precedent\" if he answered it, having declared the end of questioning, just because the guy shouted the loudest. Fair enough. Everyone laughs with delight. Tenth question: climate change, in the context of New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's endorsement. Is Obama willing to include a tax on carbon, for example? Obama responds, after pointing out that climate change may not be directly responsible for the likes of Hurricane Sandy, saying: \"I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behaviour.\" The president says he will be having \"conversations ... to find out what more we can do to make short term progress in reducing carbon. And then working through an education process across the country.\" Obama says he doesn't know how Republicans or Democrats will react, because of regional differences. \"There's no doubt that taking on climate change right now would require some tough political choices\" – but then Obama says Americans are too worried about the economy and growth to accept any move to deal with climate change. So, don't hold your breath (even if it does reduce carbon emissions). Ninth question: about the fiscal cliff and Iran, not together of course. \"Obviously we can all imagine going over the fiscal cliff,\" Obama replies to his thoughts on the worst that could happen: \"Middle class families could all end up getting a pretty big tax hike, and that's going to come as a shock. \"There are some tough things that have to be done but there's a way of doing this that doesn't hurt middle class families,\" and a host of other groups and interests, such as scientific research, says Obama. Regarding Iran: \"I very much want to see a diplomatic resolution to the problem,\" says Obama: I was very clear before the campaign, I was clear during the campaign, and I'm now clear after the campaign, we're not gonna let Iran get a nuclear weapon. But I think there is still a window of time for us it resolve this diplomatically. We've imposed the toughest sanctions in history. It is having an impact on Iran's economy. There should be a way in which they can enjoy peaceful nuclear power while still meeting their international obligations and providing clear assurances to the international community that they're not pursuing a nuclear weapon. Eighth question: it's a follow up from Fox News's Ed Henry, asking about the \"come after me\" comment and what Obama has to say to the families of those killed. Obama then says he's not going to communicate with the families of the four men through a press conference. Henry also asked about Obama's perceived mandate following his re-election victory. \"I've got one mandate,\" Obama replies: I've got a mandate to help middle-class families and families that have been working hard to try to get into the middle class. That's my mandate. That's what the American people said. They said, 'Work really hard to help us. Don't worry about the politics of it. Don't worry about the party interests. Don't worry about the special interests. Just work really hard to see if you can help us get ahead, because we're working really hard out here and we're still struggling, a lot of us. That's my mandate. I don't presume that because I won an election that everybody suddenly agrees with me on everything. I'm more than familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms. We are very cautious about that. Seventh question: is there a need for Watergate-style hearings into the Benghazi deaths? And Republican opposition to Susan Rice is raised. Obama says he won't mention future appointments but then goes on to praise and defend Susan Rice, saying that the UN ambassador was blameless regarding Benghazi. Obama then gets tough with the Republican stone-throwers: If Senator McCain and Senator Graham, and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me. And I'm happy to have that discussion with them. But for them to go after the UN ambassador who had nothing to do with Benghazi, and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received? And to besmirch her reputation is outrageous. He then taunts McCain and Lindsay: \"When they go after the UN ambassador, because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me\". Sixth question: how can Obama improve his relationship with Congress during his second term? \"There's no doubt I could always do better,\" Obama replies. It's a kind of dumb question. He goes on: As I said during the campaign, there are going to be times when there are fights, and those fights need to be had. Fifth question: has the president had the discussion with Mitt Romney that he promised he would on election night? Obama admits that he has not yet scheduled a discussion, and says people have forgotten that the election was only a week ago. \"I know I've forgotten, I forgot that on Wednesday,\" he jokes. Fourth question: should Obama have known sooner about the Petraeus affair? And should tax rates return to the Clinton era levels? On Petraeus and the timing of how he was informed, Obama responds: I am withholding judgment how the entire process surrounding General Petraeus came up. We don't have all the information yet but I want to say I have a lot of confidence in the FBI. On tax rates, Obama says he is open to ideas from all quarters. \"I don't expect Republicans to accept my budget, that's not realistic. I'm willing to compromise. But what I will not do is have a process that is vague.... the reason I won't do that because I don't want to find ourselves in a position six months or a year from now that the only way to cut the deficit is to sock it to middle class families.... that's my concern. I'm less concerned about red lines per se. What I'm concerned about is a situation where the wealthy are not paying more or not paying what they should. Obama says he's confident that the \"American people understood what they were getting\" when they re-elected him. Third question: immigration reform, specifically what moves Obama plans to make and what lessons his party took from the last election result. We learned that the Latino vote is the fastest growing group in the country, Obama replies, and that's why \"I am very confident we can get immigration reform done.\" He sees the latest Republican reaction as a \"positive sign\" and promises an attempt at comprehensive immigration reform \"very soon after my inauguration\". He says that \"conversations have already started\" between Congress and White House staff on immigration, and calls for the outlines of the Dream Act to be first up. Second question: having previously ruled out extending the Bush tax cuts and then extended them, will President Obama \"cave again\"? The last time was a \"one time proposition,\" Obama says. The most important step we can take right not now ... if we right away say that 97% of Americans are not going to see their taxes go up. That 97% of small businesses are not going to see their taxes go up. And right away we can do away with the uncertainty. After that a \"package can be shaped\" by \"folks of goodwill of both parties\". But he again rules out \"a tax cut for folks that don't need it\". But what I am not going to do is extend Bush tax cuts to the the wealthiest 2% – which economists have said we can't afford. Just closing loopholes and deductions wasn't going to be enough to make the difference, Obama says, and harks back to the election result: If there was one thing that everybody understood was a big difference between myself and Mr Romney, it was, when it comes to how we reduce our deficit, I argued for a balanced, responsible approach, and part of that included making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay a little bit more. I think every voter out there understood that, that was an important debate, and the majority of voters agreed with me. By the way, more voters agreed with me on this issue than voted for me. So, we've got a clear majority of the American people who recognize, if we're going to be serious about deficit reduction, we've got to do it in a balanced way. After a quick talk about the fiscal cliff from Obama, the first question is whether or not there have been any security breaches from David Petraeus's affair. \"I have no evidence from what I have seen at this point,\" says Obama, adding that he doesn't want to comment on an on-going investigation: I do want to emphasise what I said before: General Petraeus had a great career... By his own assessment he did not meet the standards as a director of the CIA in the personal matter that he is now dealing with. That's somewhat elliptical but Obama adds that there is a sense of \"sadness\" in what was a great career. President Obama takes the podium in the East Room of the White House, only a few minutes late. \"I hear you've got some questions for me,\" Obama begins, but he starts off by saying a few words about \"the economy and jobs\", getting that out of the way before the serious business of Paula Broadwell's email habits is opened to the White House press corps. In about five minutes time President Obama's first post-election press conference is due to start, although punctuality isn't always this White House's strong point.

I have been told in the past that it works better using a Chrome browser than Firefox, if you want to be all techy about it. My eagle-eyed colleague Suzanne Goldenberg notes that the ex-husband of Jill Kelley's twin sister – Natalie Khawam, who got personal references from generals Petraeus and Allen to back her child custody claim – is the delightfully named Grayson Wolfe. And like everyone else in this business, it seems, he has what the British call \"previous\". From Wolfe's current employer's website: Grayson Wolfe is a Partner at Akkadian. He previously served as Director of Broader Middle East Initiatives and Iraqi Reconstruction and Special Assistant to the Chief Operating Officer at the Export-Import Bank of the United States. He was appointed to the bank by President Bush in June 2002. Between January and August 2004, Wolfe served as Manager of the Private Sector Development Office of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad, Iraq. In this capacity he was directly responsible for implementing a wide range of initiatives to attract foreign direct investment and provide financing to Iraqi companies. During this time, Wolfe worked extensively on the ground with senior Iraqi and Kurdish officials, and with the Ministries of Finance, Trade and Oil. This whole threat level is now officially raised to Condition Insane. Great. Today lots of elderly white Republican senators – John McCain, Lindsay Graham – have been touring the nation's television microphones to vent their outrage at the prospect of UN ambassador Susan Rice being nominated as secretary of state. Because nothing says \"re-invented, modern Republican party\" like trying to block the nomination of a black woman to one of the nation's most senior political posts. Here's video of Nancy Pelosi taking down jejune Luke Russert on the question of her age earlier today. The Tampa Bay Times has done magnificent work on the goings-on around the \"love pentagon\" that appears to have been based in the fair city of Tampa, along with generals Petraeus and Allen at various points. The newspaper has the definitive profile of the social surroundings of Tampa, along with baggage and financial problems: South Tampa's decades-long reputation for genteel hospitality toward the military has transformed over the past several days into a soap opera of sexual misconduct and improper emails that has already cost Petraeus his job and threatens Allen's career as well. Ground zero is not the Pentagon, but a mansion on Bayshore Boulevard inhabited by a family with lavish appetites and gigantic debts. Not to be missed: the Kelley family portrait in oils. Finally someone says something sensible about the rash of \"secession petitions\" that have been doing the rounds since President Obama was re-elected: We don’t take online polls seriously, recognizing that they’re not representative. Why are we pretending that these “petitions” are meaningful? It’s quite probable that a large number of these “signatures” are some combination of a lark and the same yahoos signing multiple times. Even if the quoted numbers were actually genuine residents of the states in question, though, the numbers are absurdly small. Louisiana has 4.6 million residents; 28,000 signatures represents 0.6% of them. Alabama has 4.8 million residents; 20,000 is 0.4% of that. And there's precedent that states can't secede. It's called the Civil War. The Petreus-Broadwell-Kelley-Allen-Gmail-FBI-sexting saga continues, first as tragedy but now as farce. Thanks to someone with a sense of humour in the Tampa police department we have all learned: Jill Kelley, the woman at the center of scandals swirling around Gens. David Petraeus and John Allen, tried to invoke what she claimed was honorary diplomatic status in a 911 call complaining about trespassers on her lawn. “I’m an honorary consul general, so I have inviolability, so they should not be able to cross my property,” she told a 911 operator in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday. “I don’t know if you want to get diplomatic protection involved as well, because that’s against the law to cross my property because, you know, it’s inviolable.” On C-Span there's live coverage of some Republican House event called \"Conversations with conservatives\". The main takeaway seems to be that the \"conversations\" are taking place mainly with the voices in their head, with one claiming a mandate for conservative Republican ideals on the basis that Barack Obama was elected by a \"very narrow 51%\" of the vote last week. Meanwhile: Representative Paul Ryan received a standing ovation at a closed House Republican conference meeting Wednesday morning, his first talk to the party since losing the White House. Ryan said the 2012 campaign was a “very positive experience” and his running mate Mitt Romney is a “wonderful man,” according to a source in the room. Here's hoping for many more such \"very positive experiences\" in the years to come. While Nancy Pelosi appears set to be staying on as Democratic leader in the House, on the Republican side there's some real turmoil. Not only are some people punting Paul Ryan to replace John Boehner as Speaker of the House but there's a real ding-dong going on further down the greasy pole. Boehner and the GOP leadership want to put Cathy McMorris Rodgers in the number four post as Republican conference chairman in the House. But conservatives want the very dry Tom Price in the job – and Paul Ryan has publicly backed Price. McMorris Rodgers is the vice-chairman of the Republican conference – but Price is seen as far more conservative. CNN had Ryan's letter to GOP members backing Price: He was instrumental in drafting our House Republican budget. His vocal leadership on issues like health care, tax reform, and fiscal matters has been vital to our messaging and policy efforts. No one will work harder than Congressman Price at building a strong and compelling communications and policy strategy that reflects the will of our membership and the needs of the nation. If Price wins the caucus vote then that's a bad sign for Boehner, and possibly for hopes of significant compromise between the parties on the tax and debt issues to come. Winding up, Nancy Pelosi says: \"Aren't we proud of the fact that we've got 61 women? Now we just have to double.\" Then Pelosi repeats her slightly unusual formulation: \"there's nothing more wholesome\" than empowering women. Asked if not having the majority in the House, Nancy Pelosi points out that Democrats actually did ok in the House elections last week – and she has the facts and figures from previous elections and presidential re-elections to back her point up. Earlier, in response to a question, Pelosi says the post-election make-up of the Congress is \"infinitely better than the last term,\" arguing that \"the anti-government ideologues\" on the GOP side have gone. That seems a bold hope. So the \"offensive\" question about Nancy Pelosi's age came from NBC's Luke Russert, who himself looks about 16 years old. Fact: Pelosi is 72, Russert is 27. \"So I have made the decision that some of you may have some interest in,\" says Nancy Pelosi, getting around to her point, although the path there is rather more tortuous than normal with Pelosi. \"In order to reignite the American dream, that's what we're about,\" says Pelosi, \"we have work to do. I have made a decision to submit my name to my colleagues to serve as House minority leader.\" At last. Now Pelosi takes questions. When did she make a decision to stay on? Pelosi explains she was waiting on some late races and then talking to the unlucky losers from the Democratic caucus. But she concludes that the influence of money in politics is such that she needed to stay and fight it – raising the $7m in outside money spent against Tammy Duckworth in a single congressional election: \"Changing the role of money in politics is really a very important motivator for me.\" Is she blocking a younger leader? The House women erupt in disgust. \"Discrimination,\" several of them call out. \"Oh you've always asked that question except of Senator McConnell,\" jokes Pelosi. The reporter persists, pointing out that the House Democratic leadership is all a bit long in the tooth. The jeers start up again until Pelosi silences them with: \"Let's for a moment assume that's a legitimate question, although it's quite offensive, you may not realise that.\" After talking about the younger members of congress she has encouraged, Pelosi ends with \"The answer to your question is: no.\" \"So here we are,\" says Nancy Pelosi. \"Why is it important to make this statement about the strength of House Democratic women?\" Because this is where the hopes of America's households resides, she says, and reels off a list of the sterling work and legislation achieved by Democratic women in the House: But in any event, the point is that if America is going to reach its full fulfillment as a nation, we must have the further empowerment of women, women in the military. If we want to be at our strongest, we must give women every opportunity in the women to hold every job so that they can one day attain the top job. Women in business, how could it be that there are Fortune 500 and fewer than 20 CEOs at Fortune 500? If we want our economy to flourish and grow, we must lift up women's leadership in our economy, very important. Women in the academic world, women in health care, any subject you can name is more wholesome, more successful, more efficient with the involvement of women. A vertitable binderful of Democratic party women are gathered in the House around Nancy Pelosi as she announces that she is running again for the party's senior position in the House. Pelosi pays tribute to the number of women on the Democratic side of the House, and mentions that when she started in the House 25 years ago there were just 23 women in the House: Today we have over 60 House Democratic women. Very good. Not enough, we want more. Delivering a statement to explain his decision, Maine's Angus King says he considered being a truly independent \"go it alone\" senator,\" but says: \"It has become apparent after extensive research into the Senate rules ... that this wouldn't be practical,\" because he'd be cut out of the committee structure. Oh surprise. \"What does caucusing mean?\" wonders King, who really is making a meal of this and may have a tendency towards windbaggery. Which means he'll fit right in to the US Senate. He says he's decided to caucus with Democrats \"because doing so will allow me to take independent positions as they arise\". But King is careful to say that just because he's caucusing with Dems, it doesn't mean he doesn't also love Republicans in a bipartisan spirit of hugs. Taking questions, the first one is: if the Republicans took control of the Senate, would you wait five or 10 seconds before switching sides? Well that would depend on stuff, such as maintaining my independence, says King. (I'm only covering this because we're waiting for Nancy Pelosi's press conference to start on C-Span. And also for the people of Maine.) So Nancy Pelosi wants to stay on in the job as top Democrat in the House, once again thwarting Maryland's Steny Hoyer, who will be shaking a fist at the sky and shouting \"Pelooooooosiiiii!\" in a locked room somewhere. But there was some more good news for the Democratic party in Congress: maverick independent senator Angus King – newly elected from the great state of Maine – has announced that he will indeed caucus with the Senate Democrats. In practice that doesn't mean much, except that King gets ranking member privileges and a better selection of Senate committees, in return for a tiny bit of leverage by the Democrats. Barack Obama is holding his first formal televised press conference at the White House since March. It was probably intended to be a triumphant affair but all that has now been clouded by the scandal involving David Petraeus and the looming controversy over the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" of tax rises and budget cuts. That's coming at 1.30pm. Before that, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi – who has held the position of top Democratic in the House of Representatives for 10 years – has announced this morning she is to stand for the position again. She's holding a press conference at 10am to formally make her bid to the Democratic party caucus. Meanwhile, more details emerge over the tangled web of connections between Petraeus, General John Allen and the email trail that revealed their relationships, as Petraeus is set to appear before Congress this week regarding the Benghazi deaths in his former role as CIA director."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2010/dec/14/betrayal-clegg-punish-alternative-vote","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-14T21:00:01Z","webTitle":"By his act of betrayal, Clegg will lose his greatest reward | Peter Wilby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/14/betrayal-clegg-punish-alternative-vote","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/14/betrayal-clegg-punish-alternative-vote","fields":{"headline":"By his act of betrayal, Clegg will lose his greatest reward","bodyText":"Nick Clegg and his Liberal Democrats have taken the brunt of public anger over tuition fees. Student protesters burn Clegg and Vince Cable in effigy, not David Cameron and George Osborne, who have always favoured graduates paying the lion's share of their university costs. Whatever one's own views on the subject (and I am a supporter of fees), it is hard not to sympathise with voters who supported the Lib Dems last May mainly or even solely because of their explicit pledges on student financing. How can we call ourselves a democracy if politicians make clear promises that they then feel free to abandon a few months after being elected? When Clegg talked of a \"new politics\" in the campaign, this was not what most voters understood him to mean. Broken political promises are nothing new but the coalition government has brought betrayals of manifesto commitments that, in number and scale, are unprecedented in British politics. Alongside opposition to tuition fees, the other Lib Dem election policies that lodged in voters' minds were that the party would oppose early and deep cuts in public spending and, as the manifesto put it, would \"reject a new generation of nuclear power stations\". Tory voters have as much reason to feel aggrieved as Lib Dem voters. Manifesto promises to replace the Human Rights Act with a UK bill of rights, raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1m, and hand out prison sentences for carrying knives have all been set aside. All this must surely damage the coalition partners. Millions of Britons were frustrated enough by their inability to influence the Labour government's decisions on the Iraq war, but at least that was not an issue in the previous election. Both partners in this government have reneged on several central campaign promises. The British system allows voters a voice in how the country is governed only once every four or five years. It doesn't say much for democracy if even that modest input can be so quickly and blatantly ignored, rather in the manner that Labour governments customarily ignored party conference decisions. If this is coalition government, many will say, we want no more of it; and we should certainly not move to an electoral system that, by strengthening the Lib Dems and other minority parties, makes a coalition more likely. Next year's referendum on the alternative vote – the most precious concession that the Lib Dems have wrested from the Tories – seems certain to end in a \"no\" vote. If nothing else, thousands of voters will want to deprive the turncoat Clegg of his reward. One of the paradoxes of the coalition is that, if we tot up the votes cast at the general election, it is the first government since the second world war to command the support of a majority of the electorate, with a larger Commons majority than Margaret Thatcher in 1979 or Tony Blair in 2005. It is not, by the conventional definition, a \"weak\" government. No administration since Thatcher's, in her mid-1980s high noon, has acted so decisively and single-mindedly. Yet very few voters feel it is \"their\" government, and many – perhaps most – believe it has no mandate at all. In this it is quite unlike the last peacetime coalition, the national government of 1931, which sought and won electoral approval within months of its formation. Lloyd George's wartime coalition also went to the country almost immediately after the 1918 armistice. This is the first unelected peacetime coalition that proposes to serve a full five-year term. Judging by the mood of the anti-fees demonstrators, it arouses peculiarly strong passions and, as its spending cuts bite, it could find itself governing an angry and deeply divided country while lacking democratic legitimacy. For the Lib Dems, whose support is already below 10% according to the polls, the consequences could be catastrophic. Though their support is more concentrated than it was, they still have many fewer safe seats than the other parties: only eight of their MPs have majorities of more than 10,000; only Clegg in Sheffield Hallam has a majority of more than 15,000. They have no equivalent of the traditional support that Labour enjoys among the urban working class or the Conservatives among sections of the rural and suburban middle class. Clegg may well regret not embracing the alternative to coalition, which was to support the Tories on an issue-by-issue basis, occasionally extracting policy concessions, such as the pupil premium, in return for a promise not to bring the government down on major policy matters. The practical outcome would probably have been much the same. If all Lib Dem MPs had abstained on tuition fees – in return, say, for more scholarships for students from poor homes or a higher threshold for graduate repayments – the Tories would still have had 21 more seats than the other remaining parties and so would have got the rises through, even with a few backbench rebels. The Lib Dems would still have backed away from their election promise to vote against a rise in fees. But their position could have been presented as both principled and responsible. As it is, they are accused of sacrificing principle for power. They have probably also sunk their hopes of electoral reform for at least a decade, by demonstrating its potential pitfalls within Britain's peculiar political system. Unlike, say, America and France, we use a single vote to determine both who we want to represent us in parliament and who we want to govern us. Unlike most European countries, we also have highly centralised government that (bar Scotland, Wales and, to a lesser extent, London) leaves the country with no alternative sources of political authority to Westminster and Whitehall. That one vote is more or less the sum total of the ordinary citizen's influence over how the country and its public services, from health to education, are run. And as we have seen, coalition largely destroys even that sliver of influence. The alternative may be to accept that voting for a government should be distinct from voting for the people who will represent our views and interests and check the executive. If we are electing a government, it is plainly a nonsense to suppose that it can or should reflect every shade of opinion. Equally, it is plainly unfair and undemocratic that, in a supposedly representative assembly, the distribution of seats fails to match the distribution of votes. Is this the answer, at last, to the question of what to do with the House of Lords? Should it be replaced by a senate, elected not on AV but on truly proportionate lines, to which the Commons abdicates many of its responsibilities for representation and scrutiny? If the Lib Dems can persuade their coalition colleagues of the merits of such a solution, perhaps some good will come of their otherwise disastrous collaboration with the Tories."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2011/mar/12/japan-nuclear-meltdown-fukushima-reactor","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-13T05:33:00Z","webTitle":"Japan nuclear fears as systems fail at second reactor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/12/japan-nuclear-meltdown-fukushima-reactor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/mar/12/japan-nuclear-meltdown-fukushima-reactor","fields":{"headline":"Japan nuclear fears as systems fail at second reactor","bodyText":"Fears of another explosion at a Japanese nuclear plant are growing after officials said the cooling system in a second reactor had failed. Thousands of people were evacuated on Saturday following an explosion and leak from the Fukushima Daiichi plant, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo. It was believed the first explosion had been contained and disaster avoided. But on Sunday the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) said radiation levels around the Fukushima Daiichi plant had risen above the safety limit and said the cooling system in the number three reactor had failed. It was preparing to vent steam to relieve pressure in the reactor and the government had warned of a rise in radiation during the procedure. Fears of a nuclear fallout were first raised when a massive explosion rocked the Fukushima Daiichi atomic power plant following damage to the number one reactor in Friday's earthquake. A pall of grey-white smoke rose over the plant, operated by Tokyo Electric Power, and it was reported that four workers had been injured. Government officials revealed plans to distribute iodine tablets – a treatment for radiation poisoning – to locals while a 20km exclusion zone was set up round the plant. Residents outside the zone were urged to stay inside, close doors and windows and turn off air conditioning. Scientists had detected eight times the normal radiation levels outside the facility and 1,000 times normal levels inside the affected unit's control room. Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, declared a state of emergency at the crippled unit and at its sister plant, the Fukushima Daini, as engineers tried frantically to determine whether the reactor had gone into meltdown. Japan's nuclear safety agency said the number of people exposed to radiation could reach 160. Officials said radiation levels around the plant had breached saftey levels. Workers in protective clothing were scanning people arriving at evacuation centres for radioactive exposure. The chief cabinet secretary Yukio Edano told a news briefing: \"They are working on relieving pressure and pumping in water into the number three reactor. \"This will result in some radiation leakage, although at a level that won't affect peoples' health. It will help stabilise the situation.\" He also said radiation from the number one reactor was \"low enough not to affect people's health\". For locals in Fukushima prefecture, still reeling from frequent aftershocks and clearing up after the first disaster, the prospect of another on the way in the form of nuclear meltdown was unwelcome in the extreme. \"It is frightening. You get used to living with the nuclear plants and then something like this happens. When I saw smoke from the plant, I thought, 'Uh oh',\" said Kato Tomiyama, a convenience store employee. \"I couldn't believe it,\" said Seiko Sato, a teacher. \"We need more information.\" A loss of coolant inside the first of the plant's six reactors had caused a dangerous build-up of heat. A second, more deadly explosion – one that would have released a vast radioactive plume over the nation – seemed a real prospect until it was announced that, although the outer structure of the 40-year-old reactor building had been blown off by the blast, the actual reactor inside had not been breached. It was confirmed that radioactive caesium, one of the elements released when overheating causes core damage, had been detected around the plant. The discovery indicates that meltdown, caused by a nuclear reaction running out of control, had affected the first reactor's fuel rods – although possibly only to a limited extent. The revelation did little to reassure local people. \"Everyone wants to get out of the town, but the roads are terrible,\" said Reiko Takagi, a middle-aged woman, standing outside a taxi company. \"It is too dangerous to go anywhere. But we are afraid that winds may change and bring radiation towards us.\" Tthe operators of the Fukushima plant announced they had started to fill the containment vessels in which the reactor rests with sea water in a bid to cool it down, a process that would take from five to 10 hours, an official told reporters. It was also revealed that the International Atomic Energy Agency was planning an investigation. \"We are aware of the media reports and we are urgently seeking further information,\" an IAEA official told Reuters in Vienna. In the wake of the impact of Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the Fukushima incident has strained life in Japan to an almost unendurable level, and although catastrophe appears to have been averted the incident has raised serious concerns about Japan's enthusiastic use of nuclear energy. Reactors generate almost a third of the country's electricity and there are plans, already well advanced, to raise this to 50%. For the nuclear industry, the Fukushima incident could not have come at a worse time. Unravelling what happened and how close the nation came to disaster will preoccupy scientists and engineers for years. It will be a complex business, as John Luxat, professor of nuclear safety analysis at McMaster University in Ontario, makes clear. \"When the quake hit the reactors at Fukushima, three were up and running – the other three were shut down for regular inspection,\" he said. \"The three that were running shut down immediately, as they are designed to do when the ground shakes above a certain level. After that, the emergency back-up diesel generators that provide electricity to the shutdown cooling system operated as designed for about an hour. Then they failed for some reason that's not clear. They lost power to the pumps providing cooling water.\" Last night reports suggested that the emergency pumps had failed because they had been swamped by the tsunami triggered by the initial earthquake – an embarrassing failure by those who had planned the reactor's back-up systems. Whatever the reason, the consequences were dramatic. Without pumps taking away the water that acted as the coolant, the reactors heated up and steam built up inside. \"To reduce the pressure, you would have to release some steam into the atmosphere from the system,\" said Paddy Regan, professor of nuclear physics at Surrey University. \"In that steam, there will be small but measurable amounts of radioactive nitrogen 16 [produced when neutrons hit water]. This remains radioactive for only about five seconds, after which it decays to natural oxygen.\" The steam that built up inside the damaged reactor was released into the reactor housing, outside the containment vessel. The aim was to vent it, but before that could happen there was an explosion. A huge cloud of smoke erupted from the plant, injuring a number of workers. Government spokesman Yukio Edano said that the explosion had destroyed the exterior walls of the building where the stricken reactor is located, but not the actual metal housing that enveloped the reactor. However, it is still possible the reactor could have sustained serious damage. If its fuel rods reached too high a temperature, they would have melted at least partly. \"If any of the fuel rods have been compromised, there would be evidence of a small amount of other radioisotopes in the atmosphere called fission fragments – radiocaesium and radioiodine,\" said Regan. \"The amount that you measure would tell you to what degree the fuel rods have been compromised. Scientists in Japan should be able to establish this very quickly using gamma ray spectroscopy as the isotopes have characteristic decay signatures.\" Despite the revelation that caesium had been detected, Japanese officials still claim the reactor's container was not damaged and that radiation levels have started to fall. However, the Japanese nuclear industry has a bad reputation for owning up to accidents and many observers remain cautious about accepting these claims too quickly. Professor Malcolm Sperrin, director of medical physics and clinical engineering at Royal Berkshire hospital, said: \"There is a lot we don't know at the moment, but this looks very serious. However, there are a number of things that we should remember. The big difference between something like this and previous accidents elsewhere in the world is that there will be mechanisms in place to deal with the explosion and any impacts it might have. And although there is a lot we don't know, it is very unlikely that this was an explosion involving the core.\" Naoto Sekimura from Tokyo University insisted there was little chance that Japan came close to a Chernobyl-style meltdown. \"No Chernobyl is possible at a light water reactor,\" he said. \"Loss of coolant means a temperature rise, but it also will stop the reaction. Even in the worst-case scenario, that would mean some radioactive leakage and equipment damage, but not an explosion. Those opposed to nuclear power will not let the incident be forgotten, as Jan Beranek, head of Greenpeace's international nuclear campaign, made clear. \"How many more warnings do we need before we finally grasp that nuclear reactors are inherently hazardous?

Before that, the magazine editor had been the source of many astute comments about social trends in Japan. In April, she contacted me out of the blue. I was pleased at first, then worried. Reiko's message began in traditional Japanese style with a reference to the season and her state of mind. The eloquence was typical. The tone unusually disturbing: \"It is spring time now in Tokyo and the cherry blossoms are in bloom. In my small terrace garden, the plants – tulips, roses and strawberries – are telling me that a new season has arrived. But somehow, they make me sad because I know that they are not the same as last year. They are all contaminated.\" Reiko went on to describe how everything had changed in the wake of the nuclear accident in Fukushima the previous month. Daily life felt like science fiction. She always wore a mask and carried an umbrella to protect against black rain. Every conversation was about the state of the reactors. In the supermarket, where she used to shop for fresh produce, she now looked for cooked food – \"the older, the safer now\". She expressed fears for her son, anger at the government and deep distrust of the reassuring voices she was hearing in the traditional media. \"We are misinformed. We are misinformed,\" she repeated. \"Our problem is in society. We have to fight against it. And it seems as hard as the fight against those reactors.\" She urged me to return and report on the story. Five months on, that is what I have tried to do. Driving around Fukushima's contaminated cities, Iwate's devastated coastlines and talking to evacuees in Tokyo, I've rarely felt such responsibility in writing a story. Reiko and other Japanese friends seemed to be looking not only for coverage, but for an outsider's judgment on the big question weighing on their minds: is Japan still a safe country? The magnitude 9 earthquake that struck Japan on 11 March was one of the five most powerful shocks recorded; so powerful that it lowered the coastline by a metre and nudged Japan two metres closer to the United States. It was followed by a devastating tsunami – which rose to a peak of 40m – and accounted for most of the destruction. These two natural catastrophes left 20,000 people dead or missing and 125,000 buildings destroyed. They triggered a third disaster – the multiple meltdown of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant that have together released more radiation than any accident since Chernobyl. Such was the magnitude of the catastrophe that Emperor Akihito delivered a televised address to his people. The almost archaically formal speech was so rare that it was compared to the historic radio broadcast by his father, Hirohito, that announced Japan's surrender after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 – and prompted an era of national reform and rebuilding. Six months on, the emergency is over. But another disaster is becoming apparent: a psychological crisis of doubt and depression that could prove more destabilising than anything that came before. The streets are clear of debris, reconstruction is under way and evacuees are moving out of shelters. But millions of people are having to readjust to levels of ionising radiation that were – until March – considered abnormal. This is not a one-off freak event, it is a shift in day-to-day life that changes the meaning of \"ordinary\". But quite how is hard to determine. Low-level radiation is an invisible threat that breaks DNA strands with results that do not become apparent for years or decades. Though the vast majority of people remain completely unaffected throughout their lives, others develop cancer. Not knowing who will be affected and when is deeply unsettling. This has happened before, of course. Twenty years after the 1986 reactor explosion in Chernobyl, the World Health Organisation said psychological distress was the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident: \"Populations in the affected areas exhibit strongly negative attitudes in self-assessments of health and wellbeing and a strong sense of lack of control over their own lives. Associated with these perceptions is an exaggerated sense of the dangers to health of exposure to radiation.\" Russian doctors have said survivors were \"poisoned by information\". But in Japan, it would be more accurate to say that people are contaminated by uncertainty. On my first morning in Fukushima, I was shaken awake by a magnitude 6 earthquake, one of the many hefty aftershocks that have wobbled eastern Japan since March. But that is not what plays most on the mind. Japan's population is accustomed to physical instability. This is, after all, the most seismically active nation on earth. For centuries, the nation's culture has been infused by a spirit of \"mujo\", or impermanence. It is at the core of the nation's identity and – until now – its resilience. But this disaster is different. In a country long famous for safety, hygiene and raw food, millions of people are now being asked to accept a small but persistently higher health risk, long-term contamination of their homes, gardens, streets and schools; and food that is now deemed safer if it is prepackaged and from as far away from Fukushima as possible. In other countries, people might want to put more distance between themselves and the source of the radiation, but this is difficult on a crowded archipelago with a rigid job market. Thousands have fled nonetheless, but most people in the disaster area will have to stay and adjust. Doing so would be easier if there were clear guidance from scientists and politicians, but here, too, contemporary Japan seems particularly vulnerable. The country has just got its seventh prime minister in five years. Academia and the media have been tainted by the powerful influence of the nuclear industry. As a result, a notoriously conformist nation is suddenly unsure what to conform to. \"Individuals are being forced to make decisions about what is safe to eat and where is safe to live, because the government is not telling them – Japanese people are not good at that,\" says Satoshi Takahashi, one of Japan's leading clinical psychologists. He predicts the mental fallout of the Fukushima meltdown will be worse than the physical impact. Unlike an earthquake, he says, the survivors do not suffer post-traumatic stress symptoms of insomnia, shaking and flashbacks. Instead, the radiation \"creates a slow, creeping, invisible pressure\" that can lead to prolonged depression. \"Some people say they want to die. Others become more dependent on alcohol. Many more complain of listlessness.\" Sachiko Masuyama has suffered many of these symptoms as she has been forced to make life-or-death decisions for herself and her unborn baby. On 9 March, she found out she was expecting her third child. Two days later, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant – only 25km from her home – was jolted into meltdown. And since then her life has been turned upside down, first by a desperate escape from the disaster zone, then by a growing worry about the effects of the radiation on the foetus growing inside her. Each time she goes to the hospital for a checkup, she is filled with anxiety that the ultrasound might reveal a deformity, so she counts and recounts the fingers and toes. The doctors have reassured her there is no sign of abnormality, but they won't know for sure until the birth in November – and perhaps not for years later. For Masuyama, the worry has become so all-consuming that she has considered abortion and suicide. \"For the first two months after the disaster, I was focused only on survival,\" the 29-year-old tells me in a Tokyo restaurant, \"but since then I have had time to think and that has made me very depressed. I have been so worried that I stopped eating. I wanted to die.\" There is nobody nearby to confide in. Her friends are scattered across refuge centres in Japan. Her in-laws want her to return because the government and the power company say it is safe. But they have withheld so much information since the disaster that she no longer trusts them. \"When I watch the documentaries about Chernobyl, it is horrifying, but I have decided to give birth,\" she tells me. \"I have three children: one inside me and two outside. I wouldn't kill my son and daughter because they were exposed, so how could I kill my unborn child?\" She'd like to return to her former life, but her home, Minami Soma, is in the midst of a major decontamination operation: the streets are being cleaned, every surface sprayed. Instead, she's chosen to remain in Tokyo, where she feels lonely but safe. The decision has not been easy. \"I don't like it, but I have to choose. We Japanese like to follow each other, but this time it doesn't seem right.\" Did she need to leave? Travel around Fukushima today and there is little evidence of disaster or trauma. In the cities, the streets throng with smart suited salarymen and office ladies. In the countryside, the paddy fields are heavy with rice. Watch the bullet train speed through a frame of distant mountains and sharp blue skies and this seems to be postcard-perfect Japan. But look more closely and you will see that many families now own Geiger counters or dosimeters to check their exposure. DVD chain stores have started to rent them along with the latest Hollywood blockbusters. Inside hundreds of school playgrounds, bulldozers are scraping off the top 50cm of dirt to reduce contamination from the soil. Local newspapers and TV bulletins carry daily radiation updates with a breakdown for every neighbourhood. Each day for most of the past six months, there has been a steady drip, drip, drip of worrying news: cesium found in the breast milk of seven mothers; strontium discovered inside the city limits; 45% of children in one survey testing positive for thyroid exposure. There are reports of suicides by desperate farmers and lonely evacuees, contaminated beef smuggled on to the market, and warnings that this autumn's rice crop may have to be abandoned. At the Koriyama Big Pallette – a conference centre-turned-refugee shelter – in southern Fukushima, most people have moved into temporary shelters. The few that remain benefit from ample provisions, friendly volunteers and cardboard-and-curtain partitions designed by the world-famous architect, Shigeru Ban. But an electronic display inside the corridors shows a reading of 0.1 microsieverts (becquerels, the quantitative measure of radiation, are converted to sieverts to offer a qualitative indicator of the impact on the body). The question of whether it will return to normal prompts a sigh from volunteer Michio Terashima. \"Normal no longer means what it did. The nuclear disaster didn't turn out to be the cataclysm we feared at first and many things are getting better, but they will never be the same again.\" But there's also an effort to decontaminate and lift spirits. Fukushima is distributing 20m sunflower seeds to suck up the cesium radionuclides that have permeated the soil. The towering yellow flowers now adorn gardens, farm fields and roadside plots. Although they brighten the landscape, their stalks and petals concentrate the radioactivity and will later have to be burned or left to decompose in a controlled environment. The sunflowers are the brainchild of Kouyuu Abe, a Zen monk who owns a temple just outside Fukushima city and is committed to the \"fight against radiation\". He allows people to dump the irradiated soil from their gardens on the hillside behind his temple, where it will be buried and covered with zeolite. He is also planning to decontaminate the forests with high pressure sprays so the leaves are less of a hazard when they fall in the autumn. His greatest concern is the mental wellbeing of his followers. \"There is a lot of information but huge uncertainty. That makes everyone uneasy. The politicians, bureaucrats and academics cannot agree on anything, so how can people feel reassured? We need positive action, but we don't know what to believe.\" Many locals are farmers, who are despairing about their contaminated soil. \"Young people are leaving. In the past six months, there has been an increase in suicides. There will be more. If you don't give people hope, they lose their reason for living.\" Adding to the problem is a trust deficit. Ministers have admitted holding back vital information in order to prevent a panic. Government spokesmen initially denied there was a meltdown and said the plant's problems posed \"no immediate risk\" to human health. Safety authorities ranked the accident as a mere four on the international scale of nuclear accidents. Not until a month later did it upgrade this to a maximum seven – like Chernobyl. The full details of what happened to the nuclear reactor are still emerging and far from complete. The day after the earthquake, there was an explosion in the No 1 reactor building. Two days later, the No 3 reactor building blew its top. The following morning there were blasts at reactors two and four. These explosions released a plume of radiation, but the government withheld projections of its size and how it spread up and down the coast and inland to Fukushima city, Koriyama and Tokyo. Nuclear and emergency workers were also in the dark. I drive to Iwaki, a coastal city south of the power plant, to interview one of the men involved in the clear-up operation. T-san was evacuated from Fukushima Daiichi plant after the earthquake struck and returned almost two weeks later to join the containment operation. \"They didn't tell us anything,\" says T-san, who has asked to remain anonymous. \"Nobody mentioned a meltdown. We didn't get any critical accident training or instructions. But we all knew the situation was very bad. I thought this might be my final mission. I know it sounds a little silly, but I felt like a kamikaze who was prepared to sacrifice everything for my family and my country.\" Since March, he estimates he has been exposed to 50 millisieverts of radiation. Under the government's previous guidelines, this was the maximum allowed for an entire year. He is not alone. By Tokyo Electric's own figures, 410 workers have, like T-san, been exposed to more than 50 millisieverts since the disaster. Another six have received a dose above 250. But in an emergency move, that became legal in March, the government has increased the permissible dose for nuclear workers from 100 to 250 millisieverts. \"They changed it so suddenly and dramatically that we didn't know what was dangerous, what was safe,\" T-san says. \"We were confused. Had the government been too strict before, or was it suddenly being too lax? We didn't know what to believe.\" It is a common refrain. Since March, the government has relaxed radiation targets for food, nuclear workers, school playgrounds and discharges into the sea. What was considered dangerous a year ago is now deemed safe and legal. Close to 2 million people in Fukushima are living in areas where the annual radiation dose exceeds the one millisievert per year safety target set by the government for the general population. Even in downtown Tokyo – 240km from the reactor – levels have risen close to the point where they would have to be marked with a \"Radiation Hazard\" warning if they were found in a workplace. According to the WHO, the average background radiation people are exposed to worldwide is 2.4 millisieverts per year [see footnote]. A single chest x-ray adds 0.1 millisieverts, a six-hour transatlantic flight 0.5 and a whole-body CT scan 12 millisieverts. However, in these cases, the radiation is predictable, external and relatively easy to deal with. The fallout from Fukushima was far messier and likely to enter human bodies, where radiation does more damage. After the explosions, the radionuclides scattered like the debris from a firework display, according to wind direction and the weight of the particles. Each has a different impact on the body. First and farthest to spread was gas-light iodine 131, which tends to accumulate in the thyroid gland – it was quickly detected as far away as Tokyo. Next came particles of cesium 134 and 137, which affects the bladder and liver with a half-life of about 30 years – this contaminated the soil, water and trees of most of Fukushima as well as chunks of Miyagi, Chiba and Tokyo and remains the biggest problem. Strontium, which tends to accumulate in the bones and causes leukaemia, is spread less widely, but it has been found in 64 locations, including Fukushima city. The heaviest radionuclide, plutonium – with a half-life of tens of thousands of years – has been detected in small quantities inside the plant perimeter and may have been leaked or discharged into the Pacific Ocean along with more than 10,000 tonnes of heavily contaminated water. The overall radiation release from the plant is staggering – 770,000 terabecquerels in the wake of the accident and a billion becquerels still being added each day while engineers struggle to seal the broken containment structure. Most of the iodine – with its eight-day half-life – has since decayed and the cesium and other radionuclides have been diluted and dissipated. But much has seeped into the soil, contaminated the leaves in the forests and is being passed through the food chain to cattle, fish, vegetables – and humans. As more details become apparent, people in Fukushima are trying to work out what dose they have received. They look back at where they were on the peak day of 15 March and calculate how long they were outside, whether it was snowing and what they were wearing. Then they consider what they have eaten and drunk since and whether it was from a safe source. There is not much they can do about it. Full-body scans – promised by the government – will take time. Checking the radiation in every item of food is almost impossible, but one group is trying to help out. The Citizen's Radiation Monitoring Station in Fukushima – which has been set up by the journalist Ryuichi Hirokawa – offers free grocery checks. It is a slow process. Each item must be peeled, ground or grated, bagged and then placed in an LB 200 Becquerel Monitor for 20 minutes. Akiko Sakuma drove from two hours away to test the potatoes in her allotment. \"It's terrifying. I think about the radiation every day,\" she says and shows me a notebook in which she meticulously records the doses to which she is exposed. When it snowed after the explosion on 15 March, the level was over 100 microsieverts per hour – equivalent to 1 x-ray. She said she suffered headaches and nosebleeds. \"I want to run away to Tokyo, but there is no work. I could never understand why people in Chernobyl didn't flee, but now I'm in the same situation.\" Yet it is also not hard to find people who are fatalistic. Several tell me there is a greater risk from stress and upheaval than from the radiation. The divergence of opinion has led to divisions among families, generations and communities. \"Should I stay or should I go?\" is a question that weighs heavy on countless minds. It is why hotels in north-eastern Japan are struggling to attract tourists. It explains the rash of postponed visits by foreign dignitaries to Tokyo. And it is a particular worry for those whose DNA is most vulnerable to change: expectant mothers and young children. Among them is Mari Ishimori, another pregnant evacuee in Tokyo, who is struggling to balance health concerns for her unborn baby and pressure from her in-laws to return to her husband in Fukushima. It is a conservative rural area, but many wives, she said, are now arguing with their husbands. As soon as she heard about the accident at the plant, she fled. \"I love my husband, but I will never return to Fukushima,\" she says over a coffee. \"I want my child to have a normal childhood. But if we are in Fukushima, I will have to say, 'You can't touch the ground or touch the leaves or go in the river.' I want my child to grow up without worrying about that, just as I did. That's hard. I'm not sure if my husband and I will live together again.\" Ishimori has more reason than most to fear radiation. She grew up in Hiroshima, the city that was the target of the world's first atomic bombing. During her childhood, her grandmother and great-grandfather recounted the horrors of the US attack and the fallout that followed. She has seen the prejudice suffered by \"hibakusha\" – nuclear survivors – whose children are sometimes treated as though they bear the contamination in their genes. The discrimination is well documented. Some are refused employment. Others are rejected as marriage partners because of medically unproven fears that their offspring may be born with deformities. But the hibakusha are also revered as survivors and repositories of knowledge about the very real risks or radiation. After the disaster, they were among the first to demand a greater sense of crisis even as the government was offering soothingly ambiguous words about there being \"no immediate health impact\". Due to give birth next month, Ishimori is now alone. She avoids eating fish, meat or eggs, and is deeply sceptical about official safety assurances. \"I don't trust anything they say. Tokyo Electric and the government have told us so many lies.\" Behind much of the anxiety and suspicion is a lack of clear guidance about the health risks. But the fact is that no one is capable of setting a totally safe level of radiation. Masao Tomonaga, the director of (Japan Red Cross) Atomic Bomb Hospital, has been studying the effects of radiation for 40 years. Based on the survivors of the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he has proven that for every rise above 100 millisieverts of radiation exposure, there is a corresponding increase in the likelihood of cancer. It is assumed the same linear pattern applies at lower levels, but the change is too small to measure with accuracy. \"We cannot give people data to prove that five millisieverts is very safe or 10 is very safe. There is no clear evidence,\" Tomonaga says. \"With the atomic bombs, the survivors received a massive dose of radiation over their entire bodies in a short space of time. In Fukushima, people are getting a very small dose every day. This is an important difference.\" Chernobyl offers a closer comparison. The accident in the former Soviet Union left 134 cleanup workers with acute radiation sickness. Twenty-eight died within a year. Millions more were exposed to lower doses and a wide area of Belarus and northern Europe was contaminated. In a follow-up study 20 years later, the WHO concluded the accident caused an additional 4,000 cancer deaths – about 4% higher than the normal rate – among the 626,000 most highly exposed people. For those exposed to lower levels of radiation, it estimated that cancer fatalities would rise by about 0.6%. The organisation also noted Russian studies showing increased risk of heart disease and cataracts, but it found no evidence of an impact on fertility, miscarriages or birth defects. Given that Fukushima has released a tenth of the radiation of Chernobyl and taken greater steps to prevent contamination through milk, this would suggest Japan must brace for hundreds – rather than thousands – of extra cancer cases and births may not be as much of a problem as many believe. That ought to ease the minds of expectant mothers like Masuyama and Ishimori, but they – like many in Japan – are sceptical of official reassurances. They are aware of alternative studies of Chernobyl, which suggest the number of extra cancer cases caused could be 30,000 to 900,000. They know, too, that population densities in Japan are 10 times higher than in Belarus. There are suspicions that politicians put economic cost above public health when they withheld projections about the spread of radiation. In Namie – the worst-affected area outside the exclusion zone with readings 200 times the permissible level – locals have described this as \"murder\". There is also a growing awareness of the influence of the nuclear industry, particularly Tokyo Electric, which is one of the country's biggest advertisers, campaign donors and science graduate employers. Watching the obfuscation by Tokyo Electric and the slow response of the government, some people have become depressed. Others have been radicalised. Ryuichi Hirokawa, a photojournalist, covered Chernobyl and was one of the first reporters independently to measure radiation near the Fukushima nuclear plant after this year's accident. He believes the industry is once again in the process of a cover-up because the investigation into the health impacts of the disaster is being led by academics who, he says, have long served as cheerleaders for the power companies. \"These are the same people who initially said there was no impact from the Chernobyl accident,\" the veteran reporter tells me in his Tokyo office. \"They treat people like guinea pigs. They collect information, but they don't share it with the individuals. There will be no results and no treatment.\" To counter this threat, he's raised money to buy advanced monitoring devices – including ¥3.5m (£28,000) whole-body monitoring devices – that are being used for free at the citizen centres. \"I am worried about the government's health survey,\" he says. \"That is why I have provided these machines. They want as few people to be recognised as radiation victims as possible. We have to fight that with information. That way we can ensure people are better aware of the risks and they can get the medical treatment they need.\" Some see this new questioning of authority as a chance to shift industrial and political baselines for the better. Tetsunari Iida is a former nuclear engineer who has been advocating a shift towards solar, wind and geothermal for more than a decade. His Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies was marginalised until 11 March, but after the meltdown, Iida's call for nuclear power to be phased out has gained traction. Opinion polls suggest 70% of the public support the idea. Iida is now working with Masayoshi Son – the founder of SoftBank and one of the country's most respected entrepreneurs – to generate more funds for clean energy. This week they will launch the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation in which Sun has promised to invest a billion yen. Businessmen, politicians and celebrities are more critical of the nuclear industry, which would once have been career suicide, and the country's top news programme has stopped taking sponsorship from the power company. The shift has been noted in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political heartland. After Chernobyl, the Soviet edifice collapsed within five years. The main parties are calculating how far they must change to avoid a similar fate. Former prime minister Naoto Kan called for an end to the use of nuclear power in Japan – and promptly lost his job. His replacement, Yoshihiko Noda, is far more cautious, suggesting the momentum for change is slowing. Even the Liberal Democratic party – which gets much of its funds from the industry – is promising to reduce the country's reliance on this energy source. But for anyone to do that, they will first have to regain public confidence. I meet the politician charged with rebuilding the disaster area – reconstruction minister Tatsuo Hirano – and ask what needs to be done to restore trust. \"Until now, we have tried to help people who have been directly impacted by the disaster,\" he says, \"but we must also help those who are having to live for the first time with radiation.\" The government has earmarked ¥23 trillion (£181bn) for reconstruction over the next 10 years, but it has yet to calculate the cost of the radiation clear-up. That is partly because the full extent remains unknown. To relieve public anxiety, Hirano – who is from the disaster area – says the government must find out whether it was the earthquake or the tsunami that destroyed the reactor's cooling systems and clear up other remaining mysteries. It has launched a detailed study of the radiation inside the 20km exclusion zone, a long-term programme of health checks for Fukushima residents, and established an expert panel to set definitive radiation standards. A food safety commission recently proposed a new lifetime maximum radiation dose for Japanese citizens of 100 millisieverts, excluding natural background and medical radiation. Ultimately, he would like to see a restructuring of the power industry, including the steady phasing out of Japan's 54 reactors, starting with the oldest first. The nuclear industry is certain to put up a fight, but Hirano predicts voters will insist on change. \"In the next election, politicians will not be elected if they support nuclear expansion in exchange for personal benefit.\" But does Japan have the dynamism to denuclearise, decontaminate and regain confidence? The country has bounced back in the past, but this time it has a shrinking, ageing population, an economy in the doldrums and a putrid political system. A new start will be difficult, but some are already making a move. On my final day in Fukushima, I wake up at 5am on a drizzly morning to see off Masami Takano, who is leaving his home of 30 years and his job as a chef. He wants to leave early as he has a 10-hour drive to Shiga, a mountainous prefecture on the other side of the country, where he plans to make a new life far from the radiation leak. As his mother sobs, he packs his Honda with boxes of clothes, the noodle-making equipment he will use to find a job and a few Lady Gaga CDs for the journey. He has already bid farewell to his friends: \"I told them straight: 'I'm worried about radiation so I'm running away.' Some of them disagree. I understand, it's difficult to leave – I have been here almost all my life – but it's not safe here.\" The government, meanwhile, is urging evacuees to return. Officials insists the area is safe. Radiation levels have fallen in the past two months from 1.2 to 0.7 microsieverts per hour. But there is still concern about food and Takano is taking no chances. \"Moving will be stressful, but at least I won't have to wear a mask or fear that I am being exposed to more radiation every day.\" Over a final cup of coffee, he watches the morning news. The top story reveals that radiation inside the nuclear plant is still at a lethal level of 10 sieverts per hour. This is followed by an item on a nuclear cover-up by Kyushu Electric. \"Nowhere is completely safe,\" Takano says. \"Japan is not a big country, but we have so many reactors. There is a power plant near my new home. I want to tell the local people what a risk they are taking,\" he says. \"My internal organs have been irradiated. That will continue to affect me for many years. So even after I move, the worry won't completely go.\" It is time to leave. He gets into the car and, as his mother and their elderly neighbour Sato-san look on, he motors down the narrow driveway, past the cracks caused by the earthquake. As the car turns out of view, his mother is red-eyed and speechless. Sato-san seems unsure what to say. \"He's gone,\" she starts, then changes the subject to her garden. \"Look at these sunflowers. I planted them to soak up the cesium. I can't believe how big they have grown.\" Before publication, I sent Reiko a draft of this article. Her reply was polite, but I felt she was disappointed. \"Maybe you can find the answer. Maybe it is too much to ask. If so, just forget it. Even though I am much louder than other Japanese, I feel I am lost. My life here requires me to be normalised, to behave like we used to. I have to work, I have to eat. After five months of struggling, I am getting tired of worrying. It is much easier to give up pursuing reality. What bothers me most is being torn in this conflicting situation with no answer, every moment.\" I sympathise immensely but regret that I cannot offer the comfort of clarity. The nuclear disaster has been terrifying, but not as expected. If someone had told me a year ago that three reactors would melt down simultaneously, I would have assumed an apocalypse. Yet Japan today is not like any doomsday I imagined. Instead, there is a kind of slow decay. After three visits to Fukushima, I am less afraid of radiation than I was a year ago but more worried about Japan. • This article was amended on 14 September 2011 to correct a number of errors. References to the amount of radiation a person receives during a chest X-ray were incorrect: the amount is 0.1 millisievert, not 0.1 microsievert. We also incorrectly state that a \"six-hour transatlantic flight adds 0.5 and a whole-body CT scan 12 microsieverts\": that should be millisieverts. In addition we wrongly spelled Masayoshi Son as \"Sun\" and incorrectly referred to the \"Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Disease Hospital\" when it is the (Japan red Cross) Atomic Bomb Hospital. Finally in a sentence comparing the distribution of caesium and strontium radioisotopes we wrongly suggested that strontium is heavier than caesium. However the atomic weight of strontium is 87.62 and that of caesium 132.9."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2012/nov/06/north-wales-abuse-inquries-live-blog","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-11-06T09:01:00Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's statement on new north Wales child abuse inquiries: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/nov/06/north-wales-abuse-inquries-live-blog","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2012/nov/06/north-wales-abuse-inquries-live-blog","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's statement on new north Wales child abuse inquiries: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• Theresa May, the home secretary, has appointed one of Britain's most senior police officers to conduct a thorough investigation into the north Wales child abuse allegations. She said that Keith Bristow, head of the new National Crime Agency, would produce an interim report by April. (See 2.07pm.) • Number 10 has revealed that Mrs Justice Julia Wendy Macur will head the inquiry into whether the Waterhouse inquiry into the north Wales chidl abuse scandal was carried out properly. • Steve Messham, the victim who said last week that a senior Tory was involved in the north Wales child abuse scandal, has said that he is \"fairly optimistic\" that the new inquiry will be conducted properly. Speaking after a meeting with David Jones, the Welsh secretary, Messham said: \"I think the investigation will take a different route this time. I certainly have confidence that they're taking us seriously, of course - we wouldn't be here today if they weren't taking it seriously.\" • Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has renewed her call for a single, all-encompassing inquiry into child abuse. The government also needs to set up a single over-arching inquiry to draw together the confusing myriad of investigations now underway into institutional failures over child abuse and set out clear action that is needed. Currently there are at least 13 different inquiries including 3 BBC inquiries into Jimmy Savile, a Department of Health Investigation into Broadmoor, a CPS inquiry and inquiries into child protection in Rotherham and Rochdale. Yet the Government has no way to draw all this together or to make sure that serious problems are not hidden by the fragmented nature of the investigations. • May has criticised the Tory MP Nadine Dorries for agreeing to take part in the reality TV show I'm a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here in Australia when she could be attending parliament. • David Cameron has said that Britain would be prepared to allow Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, to be given safe passage to a third country. • Kevin Barron, the chairman of the Commons standards and privileges committee, has told MPs that information in its report into Denis MacShane could be used for a police prosecution. The committee was united in its findings that this was the gravest case that had ever come before it ... As we said in the report, the decisions as to whether conduct is criminal and whether proceedings should be brought is one for the police and CPS. If our report raises new material then the police can use it to guide their investigations but receipts, invoices and claims are not privileged and do not become so simply because they are reproduced in a parliamentary report. It is true that the correspondence between the commissioner and those he investigates could not be used in court proceedings without impeaching and questioning proceedings in Parliament. It is our view that would be a breach of Article 9 of the Bill of Rights but in reality that evidence is likely to be inadmissible anyway. • The Department for Work and Pensions has said that more than a third of people claiming incapacity benefit have been assessed as capable of some form of work. • An EU watchdog has failed to give the union's budget a clean bill of health, finding that almost 4% of allocated funds was wasted last year. • The Commons culture committee has published a report saying councils making plans to shut libraries without taking proper account of local needs risk breaking the law. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here's the Guardian video of Theresa May making her child abuse inquiries announcement. Here's an afternoon reading list. • Damian McBride on his blog writes about David Cameron’s new official spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, and why Whitehall needs to widen its recruitment process. JC [Gray] will not be fazed by difficult days, having managed the Treasury press office during tough periods under Alistair Darling and George Osborne. But more importantly, he has two key characteristics that will stand him in good stead: He’s got integrity. When he was working in Gordon Brown’s private office and I was the Treasury’s head of communications, JC told me that he’d struck up a friendship with a journalist and was planning to invite her round for dinner. Was this OK? When I next saw him, he looked like someone had shot his dog. How did the date go? “Well, it was going really well,” he said, “but then she started talking about the pressure she was under at work, having to find out what was happening with council tax revaluation, and asked whether that had crossed my desk…..So I asked her to leave.” You did what?! “Well I was very nice about it, but I said it was best we left it there.” I may be wrong, but that kind of reaction is not the mark of a man who would ever mislead a journalist or deny something he knew to be true. • Isabel Hardman at Coffee House says two sacked ministers were causing trouble at Treasury questions this afternoon. • Cathy Newman at the Telegraph says Nadine Dorries could actually boost her popularity by appearing on I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here. The World at One also carried an interview with Richard Scorer, a solicitor who represented 30 victims at the original north Wales child abuse inquiry. He said that that inquiry had been a thorough one, but that its powers and terms of reference were limited. A further inquiry would probably uncover more abuse, he said. I do not believe that the Waterhouse inquiry was a cover-up. I think it did a thorough job of investigating what it set out investigate, which was the abuse of children in care homes in north Wales. But there are two issues here. One was the terms of reference of the inquiry. It was set up to investigate the abuse of children in care homes. Although it looked at some of the paedophile activity in the immediate community around the Wrexham area, it didn't and it couldn't look at paedophile networks, perhaps even going beyond north Wales. That wasn't what it was primarily set up to do. Secondly, it's important to understand that the inquiry was not a police investigation. It could not arrest people, it could not charge people, it could not interview people under caution. It was reliant to a significant extent on the work that North Wales police had done previously. And by 1996, when the inquiry was set up, you had a complete breakdown of trust between many victims and North Wales police ... [The Waterhouse inquiry] a very thorough job with the evidence that it had. But what we are now talking about are a broader set of issues about broader networks. There are clearly allegations out there and we've seen over the last few weeks with the Savile issues how these kind of issues can come to light many years after the event. That's the nature of child abuse; it is often only many years after the event that things come to light. So I think there's every prospect of a further inquiry finding more information. Ian Lucas, the Labour MP for Wrexham, was talking about the new inquiries into the north Wales abuse scandal on the World at One. He said that evidence that was suppressed at the time needed to be made public. Here's the quote, which I've taken from PoliticsHome. There appears to be a lot of evidence that was given to the Waterhouse inquiry which is not in the public domain. This was an inquiry that was conducted as a public inquiry, individuals came forward for help and gave very difficult evidence about events that had happened to them, and they felt at the end of the inquiry that no suitable action was taken ... There’s a strong sense in Wrexham and in north Wales that evidence has been suppressed; it was suppressed at the time, and has been suppressed ever since. And I think what’s very important [is] if we are to show that we intend to get to the bottom of these matters, what we have to do is to ensure that openness is brought into these matters for the first time, and that the evidence that was given to the Waterhouse inquiry is out there in the open, so that we know what evidence was given at that time, and we need to have explanations of why that evidence was not acted on. Matthew Taylor has been in touch on Twitter to say that he thinks Chris Byrant (see 1.09pm) is missing the point. Here are the main points from the May statement. • May announced that Keith Bristow, the director general of the new National Crime Agency, will conduct an investigation into the north Wales child abuse allegations. He will lead a team of officers from the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and he will produce an initial report by April 2013. There will also be a separate inquiry into whether the Waterhouse inquiry did its job properly, but details of that have not been announced yet. • She said the government would consider the case for a wider, all-encompassing inquiry into child abuse. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said Labour wanted a single, over-arching inquiry. May said that she did not see the case for one now, but that there could be one later. \"If, at the end of the processes that we've set in train it appears that it is necessary to move forward to a wider investigation then we will look at that,\" she said. • May said Britain had \"an appalling and shameful\" record in relation to young people in care. • May urged MPs not to use parliamentary privilege to name the senior Tory who is alleged to be involved in the north Wales abuse scandal. She said naming any suspects could jeopardise any future prosecution. • Tom Watson, the Labour party's deputy chair, accused May of being engaged in a \"cover-up\". He made the point in a question to May. The lesson of Hillsborough and hacking is that a narrow-down investigation is the basic building block of a cover-up. To limit this inquiry to north Wales and Savile would in my view be a dereliction of the home secretary's duty. It would guarantee that many sickening crimes will remain uninvestigated and some of the most despicable paedophiles will remain protected by the establishment that has shielded them for 30 years. Watson said the new inquiry should follow any lead it finds. Whether you were raped or tortured as a child in Wales or in Whitehall you are entitled to be heard. The media may be transfixed by the spectre of a paedophile cabinet minster abusing children, but what actually matters is that thousands and thousand of children, whose lives have been ground into nothing, who prefer to kill themselves than carry on, who have nowhere to turn, to whom nobody listens, whom nobody helps. Does [May] sincerely want to start making amends or can she live with being what she’s just announced – the next stage of a cover-up. • Labour MP Susan Jones demanded an assurance than any member of the House of Lords found guilty of abuse would be stripped of his peerage. In the Welsh assembly Carwyn Jones says he can see the case for a single, wide-ranging inquiry into child abuse. There is some evidence that there's a connection between abuse in different parts of the UK, \"and beyond\", he says. He says he will take this up with the UK government. Leanne Wood, the Plaid Cymru leader, is speaking now in the Welsh assembly. She says action was never taken against the 28 perpetrators exposed in the Waterhouse inquiry. Carwyn Jones says that Theresa May has announced a new inquiry. But he says it would be wrong to have a number of competing inquiries. He says he regrets the way Wood suggested this morning that the government was \"standing in the way of an inquiry\". Kirsty Williams, the Lib Dem leader in the Welsh assembly, says she backs the approach Jones has taken in relation to the north Wales child abuse scandal. In the Welsh assembly Andrew Davies, the Conservative leader, is asking about the child abuse scandal. He says Carwyn Jones put out a statement yesterday saying he was meeting the Keith Towler, children's commissioner for Wales. Has Jones discussed this with the children's commissioner before? Carwyn Jones says he is meeting the commissioner this afternoon. Jones is aware of what May said. Some issues relating to this are devolved, some are not. He says he will issue a fresh statement after his meeting with Towler. The statement is now over. I'll post a summary in a moment. And I will be keeping an eye on the Welsh assembly, where Carwyn Jones is expected to be asked about the north Wales abuse scandal during questions. Labour's Stephen McCabe asks if Keith Bristow, the new director general of the National Crime Agency, will be able to give the investigation the full attention it deserves. May says she is confident that he will be able to do so. This is an example of exactly what the new National Crime Agency should be doing, she says. Labour's Susan Jones asks May if any member of the House of Lords found to be an abuser will be stripped of his peerage. May says she wants perpetrators to be brought to justice. Labour's Nick Smith asks about the terms of reference for the person who will consider whether the Waterhouse inquiry did its job. May says these terms of reference are still being discussed, including with the opposition. Labour's Madeleine Moon says that, as a former child protection officer working in Wales, she welcomes the investigation. But why are children sill placed in care away from their family and friends? We are failing generations of children by placing them far away from their families, she says. May says this is a wider issue. Sadly Britain has \"an appalling and shameful\" record in relation to how it has dealt with young people in care. Labour's Paul Flynn says evidence available to the Waterhouse inquiry at the time was suppressed by powerful people. May says the police will look at this historic evidence. Labour's Yasmin Qureshi says that, as a former prosecutor, she knows that sexual abuse is commonplace. The government needs to consider what can be done to protect young people. Abuse takes place within the home and within the family too, she says. Labour's Geraint Davies asks if those care workers accused of child abuse in north Wales but not found guilty were redeployed in the system. May says the inquiry will look at this. Good point from Labour's Chris Bryant. Mark Durkan, the SDLP MP, asks May if the security services are being asked to review whether they have any evidence of abuse. May says the police inquiry will have to consider whatever avenues it considers necessary. Ian Lucas, the Labour MP for Wrexham, says the victims of the north Wales child abuse scandal feel that they were ignored last time. May says the new police investigation will consider the allegations properly. Graham Stuart, a Conservative, says the education committee, which he chairs, will publish a report on child protection tomorrow. Robert Wilson, a Conservative, says all evidence acquired by Newsnight and others should be handed to the police. He says some people have been unfairly libelled on the internet in recent days. May says she thinks the entire Commons was happy with the terms of reference of the Waterhouse inquiry at the time it was set up. Labour's Tom Watson says that the lesson from Hillsborough and hacking is that a narrow-down inquiry is a recipe for a cover-up. He says some paedophiles could remain protected by the establishment if the inquiry is now widened. The police should have the support of child protection experts. He talks about children being abused \"from Wales to Whitehall\" and says the media are transfixed with the prospect of \"a cabinet minister abusing children\". All abuse should be investigated, he says. He says that what May has announced amounts to \"the next stage of a cover-up\". Some MPs protest at this point. May says the police will be able to pursue any investigations \"without fear or favour\", going wherever the evidence takes them. (Watson has set out his case in more detail in a letter to David Cameron that he has posted on his blog.) Sir Edward Garnier, the former solicitor general, says the police investigation into the fresh allegations should take priority. He says they should establish whether the suspects are innocent or guilty. Here is the full text of what May had to say about the fresh inquiries she has ordered. I can tell the House that Mark Polin, the Chief Constable of North Wales Police, has invited Keith Bristow, the Director General of the National Crime Agency, to assess the allegations recently received, to review the historic police investigations and investigate any fresh allegations reported to the police into the alleged historic abuse in North Wales care homes. He will lead a team of officers from the Serious and Organised Crime Agency, other investigative assets as necessary, and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre, who will act as the single point of contact for fresh referrals relating to historic abuse in North Wales care homes. He will produce an initial report reviewing the historic investigations and any fresh allegations by April 2013. I have made clear to Mark Polin and Keith Bristow that the Home Office is ready to assist with the additional costs of this work. In addition, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, the Government will also ask a senior independent figure to lead an urgent investigation into whether the Waterhouse Inquiry was properly constituted and did its job. Given the seriousness of the allegations, we will make sure that this work is completed urgently. Labour's Paul Murphy says he was Welsh secretary when the Waterhouse report was published. He says the fresh allegations must be investigated. Tim Loughton, the former children's minister, says that when the Jimmy Savile affair emerged, he said it was \"the tip of the iceberg\". Loughton says it is time of an over-reaching inquiry. All institutions involved with children should have a robust child protection strategy, he says. May says Loughton has a \"worthy record\" on this issue. Theresa May is responding to Cooper. She says she wants the new police inquiry to follow the evidence wherever it goes. If, at the end of that process, there is a case for a wider, general inquiry, then the government will consider it. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is responding to May now. She says that there has to be a proper investigation, that MPs have to know whether there was a cover up and that safeguards need to be in place. But she says she is concerned that the government's response is not wide enough to take in concerns raised by the Jimmy Savile affair. Will the new inquiry be able to range beyond Wales? She says there are numerous inquiries now underway covering child abuse. Labour wants a single inquiry. The multiple inquiries will not be able to draw together the common threads, she says. Too often victims of sexual abuse are not believed, she says. She points to the grooming cases in Rochdale. Cooper urges May to look again at the case for a single, over-arching inquiry. Theresa May, the home secretary, says north Wales police started an investigation into child abuse in north Wales in 1991. This resulted in eight prosecutions and seven convictions. But there were suspicions the abuse went much wider. A report into this was not published because parts were defamatory. In 1996 William Hague, then Welsh secretary, invited Sir Ronald Waterhouse to conduct an inquiry. Waterhouse heard from more than 600 people. Some 80 people were named as abusers. The report was published in 2000. Afterwards some 140 compensation claims were settled. But the report found no evidence of a paedophile ring. On Friday Steve Messham said the inquiry did not consider abuse outside the care homes. And he made allegations about an individual. May says Keith Bristow, director general of the National Crime Agency, will review the allegations, as well as looking at the historic claims and any new claims made. He will report by April next year. The Home Office will give him the resources he needs. May says that if MPs use parliamentary privilege to name any suspects, they could jeopardise a future trial. She says the goverment will do everything it can to support victims of abuse. Theresa May, the home secretary, is about to make a statement about the new north Wales child abuse inquiries. These have been prompted by the claim made on Newsnight on Friday by Steve Messham, one of the victims, that a senior Tory was involved in the abuse and that there was a cover-up. Messham's allegations about the Tory were considered by the original inquiry (the Waterhouse inquiry) but they did not result in a prosecution. May had trouble on the Today programme explaining why a new inquiry was necessary. The answer, of course, is that in the light of Hillsborough and Jimmy Savile, people are far more willing to believe in the possibility of a police investigation failing and an establishment child abuse cover-up than they were when the Waterhouse report was published 12 years ago. • Theresa May, the home secretary, has defended the government's decision to order two fresh inquiries into the north Wales child abuse scandal. She will make a full statement about this to the Commons at 12.30pm, but on the Today programme she said that child abuse allegations were so serious that it was right to consider whether the Waterhouse inquiry did its job properly. However, as Nick Robinson pointed out on Twitter, she had difficulty explaining why a new inquiry was needed into allegations about a senior Tory being involved in abuse which were aired at the time of the original inquiry. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first secretary, is also preparing to take questions on this at 1.30pm. • The Conservative MP Nadine Dorries has been criticised for agreeing to spend up to a month in Australia taking part in I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here. One of the unofficial posts in British public life is parliamentary plonker, the one MP who, by common consent, has lost all right to be taken seriously. The post used to be held by Lembit Opik, before he lost what was a relatively safe Lib Dem seat in the 2010 election because his constituents decided he was an embarrassment. And today I can regretfully announce that the new office-holder is Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire. I say \"regretfully\" because I don't really do spite on this blog and because Dorries, a former nurse, is the kind of articulate, working-class Tory who is under-represented in parliament. But how else can you respond to the news that she is galivanting off to Australia to take part in I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here? As Hélène Mulholland reports in the Guardian story about this, the Conservative party is at a loss for words; it has not issued a comment. But Twitter is ablaze. Here are some of the comments. From the Daily Mail's James Chapman: From Labour's Chris Bryant: From the Daily Express's Patrick O'Flynn: From the FT's Janan Ganesh: From the Sunday Mirror's Vincent Moss: From Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chief whip: According to No 10, David Cameron was also asked about Dorries in an interview in the Middle East. The interview is being released later. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here's the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, here's the ConservativeHome round-up of today's political stories and here is the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles. And here are some stories and articles that I found particularly interesting. • James Lyons in the Daily Mirror says David Cameron did not hand over any of his text messages or emails to the Leveson inquiry. The story implies that the messages released by the inquiry between Cameron and Rebekah Brooks came from News International, not Downing Street. David Cameron has not handed over a single text message or email to the Leveson Inquiry, a No10 insider has revealed. It has fuelled claims of a cover-up and piled pressure on the PM to reveal all about his exchanges with ex-Sun editor Rebekah Brooks. Politicians of all parties now want him to publish the cache – said to run to at least 130 texts and emails. • James Chapman in the Daily Mail says the Treasury is considering limiting child benefit to just two children. The proposal goes further than Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith’s suggestion that workless families could have child benefit and child tax credits limited if they insist on having more than two children. Instead, child benefit could be paid to all families, whether in work or not, for the first two offspring but not for subsequent children. Ministers say benefit would not be removed from existing families, so could only apply in the future. The reform would be far simpler to administrate than a complicated means-tested removal of benefit from lower income households. Paull Goodman at ConservativeHome says this could make the tax and benefit system \"the least family-friendly in Europe\". • Colin Robertson and Tom Newton Dunn in the Sun says the Tory MP Nadine Dorries is going to take part in I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here. The £65,738-a-year MP, who dubbed the PM and Chancellor George Osborne “arrogant posh boys”, will spend the best part of a MONTH in the Aussie jungle. And a show insider said: “I’m sure David Cameron will keep a close eye on what she has to say in there.” Sources say the Mid Bedfordshire MP will be paid “a maximum of £40,000”. She will be the first serving MP on the ITV1 show, which starts on Sunday. • Sarah Neville in the Financial Times (subscription) says Francis Maude will tell a conference today that the government could save £1.2bn over the next three years by moving government services online. Addressing the Financial Times Innovate conference in London, the cabinet office minister will unveil a government digital strategy intended to make it easier for people to pay their car tax, book driving tests, complete tax returns or apply for the state pension online. He will say that the government handles more than one billion different transactions each year through 650 different services, but in only a few cases do a large majority of people opt for the online option. “Half don’t offer a digital option at all and apart from a handful of services, if there is a digital option, few people use it because it’s not a sufficiently fast or convenient option,” Mr Maude will say. • Jill Sherman in the Times (paywall) says up to £45bn from pension funds could be used to fund infrastructure projects. Up to £45 billion is to be raided from local authority pension funds to build houses, bridges and roads. Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, will unveil proposals today to let councils invest a third of their pension funds on infrastructure projects. It follows criticism from Lord Heseltine that the Treasury is not making enough use of pension funds to help the construction industry and create jobs. But unions have warned against investing members’ pension savings into “dodgy projects” that can offer poor returns. Several of the private finance initiatives cost tens of millions of pounds more than expected. • Benedict Brogan in the Telegraph says the Lib Dems’ determination to block the proposed parliamentary boundary changes could bring down the coalition. Who cares about a spat over some obscure bit of Lords legislation? Except that what Mr Clegg added, perhaps as a little “by the way” when he and Mr Cameron had a brief word last Tuesday, is that it won’t end in the Lords: he and all his ministers and backbenchers will vote with Labour when the legislation returns to the Commons. In other words, Mr Clegg will lead his party against the Government – against his own Bill – precipitating its near-certain defeat ... The effect, I fear, could be far more serious. If Mr Clegg’s plan goes through, any pretence of collegiality between Tories and Lib Dems will end. Party discipline will collapse. Mr Cameron will be powerless to sanction his own rebels when the Lib Dems are allowed to defeat the Government – and Labour will look for other ways to tempt them across the floor. • Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says very few Tories want Mitt Romney to win the US presidential election. It’s remarkable how many senior Tories are privately hoping that Barack Obama will win. Brooks Newmark, the Harvard-educated Conservative MP, who attended the Republican Convention earlier this year, says: “I’m one of the only Tories rooting for Mitt Romney; it’s almost like we’re a secret society. The general sense in the tea room is that the majority of my colleagues would prefer Obama. They feel more comfortable with him.” Yesterday the prime minister's spokesman had a rough time from journalists at the lobby briefing when trying to explain why David Cameron had not held a general, all-purpose press conference at No 10 for more than a year. The spokesman ended up claiming that all was fine because we can always get on a train and go to Brussels, where Cameron normally does hold a press conference after European Council meetings. We were surprised to learn that a Conservative administration has now outsourced prime ministerial accountability to the EU. Today, to make amends, No 10 is making a point of showing that Cameron does talk to journalists (as long as they can afford a ticket to Abu Dhabi). David Cameron has been speaking to the BBC about his decision to promote the sale of Typhoon jets while he's in the Middle East. This is what he said. I've taken the quotes from PolitcsHome. [The United Arab Emirates] stood with us and fought with us in the Libya campaign to help bring freedom to that country from the tyranny of Colonel Gaddafi. Even today, Emirati soldiers and British soldiers are serving together in Afghanistan. The security of the United Arab Emirates is in Britain’s interest and so we are partners, as I’ve said, for prosperity and also for security. But another point I think that needs to be made perhaps more generally when we discuss this whole issue of the defence industry and arms sales, every country in the world in my view has a right to self defence. You cannot expect every country in the world to produce every tank, every ship, every plane that is necessary for that self defence. As a result, some form of defence sales internationally are inevitable. Britain has a very strong defence industry based on centuries of endeavour, and so it’s right that there is a properly regulated arms and defence international business. Mark Lewis, a lawyer who represented 15 victims at the original north Wales child abuse inquiry, told ITV's Daybreak that he thought the police did not follow up the allegations raised at the original inquiry properly. I think one of the problems and one of the challenges that comes out of the Waterhouse inquiry, this north Wales child abuse inquiry that took place back in 1997, is the fact that there was no substantive follow-up by the police and that is a key issue. There were 28 people who were named in the inquiry but were not publicly reported. Now the reason for that, and there is a good reason, was that Sir Ronald Waterhouse, the judge who ran the inquiry, did not want to prejudice any upcoming trial. Of course the problem then is that there was no substantive follow-through and of course that's the really important issue here. We needed to have the follow-through and the people who are making the complaints today were making the complaints back in 1997 and before. Lewis also said that he thought Waterhouse interpreted his terms of reference too narrowly. There had been a series of investigations none of which had really got to the bottom of it and he looked at his terms of reference rather too narrowly in my judgment and as a result some of the stories that we have heard over the last couple of days were effectively suppressed from coming out. In the Guardian today John Harris has an article saying the the police commissioner elections will be meaningless because voters have not been given the information about candidates that would allow them to make a meaningful choice. John says he's going to spoil his ballot paper. On the Today programme Theresa May, the home secretary, was asked if the police commissioners would have a real mandate if they were elected on a turnout as low as 10% or 15%. She insisted that they would. I never set a turnout threshold for any election and I'm not going to do it now. What I do know is the people who are elected as police and crime commissioners will have something that the current police authorities do not have. For the first time ever, they will have a democratic mandate for the people for the work they're doing. For the record, here are today's YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 44% (up 2 from YouGov in the Sunday Times) Conservatives: 35% (no change) Lib Dems: 8% (down 1) Ukip: 7% (no change) Labour lead: 9 points (up 2) Government approval: -32 (down 4) David Jones, the Welsh secretary, is meeting Steve Messham, the child abuse victim who is alleging that a senior Tory was involved, at 2.30pm today, according to Sky. But Channel 4's Michael Crick is sceptical about whether the unnamed Tory really was involved. Here's the Guardian report about what Messham told Newsnight last week. David Cameron is not just flogging arms on his Middle East tour. According to the story the Press Association filed overnight, he's also trying to drum up interest in wind farms. Here's the PA copy. David Cameron will push for massive new Middle Eastern investment in Britain's energy production today - including cash for windfarms as he continues a trade and diplomacy mission in the Gulf states. The prime minister will meet the heads of three of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the United Arab Emirates as he bids to persuade them to make further major investment in renewables, nuclear and North Sea oil. It is the premier's latest attempt to secure a share of some of the £440 billion-plus cash surplus held by the oil-rich state to boost Britain's ailing economy after yesterday pushing sales of military fighter jets and meeting business leaders engaged in joint working with the UAE. A week after the coalition was hit by a public split between ministers over whether to continue building turbines in the countryside, Cameron will put the focus firmly on the potential for reaping the winds off Britain's coastline. Among those involved in a breakfast meeting to discuss potential future deals is Masdar, which contributed almost £500 million to the giant 175-turbine £1.7 billion London Array wind farm off the coast of Essex and Kent which came on stream last month and is due to power 47,000 UK homes. He will also discuss with the Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) a tax break announced by chancellor George Osborne to encourage firms to seek to exploit older and deeper oil fields using new techniques. And the talks will include the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, (ENEC) which is considering investment in plans for a new generation of nuclear plants boosted by Hitachi taking on the £700 million Horizon deal last week ... In an interview with The National newspaper in the Emirates he said: \"Emirati investment in the UK across a range of sectors - including real estate, banking, sport and infrastructure - is vital to our economy back in Britain. So we will continue to do all we can to make the UK an attractive and accessible investment destination\". Cameron will move on to Saudi Arabia later today where he is due to hold talks with King Abdullah and other senior figures on issues such as Iran, Syria and anti-terrorism work. But the latest leg of his three-day tour is bound to be dogged again by controversy over his push for trade - including arms deals - with countries which have faced criticism for their human rights records. Yesterday David Cameron announced two new inquiries into the north Wales child abuse scandal. There are allegations that a senior Tory was involved and that the original Waterhouse inquiry amounted to a cover-up and, in the light of the Jimmy Savile affair, ministers are determined to be seen to be taking child abuse allegations seriously. Theresa May, the home secretary, will be giving more details about the new inquiries in a Commons statement at 12.30pm and, on the Today programme, she said the government was right not to ignore the new claims being made, particularly those raised on Newsnight on Friday. I've taken the quote from PoliticsHome. These are hugely serious allegations that have been made – child abuse is appalling and shocking. An individual has come forward, allegations have been made. I think it is entirely right and proper for the government to say we should look to make sure that the work that was done in relation to the Waterhouse inquiry did cover everything that it should have needed to cover and that that review was as appropriate as it should have been. I really do think that in the face of these issues, which are, as I say, hugely shocking in relation to child abuse, that we do need to go back and say ‘actually let’s have a review of that inquiry to make sure that it did do the job that it was supposed to do’. I’ll be covering her statement in detail. Here’s the full agenda for the day. 9.30am: John Griffith-Jones, the chairman designate of the Financial Conduct Authority, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 10.30am: John Hayes, the energy minister, gives evidence to the Commons energy committee about nuclear power. 11am: Theresa May, the home secretary, is interviewed on This Morning. 11.30am: Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, will take Treasury questions in the Commons. George Osborne will miss it because he’s away, and so Ed Balls will sit it out too. 12.30pm: Theresa May makes a statement in the Commons about the new North Wales child abuse inquiries. 1.30pm: Carwyn Jones, the Welsh first minister, takes questions in the Welsh assembly.

He is credited with boosting the status of alternative energy, both at home and abroad, thanks to his visionary zeal. Nicknamed the \"solar king\", the \"sun god\" and the \"solar pope\", or – for those who were not complimentary about his environmental goals – the \"Stalin of renewables\", in 2000 Scheer succeeded in introducing the feed-in tariff, otherwise known as Scheer's law, by which individuals and businesses that generate power through renewable energies are able to sell it back to the grid at above-market prices, thus encouraging the spread of wind, solar and hydro power. The system has been adopted around the world and has contributed to the respect now given to renewable energy, not least because it has encouraged individual participation. A man of considerable energy himself, and also of great impatience, Scheer founded the International Renewable Energy Agency and was president of Eurosolar, the European Association for Renewable Energy. A member of the Social Democratic party (SPD) since 1965, Scheer took part in the student movements of the late 60s, and became a member of the Bundestag in 1980, representing the SPD in the state of Baden-Württemberg. He played a key role in introducing the country's solar-roof programmes and was the author of the renewable energy law. He was a member of the SPD's federal steering committee between 1993 and 2009, and belonged firmly to the leftwing of the party. In 1998 he received the World Solar prize for his contribution towards improving the environment and, in 1999, he was the recipient of the Alternative Nobel prize, while the US magazine Time awarded him the title \"hero for the green century\". the prolific author and publisher on energy matters was to have presented his latest book, Der Energethische Imperativ, subtitled 100% Now: How the Complete Switch to Renewable Energies Can Be Realised. It sums up his passionate conviction that it was technically and economically feasible for renewable energy to fully replace fossil and nuclear energy within just a few years, if the political will existed. He saw political intransigence as the biggest barrier to achieving this. He was frustrated by the energy politics of Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who recently called for an extension to the lives of the country's nuclear power stations, describing atomic energy as a vital \"bridging technology\". She insisted it would help pave the way for renewables in the long term, whereas Scheer, whose own party had fought for and secured a nuclear phase-out while in government, saw it as cowardly kowtowing to what he described as an all-too-powerful energy industry. Scheer was never afraid of voicing his views. He often clashed with fellow party members, particularly the erstwhile SPD party leader and former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder, over his decision in the late 90s to back Nato's intervention in Kosovo, which he called a \"war crime\", to which Schröder responded that he no longer belonged in his party. But his position in the Baden-Württemberg SPD was so solid that his future there was never called into question. Scheer was born in Wehrheim, in the western German state of Hesse, and grew up in Berlin. A brilliant swimmer, he was a member of the national youth pentathlon team, and later the national pentathlon team. Following his Abitur (A-level equivalent), he volunteered for the Bundeswehr, or military. He went on to study politics, economics and social sciences at Heidelberg University and later graduated as a doctor of political science from Berlin's Free University. In 1988 Scheer's views began to gain respect when he founded the non-profit Eurosolar, whose goal was to completely replace atomic and fossil energy with renewables. In the mid-90s he succeeded in persuading the rest of the SPD to include in its manifesto the pledge to install solar panels on no fewer than 100,000 German roofs. That initiative contributed to the groundbreaking decision by the SPD-Green coalition government that came to power in 1999 to put 1bn marks into a solar programme. In recent weeks he was an active participant in demonstrations against the controversial Stuttgart 21 railway reconstruction project, for which he was pushing for a referendum. A true architect of the renewable-energy age, he lived as he preached, powering his home with a windmill. He never withered under the criticism that his ideas were utopian, and for the past decade was able to enjoy the fact that his views were being taken seriously. The words of Mahatma Gandhi – \"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win\"– are a fitting introduction to his new book. He is survived by Irm Pontenagel, whom he married in 1970, their daughter, Nina, and his granddaughter, Lilli. • Hermann Scheer, politician, environmentalist and author, born 29 April 1944; died 14 October 2010"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2010/dec/13/uk-energy-efficiency-green-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-13T08:00:11Z","webTitle":"UK must shake off the dominance of the energy giants | Catherine Mitchell","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/dec/13/uk-energy-efficiency-green-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2010/dec/13/uk-energy-efficiency-green-deal","fields":{"headline":"UK must shake off the dominance of the energy giants","bodyText":"After more than 25 years working on energy issues, I have recently come to an extraordinary personal realisation: there is very little need to have heating bills at all. Since refurbishing my coastguard's cottage in July, I have – to my total surprise – been able to more or less rely on solar heating for warm water and a wood burning stove, occasionally, for heating. Now, my house faces south and I have triple-glazed windows, van loads of insulation under my floors and in my roof, cavity wall insulation and passive lighting. I know not every home can be like this, but I've cut my energy use by 80-90%, which is the sort of ambition needed nationally if the UK is to meet the carbon emission cuts set in its climate change law, and it is comfortable, warm and dry. This week, the government is expected to publish proposals for what it says must be a revolution in the electricity supply market, to boost the UK's tiny levels of renewable energy. It follows last week's \"green deal\" bill, which aims to banish the upfront cost and hassle of refurbishing the UK's leaky homes. The government is right that our business-as-usual energy policy – one of the most liberal energy markets in the world – has to be abandoned. Sadly, the proposed electricity market reforms and the green deal do not include anything that will move the UK forward in anything other than an incremental manner. At the heart of the problem is a seasonally appropriate difficulty: asking turkeys to vote for Christmas. It is simply not in the interests of the handful of dominant energy companies and their shareholders to dramatically transform the energy system, whether on the supply or demand side. In particular, an increase in the energy efficiency of buildings will undermine a company's future sales and profits. Only when the government confronts head-on the interests in maintaining the system largely as it is, will the energy system change. Energy companies sell energy or services and have to comply with various rules and incentives. The rules and incentives are being tweaked so that energy companies can make more money from low-carbon energy supply and reducing energy demand. But reducing the UK's greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030 means developing a completely different energy system. Energy companies doing what they can within the current energy system is not nearly enough. The issues of supply, demand and energy transmission are highly complex. For example, building new low-carbon power plants, such as offshore wind farms, nuclear power stations and clean coal plants, is laden with many billions of pounds of upfront cost. It is hard for the big energy companies to raise this capital, given that the payback, via customer bills, is over decades. But cutting total energy demand makes it all far simpler. If less energy is used, then fewer capital-intensive plants need to be built. This in turn leads to less need for new transmission cables and connectors. Thus, a central policy should be to reduce energy demand. In theory, it already is: the practice is very different. A typical energy policy argument is that an energy company has to move from selling energy units to providing services. In this way, it is argued, the loss they take from reduced energy sales can be made up through new profits or new services. But, thinking of my cottage, this simply is not the case. I paid for my energy-efficient house upfront. I don't need any services and my bills are now minute. From the perspective of an energy company which makes most of its money from supplying energy, installing the equivalent energy-efficiency measures I had in my house into another house will effectively get rid of a customer. But this is what is required. The current key executors of government energy policy, including energy-efficiency programmes, are the energy supply companies. I simply don't believe, however responsible they are, that they are able to implement serious energy-efficient programmes. They have not done so in the past, despite many policy initiatives, and the new green deal does not force them to make more than incremental improvements. In parallel, the consultation on electricity market reform is a missed opportunity. Various ideas have been put forward, but these again are about incremental change to the same system. The proposed market reforms leave market and network rules and incentives more or less the same, thereby enabling energy companies to largely continue what they are currently doing if they want to. Additional proposals, for example for long-term contracts for low-carbon energy and carbon floor prices, are all major sticking plasters on the current market design rather than changing the energy market to deliver a new type of energy system. So what's the answer? We need regulated obligations on the scale of the transition from town gas to natural gas. Tendering for street-by-street or area-by-area contracts to make homes energy efficient is cost effective, but crucially creates a mechanism for new companies to enter the market, thereby potentially diluting the dominance of the current energy companies. Can it work? I lived in Brixton during the riots of the 1980s and the subsequent Scarman Report identified poor housing as an important factor. It recommended creating Aim areas (Areas for Improvement and Modernisation), which were subsequently put in place by the Greater London Council. Result? Areas of Brixton were systematically brought up to a decent standard. No one is saying that transforming how we generate and use electricity as we move to a sustainable future is easy. However, government policy which ignores the reality of economic interests, thereby tacitly accepting that energy companies will not try too hard to reduce energy consumption, betrays a government which continues to hope against hope that it doesn't have to make any difficult decisions which upset anyone. Not only is this a sad cop out, but if it confronted economic interests, particularly on the demand side, then it would find the supply side and security questions would become a lot easier and cheaper to solve. • Catherine Mitchell is professor of energy policy at the University of Exeter. • The photograph on this article was changed on 17 December 2010 to comply with current health and safety regulations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2009/jan/14/obama-white-house-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-14T14:07:14Z","webTitle":"Michael Tomasky: Chu, one to watch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2009/jan/14/obama-white-house-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2009/jan/14/obama-white-house-energy","fields":{"headline":"Chu: one to watch","bodyText":"Hillary took up the media oxygen yesterday, but let's take a moment to note Steven Chu's confirmation hearing for energy secretary.

It's main job is to oversee nuclear storage and facilities. I don't know why. That will change a little under Chu, who's gung-ho to be involved in directing policy making. And yesterday he clearly signaled one direction he wants to pursue: In multiple answers, he sketched a plan for accelerated nuclear energy development, including improving a department loan program for new reactors and developing a long-range plan for dealing with nuclear waste. I've believed some time that we have little choice but to expand our use of nuclear power. All things considered, it's a cleaner and safer technology for electricity production than coal. Until, of course, the day that it isn't. Expect an uptick in rentals of The China Syndrome. I would be remiss not to say that Chu is keen on renewables, but the issue there is transmission, i.e., delivering electricity generated by renewables to consumer markets.

Speaking to reporters in Seoul, Stephen Bosworth said evidence the North had built an ultramodern enrichment plant was \"the latest in a series of provocative moves ... it is a very difficult problem we have been struggling to deal with for 20 years\". \"This is not a crisis, we are not surprised. We have been watching and analysing [North Korea's] aspirations to produce uranium, [but] it is not helpful to jointly agreed goals we have subscribed to in terms of peace, prosperity and stability in the Korean peninsula and north-east Asia.\" Bosworth arrived in the region after a US scientist, Siegfried Hecker, said the government in Pyongyang had shown him a \"stunning\" new uranium enrichment plant at the country's main nuclear complex at Yongbyon this month. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mike Mullen, said it provided further evidence of North Korea's increasingly belligerent behaviour. \"From my perspective, it's North Korea continuing on a path which is destabilising for the region. It confirms or validates the concern we've had for years about their enriching uranium, which they've denied routinely,\" said Mullen. \"They are a country that routinely we are unable to believe that they would do what they say.\" Hecker's revelations are expected to prompt a rethink over Washington's policy towards Pyongyang given the failure of sanctions to curb its nuclear ambitions. Mullen said China – the North's main ally and biggest aid provider – had a pivotal role to play. \"We've been engaged with China for an extended period of time with respect to North Korea ... a great part of this, I think, will have to be done through Beijing,\" he said on ABC's This Week. \"I've been worried about North Korea and its potential nuclear capability for a long time. This certainly gives that potential real life, very visible life that we all ought to be very, very focused on.\" The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, said he doubted North Korean claims that the facility is part of a peaceful nuclear energy programme. \"I don't credit that at all,\" Gates told reporters in Bolivia, where he is attending a regional defence conference. He said the facility could enable North Korea to build \"a number\" of nuclear devices. Hecker, a Stanford University professor who was shown around the enrichment plant, said it contained an \"astonishingly modern control room\" overlooking 2,000 centrifuges. \"These facilities appear to be designed primarily for civilian nuclear power, not to boost North Korea's military capability,\" Hecker wrote in a report on his visit. But he added: \"Nevertheless, the uranium enrichment facilities could be readily converted to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU) bomb fuel (or parallel facilities could exist elsewhere).\" Despite North Korea's claims that the facility is designed to produce electricity, the news will trigger suspicions that it is seeking to bolster its weapons capability and gain the upper hand in nuclear talks, as it reels from US and UN sanctions. The North Koreans have created and tested nuclear bombs made from plutonium. The enrichment of uranium represents another potential route to make a bomb. Plutonium and uranium can also be used to make much more powerful thermo-nuclear warheads. Bosworth will go on to Beijing and Tokyo to continue discussions on a collective response to the revelations. Six-nation talks over North Korea's nuclear programme – between the two Koreas, the US, Japan, Russia and hosted by China – have stalled, and some observers speculated that the Pyongyang regime gave Hecker and other scientists access in the hope of strengthening its position at any future multiparty nuclear talks. Washington has refused to consider North Korea's request to restart six-party negotiations in Beijing until the regime honours previous commitments to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea is known to have enough fissile material from its plutonium-based programme to make six to 12 nuclear bombs, but has not proved it has a working nuclear weapon. Hecker, a former director of the Los Alamos national laboratory, said the new facility appeared to have been built within a year, in the gutted shell of an old fuel fabrication plant at Yongbyon. The nuclear scientist said: \"The first look through the windows of the observation deck into the two long high-bay areas was stunning. Instead of seeing a few small cascades of centrifuges, which I believed to exist in North Korea, we saw a modern, clean centrifuge plant of more than 1,000 centrifuges, all neatly aligned and plumbed below us.\" He said the facility \"would fit into any modern American processing facility\". Although he could not verify claims by his hosts that they had put 2,000 centrifuges into operation, he confirmed he saw at least 1,000. Hecker, who was not permitted to photograph the facility, passed on his findings to the White House several days ago, according to media reports. He predicted they would cause \"a political firestorm\". The news is the latest in a series of recent blows to Barack Obama's attempts to keep alive his vision for global nuclear disarmament. The speed with which the plant appears to have been built and its sophistication suggest outside help, at least in acquiring parts. Washington is expected to exploit Hecker's report to prove that the regime has continued to develop nuclear weapons, despite UN sanctions. Pyongyang has endured widespread condemnation and punitive measures since conducting nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. Hecker said: \"It is clear that waiting patiently for Pyongyang to return to the six-party talks on terms acceptable to the United States and its allies will exacerbate the problem ... The only hope appears to be engagement.\" Pyongyang has carried out two nuclear bomb tests. There have been reports that it may be preparing for a third in north Hamgyong province, where it held its second test in May last year, and where tunnelling work has been spotted recently."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2010/nov/07/bright-idea-light-bulbs-data","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2010-11-07T00:06:10Z","webTitle":"My bright idea: Light bulbs can be used to transmit data | Discover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/nov/07/bright-idea-light-bulbs-data","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2010/nov/07/bright-idea-light-bulbs-data","fields":{"headline":"My bright idea: Light bulbs can be used to transmit data","bodyText":"\"Light can be gentle, dangerous, dream-like, bare, living, dead, misty, clear, hot, dark, violet, spring-like, falling, straight, sensual, limited, poisonous, calm and soft,\" said the great Swedish cinematographer Sven Nykvist. It is also extraordinarily useful, he could easily have added, a point that scientists have been recently exploiting with some striking new uses for light, both in the home and in industry. Using light-emitting diodes – or LEDs – it will soon be possible to manipulate optical signals in order to build super-fast data links for personal computers, construct simple crash-avoidance systems for cars, design cable-free communication links with submarines and underwater robots and develop a host of other intriguing devices. Such projects currently are now being studied by engineers like 42-year-old Professor Harald Haas, once a projects manager for Siemens, now professor of mobile communications at Edinburgh University – and a man with a bright future. So what is the basis of the technology that you are working on? We use standard light-emitting diodes, LEDs, which you can buy at Homebase or B&amp;Q. They have several important features. For a start, they are highly power-efficient. Standard lightbulbs have an efficiency of 2%. In other words, only 2% of the energy put into them is turned to light. The rest is wasted. By contrast, LEDs have efficiencies of around 15% or more. The US Department of Energy has calculated that if everyone on Earth turned to the use of LEDs, the planet would require 100 fewer nuclear power stations. But there is another very nice feature about LEDs. They are electronic devices based on silicon and so can be switched on and off very quickly. Lightbulbs cannot do that. A standard lightbulb works by heating up a wire so that it glows brightly. This takes time, however; too long for use as a means to transmit large amounts of data at a rapid rate. Because these LEDS can be switched on and off extremely quickly, they can be used for signalling. This opens a new avenue for their use: data transmission. How do these device work then? Essentially, we use a mathematical trick that we apply to LEDs. This is known as OFDM – orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. Using this, you can vary the intensity of the LEDs' outputs and these signals can then be picked up by simple receivers. There are two key points about this system. The first is that it is incredibly rapid. We can get data rates of 100 megabits a second. That compares with wireless Lan (local area network), which gets around 50 megabits while broadband today is about 10 megabits, perhaps up to 50. Rates like that are bread and butter for our system, however. Our aim is to get to data transmission rates of a gigabit a second and more.The other point is that the rate of transmission is so fast, the human eye cannot detect it. The LEDs switch so fast that you cannot see they are going on and off. They just appear to glow like a normal LED. In other words, the lights shining round your home and office would actually be transmitting huge amounts of data without you being able to see that going on. How do you see this being exploited? One simple use would be as a substitute for broadband for your computer. You would have clusters of LEDs on your ceiling and a receiver on your computer. You would be able to download data at really fast rates. Ideas like that take advantage of the rapid data rates that are possible with LED systems. But more than that, there's one other clear benefit: LEDs can transmit data without using radio waves.That has real advantages. For example, LEDs could be used in hospitals to transmit data from MRI scanners to laptop computers. Because there are such intense magnetic fields around devices like these, it is impossible to transmit data using radio waves. LEDs get round that problem. Indeed, we are already working on such a system. Using light to transmit data would also be useful in the oil and gas industries. In oil platforms, for example, radio waves are not allowed because they can cause sparks. They can ignite. In contrast, light is intrinsically safe. At the heart of your system, you have a light-emitting silicon device that is capable of switching on and off with incredible rapidity. What other uses are you working on? You cannot use electromagnetic waves underwater because salt water is electrically conductive. So LEDs offer the option of transmitting data to underwater robotic vehicles or submarines. Robot craft could be guided without cables. We are in discussions about this use with one company. Similarly, we are also discussing using LED data transmission as the basis for a crash-avoidance system for road vehicles. If you have LEDs used as car headlights – and these are being introduced for road vehicles – you have the means to communicate from one car to another and set up a data link that could help a driver take early action that could help avoid having a collision. Or you could use them in aircraft to transmit internet data to passengers without using radiowaves that disrupt the operation of the aircraft. All these ideas are now being discussed between my department and companies. Those talks are at quite an advanced state. For example we have a project funded by Scottish Enterprise called D-Light which aims to establish a spin-off company by 2011. Certainly I would hope that we will see some of these devices in action in two or three years. There is light ahead, in other words."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2011/apr/01/spain-catalonia-independence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2011-04-01T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Spain: why prosperous Catalans may beat rebellious Basques to the exit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/01/spain-catalonia-independence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2011/apr/01/spain-catalonia-independence","fields":{"headline":"Spain: why prosperous Catalans may beat rebellious Basques to the exit","bodyText":"In a smart Barcelona office block this week I came across a map of a state that doesn't exist. This imaginary country has long borders and many provinces. It has history and an ancient language; a famous capital city and some of the world's best chefs. There is a sunny coast, snowy mountains and attractive islands. People come from around the world to visit. All this splendid country lacks is reality. The Països Catalans – the Catalan lands – stretch out like a ballerina's extended leg down the Mediterranean coast from France to a toe far to the south of Spain. In an alternative history of Europe – one in which different local medieval monarchies had conquered their neighbours – Catalonia, larger than Denmark, could have become a successful member of the European Union. The Catalans have at different times acquired the trappings of independence: a constitution in the 15th century, and a parliament, twice, in the 20th. But for the most part they have thrived or struggled in Spain. Prosperity has been some compensation for a sense of cultural injustice that like all nationalism draws its power from emotion as much as hard fact. Franco's repression – most but not all Catalans backed the defeated republicans in the civil war – fuelled Catalan distrust of Madrid. Lluís Companys, the Catalan president during the civil war, was returned from exile in France in 1940 and shot by the fascists: the only elected head of a European government to have been executed in office. That dark time for Spain is over. Catalans regained their autonomy in 1980. Their language – banned in public under Franco – is flourishing, its sharp tones a curious staccato descendent of Latin. Varied flavours of nationalist parties dominate the Catalan parliament in Barcelona and use their role as powerbrokers in Madrid to demand favours. Devolution is not total – most controversially it does not allow Catalans to keep their tax revenues as the devolved Basque country does – but nor is it fictitious. Spain, like Britain, is an unstable and imbalanced amalgam, devolved in parts but in theory still loyal to its king. Why, I asked Catalan politicians, did the politics of national identity trouble them so much? The answer lies partly in the events of last summer when a vast crowd in Barcelona protested at the Madrid constitutional court's rejection of a new Catalan statute of autonomy. Outrage at this ruling – after the statute had been approved by the Catalan and Spanish parliaments and a referendum – has led mainstream Catalan politicians, once largely opposed to independence, to change their thinking. More than a million Catalans – one in seven – marched under the banner \"Som una nació. Nosaltres decidim\" – \"we are a nation, we decide\". I began my journey last Sunday in Figueres, as joggers on a fun run passed fresh graffiti calling for \"independencia\". This is the town where the republican parliament sat for one last desperate session in early 1939 as a million civil war refugees fled north from the town on the French border. Now Figueres has acquired a symbol of what should be the collaborative new Spain: a station on the first section of a high-speed rail line that will soon link Paris, Barcelona and Madrid. The sleek trains cutting through the Catalan countryside suggest Europe really could be a continent without borders or political differences. The reality is different. To find out why I went to the Barcelona offices of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya – a leftist party which wants Catalan independence and until elections last year was part of the Catalan government. This is where I came across that map of the Països Catalans – those old linguistic territories which now run deep into other provinces of Spain and France. The ERC is anxious to present itself as the pragmatic face of nationalism. Members disassociate themselves from that other, violent, nationalist force inside Spain, in the Basque country. \"Here there is no armed movement. Discussion has not been contaminated by the personal experience of people who have been injured,\" I was told by Pere Aragonès, a young ERC MP. He was keen to convince me of Catalan moderation. Blame for the independence movement lies in Madrid, he said. \"Spain fails to recognise Catalan identity as a part of itself\". And growing economic pressures – Catalan resentment of taxes subsidising poorer parts of Spain – mean that \"independence is now a rational question, not just one of identity\". But while Aragonès was likeable, his older ERC colleague Josep Huget was more disturbing. His nationalism seemed based on hostility to others. \"There is a Spanish tsunami in Catalonia,\" he claimed – the impact of Madrid's taxes on Catalans in his opinion three times greater each year than the consequences of the disaster in Japan. Huget encapsulated the worst of parochial nationalisms. \"I expect people to speak Catalan,\" he said – absurd in Barcelona, a city of migrants where most citizens do not. The ERC has overreached itself. Its vote plunged at the last elections. But although polls suggest two-thirds of Catalans do not want independence now, while only a quarter support it, the tide is running against Spain. The ruling centre-right CiU party, long a bastion of Catalonia's post-Franco devolved settlement, is now increasingly sympathetic to a full breakaway. So are some Catalan socialists. Only the rightwing People's party is firmly against. This is crucial. In the Basque country two centrist parties, the PP and the Spanish socialists, run the devolved government together against a nationalist opposition. But in Catalonia, the major parties are nationalist. No one has an interest in fighting the drift away from Madrid. How do Catalans feel about this? I phoned Pilar Rahola, a well-known Catalan commentator who once sat in parliament for the ERC but left to write a biography of the current Catalan president, Artur Mas, leader of the CiU. \"Catalans are in a phase of perplexity and disenchantment,\" she told me. \"One part of the population are totally pro-independence and the majority, although unhappy with Spain, are slowly evolving towards pro-independence ideas.\" The pressure, she said, was growing \"because Catalans feel they suffer what is basically burglary, the theft of their economic resources. Spain is taking more than the Catalans are able to give.\" On top of that comes a feeling that parties in Madrid are no longer interested in assisting Catalan autonomy. \"Spanish parties are the best promoters of Catalan independence,\" she said. Rahola cites the current Catalan president's stark remark as a sign of what is to come: \"Spain is a closed road now.\" Certainly there is a casual contempt for Catalans among many Spaniards. Catalans find their accent and their culture mocked. The heir to the Spanish throne is never seen trying to speak Catalan, Basque or Galician. TV3, a Catalan channel, has been blocked from broadcasting in neighbouring Valencia. But I wonder if the Catalan sense of injustice is not overdone. Catalonia is awash with fast roads, new railways and oversized airports: not a sign Madrid has spent all its money elsewhere. Huget, from the ERC, boasted that without Spain, Catalonia could repay its debts in two years, but there seems be economic ignorance about the consequences of a Catalan walkout from Spain. It is simple for politicians to pretend to voters that all their woes can be blamed on Madrid. In search of politicians who share my fears I walked though Barcelona's Parc de la Ciutadella, amid palm trees and spring sunshine, to the Catalan parliament, which – tellingly – faces the city zoo. It is a grandiose stone building whose red velvet carpets and uniformed retainers give it the air of a London gentleman's club. It feels no place for a revolution. In a remote basement office I found Albert Rivera, the young leader of the small Citizens party which has set itself against the nationalist tide. One Catalan dismissed him as \"a snake charmer\" – a plausible front for the rightwing PP. I found him intelligent and impressive and about the only person I met who admitted to being proud of being both Catalan and Spanish. Rivera agreed Spain had alienated Catalans but added that nationalist parties were cooking up rows with Madrid to engineer greater resentment. \"We are trying to build a border with Spain, not just physical but cultural,\" he said. \"Catalonia is more closed than it was. I don't want to live in Kosovo. I want to be in a powerful region of Spain in a large country in the heart of Europe.\" This drift dismays others for whom self-determination is not a priority, such as Dolors Camats of the Green party. \"The big parties use the national debate as a curtain to hide other issues,\" she said. Last week, she tried to stage a debate in parliament on nuclear power after the Japanese disaster. No one was interested. Across the hall from Rivera's office the clipped Oxford tones of an unusual nationalist are audible. Antoni Strubell is an MP for a small alliance of pro-independence parties. Born in England, his father was a republican exile. Strubell's argument is straightforward. \"Catalonia is a nation. Madrid doesn't recognise us as such. No one in Madrid talks about federalism any more.\" Pressed on the benefits on independence, though, and like most Catalans he seemed vague. \"There is a general change to independence worldwide\" – Catalonia, like Flanders or Scotland, should break away.\" This depressed me. The financial crisis has made Catalans understandably anxious. But there is naivety in wanting to leave Spain to become rich. Members of the public, for the most part, are little involved: turnout in Catalan elections is low. But their politicians are drifting towards a contrived showdown. \"I am disconcerted and pessimistic,\" said Pilar Rahola – even though she favours independence. After 500 years, it is possible to believe that Spain is on the brink of falling apart – with the pragmatic Catalans, not the rebellious Basques, leading the way to the exit."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/cif-green/2010/apr/21/carbon-calculator-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-21T10:36:38Z","webTitle":"National carbon calculator: How Labour would cut emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cif-green/2010/apr/21/carbon-calculator-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/cif-green/2010/apr/21/carbon-calculator-labour","fields":{"headline":"National carbon calculator: How Labour would cut emissions","bodyText":"Alongside the economic crisis and the political crisis of expenses, the climate crisis is fundamental to the choices we have to make as a country in the years ahead. But despite the threat that global warming poses, we must also seize the moment to inspire people with the positive vision we can achieve as we tackle it. The mission to create green jobs through clean energy and low-carbon manufacturing is at the heart of our manifesto. Making that change happen requires an active government. The Tory idea of a laissez-faire DIY state cannot achieve it. Of course we need to help people act, but government also has a duty to lead. The crucial feature of Labour's approach is not just making it possible to cut carbon, it is creating jobs. Over the last few months four of the world's biggest wind turbine manufacturers - Siemens, GE, Mitsubishi and Clipper - have decided to open new plants in Britain, creating thousands of jobs. Why? Because the Labour government has made us the leader in offshore wind generation and provided financial support for manufacturing investment. That support was opposed by the Tories and would be at risk from their immediate cuts in public spending. At the same time Toyota and Nissan have chosen Britain to manufacture Europe's first hybrid car and Europe's first mass-produced electric car. Why? Because of the Labour government's commitment to supporting infrastructure and helping consumers buy electric cars - again spending opposed by and at risk from the Tories. And now one of the centrepieces of our manifesto is the creation of a Green investment bank, to help finance low-carbon infrastructure. And unlike the Tory imitation of this policy, the bank we propose will have new money in it financed through asset sales. We also want to empower individuals. So we are supporting people to improve energy efficiency and generate their own power, for example through new ways to finance clean energy home improvements, so people can install advanced energy efficiency measures or solar panels. So there is a positive vision of jobs, empowerment and fairness with plans sector by sector from agriculture to transport. All of this will take place within a clear framework for carbon emissions. That is why, with support from groups ranging from Greenpeace to the Confederation of British Industry, we introduced the Climate Change Act which made Britain the first country in the world to have detailed carbon budgets written into law. On the website of the Department for Energy and Climate Change you can see the budget levels for each sector. Combined, they set out the progress that needs be made to achieve our statutory target of a reduction in emissions by 2020 of 34% on 1990 levels. To make sure that government is held to these commitments, we set up the independent Climate Change Committee which reports regularly on progress on emissions reductions. The committee will also advise us on what further reductions we will need to make when we achieve our aim to shift the European goal from a 20% to a 30% reduction in emissions by 2020 alongside similar ambition from other developed countries. In contrast, the Tories don't mention this target at all - suggesting they have no such ambition. The Guardian's national carbon calculator takes a different approach from the government's on how to calculate emissions and where savings can come from, but however you do the maths, it is clear that we need to provide active support for energy efficiency and to take the carbon out of our energy infrastructure. It also shows that ruling out any one of the main low-carbon power sources makes achieving an 80% cut in emissions very difficult indeed. It just isn't practical to think we can cut emissions as required and keep the lights on if we don't attempt to use all low-carbon power sources at our disposal: renewables, nuclear power and clean coal. So we disagreed with shadow business secretary, Ken Clarke, when he said we should have no more wind turbines on mainland Britain - echoing the many Tory councils that refuse to give them planning permission. We think onshore wind has to play a role. And, unlike the Liberal Democrats, we don't think we should rule out the only low-carbon technology which already supplies a sizeable proportion of our electricity: nuclear power. But action at home will not be enough to beat climate change. We need action globally, and for that we need Europe to lead, something the Conservatives cannot do because of their scepticism on Europe. International progress has been slow, but through the Copenhagen Accord we do now have an agreement that for the first time agrees to limit warming to 2C and commits all major countries, including both the US and China, to reducing their emissions. The next few years will be crucial in deciding whether we build on this progress or go backwards. We believe in pushing for a stronger, internationally legally binding treaty, with deeper emissions cuts in Europe and among developed countries and an acceleration of action at home. Our manifesto sets out a course to meeting those objectives. We can both inspire people positively and prevent the dangers of unchecked climate change. It requires determined action by government in partnership with people, driven by fairness. We are determined to do it. • Ed Miliband is the secretary of state for energy and climate change and the Labour MP for Doncaster North"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2008/may/23/britishenergygroupbusiness.europe","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2008-05-23T09:11:23Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power: Suez pulls out of race for British Energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/23/britishenergygroupbusiness.europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2008/may/23/britishenergygroupbusiness.europe","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power: Suez pulls out of race for British Energy","bodyText":"Suez, the French utility, today pulled out of the bidding war for the government's stake in British Energy, leaving just two potential candidates to take over the nuclear power operator.

That tie-up has been delayed by a series of court rulings and union resistance. Its decision to leave the field leaves state-owned EDF, the French power group, and rival German and Spanish companies, RWE and Iberdrola, who are preparing a combined offer, to fight it out for the government's 35% stake. \"As previously indicated, the completion of the merger with Gaz de France remains Suez's key priority,\" Suez said. \"Accordingly, Suez confirms that, in its discussions regarding the future development of the nuclear energy sector in the UK, those relating to a potential offer for British Energy have now ceased.\" It said UK takeover rules would prevent it from resuming talks over a possible offer for British Energy until it had completed its merger with GDF. This is due later this year.

In a Commons statement, he said the cull would go ahead next year. In a comment article, Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, says Paterson should abandon the policy for good. • Michael Gove has accused Ed Miliband of being a \"small-c conservative\" because of his resistance to modernisation. In a speech, Gove said that Miliband's \"one nation Labour\" speech illustrated not a move to the centre but an \"explicit disavowal\" of the centrism practised under Tony Blair's leadership. Gove also said that the \"blue Labour\" philosophy favoured by Miliband was \"anti-globalisation, explicitly anti-liberal and proudly protective of the past\". Blue Labour thinking - Ed Miliband's thinking - is not then a continuation or refashioning of Blairism, it is a critique and rejection of Blairism. It's an attempt to repudiate the period in the party's recent past when wealth creation was welcomed, when spin doctors argued education reform would mean a move away from the bog-standard comprehensive, when the director's box at the Emirates was preferred to the Durham Miners' Gala. That is why it is a fundamental mistake ... to see Ed Miliband's One Nation speech as a move to the centre. It was an explicit disavowal of the centrism practised under Tony Blair and a celebration of an older, more solidaristic socialism of the kind which would have found favour with Tony Crosland or even Tony Benn. Where Tony Blair used his speeches to identify the forces of conservatism and declare war on them, Ed Miliband has used his speech to celebrate the forces of conservatism and declare he wants to become their leader. • Gove has said that he is writing to MPs in areas of \"concentrated educational under-performance\" to encourage them to support his bid for more primaries to become academies. I want the MPs in those cities to work with me to persuade their local authorities and their local communities that we need rapidly to improve their schools. They have a simple choice: stand with those in the academies and free schools movement who want to put children first; or stand with the adults who are blocking school improvement. • MPs have been told that suspects are being needlessly remanded in custody and denied a fair trial because of a severe shortage of qualified court interpreters. • The European parliament has voted for a 6.8% increase in the EU's budget. • Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, has published figures showing that the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games came in £377m under budget. The overall cost of the Games is now forecast to be £8.921bn from a budget of £9.298bn. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here's an afternoon reading list. • Paul Goodman at ConservativeHome says it is now possible to imagine David Cameron supporting Britain leaving the EU. What will the Prime Minister do [if other EU member states refuse a renegotiation]? After all, he is adamant that he wants Britain to remain within the E.U. There are two possibilities. The first is that he sticks to his view. The second is that he shrugs his shoulders and recommends that Britain pull out. Extraordinary as it may seem, the latter course is now possible. I am not sure that the significance of the Gove intervention - the Education Secretary's admission that he would vote to pull out of the EU were there an In-Out referendum today - has been fully grasped. It marked the moment when a view held by roughly half of party activists and a significant percentage of Tory MPs was backed without reproof at Cabinet level - and by the Government's most successful senior Minister at that, and one who may yet be, for all his protestations to the contrary, a future party leader. • David Butler at Ballots and Bullets writes about what happens to chief whips after they move. Few ex-Chief Whips however became very important on the political stage. Wakeham, and, still more, Heath stand out as the eminent exceptions. So while many Chief Whips do have a political afterlife, the post is often the most significant that an individual will ever hold. Andrew Mitchell may want to take note of that rather depressing fact. • Luke Akehurst at LabourList posts a table showing who would win the police commissioner elections if voters were to vote by party as they did in the 2010 general election. The Ministry of Justice has announced what it describes as \"a new measure ... [to] help prosecutors combat corporate offending\". Deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) will allow prosecutors to agree not to prosecute firms accused of serious economic wrongdoing, such as fraud, bribery or money-laundering, provided they make amends, pay a fine and agree to reform their internal procedures to stop the problem happening again. And here's what Friends of the Earth is saying about the badger cull announcement. This is from Liz Hutchins, FoE's senior political campaigner. The self-professed ‘greenest government ever’ might make fewer mistakes on its environmental policies if it adopted an evidence-based, rather than ideological approach, to policy making. Ministerial plans to cull badgers and buzzards were severely undermined by the partial use of facts to suit certain interests. The forthcoming energy bill is a crucial test of the government’s scientific credibility – will it listen to its climate expert’s call for our power system to be decarbonised by 2030, or give the go-ahead to George Osborne’s reckless dash for gas? The NFU says the decision taken to delay the badger cull was \"exceptionally difficult but on balance ... responsible and right\". Peter Kendall, the NFU president, has put out this statement. The NFU and its members take their responsibilities on this issue extremely seriously and I know there will be many who are devastated by today’s news. We have all worked tirelessly to prepare for the delivery of this government policy to see us finally get on top of this terrible disease. But there have been a series of obstacles, not least the appalling weather, delays because of the Olympics and Paralympics, and the legal challenges from those against the policy. And let’s be clear, the numbers from the badger population survey last week, which demonstrated just how large the badger numbers are, have left us with a huge challenge to ensure we achieve the targets needed for disease control. We have always said that this has to be a science-led policy to reduce disease and we have to be confident of achieving the numbers needed for disease reduction. As we rapidly approach winter the odds of achieving that number decrease. This is why, reluctantly, we have taken the decision, with the companies involved, to delay until late spring next year. For those that have suggested that this cull is irresponsible, I think today’s decision shows that this is simply not the case. Postponement is the most responsible thing to do. We have said all along that this has never been about killing badgers; this has always been about eradicating disease. It has been about the battle to get on top of the TB on our farms that strikes at the very heart of our beef and dairy herds. This has been a very tough year for farmers, which has lent its own set of challenges. In preparing to deliver on this government’s TB eradication policy we have met with delay after delay; challenge after challenge. But I am proud of the way that farmers have worked together and shown great resilience in the face of not inconsiderable opposition - and for that I want to thank them. The statement is now over. So much for one nation. Listening to that statement, it was like hearing a row between the farming party and the non-farming party. There were some Conservative MPs who expressed reservations about the cull (see 1.36pm and 1.39pm), but broadly they were all strongly in favour of culling badgers and many of them spoke about the damage bovine TB is doing to farmers. There must be some cattle farmers living in Labour constituencies too, but you would not have guessed this by listening to these exchanges. Instead Labour MPs focused on the political embarrassment this causes for the government, the cost of the pilots and doubts about the Defra science case. Here is the story my colleague Damian Carrington has just filed about the badger cull being delayed until 2013. And here's a Guardian article from Brian May about the cull being postponed. Labour's Jon Ashworth asks if Paterson will publish the figures for how much has been spent on the scheme so far. Paterson says he is happy to do this. And he rejects claims this is a U-turn. \"This is not a U-turn,\" he says. Labour's Willie Bain asks what Paterson has to say to scientists who call the cull a costly error. And why did Defra cut spending on vaccine research? Paterson says Defra has not cut spending on vaccine research. Labour's Steve McCabe asks why the government is going ahead with the cull when its own impact assessment says the costs will outweigh the benefits. Paterson says what's more important is what the cost would be of doing nothing. Lord Krebs, a government science adviser, has described the cull plan as \"crazy\". Asked about this, Paterson says Krebs accepts the link between badgers and bovine TB. Krebs was objecting to the way the proposed cull was going to be conducted, he says. Mel Stride, a Conservative, says bovine TB is causing misery to farmers in Devon. Labour did nothing to address the problem, he says. Labour's Andrew Miller asks Paterson to publish all the scientific evidence he has received on this. Paterson says most of this information has already been published. If Miller cannot find it on the internet, Paterson will send it to him. Andrew Percy, a Conservative, says there is a lot of concern among the public about this. Can Paterson \"nail down the arguments\" over the next year? Paterson says he accepts there is public concern about this. Labour's Simon Danczuk asks how much the trials have cost so far. Paterson says he will write to Danczuk with the figures. But he repeats the point about bovine TB possibly costing the country £1bn. In the light of that, the amount of money spent so far would look like \"a round of drinks\". Tracey Crouch, a Conservative, says it was disappointing to see Labour MPs laughing during the statement. She says a cull would only cut bovine TB by 16%. Paterson says 16% is a significant number. A cull would lead to disease figures going down. Labour's Chi Onwurah asks if Paterson believes in evidence-based policy, or policy-based evidence? Paterson says he is following the evidence of respected experts in the field. Guy Opperman, a Conservative, asks if farmers will continue to get the financial support they need and deserve until this disease is eradicated. Paterson says he wants to see an expanded cattle industry. But bovine TB has to be tackled first. Labour's Sheila Gilmour says Defra has a track record of backing off under public pressure. Will Paterson reassure her that he will reconsider the whole policy? Paterson says Gilmour has missed the point. He wants to go ahead. There is \"enormous pressure\" for a cull from cattle farmers. No one is backing off at all, he says. Labour's Nia Griffith asks when the EU might allow vaccinated cattle to be exported. Paterson says the government has been working on this for two years. But it does not have a viable proposal to put to the European commission yet. Glyn Davies, a Conservative, asks Paterson to confirm that the scientific criteria will be adhered to next summer. Paterson says the tests will follow the scientific criteria. Labour's Mary Glindon asks Paterson to fast-track a vaccine programme as a long-term solution. Paterson says he would love to go ahead with a vaccination programme. But the science is not ready yet, he says. Tony Baldry, a Conservative, asks Paterson if he will meet Creagh on privy council terms to see if she has a single idea for dealing with the problem. If she has, she has not mentioned it, Baldry says. Paterson says he would be happy to work with Labour on this. Duncan Hames, a Lib Dem, asks what the government is doing to develop the \"diva\" test (the one that can differentiate between vaccinated cattle and diseased cattle). Paterson says he wants to proceed with this \"full bore\". The full text of Paterson's statement is now on the Defra website. Neil Parish, a Conservative, asks for an absolute assurance that the culls will go ahead next year. Paterson says he agrees with Parish; he wants the culls to go ahead. Daniel Kawczynski, a Conservative, asks if the cull will be extended quickly if the pilots are successful. Paterson replies: \"Emphatically yes.\" He says he is confident the pilots will be a success. Robert Drax, a Conservative, asks how many farmers have been threatened in the proposed pilot areas. Paterson says fortunately the number is tiny. Labour's Robert Flello asks Paterson to meet scientists opposed to the cull. Paterson says Flello is wrong to say the government is basing its poiicy on \"NFU science\". It is following the evidence produced by the last Labour government. He says he is happy to meet scientists. Paterson says there are going to be roughly 60 marksmen in each of the cull areas. Labour's Chris Williamson says earmarking £250,000 to examine dead badgers is a waste of money. Paterson says this is a ludicrous question. It shows Labour does not understand the problem. The problem could cost the government £1bn. Paterson says the police forces in the cull areas will receive funding to cover the costs they have incurred. Simon Hart, a Conservative, says farmers watching the reaction of the Labour party will feel \"a shiver down their spine\". Labour is exploiting this for party political reasons. So much for one nation. Paterson says Labour's approach has been \"shameful\". James Gray, a Conservative, asks Paterson to confirm that a workable badger vaccine would not help badgers that are ill. Paterson says an injectable badger vaccine was licensed last year. But you have to vaccinate every badger every year. And it won't help the ones that are ill. He says he is doubtful whether the Welsh government's vaccination programme will work. Ian Paisley, the DUP MP, asks if the department has a plan B. According to Paterson's figures, 30,000 cattle will be slaughtered over the next year. Paterson says that Paisley is right to say that, until Defra deals with the problems, the \"horrendous\" slaughter figures will continue. But he has to respect the science, Paterson says. Paterson says other countries are culling badgers. Labour's Barry Gardiner asks what the government is doing to improve bio-security. Paterson says he agrees on the importance of bio-security. \"But we are dealing with an animal that can get into sheds,\" he says. He says one millilitre of badger urine contains 300,000 colony-forming units of disease. He says that only 0.001% is enough to spread disease. (I didn't quite follow to which unit the 0.001% referred, but the general point is clear - Bovine TB spreads very easily.) Anne McIntosh, a Conservative, asks if farmers in the cull areas will be given legal protection. Will Paterson ensure that vaccinated animals can be sold legally in the EU? Paterson says the police have co-operated in a tremendous manner. On vaccination, he says the current vaccine is only 50-60% effective. That is not very effective. A test has been developed to show the difference between a vaccinated animal and a diseased animal. But it is not yet ready. The EU authorities are saying that if Britain did vaccinate now, it would not be allowed to export cattle products. He says he will discuss this with the European commission. But he cannot present them with an evidence-based vaccination programme. Labour's Meg Munn asks why Defra got the figures so badly wrong. Paterson says the figures showing there were more badgers than expected only came in relatively late. Sir James Paice, the former farming minister, says the decision is disappointing. But he says that the fact that there are more badgers than expected in the culling areas makes culling even more necessary. Paterson agrees, and pays tribute to the work Paice did in developing this policy. Owen Paterson is responding to Mary Creagh. He says the pilots were designed to see whether culling would work. The government was wholly subscribing to the science. The government is not dropping the policy, he says. This policy is absolutely intact ... We will deliver pilot culls from next summer which will show the efficacy of what we intend to do. Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, says this is another U-turn. The government has been \"incompetent and shambolic\", she says. She says Labour warned the government about this. She asked how many badgers there were in the cull areas. But ministers did not know how many badgers there were in the area. This admission meant Defra was wide open to a judicial review, she says. Is this like the forestry U-turn? Will the policy be dropped? Or is it like the health bill pause, where the government will carry on regardless? Creagh says Paterson has \"blamed the weather and the police\". But it was Theresa May, the home secretary, who said the cull should not go ahead during the Olympics. And what will happen if the weather is bad next year? Will farmers be able to sue the government for damages? Creagh asks if Paterson was forced to perform this U-turn by David Cameron. This policy should never have left the red box, she says. With forestry and circus animals, Defra has now performed a U-turn hat-trick. Policy should be based on the evidence, she says. Owen Paterson is speaking now. There are cheers as he stands up. Bovine TB is the most pressing animal health problem in the UK, he says. It used to be isolated. But it has spread extensively through the west of England and Wales. Cases are doubling every nine years. Last year some 26,000 cattle were slaughtered at a cost of £100m. Over the next 10 years it could cost £500m, he says. Last week the government announced plans for a new testing regime. Cattle and badgers can transmit the disease to each other. Culling badgers can cut transmission to cattle if it is carried out over a large enough area and for a significant length of time. That is why the government thinks culling badgers can make a significant contribution. The NFU has taken the lead in preparing the pilot culls. Paterson says he has been \"immensely impressed\" by the work done by the NFU. And he thanks the police for their help. The severe bad weather this summer has caused problems. Legal problems, and the police request for the cull to start after the Olympics, mean the government has missed the best time to start the cull. New figures also show that there are more badgers in the pilot area than thought. For a cull to be successful, 70% of badgers have to be culled. Farmers now say they cannot be confident of culling 70% of the badgers, partly because of the higher numbers and the delays. The companies due to carry out the culls have written to Paterson asking him to delay the culls until next summer. Paterson says he has placed a copy of the letter in the library of the Commons. Starting next summer will ensure that the culls can conform to the scientific criteria and the evidence base. This will be disappointing, Paterson says. But he fully supports the decision of the NFU. The government is still committed to the policy. But it wants to work with the NFU to get the policy right. It wants to have a TB-free England. Vaccination would be another option. But it will be some years before a viable cattle vaccine is available, he says. Paterson says he is utterly convinced that culling is the right thing do to. He wants the culls to be delivered safely next summer. My colleague Adam Vaughan has been speaking to Brian May, who has been one of the leaders of the anti-culling campaign. This is what May told him. A pilot vaccination scheme could come in months, not years. This is the most exciting news for farmers that you could possibly have. All of Team Badger [a coalition of groups opposed to the badger cull] are committed not only to the welfare of badgers, but of cows, and are very conscious of the misery that bovine TB causes farmers. So with this policy of culling out of the way, it will clear us to working directly with the NFU [National Farmers Union]. That’s what I sincerely hope. I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone who’s contributed to raising public awareness of this issue. It’s vital to everyone in this country, not just to the rural community. There is a much bigger picture here, which is the whole relationship humans have with other creatures on this planet. Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, is about to make his Commons statement about delaying the badger cull. If you want some background, here's a 24-page briefing paper from the Commons library about badger culling (pdf). • Wildlife campaigners and the Labour party have welcomed the news that the government is going to delay its proposed badger cull. Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, will make a statement in the Commons at 12.30pm confirming the delay. I will be covering it in detail live. • George Entwistle, the BBC director general, has defended the BBC's handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Giving evidence to the Commons culture committee, where MPs have strongly criticised him for not taking more interest in the Newsnight investigation into Savile, Entwistle also said that some past and present BBC employees are being investigated. \"We are looking at between five and 10 serious allegations relating to activities over the whole period in question, the Savile period,\" he said. That included claims of sexual harassment made against people still working at the BBC, he added, but he could not say how many. There are further details of the hearing, which is still going on, on our media live blog. • William Hague, the foreign secretary, has said that the European Union will become \"democratically unsustainable\" unless more power can be returned to national parliaments. (See 10.17am.) • Hague has announced that the government's review of EU powers will produce more than 30 reports. In a written statement to MPs, he said it would report in four stages, with each stage resulting in six to 10 reports. • Britons are 13% poorer than they were before the financial crisis started, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. • Two Scottish National party members of the Scottish parliament who led a rebellion against proposals for an independent Scotland to join Nato have resigned in protest. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here is the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must reads, here is the ConservativeHome round-up of today's politics stories and here is the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles. And here are some articles and stories I found particularly interesting. • Nick Robinson in the Times (paywall) says television debates may well not happen in the 2015 election. No one should assume that the next election will produce a second series of prime ministerial debates. Surely, you might think, having waited more than seven decades after the invention of the goggle box for our first debates no one would want to stop them now? Oh yes, they would. In the US there was a gap of 16 years after the first debate in 1960. After Kennedy’s charm trumped Nixon’s gruffness American voters had to wait until Gerald Ford faced Jimmy Carter in 1976. Prime ministerial debates in Australia and Canada have been irregular too. Now I am beginning to hear doubts about whether agreement will be possible for debates in 2015. • Paul Goodman in the Daily Telegraph says Theresa May could be the next Conservative leader. If you are a Conservative Cabinet Minister, and are asked whether you have ambitions to become party leader, your duty is to answer roughly as follows: “David Cameron will be Prime Minister for decades. I will have vanished into obscurity long before he wins his fourth election victory. The suggestion you’re making is absurd.” Posed the inevitable question last weekend, Theresa May answered: “We have a first-class leader at the moment [my italics]. David Cameron is dealing with the issues that he was left by the last government very well indeed.” This fell short by some distance of the grandiloquent encomium required. There can be no doubt about it. The Home Secretary is, as Tory MPs would put it, “on manoeuvres” – discreet ones, to be sure, but unmistakable for all that ... It is not as though Mr Cameron has an obvious successor. The three front-runners to succeed him are Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and George Osborne. The first claims not to want to do so. The second lacks the means (since he isn’t an MP and will still be Mayor of London if he becomes one after the next election). And the third will lack the capacity if the Conservatives fail to win a majority next time round: he will go down with Mr Cameron, his friend, in such an event – one still more likely than not, given the collapse of the boundary review. So Tory MPs are quietly casting around for who could next lead them in Opposition. • Richard Garner in the Independent says Britain is one of only three countries in Europe where fewer than 10% of students go on to post-graduate study. In most major European countries, between 15 and 24 per cent of students continue with their studies after gaining an undergraduate degree. But in Britain, the number is significantly lower. It leaves the UK in the company of Andorra, the tiny principality and partial tax-haven between France and Spain, and Kazakhstan, the vast uranium-rich country in Central Asia where insulting the President and officials is a criminal offence. • Roland Watson and Richard Fort in the Times say ministers fear turnout in the police commissioner elections could be as low as 10%. Turnout in next month’s landmark polls to elect police commissioners could be only 10 per cent, ministers fear. The Conservative leadership is preparing to defend public apathy as mere “teething problems” unlikely to recur once the public becomes used to the new posts. But the expected low level of participation threatens to rob the new commissioners of legitimacy ... A Populus poll for The Times found that 22 per cent of voters “strongly disagreed” with the premise that they probably would not bother to vote. However, MPs report little interest on the doorstep and they are resigned to turnout being well below 20 per cent, with some senior figures predicting that in some areas it will be half that. • Richard Garner in the Independent says Michael Gove has written an apology to his French teacher from 30 years ago for his “cocksure” behaviour in class. The Education Secretary’s letter is published in today’s Radio Times as his contribution to this year’s Teaching Awards, which will be aired by BBC2 next Sunday. In it, he tells Mr Montgomery: “You were trying patiently, doggedly, good-humouredly, to broaden our horizons. You were, without any pretension or pomposity, attempting to coax a group of hormonal lads to look beyond familiar horizons and venture further... [yet] all we could do was compete to think of clever-dick questions to embarrass you and indulge in pathetic showing-off at your expense.” Referring to his former teacher as “Danny”, the letter concludes: “It may be too late to say I’m sorry. But, as my mum told me, it’s never too late to set the record straight. You were a great teacher – one of many who helped introduce me to the work of great thinkers and writers and thus gave me the greatest gift of all – the chance to write my own life story.” • The Daily Telegraph publishes an obituary of Walter Harrison, Labour's deputy chief whip in the 1970s. His energy and talents were essential as the parliamentary party elected in 1974 turned fractious and a reinvigorated Opposition under Mrs Thatcher turned up the heat. Cocks would dispatch Harrison to bawl threats through the letterboxes of absent backbenchers, and his carpeting of the Left-winger Tom Litterick for missing a confidence vote (he was holidaying in Crete) was audible well beyond the confines of the Whips’ Office. To get the government’s business through — or vice versa when in opposition — Harrison developed an array of wheezes. They included getting three members to vote each way in a committee to make it look as if a quorum were present (for which Mellish apologised to the House), and blocking one of the division lobbies (undertaken with Scottish Nationalists to prevent the Tories winning a vote against devolution). One day in May 1968 he was whipping on two Committees at once when a vote was called on the Finance Bill. He arrived just as the door was closing, forced his way through and voted. When the Shadow Chancellor Iain Macleod challenged his vote, Harrison said he had been three-quarters in and had pulled his leg in after him. The chairman declared the vote carried by 22¾ to 22. My colleague Severin Carrell has filed a story on the resignation of two SNP MSPs over the Nato decision. (See 10.24am.) Two SNP MSPs who led a rebellion against proposals for an independent Scotland to join Nato have resigned in protest. John Finnie and Jean Urquhart, both MSPs in the Highlands, announced they had quit after the party very narrowly voted to overturn the decades-long ban on Nato membership, following an intense conference debate last Friday. Their resignations mark the first major revolt against Alex Salmond's leadership since the party won power at the Scottish parliament in 2007, illustrating the scale of the controversy over the new pro-Nato policy. The rebels insisted it was both hypocritical and probably unworkable for the SNP to join a nuclear-armed military alliance while at the same demanding that the UK removes the Trident nuclear weapons system from its base on the Clyde. Finnie, a former police officer who has been an open critic of Scottish government policy, and joined the SNP at 16, said: \"I cannot belong to a party that quite rightly does not wish to hold nuclear weapons on its soil, but wants to join a first strike nuclear alliance. “Although I envisage that I will continue to share common ground with the SNP on many issues, I cannot in good conscience continue to take the party whip.” Jean Urquhart, a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament member for 35 years, who had been considering whether she might resign before last Friday's knife-edge vote, said: “The issue of nuclear disarmament and removing Trident from Scotland’s waters is a red line issue for me, and I could not remain committed to a party that has committed itself to retaining membership of Nato.\" Britons have become even poorer over the past four years than previously thought, according to research published by the Office for National Statistics today. National wealth is usually measured by GDP data. But the ONS paper, which is published as part of its research into national wellbeing (or happiness, as we call it in the media) says that net national income (NNI) per head is a more useful measure of living standards. And here's the key finding. In the second quarter of 2012 net national income (NNI) per head in real terms was 13.2 per cent below its pre-recession level in the first quarter of 2008; a sharper fall in economic well-being than the 7.0 per cent fall that GDP per head data indicate. The ONS news release is here. And the full 27-page report (pdf) is here. Back to badgers. My colleague Steven Morris has sent me some reaction to the news that the cull is being postponed from Gloucestershire, one of the areas where the cull was going to be piloted. Delight from “Jay”, one of the leading lights of the Stop the Cull organisation, which has been undertaking direct action aimed at halting the shooting. He's intent on doing a little more research to find out how close the cull came to starting – but he thinks it's “dead in the water”. He is planning to turn his attention to other animal rights issues – and return to the badger cull next spring if it looks like it may be back on the agenda. “I think I can probably leave it safely until March or April now.” Jay thinks the badger cull question may be a watershed moment for the animal rights movement, with many people who had not been involved prepared to get involved in direct action. His website badger-killers.co.uk has been a focal point for those who had planned to get out into the cull zones wearing high-visibility jackets and carrying high-powered flashlight and horns to try to disrupt any shooting. “Those people won't go away, if needed they'll be back next year again,” he said. There was a more cautious welcome from Jackie Fraser, Labour member of the Forest of Dean district council, to the expected announcement. She had proposed a motion that was passed by the district council banning badger culling on its land and contacted all land-owners within its boundary to request them to refuse any culling of badgers. Fraser said: “I'm pleased but cautious. I hope the government is going to look seriously at other ways of tackling bovine TB like vaccinating cattle and improving biosecurity.” There's joy from the group Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting, set up to campaign “peacefully” against the cull. Spokesperson Liz Gaffer – who had tears in her eyes as she spoke - said: “We are so, so pleased. The scientific evidence has shown that killing badgers won't help. The people of Gloucestershire have voiced their concern loudly. We thank the government for taking it on board.” George Entwistle, the BBC director general, has just started giving evidence to the Commons culture committee about the Jimmy Savile affair. You can follow the proceedings on our Jimmy Savile scandal live blog. Back to badgers. Gavin Grant, the RSPCA's chief executive, has put out this statement about the badger cull delay that Owen Paterson is due to confirm later. This is good news for badgers, cows, dairy farmers and animal-lovers alike. Hopefully, it marks the beginning of the end for these unscientific, foolish and cruel plans to cull badgers. We welcome this postponement, but this must not be a temporary reprieve, but must mark an end to all cull plans. Science, the public and MPs from all parties had said very clearly that a cull is no answer to bovine TB. The RSPCA stands ready to play a full part working with farmers, land-owners, government and conservationists to move forward rapidly and constructively to tackle this dire disease in cattle and wildlife. In Scotland the repercussions of the SNP's decision to drop its historic opposition to an independent Scotland belonging to Nato continue. This is from the BBC's Raymond Buchanan. William Hague, the foreign secretary, delivered a speech on the future of Europe in Berlin this morning. You can read the full text on the Foreign Office website. Here are the key points. • Hague said the European Union would become \"democratically unsustainable\" unless it could show power going back from Brussels to national parliaments. People feel that in too many ways the EU is something that is done to them, not something over which they have a say. The way in Britain Lisbon was ratified without any consultation of the voters has played a part in that. People feel that the EU is a one way process, a great machine that sucks up decision-making from national parliaments to the European level until everything is decided by the EU. That needs to change. If we cannot show that decision-making can flow back to national parliaments then the system will become democratically unsustainable. Subsidiarity must really mean something. • He said that \"public disillusionment with the EU in Britain is the deepest it has ever been\". (Actually, I'm not sure that's true. The proportion of British people wanting to leave the EU, or the Common Market as it then was, was much higher in the early 1980s than it is now.) • He said that in future some countries should be allowed to integrate more with the EU than others. Resurrecting a phrase from the John Major era, he said there should be \"variable geometry\". The Eurozone countries must do what they must to resolve the crisis, but the way forward for the EU as a whole is not more centralisation and uniformity but of flexibility and variable geometry, that allows differing degrees of integration in different areas, done in ways that do not disadvantage those that do not wish to participate in everything, and preserves the things we all value. There are four polls around today - three state-of-the-parties ones, and one from the Corby byelection. Here are the results in full. I've also included figures on economic competence because, as we report in the Guardian, this is where the figures are probably most interesting. ICM for the Guardian Labour: 41% (no change since ICM last month) Conservatives: 33% (up 2) Lib Dems: 14% (no change) Labour lead: 8 points (down 2) Populus for the Times (paywall) Labour: 40% (down 5 from Populus last month) Conservatives: 35% (up 5) Lib Dems: 9% (down 1) Labour lead: 5 points (down 10) YouGov for the Sun Labour: 45% (up 2 from YouGov in the Sunday Times) Conservatives: 32% (no change) Lib Dems: 8% (down 1) Ukip: 8% (down 1) Labour lead: 13 points (up 2) Government approval: -39 (down 9) A poll from Lord Ashcroft in Corby, where there is a byelection next month Labour: 54% Conservatives: 32% Ukip: 6% Lib Dems: 5% Labour lead: 22 points And here the figures on economic competence ICM for the Guardian Who would manage the economy better? Cameron and Osborne: 31% Miliband and Balls: 27% Tory lead: 4 points Populus for the Times (pdf) Who do you most trust to manage the economy? Cameron/Clegg/Osborne: 42% Miliband/Balls: 27% Coalition lead: 15 points YouGov for the Sun Which party would handle the economy in general best? Labour: 28% (up 1 from early October) Conservatives: 26% (down 3) Labour lead: 2 points As the YouGov tracker figures show (pdf), this is not the first time Labour have led the Conservatives on this question since 2010, but it has only happened three other times, in May and June this year, when Labour led the Conservatives by 1 point or 2 points on this measure. Here's some Labour reaction to our badger cull story. From Lady Royall, the Labour leader in the Lords From Denis MacShane, the former Europe minister From the Labour press office From Ben Bradshaw, the former culture secretary At Politics Live I haven’t really written about badgers before but there’s a first time for everything and, with my media colleagues live blogging the George Entwistle culture committee hearing about the Jimmy Savile affair, I will be focusing on Owen Paterson’s badger cull U-turn statement in the Commons. As my colleagues Juliette Jowit and Damian Carrington report, Paterson will announce that the long-planned badger cull is being postponed amid concern about the effectiveness and cost of the controversial policy. The Department for the Environment insists that this isn’t a U-turn, but it is going to look like a U-turn, which is unfortunate for David Cameron coming, as it does, at a time when the government is being widely criticised for incompetence. But that’s not the only item on the agenda. Here’s the full diary for the day. 9.30am: The NHS Confederation and the Local Government Association give evidence to the Commons health committee about health spending. 9.30am: EDF and Scottish Power give evidence to the Commons energy committee about nuclear power. 9.45am: Interpreters and the Magistrates’ Association give evidence to the Commons justice committee about court translation services. 10.30am: George Entwistle, the BBC’s director general, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee about the Jimmy Savile affair. We’ll be covering the hearing on a separate live blog. 11.15am: Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary designate, speaks at a TUC green industry conference. 12pm: Michael Gove, the education secretary, gives a speech to the Politeia thinktank. 12.30pm: Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, makes a statement in the Commons on the proposed badger cull. 3.15pm: Vince Cable, the business secretary, gives a speech to the TUC green industry conference. At some point today David Cameron is holding a meeting with large firms to promote a new supply chain finance scheme, and William Hague, the foreign secretary, is giving a speech on Europe in Berlin. As usual, I'll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.

Griffin said the voluntary programme would be open to around 180,000 people a year who \"could go back and help develop their own countries\". He said the scheme would be funded from the foreign aid budget and money the government is \"wasting at the moment on ridiculous climate change adaptation policies\". \"We're saying that we'd give resettlement grants ... this is voluntary ... we're looking probably at £50,000 per person,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Griffin said that the doors would be closed to everyone because Britain was \"the most overcrowded country in Europe\", but he did give exceptions. He said that Irish people would be allowed in because \"as far as we are concerned the Irish are part of Britain and are fully entitled to come here\". Griffin also gave the example of a Japanese physicist needed to help with a fleet of British-built nuclear power stations to be developed under a BNP government. He claimed that French people who came to the country were unlikely to be targeting \"soft-touch Britain\". \"If you are talking about Polish plumbers or Afghan refugees, the doors are going to be shut because Britain is full,\" the BNP leader said. Griffin, who claimed he would rather be about the economy \"like the other leaders\", but was \"very pleased\" to talk about immigration, continued: \"The door is shut to any significant numbers whatsoever, from anywhere. It's open where it suits Britain and suits the British people. That's fair enough.\" He claimed \"British indigenous\" people would be in a minority in the country between 2050 and the end of the century. Griffin said the BNP would be prepared to tear up international treaties in order to achieve its objectives.

Except for the predictable minority who aren't. The poll is from Gallup on what people think would constitute sensible energy/environmental policies. Now, to start with, it does turn out that 66% people still support offshore drilling but they are basically evenly divided between those who want to do more exploration for new wells and those who want to keep extant operations going but that's it. Only 22% want to ban it all. So far so reasonable. Now is where we get into the communistic part: Do you want to require utilities to expand renewables? Yes 87, No 9. Do you want tougher efficiency standards? Yes 78, No 17. Do you want limits on CO2? Yes 66, No 29. Do you want more oil, coal and gas exploration? Yes 68, No 26. Do you want more nuclear power? Yes 50, No 42. Okay. The real message here is that people want more energy, even the dirty kind, but they think the government should place limits on CO2. They're a little dubious of nuclear, but they want more power, starting with renewables. I'd like to meet that 9% eh? Actually, on second thought... Finally there's this. Is it more important to keep energy prices low or protect the environment? All: Environment 56, low prices 37. Dems: Env. 68, low 28. Indies: Env. 59, low 32. Reps: Low 52, env. 41. So the Republicans are out of step with the rest of the country, which says by substantial majorities that they'd pay higher prices for a better environment. Just like substantial majorities typically supported a public option, remember. To sum up then. Majorities of Americans want renewables, CO2 reductions, higher efficiency; and will pay higher prices. What are the odds the energy bill that comes out of the Senate in a couple months' time reflects these priorities (assuming one comes out at all)? Correct. Slim. And why? The power of the lobbies, yes. But mainly the rules of the Senate, and the way the 41 who speak for the out-of-step minority group in the above have such inordinate power over what happens. So any bill that's passed here will be to the right of where the American people are (this poll in my experience is hardly an outlier). And if Obama pushes hard for some of these things - if, for example, he were to say that protecting the environment was worth slightly higher prices, a view most Americans back - he would be pilloried as usual by the usual loudmouth gang of paid-for reactionary cretins with their usual lies, and the press would write the story that Obama was the one who was being extreme.

John Healey, the minister for local government, has written to all MPs announcing that he is amending the planning reform bill - due for its third reading on Monday - to give MPs a greater say over new national strategies for nuclear energy, renewable energy, airports, ports and roads. He is also changing the law so thousands of people whose homes could be blighted by such developments will automatically get the right to compensation, at a cost of tens of millions of pounds. This is intended to draw the sting out of protests, but the government yesterday did not know how much the concession would cost. The move follows a parliamentary motion by 63 Labour MPs to throw out the heart of the bill - a new independent infrastructure planning commission to decide on all new nuclear power stations, road schemes and airport runway extensions. Labour backbenchers led by John Grogan, MP for Selby, and Clive Betts, MP for Sheffield Attercliffe, say the body's decision-making power should revert to ministers. Betts told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme yesterday: \"I think it is really very worrying that matters such as a new nuclear power station, a new airport or a major new motorway could all be eventually determined by an unaccountable, unelected commissioner, not by a politician who is elected.\" Healey is refusing to back down over this point but is offering a series of other concessions to give MPs more say. The main thrust of the changes is that they will have a vote on new national strategies for nuclear energy and other controversial areas before they are referred to the commission for decision. The one on nuclear power stations will say how many will be required, where they will be sited and how much they will cost. It will also include compensation payments. MPs could vote down or amend the schemes, which would have to be presented to parliament. The change in planning laws is part of a streamlined process to put eight separate schemes into one system and should save the government some £300m a year by avoiding drawn-out procedures, such as the long inquiry into whether to build Heathrow's Terminal Five. The changes will cut down the opportunities for delaying tactics by protesters. Healey said: \"This bill will make the planning system quicker, more transparent and easier for the public to become involved. It will reform the planning system for major infrastructure projects, which is increasingly struggling to deal with the challenges of the 21st century.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-speech-crime-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2012-10-22T15:43:00Z","webTitle":"David Cameron's speech on crime: Politics live blog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-speech-crime-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-speech-crime-live","fields":{"headline":"David Cameron's speech on crime: Politics live blog","bodyText":"• David Cameron has signalled that he will block any attempt to increase the EU budget by more than inflation. In a statement on the EU summit, he said that several EU countries had signed a letter saying an above-inflation budget increase would be unacceptable. The EU budget settlement had to be \"rigorous\", he said. • Cameron has sidestepped questions about whether a no vote in the referendum he is proposing on a renegotiated relationship with the EU would lead to Britain leaving the EU. Although he has not formally committed himself to a referendum, he has said that he wants to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and that a referendum would then be the simplest way of obtaining public consent for that. During the statement, two Tory MPs, Peter Bone and Mark Reckless, asked if a no vote would lead to Britain leaving the EU or whether it would be an \"in/in\" referendum, with a no vote endorsing the status quo. Cameron refused to answer. • Ed Miliband has accused Cameron of weakening Britain's influence within the EU. In his response to Cameron, Miliband said Finland's Europe minister, an Anglophile, complained at the EU summit that Britain was waving goodbye to the EU. The prime minister does not seem to realise that all his bluster about fighting for Britiain is meaningless if he alienates our natural supporters ... He really has become the guy who goes to Europe and picks a fight in an empty room - which is just as well because he normally finds himself in an empty room ... The reality is he has lost control of his party on Europe. We have a prime minister outside the room looking in at Britain's empty seat at the table. There's one thing that our allies in Europe and the British people can agree on: his government's a shambles and it's Britain that suffers. • Philip Dunne, a defence minister, has told MPs that Scotland could lose Royal Navy defence contracts if it went independent. This is what he said when he was asked about the matter at defence questions. The UK has not built a complex warship outside these shores since the second world war; we remain committed to using UK industry to build UK warships. In the unlikely event that Scotland should decide to separate from the UK, the Scottish defence industry would only be eligible to bid for contracts placed by a future Scottish government, or competed for outside the UK, placed by the UK or other governments. Many UK defence contracts are exempted from procurement rules for national security reasons. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here's an afternoon reading list. • Peter Kellner in Prospect looks at the voters who have abandoned Labour since 1997, and considers what policies might appeal to them. What, then, are the messages that chime with the majority of defectors? Redistribution won’t do it. Just 21 per cent want the government to “do far more to help the poor,” while 27 per cent, would prefer the opposite—cutting welfare payments “because the poor should take more responsibility for themselves.” Loyalists prefer redistribution to welfare cuts by two-to-one. There is one radical policy that most defectors support. A law limiting maximum pay to £1m a year is supported by 58 per cent. But two right-wing policies are at least as popular: 59 per cent of defectors want Britain to leave the EU, and a huge 78 per cent want “net immigration reduced to zero”. Equally, though, activists who reassure themselves that Labour’s core supporters reject such views should think again. As many as 41 per cent of loyalists also want Britain out of the EU, and two-thirds of them back zero net immigration. One of the key findings from this analysis is that Labour defectors generally hold more right-wing views than many party activists like to think—but so do millions of Labour loyalists. • Damian McBride on his blog says David Cameron should learn from the mistakes Gordon Brown made when he tried to get his government out of crisis mode. First, [Cameron] – like Gordon – is trying to announce his way out of the crisis, going into each Sunday morning and each PMQs with a fresh attempt to get on top of the news agenda with some random, focus group designed announcement. At its very least, this is a waste of potentially good stories and speeches which should be held back until there’s a chance of them being heard; worse, it leads to the bungled announcement of half-baked policies, like the fuel bills balls-up; and worse still, it leads to ridiculous headlines like “Cameron: Now Mug A Hoodie”. Second, he and his team are fighting forest fires with buckets of sand, when what they need is proper firebreaks, i.e. moments when the pre-existing political news agenda is suspended (or at least turned into a backdrop) while another issue or event comes to the fore. It could be a Budget, a Queen’s Speech, a trip to Washington, a Defence White Paper: anything which obliges the political media to focus their attention elsewhere for a few days, not least – to put it crudely – if they want to get an exclusive preview. So where are the Coalition’s firebreaks? The only one I can see on the horizon is George Osborne’s Autumn Statement on 5th December; that feels a long time away. • Dan Hodges on his blog says Boris Johnson is now featuring in one of Barack Obama’s ads attacking Mitt Romney. • Gavyn Davies on his FT blog explains why the latest thinking from the IMF about fiscal multipliers is so important. The [IMF] authors believe that this is because the fiscal multipliers have turned out to be higher than was assumed when the austerity programmes were designed. In fact, they suggest that the multiplier under current circumstances might be as large as 0.9-1.7, compared to the initial assumption of 0.5. If true, the implication of this would be critical. If the multiplier is 0.5, then an initial public expenditure reduction of 1 per cent of GDP reduces real output by 0.5 per cent. Using normal rules of thumb, this drop in output would in turn reduce taxation or increase public transfers by about 0.2 per cent of GDP, leaving the budget deficit improving by 0.8 per cent of GDP. This ratio of budget improvement to reduced growth might be just about acceptable to democratic governments. If, however, the multiplier is 1.7, then the same initial public spending cut of 1 per cent of GDP would reduce real output by 1.7 per cent. The second round effects of this reduction in output would reduce tax or raise transfers by 0.68 per cent. The net overall improvement in the budget deficit would therefore be only 0.32 per cent. The economy would be in recession, and the budget deficit would hardly improve at all. Even if this were acceptable to governments, it would not be acceptable for very long to their electorates. I've already posted some reaction to the David Cameron speech (or pre-reaction, because it was available before the full text of the speech was published). See 10.57am. Here's some more. From Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform It is all very well to pay providers by results but you must have a result that is meaningful in the first place. The Ministry of Justice is looking at paying providers on whether individuals are reconvicted or not but this is a blunt measure that does not reflect the reality of how people desist from crime. Rather than simply shift from offending to not offending like an electrical switch, people who offend tend to lead chaotic lives and slip in and out of trouble with the law. Sometimes progress is better measured in whether people are reoffending less seriously or less frequently than before. But that kind of progress would not be measured under current proposals, which raises questions as to what success any providers will be able to produce. From Mike Trace, chief executive of the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust We welcome that David Cameron has made clear his determination to focus on ‘making prison work’ using effective rehabilitation, but this policy will only work if the government scales up its commitment to drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes in prisons that actually succeed in reducing reoffending. It is clear from our analysis that ensuring prisoners get access to good quality drug treatment programmes will significantly help deliver the results he seeks. An intensive recovery approach cuts costs as well as crime. For every 100 individuals, the RAPt programme saves £6.3 million on re-sentencing and re-incarcerating. This would equate to savings of £440 million a year if the programme was offered to just 10% of drug dependent prisoners. From Rhodri Davies, policy manager at the Charities Aid Foundation The prime minister is right that payment by results contracts have potential to help charities use their expertise to tackle intractable social problems such as reoffending. But ministers need to improve the way these contracts are designed so charities are not simply squeezed out in favour of large private sector providers. Most charities simply cannot afford to take on contracts to tackle social problems without up-front funding because they are not allowed to carry large financial reserves and have limited access to capital compared to for-profit businesses. Here's a Guardian video with an extract from Cameron's speech. • David Cameron has claimed that being \"tough but intelligent\" will be the hallmark of his approach to law and order. In a wide-ranging speech on law and order which he used to announce the extension of payment-by-results prisoner rehabilitation, Cameron said that the best approach to criminal justice combined punishment with rehabilitation. \"It's not a case of 'prison works' or 'prison doesn't work' - we need to make prison work,\" he said. • Cameron has dismissed some of the government's recent difficulties as \"processology\" and said that he is focusing on the \"big picture\". This is what he said when asked about claims that the government was losing its grip. We need to focus on the big picture. What actually happened last week is that unemployment fell, inflation fell, waiting lists in our hospitals fell, crime fell, the right decision was made about Gary McKinnon. Those are the important things that are happening in an economy where we've created a million private sector jobs in the last two years. There will always be people that will go on endlessly about process and processology and Kremlinology and all the rest of it, what actually matters is what is happening out there. • Cameron has defended his decision to try to hang on to Andrew Mitchell as chief whip. It's the easiest thing in the world as prime minister to just sack someone at the drop of a hat when something goes wrong. I thought the right thing to do was to make sure there was a proper apology. The police didn't want to take it further but it did become apparent he wasn't going to be able to do his job so the right conclusion was reached. It takes longer to discover whether someone can or can't do their job. It's much easier just to fire people, I actually think that is not the right approach. • Cameron has said that the latest developtments at the BBC, where Newsnight editor Peter Rippon is termporarily stepping aside over the Jimmy Savile affair, are \"concerning\". Cameron said: \"The developments today are concerning because the BBC has effectively changed its story about why it dropped the Newsnight programme about Jimmy Savile.\" • Ministers have hinted that they are backing away from plans to allow the recall of MPs. In response to a report from the Commons political and constitutional reform committee, which said the plan should be abandoned, the government said its plan to allow voters to trigger a byelection where an MP is guilty of serious wrong-doing was \"an entirely novel mechanism for our political landscape\". The government said it was still committed to the idea, but it signalled that nothing is going to happen soon. \"To give due consideration to the committee's conclusions and recommendations, the government wishes to take the proper time to reflect on this policy and determine its future direction,\" it said. • Alun Michael and Tony Lloyd have resigned as Labour MPs because they are standing as candidates in the police commissioner elections next month. Here's some copy from the Press Association about David Cameron's visit to Wormwood Scrubs this morning. David Cameron tried to put a week of heavy political criticism behind him as he visited a prison in west London today. The prime minister spent a grey Monday morning touring HMP Wormwood Scrubs, ahead of a major speech designed to recapture the political agenda after weeks of difficulties for the Government. After speaking to inmates in the workshop, and seeing the prison's laundry facilities, Cameron visited a charity-run drug rehabilitation support group in C-Wing. The wing can house 300 prisoners and is nearly full to capacity. Around 45% of the inmates are currently in drug or alcohol rehabilitation programmes. The visit allowed the prime minister to view first hand a group putting into action his vision of charities, voluntary groups and private companies providing rehabilitation services to help turn prisoners' lives around and stop them reoffending. Cameron insisted that a lack of money was not an issue in bringing down the reoffending rate, saying that extending payment-by-results schemes for those helping to rehabilitate prisoners would refocus existing resources. In one of the prison's courtyards, the prime minister said: \"We have got to do more for less, every place here costs £40,000, there are 600 staff that work in this prison - it's not a shortage of money, it's that we haven't been focusing people on what really matters, which is the results.\" Asked if it was a gamble to use private companies and charities to plug gaps, Cameron said: \"We spend billions of pounds on prison and probation but we are not getting the right results. \"In terms of getting charities to do more, it's happening now. I've just been sitting in a cell with a very good drug rehab charity that's working with prisoners trying to get them off drugs, get them clean. \"If that works then that prisoner won't be costing us all that money, won't be robbing houses and causing chaos and won't be returning to our prison system.\" Who would be a politician? They are expected to know what they think, and to be principled and consistent. Yet we (at least, we in the media) are also always expecting them to say something new. It's a hard ask. Today Cameron managed to package his thoughts about law and order into a coherent whole quite effectively. He covered most aspects of the criminal justice system. But, as a speech, it did not really pass the \"new\" test at all. Cameron has been talking about the need for better rehabilitation and the advantages of payment-by-results for years and, although he did announce a national roll-out today, the whole point of piloting these programmes is to pave the way for national implementation, and so this did not come as a huge surprise. (And, by the way, the Peterborough scheme praised by Chris Grayling this morning - see 10.09am - was launched under Labour.) Cameron also rattled through various \"tougher penalty\" measures, but almost all of them had been trailed before. Politicians can solved the consistent/new dilemma by dreaming up a fresh slogan to explain their approach and Cameron had a go at this. He would be \"tough but intelligent\", he said. Fine. But it's not exactly catchy. Here's some more from the section of the Cameron Q&amp;A that I missed because it was not shown on Sky or BBC News. From ITV's Chris Ship From PoliticsHome's Paul Waugh From the Sun's Tom Newton Dunn Here's David Cameron's full quote on the BBC and Jimmy Savile. I think these [BBC] investigations are important and they are independent and they need absolutely to be seen to be independent. The nation is appalled, we are all appalled, by the allegations of what Jimmy Savile did and they seem to get worse by the day. And so every organisation that was involved with him, whether the NHS or the BBC, needs to get to the bottom of what happened. And the developments today are concerning because the BBC has effectively changed its story about why it dropped the Newsnight programme about Jimmy Savile. So these are serious questions. They need to be answered. They need to be answered by these independent reviews that the BBC has established and I'm sure that they will be. Sky and BBC News have now dropped their coverage of the Cameron Q&amp;A. Cameron says having police and crime commissioners will increase accountability. The first question comes from someone from the Prison Reform Trust. Q: What will you do to promote restorative justice? Cameron says this has a part to play. But the government has to take the public with it. People do understand the value of restorative justice. But the government has to show them that these measures can be tough. Q: Do you have confidence in the BBC to carry out the investigation into itself in relation to Jimmy Savile? Cameron says today's developments at the BBC are \"concerning\". The BBC has \"effectively changed its story\". The BBC's investigation has to be thorough, he says. Cameron has finished now. He is going to take questions. Cameron now turns to prevention. Strong families can prevent people from turning to crime, and that is why the government is trying to turn around the lives of troubled families. The government is doing more to promote discipline in schools. And pupil referral units will be turned into academies if they are not performing. Too many of them are just staging posts to a place in a young offender centre, he says. Cameron is now talking about punishment. All community punishments will in future contain an element of punishment, he says. An amendment to legislation to this effect will be introduced tomorrow, he says. The use of GPS tags will be extended (see 10.42am) and other punishments wll be made tougher, he says. He says no one will be able to accuse the governnment of not being tough. But being tough on its own is not enough, he says. I’m not going to try and out-bid any other politician on toughness, saying “let’s just bang them up for longer, let’s have more isolation, and once they’re out they’re on their own”. I say: let’s use that time we’ve got these people inside to have a proper positive impact on them, for all our sakes. It’s not a case of ‘prison works’ or ‘prison doesn’t work’ – we need to make prison work. And once people are on the outside, let’s stick with them, let’s give them proper support… …because it’s not outer space we’re releasing these people into – it’s our streets, our towns, among our families and our children. That’s why this government is engaged in what can only be described as a rehabilitation revolution – led by the new justice secretary, Chris Grayling. His main, driving mission is this: to see more people properly punished, but fewer offenders returning to the system. To achieve that, we’re saying to charities, companies and voluntary organisations – come and help us rehabilitate our prisoners. Cameron is talking about the court system. The government has made courts more flexible, he says. Their hours are being extended. And he announces the government will appoint a new victims commissioner. The previous commissioner, Louise Casey, is now in charge of the troubled families unit. Cameron says the government has saved the police from top-down targets. He says Labour said police cuts would lead to less neighbourhood policing and rising crime. But crime rates are going down, and neighbourhood policing is increasing, he says. And he says the election of police commissioners will make a difference. People claim the public are not interested in these elections, he says. But the website mapping local crime has received 500m hits. That shows people are interested in local policing, he says. Cameron is now on a passage not released in advance. He praises the police. He says they leave home every morning knowing that they could be killed in the line of duty. Years ago he used to go running past Wormwood Scrubs, he says. On his route, he saw a memorial to three officers killed in 1966. And he mentions the two female police officers killed in Manchester recently. David Cameron is speaking now. He is at an event hosted by the Centre for Social Justice, the thinktank set up by Iain Duncan Smith. He says he is looking forward to the CSJ's forthcoming report following up on the Breakthrough Britain report it published several years ago. There does not seem to be much in the speech so far that was not in the extracts released in advance. (See 9.52am.) David Cameron will be delivering his crime speech shortly. As background, it is worth reminding everyone that crime rates in England and Wales are falling and that the chances of becoming a crime victim are at their lowest since the early 1980s. Alan Travis has more details here. And here's a post on the Guardian's data blog with more information about the latest crime figures. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. • Downing Street rejected claims that the relationship between Theresa May, the home secretary, and Eric Holder, the US attorney general, has broken down. On Saturday the Daily Telegraph said Holder was refusing to take calls from May because of her decision not to extradite Gary McKinnon. Asked if the relationship had broken down, the prime minister's spokesman said: \"There is no breakdown in the relationship. We work very closely with the US on a whole range of issues and will continue to do that.\" • Number 10 reaffirmed David Cameron's opposition to an above-inflation increase in the EU budget. \"We do not see the need for an increase in spending above the rate of inflation,\" the spokesman said. He would not say what measure of inflation Cameron would use to judge any proposed budget increase. And he said Number 10 had not been told by the Germans that Angela Merkel would cancel next month's EU summit if Cameron was determined to veto the proposed budget, as the Financial Times reports today (paywall). • Cameron has not ruled out having a public inquiry into the Jimmy Savile affair. But the government is not ordering one now because it wants to allow the police, BBC and Department of Health inquiries to be allowed to take their course, the spokesman said. • Downing Street refused to say whether Cameron thought Andrew Mitchell should take the severance payment he is entitled to claim after resigning from the government. \"It is up to the minister [to decide whether to take it],\" the spokesman said. • Number 10 said that Savile's knighthood could not be removed posthumously because people lose their knighthoods when they die anyway. In response to a question from the reporter, the spokesman said there were no plans to change the law to allow people to keep their knighthoods posthumously so that Savile could then be stripped of his. At the lobby briefing we were told \"operationally\" (ie, on the understanding that it would not be published at that point) the name of a prison David Cameron was visiting this morning. But, on Twitter, Cameron had already revealed all. I'll post a summary of the briefing shortly. And here is some pre-reaction (or whatever you call response to an event that has not yet happened) to the David Cameron speech. From Mark Leech, editor of Converse, the national newspaper for prisoners I very much welcome this revisiting of criminal justice policy, but equally I am deeply sceptical about whether David Cameron can actually deliver his ‘Tough But Intelligent’ criminal justice agenda because, whether you call it the ‘Rehabilitation Revolution’ as he does, or as Tony Blair called it 15 years ago ‘Tough on Crime Tough on the Causes of Crime”, it is ultimately about the same thing in practice; rhetoric about reducing crime. And, while Tony Blair had all the resources of Government behind him in 1997 to deliver his tough on crime tough on the causes of crime policy, we no longer have that luxury – and even with all the resources, Blair gave us 3,000 new criminal offences, 25,000 more prisoners and he failed to address entirely the Tough on the Causes of Crime part of the policy at all. Blair left us with even more of the high-crime, inner-city housing estates that existed when he came to power, and with precisely the same degree of unemployment, school exclusions, poor parenting, drug misuse and gang cultures existing when he left. Forced by a lack of resources to fund his policy Cameron is turning to the private and voluntary sector to help him deliver his ‘Tough But Intelligent’ policy to be announced later today, relying on a ‘Payments By Results’ method of funding it – but behind the scenes I can tell you there are huge arguments about what the ‘Payment By Results’ mechanism actually means – what ‘results’ amount to ‘results’, who assesses those ‘results’ and what level of ‘payment’ are we talking about here? From Vicki Helyar-Cardwell, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance This speech was an opportunity to regain the momentum promised at the start of the coalition government to drive forward a genuine rehabilitation revolution to cut crime, prioritise prevention and reduce the damaging levels of reoffending. The danger is the intelligent bit gets lost at the expense of sounding tough. A truly smart approach would be to focus on offenders making amends for their wrongdoing, treating drug and alcohol addictions that can fuel crime and getting ex-offenders back into real work. Much of this relies on wider society – organisations and people outside of the criminal justice system. The real strength of the Prime Minister’s 2006 so-called ‘hug a hoodie speech’ is that it recognised that criminal justice and social justice are inextricably linked. Yet several years on, the criminal justice system still often picks up the pieces when others have failed, the high levels of children in care who end up in our youth justice system are a telling example of this ... Criminal Justice Alliance organisations, working in prisons and with offenders and their families in the community, report that prison overcrowding and budget cuts mean rehabilitation is being undermined. Making governors more accountable for what happens after prison is welcome, but this will backfire without efforts to curb huge prison overcrowding that blights much of the positive work in prisons. Overcrowding extracts a heavy price from prisoners, prison staff and voluntary sector working to cut reoffending, and ultimately harms communities to which ex-prisoners will return. The Prime Minister’s speech comes the week after the Chief Inspector of Prisons said that in order to deliver a rehabilitation revolution, government needs to reduce numbers of people in prison or invest more in prison budgets. From Isabel Hardman at Coffee House It’s clear the government has had a bad week when the Prime Minister pops up on a Monday with a crowd-pleasing policy announcement. Recent re-launches have been shared by senior Lib Dems and Tories following the collapse of Lords reform, for example, to demonstrate that the Coalition is still working well. But today, the Lib Dems are nowhere to be seen: the Prime Minister’s big crime announcement is a response to a terrible week for the Conservative party, rather than the coalition as a whole. From Tim Montgomerie at ConservativeHome The speech is being presented by some in the media as a response to the Government’s difficult week but, in reality, the speech and whole approach has long been in the pipeline. Chris Grayling was thinking about a rehabilitation revolution when he was Shadow Home Secretary. Working with Nick Herbert and the Centre for Social Justice the Tory leadership was interested in reducing reoffending rates for most of the last seven years. From Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary There is nothing intelligent or tough about cutting frontline police officers, reducing the power of judges to give tough sentences or cutting support for innocent victims of crime. This is nothing more than a smokescreen to try and cover up Andrew Mitchell losing his job on Friday and 29 wasted months of dithering on law and order. This out of touch Government must think the public are stupid - it’s these kind of actions that makes the public so cynical about politicians. Rehashed announcements, rushed legislation and ill-thought out and evidence-free policies risk undermining public confidence in our criminal justice system. This is empty rhetoric from a weak Prime Minister of an incompetent government, designed only to keep rebellious Tory MPs happy rather than what works in keeping our communities safe. I'm off to the Number 10 briefing now. I'll post again after 11.30am. You can read all today's Guardian politics stories here. And all the Guardian politics stories filed yesterday, including some in today's paper, are here. As for the rest of the papers, here is the PoliticsHome list of top 10 must-reads, here is the ConservativeHome roundup of today's political stories and here is the New Statesman list of top 10 comment articles from today's papers. And here are some stories I found particularly interesting. • Robert Winnett in the Daily Telegraph says Oliver Dowden, David Cameron’s deputy chief of staff, has told an American broadcaster that much of his time is spent on crisis management. [Dowden] said: “Most of my time is spent on day-to-day crisis management — is the term we use.” The aide jokingly added that “we are not permanently in crisis” before disclosing how he was trying to ensure that Conservative MPs stayed “on message” during media interviews. However, he admitted that he often only discovered the daily political agenda by listening to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “Of course, the first thing I do in the morning, if I’m not woken up by my very young children, I turn on the Today programme and hear what’s going on,” he said. “Hopefully we will have some sense of what’s coming up anyway, but often you’ll get surprised by what’s going on …” • The Labour MP Glora de Piero tells the Independent why she has been going around the country meeting ordinary groups of people to find out why they hate politicians. “With most of them the initial instinct has been ‘Why would we want to do that?’,” she said. “We got rebuffed by a lot of aerobics classes in Billericay. The evening classes were like ‘Why would we want to do that?’ – but finally we got a day one. But once they have started, there is no stopping them. You can kind of feel an awakening in them, because they love it, because no one ever asked them normally. “It’s pretty bad. They feel like we don’t understand their lives. They obviously get most of their impressions of politicians from TV – Prime Minister’s Questions and clips from the news. They all think we’re absolutely ridiculous the way we shout and abuse each other. In interviews, they think that we won’t answer the questions and just say what we were going to say anyway.” A more sensitive soul might find it depressing to hear their profession traduced in this way, but Ms de Piero asserts that she likes the contact with ordinary people. What gets her down is getting on the train back to Westminster, where people work “in a bubble”, and where MPs know that they have a serious problem with their public image but do not know what to do about it. The answer, she believes, is to persuade more people from working class backgrounds doing everyday jobs to stand for Parliament – although she admits she does not know how that can be achieved when the process for getting selected seems designed to put off anyone who is not a political obsessive. • Steve Connor in the Independent says leading energy scientists have written to the paper saying the government is planning to offer a subsidy to the nuclear power industry in what would be a significant U-turn. • Chris Grayling says in an article in the Sun that the government will make more use of GPS tags to monitor the activities of paedophiles released into the community. And here are the main points from the inteview that Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, gave to the Today programme about the government's rehabilitation initiative. I've taken the quotes from PoliticsHome. • Grayling said that too many prisoners were released without being given help to stop them reoffending. The reality at the moment, all too often, is that we release somebody on to the streets after prison, with £46 in their pocket, relatively little, if any, support. Probation officers do good work with those who have been in prison for longer periods; those who’ve been in prison for shorter periods get no support at all. • He said a pilot payment-by-results rehabilitation scheme in Peterborough had been a success. He had been to visit this scheme, he said. \"First indications are very encouraging,\" he went on. \"We get the detailed statistics this month, but from what I’ve seen so far, I’m very encouraged that it does indeed work.\" • He said he wanted private companies and charities to be involved in running payment-by-results rehabilitation programmes. • He rejected suggestions that providers would be incentivised to fiddle the figures. \"In many ways the measurements for payment-by-results in criminal justice are very binary,\" he said. \"Do you reoffend or don’t you? if you're back in court, back in a police cell, then it’s not worked and the providers don’t get paid.\" • He said former offenders could play an important role in rehabilitation programmes. I’ve seen examples in community projects of former offenders, perhaps former gang members, mentoring younger offenders to say, ‘Well look, I’ve been through it all, I’ve gone straight - there’s a better place to be.' That can be enormously powerful, and you’ve got a lot of that in the voluntary sector. • He said that, having promoted payment-by-results in the work programme as welfare minister, he was keen to apply the same principle in the justice system. • He said it was \"very silly\" of Lord Blair, the former Metropolitan police commissioner, to say that people should not vote in the police commissioner elections. I think it’s a very silly thing to say. I’m very sorry he’s said that. Nobody should ever look upon a democratic election as something they shouldn't take part in. Here are some more key points from the Cameron speech, based on the (fairly lengthy) extracts released overnight. • Cameron will argue that he has been trying to introduce a new \"tough but intelligent\" approach to law and order. He will say that being \"tough but intelligent\" is a way of avoiding just being authoritarian or liberal. That is just a \"sterile debate\", he will say. See 9.07am. (Unfortunately, this passage of the speech just sounds like a pale imitation of Tony Blair's \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\". Cameron might have been better just adopting that slogan wholesale.) • He will say that criminals deserve \"retribution\". Retribution is not a dirty word, it is important to society that revulsion against crime is properly recognised. (The use of the word \"retribution\" is one of the elements of the speech that excited the Mail on Sunday because of its Old Testament overtones, but Cameron just seems to be using it as another word for punishment.) • He will say that prisoners need rehabilitation because \"being tough isn't a successful strategy in itself\". Come with me to any prison in this country. There you’ll meet muggers, robbers, and burglars. But you’ll also meet young men who can’t read, teenagers on drugs, people who’ve never worked a day in their life. These people need help so they can become part of the solution and not remain part of the problem. Recognising this isn’t soft, or liberal. It’s common sense. We’ll never create a safer society unless we give people, especially young people, opportunities and chances away from crime. Prevention is the cheapest and most effective way to deal with crime – everything else is simply picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before. • He will say the government will extend \"payment-by-results\" as a means of providing prisoner rehabilitation. When this government came to power we were spending £40,000 a year just on banging people up. With payment by results, your money goes into what works… …prisoners going straight, crime coming down, our country getting safer. It’s such a good idea I want to put rocket boosters under it… …indeed today I have an announcement to make. By the end of 2015, I want to see payment by results spread right across rehabilitation. • He will say that rehabilitation programmes will be offered to prisoners serving short sentences, not just to offenders who have been jailed for a year or more, as happens now. • He will say that tackling crime is part of the \"aspiration nation\" agenda he set out in his party conference speech. \"We will not rise as a country if we leave millions behind and write off whole communities,\" he will say. David Cameron is going to give a speech on law and order later today and in it he is going to complain that politicians who speak on criminal justice are either portrayed as authoritarian, bang-’em-up merchants or soppy liberals. For many people, I’m the person associated with those three words, two of which begin with ‘H’, and one of which is ‘hoodie’… …even though I never actually said it. For others, I’m the politician who has argued for tough punishment. So do I take a tough line on crime – or a touchy-feely one? In no other public debate do the issues get polarised like this. On climate change you don’t have to be in denial or campaigning to get every car off the road. Life isn’t that simple – so government policy isn’t that simple. And yet with the crime debate, people seem to want it black or white. Lock ‘em up or let ‘em out. Blame the criminal or blame society. ‘Be tough’ or ‘act soft’. Cameron will argue that this binary approach is simplistic and he will say that he wants to “move the debate on”. But, judging by the way the speech has been reported so far, he’s not having much luck. The speech was previewed in the Mail on Sunday yesterday in a story that suggested it was all about hellfire-and-damnation authoritarianism. The headline read: \"Cameron: 'It's time to mug a hoodie.'\" Having read the speech extracts released overnight, I see that it’s not like that all; it’s mostly about promoting more prisoner rehabilitation by extending the payment-by-results scheme. Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, was talking about this on the Today programme about an hour ago. I’ll publish more extracts from the speech, and highlights from the Grayling interview, soon, as well as covering the speech and the reaction to it when it happens. Otherwise, it’s relatively quiet. Here’s the agenda for the day. 12.15pm: David Cameron gives a speech on law and order. 2.30pm: Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 3.15pm: Sir Nicholas Macpherson, the Treasury permanent secretary, gives evidence to the Commons public accounts committee about the Treasury accounts. 3.30pm: Cameron makes a statement in the Commons on last week’s EU summit. As usual, I'll also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.

Dai's DPRK interlocutors had responded that they wanted bilateral engagement with the United States first and that they would consider next steps, including possible multilateral talks, depending on the outcome of U.S.-DPRK bilateral talks. Dai said that Premier Wen's October 4-6 visit to Pyongyang would be another opportunity for China and North Korea to exchange views on the nuclear issue. On Iran, Dai said China and the United States had the same objectives but that China would work on Iran in its own way. China believed peaceful negotiation would achieve a more meaningful resolution than sanctions would, and, Dai urged, the United States should be more patient. D responded that patience could not be unlimited in light of Iran's continued enrichment program in violation of UNSC resolutions. Dai assured the Deputy Secretary that China and the United States would work together to prepare for President Obama's November visit to China. Dai supported the idea of a \"concise and substantive\" joint document to be issued in conjunction with the visit. End Summary. Full Strategy to Address North Korea ------------------------------------ 4. (S) The Deputy Secretary met with State Councilor Dai Bingguo for an eighty-minute discussion on North Korea, Iran, and the U.S.-China relationship on September 29. The Deputy Secretary stressed the importance of fashioning a full strategy to address the DPRK nuclear issue and having a unified position among Six-Party Talks partners and allies that would lead to an effective and diplomatic resolution of the problem. He expressed support for Premier Wen Jiabao's October 4-6 trip to Pyongyang and said both countries should work to persuade Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks and to reaffirm the 2005 Joint Statement. The United States was prepared to have meaningful, substantive engagement with BEIJING 00002965 002 OF 004 a senior North Korean official and would use the any bilateral discussion to encourage Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks. The Deputy Secretary expressed appreciation for China's efforts to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1874. U.S.-China Relations on Positive Track -------------------------------------- 5. (S) State Councilor Dai said that President Obama and President Hu had had several opportunities to meet in recent months. After watching the two leaders interact in New York, Dai observed, the two presidents appeared to be \"old friends.\" Dai thanked the U.S. Government for its \"careful arrangements\" for President Hu's visit to New York, as well as for National People's Congress Chairman Wu Bangguo's recent, successful visit to the United States. Dai expressed appreciation to President Obama, Secretary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Geithner for their personal contributions in making the Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&amp;ED) a great success. Dai was confident that the S&amp;ED would have a positive global impact and confided that China had already begun thinking about the next round. The U.S.-China relationship was off to a good start under the new U.S. administration despite some \"unpleasant things.\" Dai urged the two countries to keep up a good momentum in the bilateral relationship and to work hard t o avoid \"setbacks.\" Dai's Visit to Pyongyang ------------------------ 6. (S) Regarding his recent visit to Pyongyang, Dai briefly recounted his two-hour meeting with DPRK leader Kim Jong-il. Dai said he was on relatively familiar terms with Kim, because he had met with Kim on several occasions in his previous role as Director of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee International Liaison Department (CCID). Dai admitted that in contrast with his discussion with Vice FM Kang (see below) his conversation with Kim was not as direct and candid and joked that he \"did not dare\" to be that candid with the DPRK leader. Dai noted that Kim had lost weight when compared to when he last saw him three years earlier, but that Kim appeared to be in reasonably good health and still had a \"sharp mind.\" Kim told Dai that he had hoped to invite the Chinese official to share some liquor and wine, but that because of scheduling problems, he would have to defer the offer to Dai's next visit to North Korea. Kim Jong-il had a reputation among the Chinese for being \"quite a good drinker,\" and, Dai said, he had asked Kim if he still drank alcohol. Kim said yes. Dai said he also met briefly with Kim Yong-nam, President of the Supreme People's Assembly, who invited him to attend the performance of a famous Chinese opera, \"The Dream of the Red Chamber.\" 7. (S) Dai said that he had had frank and blunt discussions with DPRK First Vice Foreign Minister Kang Suk-ju that totaled over two and one half hours. Dai said he told Kang that denuclearization should be Pyongyang's first choice and that it was important for North Korea to return to Six-Party Talks. He had stressed to Kang that the Six-Party Talks mechanism was useful and explained that the ultimate resolution of the Korean Peninsula issue could not be resolved without the participation of the Six Parties. According to Dai, Kang responded that North Korea was still committed to the goal of denuclearization. Dai believed that the North Koreans had not categorically denied the Six-Party Talks and opined that under the right circumstances, it might be possible to revive the Six-Party Talks process. Dai's North Korean interlocutors had emphasized the strong security threat it faced. The North Koreans told Dai that they wanted to have dialogue with the United States first and that they would consider next steps, including possible multilateral talks, depending on their conversation with the United States. North Korea held \"great expectations for the United States,\" said Dai. DPRK officials had told Dai that North Korea viewed former President Clinton's visit to Pyongyang positively. 8. (S) Even though he had not had an opportunity to visit or observe any place other than Pyongyang, Dai said, his impression of North Korea was that the domestic situation appeared stable and normal. Dai opined that the DPRK BEIJING 00002965 003 OF 004 appeared focused on two issues: improving its relationship with the United States and developing its economy. U.S.-DPRK Bilateral Engagement ------------------------------ 9. (S) China was aware that the United States was considering possible re-engagement with North Korea and supported U.S.-DPRK bilateral discussions, said Dai. With bilateral dialogue, there was \"no limit to how far you could go.\" China appreciated U.S. understanding and support for Premier Wen's upcoming visit to Pyongyang. President Hu had already informed President Obama of the trip. Dai explained that it would have been \"impolite\" for China to not reciprocate with a high-level visit to Pyongyang after DPRK Premier Kim Yong-il had visited Beijing in March for the 60th anniversary celebration of Sino-DPRK ties. Wen's visit would provide an opportunity for China and North Korea to exchange views on the nuclear issue, stated Dai. 10. (S) The Deputy Secretary thanked Dai for sharing his perceptions of the North Korea nuclear issue and stressed that President Obama wanted to make clear to the North Korean people and to Kim Jong-il that the United States did not have any hostile intent toward North Korea. The United States was ready to move forward to normalize relations with North Korea if Pyongyang moved toward denuclearization. The Deputy Secretary expressed hope that North Korea would agree to a meeting between Ambassador Bosworth and First VFM Kang Suk-ju to achieve that goal. Iran ---- 11. (S) The Deputy Secretary said the United States valued the joint effort it took to create the P5-plus-1 foreign ministers statement on Iran. He acknowledged that the United States and Iran had a long and complicated history of mistrust. The Deputy Secretary explained U.S. objectives and stressed that all sides had to take confidence-building steps that would lead to a diplomatic resolution. Recent disclosures by Iran underscored the need to deal with the issue urgently, and it was important that Iran give a strong signal during the October 1 meeting that demonstrated it was ready for serious engagement. 12. (S) Dai responded that China and the United States saw eye to eye on the Iran nuclear issue. Nuclear states should reduce their nuclear arsenal with the goal of eventual elimination and should work to prevent other nations, including Iran, from developing nuclear weapons. However, China and the United States had different considerations on how we advanced these goals. With a history of mistrust and mutual suspicion between the United States and Iran, it would not be easy to resolve the Iran nuclear issue. Dai urged the United States to have more patience, address Iran's legitimate concerns, and work to identify and expand on the positive areas in the bilateral relationship. 13. (S) Dai characterized President Obama's policy to resolve issues through dialogue and engagement as \"wise.\" Sanctions might work up to a point, but China believed peaceful negotiation would achieve a more meaningful resolution. Dai warned that pressing too hard might risk antagonizing Iran. Iran was not a small country, it had a long history and culture, and its people were not dumb. Dai urged the United States to resolve the issue in a \"smart\" manner. One meeting would not be able to resolve all problems, so the United States lower its expectation for the October 1 meeting. China would work on Iran in its own way and would urge Iran to seize the window of opportunity. Dai said China and the United States had the same objective, but said that each country would play a different role in achieving that objective. 14. (S) The Deputy replied that it was Iran that was \"impatient\" in its ongoing program of uranium enrichment in violation of the UNSC resolutions. The U.S. and the P5 1 would be more willing to be patient in discussions if Iran agreed to suspend its enrichment and forgo its overall? program. This would create an appropriate context for all sides to address underlying issues of concern. BEIJING 00002965 004 OF 004 U.S. National Security Strategy ------------------------------- 15. (S) Noting the Deputy's interest in \"strategy\" Dai asked whether the Obama administration had an overarching national security strategy. the Deputy Secretary said that the National Security Strategy, which would likely be issued before the end of the year, would articulate the administration's global strategy. He noted that the Secretary had recently identified major themes during her speech to the Council of Foreign Relations, including the importance of global cooperation in confronting today's challenges. In that context, the U.S.-China relationship would play a core role. Dai said he looked forward to reading the strategy paper. President Obama Visit to China ------------------------------ 16. (S) Dai said that President Obama had recently told President Hu that he looked forward to having a \"magnificent\" visit to China. Asked how China could help achieve this, the Deputy Secretary said the two countries should seek to demonstrate to our peoples and to the international community how the U.S.-China relationship would help address global challenges in areas such as public health, nonproliferation and the environment. The two countries should seek to demonstrate how U.S.-China ties were between the two peoples, not just between the governments, diplomats and leaders. Dai assured the Deputy Secretary that China would work with the U.S. to prepare a successful visit. It would be \"great,\" said Dai, if the two sides could agree on language for the joint visit document that would be \"concise, as well as substantive.\" Global Nuclear Security Summit ------------------------------ 17. (S) Asked about U.S.-sought outcomes and goals for the Nuclear Security Summit, the Deputy Secretary explained that President Obama had laid out the three pillars of his nuclear policy during his Prague speech. The Nuclear Security Summit was designed to focus on one of those pillars-the need to safeguard nuclear material against theft or diversion. The risk of proliferation had increased with the expansion of new nuclear power programs and with the existence of unsecured legacy nuclear materials in former Soviet states. We needed to have assurances that the peaceful development of nuclear power programs and nuclear research did not pose proliferation risks. The Same Boat ------------- 18. (S) The U.S.-China relationship was of crucial importance, said Dai. China would do its best to cooperate with the United States wherever possible. \"If we expand the pie for the common interest, the pie will be larger and more delicious.\" Together, the two sides should work collaboratively for the good of the world, especially since the two countries were \"passengers in the same boat.\" Dai urged careful management of the relationship and respect for each other's core interests and concerns. 19. (U) The Deputy Secretary cleared this message.

Confirmation that the government will sign on to the 10:10 commitment as part of the coalition agreement between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats came as Mr Cameron visited the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), speaking alongside the newly appointed Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne. Mr Huhne said: \"Climate change is, in my view, in our view, the greatest challenge for mankind.\" Addressing staff at DECC, the new Prime Minister said: \"I want us to be the greenest government ever. It's a very simple ambition and one that I'm absolutely committed to achieving.\" Mr Huhne will oversee a steering group to ensure the government meets its emissions targets. The group will also include representatives from other departments and the private sector. A DECC representative told Guardian Sustainable Business that no concrete plans have materialised for the reductions, but that information on departmental energy use should be available on-line by the end of the summer. Mr Cameron said: \"This is transparency in action to drive forward the cuts in carbon emissions. It's a new way of doing climate change, it's a new way of doing politics. It's in the spirit of our age and I think it will make a very big difference.\" Chris Huhne is one of five Liberal Democrats to join Mr Cameron's cabinet, in an agreement under which Liberal Democrats will allow expansion of nuclear power in the UK despite their party's traditional opposition. Mr Huhne replaces former secretary Ed Miliband, now seen as a possible contender in the leadership contest in the Labour Party. Before the election, analysts predicted that a weak Tory government might have been held back from assertive action on climate by change by backbench MPs, many of whom are sceptical of the benefits of legislation designed to reduce carbon emissions. The agreements reached in the Con-Lib coalition agreements, however, promise a number of environmental actions, including the establishment of a smart grid, a green investment bank, and the provision of a floor price for carbon. According to Friends of the Earth, during the election, Lib Dem candidates were most likely amongst the major parties to pledge to back a set of measures on climate change. The Conservatives were least likely."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/2009/dec/01/zac-goldsmith-environment-david-cameron","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-12-01T00:33:29Z","webTitle":"Zac Goldsmith: Tories will ring in era of integrity – and we don't need Sun","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/dec/01/zac-goldsmith-environment-david-cameron","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/dec/01/zac-goldsmith-environment-david-cameron","fields":{"headline":"Zac Goldsmith: Tories will ring in era of integrity – and we don't need Sun","bodyText":"Zac Goldsmith, the Tory candidate for Richmond, and one of David Cameron's closest advisers on the environment, insisted yesterday he would not be corrupted by power, and said politics had to enter a new era of transparency and integrity to regain trust, including on green taxes. In remarks lasting over an hour, he insisted no new nuclear power stations would be built under a Tory government, admitted he would not want the support of Rupert Murdoch's Sun and described the paper's campaign against Gordon Brown over his treatment of bereaved relatives in the Afghan war as repulsive. He also said that if a Cameron government did not make progress on environmental issues after one term in power, then the Tories' political share price would go \"through the floor\". He was speaking a day after he admitted that he was a non-domicile, but insisted that he had done nothing wrong in inheriting this tax status from his father. He stressed he paid tax on all his UK activities, and denied he had avoided paying capital gains tax on any of his British activities. Speaking at an event in London organised by a semi-spiritual group, Alternatives, he admitted that he was seen by some as a wealthy Tory green toff, but refused to take questions on his tax status with reporters afterwards. He insisted: \"I find it hard to imagine how I would be corrupted by power because I have no great career path planned out.\" He said the reputation of politics had fallen to a new low, but that politics was changing for the good due to the expenses scandal. The controversy over his tax status did not lead Goldsmith to hold back on expressing stark views on other issues. He called for a mandatory ban on plastic bags in supermarkets, a scaling back of the BBC to its core purpose and the closure of the food standards agency. He also predicted President Obama had used up his political capital on health issues and that no deal on carbon emissions would be possible at Copenhagen. The single biggest block to action on green issues in Britain he said was the media. He said \"politicians are afraid of one thing and one thing only and that is losing their job, they are afraid of being booted out in the subsequent election that is the thing that motivates most politicians. As long as the media remains completely crippling violently hostile to green talk and green solutions, I do not think politicians will really have the courage to grapple with this issue.\" He said \"until politicians put a cost on those things that do have a cost, such as forest pollution, waste, use of scarce resources, we don't have a hope.\" At the same time he predicted the fate of a Cameron government rested on its performance on green issues. \"If after five years we have not had a significant shift in the right direction, the political share price of David Cameron and the Conservative party will have gone through the floor. The Tory party will be brutalised.\" He said the admission \"we cannot get out of this mess without green taxes is absolutely incumbent on total honesty and transparency, and you have got to be bullish, or there is no point in doing it\". He also said he hoped Rupert Murdoch would not be behind Cameron in power. He said that the Sun's treatment of Gordon Brown over his letter to the mother of a bereaved soldier had left him with \"a very odd feeling, that my heart went out to Gordon Brown and I was repulsed by the Sun and I thought 'My God, I did not want this newspaper to be backing my campaign.' It is immoral and unethical and wrong. The Conservative party by default got caught up by this which is a shame.\" He said the association with the Sun had led to a fall in Tory support. Presaging a Tory row to come, he predicted that if the party sticks to its existing policy, it would never allow the building of a new nuclear power station. He said Tory policy \"was to give a green light to nuclear power as long as there is no call on the taxpayer, not just in terms of building, but maintenance, security and disposal of waste.. In the history of nuclear power there has never been a station built without huge use of taxpayers' subsidy\". He also warned the effect of environmentalists trying to suppress climate change deniers \"was only driving more and more people into the camps of sceptics. Environmentalists so used to be squashed at every moment have suddenly got a good stage, and they have not been sharing it. That is a an awful form of politics. We need to engage.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2010/jun/30/simon-burns-simon-hoggarts-sketch","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-29T23:08:02Z","webTitle":"Simon Burns gets too hot to handle | Simon Hoggart's sketch","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/jun/30/simon-burns-simon-hoggarts-sketch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2010/jun/30/simon-burns-simon-hoggarts-sketch","fields":{"headline":"Simon Burns gets too hot to handle","bodyText":"Mr Simon Burns is the Tory MP for Chelmsford. He is very choleric, in the old medieval sense of having too much of one particularly bodily humour. Or ill-humour, as we might say. His face can turn from normal, ie politicians' pasty, to brick red in the time it would take a chameleon to register it had just missed the last bus. Today, Mr Burns was driven to the edge of his reason – a distance which, to be frank, is not very great. He is a junior health minister, and was answering questions on that topic. He made it his habit, when being questioned by his own side, to turn round and address them directly instead of facing the microphone and addressing the House as a whole. Not a great solecism, but requiring a modest reproof, which is what it got. The Speaker asked him to face forward, and perhaps goaded by the fact that Mr Burns has previous form, added: \"It's a very simple point. I've made it to others, and they understood it.\" Mr Burns, who until then had sounded as precise and faintly sinister as his namesake in the Simpsons, the owner of the Springfield nuclear power facility, erupted in a fury at this rather slight slight. His face went from white to pink to fuschia to scarlet to crimson and on to beetroot in perhaps three seconds. He glowered, he gurned, he churned. He started talking, and not to himself. We heard the words \"stupid\" and \"dwarf\", more than once. Some of my colleagues claim to have detected the word \"sanctimonious\" in there somewhere as well. At one point he held his hand out, at what I can only conclude would be the height of a dwarf. He went on rattling, like an ancient car whose engine continues to run even after the ignition has been cut off. An Ulster MP tried in vain to ask a question. Later Ian Paisley Jr, a man who should have been inured from childhood to the sound of volcanic rage, later complained that it was out of order for someone to \"berate, scoff, scold and hiss at the Chair while another member is trying to ask a question\". Mr Burns would not simmer down. He continued his beratement, his scoffing, his scolding and his hissing. At one point he had to be calmed by a gentle pat from Michael Fabricant. Fabricant! A man himself never knowingly underexcited. After a while Mr Burns calmed down enough to make a few sarcastic remarks about not knowing which way to look – \"all right, I'll look forward!\" But his hand drummed the dispatch box like the wings of a living butterfly pinned to a board. The Speaker, traditionally, does not get mired in these rows. But his wife can. Sally Bercow tweeted: \"So much for the new politics, eh, Mr Burns? # Nasty Tories # Low grade abuse. Mr B. is Speaker, so get over it.\" In the long term, we learned something which was, perhaps, more worrying. Mr David Tredinnick has been selected as a member of the backbench committee on health. Mr Tredinnick is a great believer in the curative powers of homeopathy. Next: an astrologer joins the Bank of England monetary policy committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jan/29/climate-change-carbon-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-29T17:57:44Z","webTitle":"US pledges to cut federal government emissions by 28% by 2020","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/29/climate-change-carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jan/29/climate-change-carbon-emissions","fields":{"headline":"US pledges to cut federal government emissions by 28% by 2020","bodyText":"Barack Obama used his presidential authority to help advance his climate change agenda today, announcing that the US federal government and agencies would cut their giant carbon footprints by 28% by 2020. The announcement was held up by administration officials as evidence of Obama's commitment to his climate and energy agenda, which has run into opposition in Congress and from coal, oil and manufacturing groups. The White House said the targets – which are set against 2008 emissions levels – would reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions by 80m metric tons by 2020, and save the government between $8bn (£5bn) and $11bn in energy costs. Obama will also propose a tripling of government loan guarantees for new nuclear reactors to more than $54bn, an administration official said, a move sure to win over some Republican lawmakers who want more nuclear power to be part of climate change legislation. The loan guarantees, which follow Obama's pledge in his State of the Union address to work to expand nuclear power production, will be announced as part of his budget proposal on Monday, the official said. The federal goverment is the largest single user of fuel and electricity in the country and is responsible for emissions to match. Including the department of defence, it owns nearly 500,000 buildings, more than 600,000 vehicles, and it purchases $500bn in goods and services every year. \"As the largest energy consumer in the US, we have a responsibility to American citizens to reduce our energy use and become more efficient,\" said President Obama. \"Our goal is to lower costs, reduce pollution, and shift Federal energy expenses away from oil and towards local, clean energy.\" The White House ordered federal government departments last October to begin measuring their use of electricity and fuel, and make energy savings. Nancy Sutley, the chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the effort was an important show of leadership. \"It shows the commitment of federal government to lead by example and to take on its responsibility to reduce pollution and help stimulate clean energy economy,\" she said. The cuts will come from across 35 government agencies and departments. The Treasury department pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 33%. The department of Defence – which operates 300,000 of those government buildings – pledged to cut its emissions by 34%. However, that effort excludes combat operations, and would cover just 40% of DoD greenhouse gas emissions. Sutley said government departments across the country were already taking action, installing solar panels and wind turbines. The National Renewable Energy Labs in Denver was aiming to reduce energy use of its data centre by 65%. Today's announcement covers only direct emissions from electricity in government office buildings and military installations, and petrol for government cars. Departments are to report back in 2010 about other potential areas of energy savings, including workers' commutes. The order also does not cover government contractors, officials said. The initiative comes at a time when the Obama administration is determined to demonstrate its commitment to action on climate change. Obama in his State of the Union address pledged to work to help build Republican support for climate change proposals now under discussion in the Senate. But most observers think getting a climate bill through Congress in 2010 still remains a long shot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2010/oct/07/georges-charpak-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2010-10-07T17:32:36Z","webTitle":"Georges Charpak obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/oct/07/georges-charpak-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2010/oct/07/georges-charpak-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Georges Charpak obituary","bodyText":"Georges Charpak, who has died aged 86, won the Nobel prize for physics in 1992 for his invention and subsequent development of the multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC), a type of particle detector now widely used in high-energy particle physics, biophysics and medicine. He developed the device, consisting of an array of parallel wires suspended in a gas, and kept at high voltage, in 1968 while he was working at Cern, the European Centre for Nuclear Research, in Geneva. \"I have worked on many detectors. Some were very elegant and useless,\" he once said. The MWPC was far from useless. As in the Geiger counter, a proportional counter uses a high-tension wire, which runs through a metal enclosure filled with gas, the walls of which are held at ground potential. If an electrically charged particle passes through the tube, it ionizes atoms of gas in its immediate vicinity. The resulting ions and electrons are accelerated by the electric field around the wire, causing a cascade of ionization, which is collected on the wire, giving an electric current proportional to the energy of the original particle. This allows the experimenter to count particles as well as determine their energy. In high-energy particle physics experiments, it is also valuable to observe the particle's path. For a long time, bubble chambers were used for this purpose, but as electronics improved during the 1960s, there was a desire for detectors with fast electronic read-out. Charpak's discovery of how to replace an isolated wire in a proportional chamber with hundreds of thousands of independent wires proved revolutionary. By recording which wires had pulses of electric current, one can see the particle's path; the direction of the curves shows how the particles are charged. Charpak combined this with the idea of the proportional counter to determine the energy. This increased the data collection rate by a factor of 1,000 over previous techniques, and rapidly became a standard tool in particle physics. The chamber permitted particles to be tracked with a precision of better than 1mm, as a result of which several novel ephemeral subatomic particles have been discovered, such as the tau-lepton – a heavy version of the electron – and exotic varieties of quarks. Today, his detectors are used as essential components in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at Cern. The magnetic fields involved in deflecting the paths of particles in these detectors are often quite strong. A piece of folklore at Cern tells how on one occasion, Charpak was sitting on a metal chair while working on an MWPC. He and his team had spent several months carefully attaching thousands of thin wires in the apparatus. One day, he moved too close to the magnetic field. The magnet pulled his metal chair out from under him and smashed it into the chamber, ripping all the wires and ruining the detector. Charpak hated hierarchies. His original small detectors were used in tandem inside bigger detectors, and the teams of scientists involved also grew. He once said: \"When I saw groups with more than 1,000 physicists, I became scared. So I decided to switch to the application of my detectors to medicine and biology.\" Here he had some success in the field of radiology for children. However, Charpak himself made no great fortunes from his detectors, saying: \"Physicists are not necessarily businessmen. You can have as many Nobel prizes as you want, but once you go out to industry, it's a completely different story.\" Charpak was born to Jewish parents in in eastern Poland, now Dubrovytsia in Ukraine. His family moved to Paris when he was seven. During the second world war, he was a member of the resistance, and was imprisoned in 1943. The following year he was deported to the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, where he remained until it was liberated in 1945. He returned to France, becoming a French citizen in 1946. After graduating from the École des Mines de Paris in 1948 with a degree in civil engineering, he joined the National Centre for Scientific Research, receiving his doctorate in 1954 at the Collège de France. His initial involvement in nuclear physics gradually focused on high-energy particles. From 1959 to 1991 he worked at Cern, but he continued to have ideas after he left. Recently he devised a radon detector that could help predict earthquakes. Charpak was a strong advocate of nuclear power, but is best known in France for having radically changed the way that science is taught in French elementary schools. After making the surprising discovery that just 3% of such schools introduce their students to science, Charpak set up La Main à la Pâte (Hands On), which encouraged children to investigate simple scientific problems on a practical level, rather than merely study theory. The approach has spread to several countries around the world. He was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1985 and received many honours and awards. President Nicolas Sarkozy's office issued a statement following his death, describing him as a \"great humanist whose life and commitment are an example for the nation and for young people\". He is survived by his wife, Dominique, two sons and a daughter. • Georges Charpak, physicist, born 8 March 1924; died 29 September 2010"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2011/mar/20/japan-investors-sit-tight","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2011-03-20T00:01:02Z","webTitle":"Japan investors urged to sit tight and await the fight back","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/mar/20/japan-investors-sit-tight","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2011/mar/20/japan-investors-sit-tight","fields":{"headline":"Japan investors urged to sit tight and await the fight back","bodyText":"The earthquake and tsunami in Japan created a tragedy on a global scale that dwarfs the trivial concerns of UK investors. But people with exposure to the Japanese stock market and economy will inevitably be worrying about their investments, and wondering what to do with any exposed assets – particularly because Japan has been a rich source of gains in recent years. Out of 65 funds in the Japan sector, just eight have lost money during the past year, while only two have posted losses over a three-year period (though the five-year figures point to greater volatility, with just a handful of funds notching decent returns). Over the past year, the standout funds were Legg Mason Japan Equity (up 24.2%) and AXA Framlington Japan Smaller Companies (up 15.1%); top of the three-year table are Neptune Japan Opportunities (up 74.7%) and M&amp;G Japan Smaller Companies (up 74.2%). This more than betters the Japanese stock market. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 Index has fallen by about 14% during the past three years (to the day before the disaster), and was in fact flat over the past 12 months (again, to the day before the tragedy). Then came the tsunami, leading to the largest sell-off in Japanese equities since 1987. On the first day of trading after the disaster, the Nikkei shed 6% – its biggest fall in two years – dragging the one-year and three-year returns down, greatly worrying the global investment community. The index has fallen from 10,370 to a post-disaster low of 8,233 (a drop of 20%) before rallying to – at the time of writing – 9,099 (a drop of 12%). The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has acted swiftly to guarantee bank deposits and injected trillions of yen (in excess of £115bn to ease financial conditions and ensure liquidity – reassuring the global investment community. The BoJ also embarked on a programme of asset buying which should help to restore calm in financial markets and weaken the yen, making Japanese companies more profitable. Nevertheless, uncertainty about the economic impact of the quake has caused many investors to flee to safe havens such as gold and bonds. So should investors have dumped Japanese stocks and funds? And if you invested in the region, what should you do now? After the Kobe earthquake of 1995, Japanese equities were decimated, but there was limited lasting damage to global equities (which were broadly flat in the months following the earthquake). But the losses in Japan were soon made up: the Nikkei hovered around 19,700 before Kobe (which struck in January 1995), plummeting to 14,517 by June that year before rising to 19,900 by December 1995. Paul Niven, head of multi asset investment at F&amp;C Investments , said the extent of the current decline in Japanese share prices reflects panic selling, with signs of investors exiting at any price. \"Provided the global economy can maintain momentum – which we expect – then risk assets should recover poise and make gains from current levels,\" Niven explained. He believes government interventions are already sizeable enough to indicate the economic damage will not mirror the post-Kobe landscape. Adrian Lowcock of BestInvest would not recommend selling existing investments in Japan because any good news could see the current market falls reversed. \"Tokyo is largely unaffected, the government is still functioning properly and things will slowly return to normal,\" he said. \"The main areas affected are not of prime economic importance, although the devastation and loss of life is naturally upsetting. Some sectors of the Japanese economy, such as insurance and car manufacturing, will undoubtedly suffer – but the long-term economic effect is likely to be less than the devastation suggests.\" Lowcock added that, on a technical basis, the Japanese stock market remains cheap and investors can access large international companies at good valuations. \"In the short term, GDP and industrial production will fall, but will both recover. On the information currently available, we do not believe there has been serious overall damage to the business sustainability of many Japanese companies. Indeed, many Japanese managers have come out in support of the country's economy.\" Despite the possibility of meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant, Lowcock remains sanguine about the threat. \"Global stock markets have fallen on the fear that a nuclear catastrophe will happen, even though this has been highly unlikely,\" he explained. \"This demonstrates the inability of markets to price in rare, high-risk events known as black swans. Nuclear fallout is one of those events where fear overwhelms rational behaviour.\" His recommended Japan fund is GLG Japan Core Alpha as it has a strong bias towards large cap value companies and the manager can take an aggressive position in sectors. Paul Marson, chief investment officer of Lombard Odier private bank, said a deterioration of the nuclear situation would lead it to review its positioning. \"But if authorities manage to contain the situation, the Japanese equity market would appear to be extremely cheap by historical standards,\" he added. Patrick Connolly at independent broker AWD Chase de Vere said most investors would, rightly, have only a small exposure to Japan. \"These investors should stay put and aim to ride out the current troubles. We don't expect the events in Japan to have a major impact on global stock markets, so investors in other regions should stay put. In fact, the direction of global stock markets is more likely to be dictated by events in the Middle East, the US, the eurozone and China.\" Philippa Gee at Philippa Gee Wealth Management pointed out that Japan has long been a high-risk investment area \"where it might come good or it might suffer further financial problems\". That said, she believes investors should stay put: \"This is absolutely the wrong time to pull out as you are probably getting out with a loss, and letting others make money out of your concerns. No investment into Japan should be for the short term.\" Many global funds have small percentages invested in Japan. Jupiter Merlin Worldwide, for example, has just under 9% (at the time of its last factsheet), while Invesco Perpetual Global Smaller Companies has just under 15%. No advisers believe this is a problem for investors. A Whitechurch Securities statement warned that some car makers and IT suppliers in the northern region of Tohoku had been affected, but added: \"There is nothing that appears to have irrevocably altered the long-term investment case.\" In the UK, companies such as Aggreko and BG have seen share price gains on the back of repairs needed to Japan's ailing nuclear generators, and the country's renewed demand for liquefied petroleum gas. Stockbroker TD Waterhouse said financial stocks were hugely popular among its customers last week. The shares of insurers such as Aviva were snapped up as investors took advantage of falling prices as a result of fears that the insurance sector will be hit hard by events in Japan. Interactive Investor (II) said its spread betting clients were making some \"classic plays amidst the panic\". Mike McCudden, II's head of derivatives, said: \"With danger to a nuclear power station in the news we have seen sharp downturns in the price of any company associated with this industry – from uranium miners to steam turbine component manufacturers – and an influx of investment in wind and solar and natural gas. \"We have seen short-term traders trying to sniff out buying opportunities amidst the sell-off. Betting against the trend is fraught with danger and further negative sentiment in the coming days could well propel the market to new lows.\" Energy quest Some analysts have been quick to look for opportunities. Mick Gilligan, head of research at Killik &amp; Co, said global demand for renewable energy would be boosted following the disaster: \"With energy security worries becoming increasingly pressing, renewable energy technology companies and funds are looking increasingly attractive. \"Upheaval in the Middle East and north Africa is causing uncertainty in the oil markets; the threat of nuclear catastrophe in Japan is reigniting worries about nuclear sources; and the peak oil argument is gaining further momentum. These factors combine to suggest that many governments and companies will be looking for alternative energy resources and technologies to provide a reliable, long-term supply.\" Gilligan recommends the Impax Asia Environmental fund and Blackrock New Energy fund for investors keen to make money out of renewable energy. Similarly, Ankit Jain, an analyst at S&amp;P Equity Research, said his company was ploughing into renewable energy companies following the disaster. \"We raise our stance on renewables from 'marketweight' to 'overweight',\" he explained. \"Having previously assumed negative implications on one key driving force for the sector – regulation – due to the fragile global economy we believe governments globally will now come under increasing pressure to present regulatory changes in favour of renewable energy.\" F&amp;C's Paul Niven added: \"Relative value in Japan has never been as pronounced as it is today, and Japanese equities remain a high beta play on global growth [a return mirroring that of the global growth index], which we still anticipate will be robust in 2011.\" Roberto Cominotto, fund manager of the JB Energy Transition Fund at Swiss &amp; Global Asset Management, said he had reduced his weighting in the nuclear sector from 1.8% to 0.3%. \"The only remaining position is a company active in nuclear waste disposal and decommissioning of closed nuclear plants. Our fund should benefit from the expected change in energy policies and improved investor sentiment towards alternative energy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"books/2011/oct/14/haruki-murakami-1q84","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2011-10-14T10:59:00Z","webTitle":"Haruki Murakami: 'I took a gamble and survived'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/14/haruki-murakami-1q84","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2011/oct/14/haruki-murakami-1q84","fields":{"headline":"Haruki Murakami: 'I took a gamble and survived'","bodyText":"1Q84, Haruki Murakami's new novel, is 1,000 pages long and is published in three volumes. It took the author three years to write and it is possible, on an 11-hour flight from New York to Honolulu, to get through about half of it. Murakami looks crestfallen on receipt of this news – the ratio of writing to reading time is never very encouraging for a writer – and yet if anything tests a novel's power to transport, it is reading it at the back of economy on a full flight over long haul. For those 11 hours, you disappear wholly into Murakami world. We are in the presidential suite of the Hyatt, Waikiki, overlooking an ad-perfect beach framed by mountains. Murakami, who at 63 still looks like an adolescent skateboarder, divides his time between homes in Hawaii, Japan and a third venue he calls Over There. This is where he disappears every morning while writing his novels, a place populated by the kind of characters who have come to define the Murakami style: enigmatic, deadpan, full of big emotions sheared flat by repression and presented with a detachment that, unusually for a novelist who sells in the millions, has given him a cult-like status. Before I leave for Hawaii a friend confesses his enthusiasm for Murakami is partly based on a desire to be the kind of person who likes Murakami. \"I don't think of myself as an artist,\" says the author more than once in the interview. \"I'm just a guy who can write. Yeah.\" Murakami's cool benefits from an un-nerdy background running a jazz club in his 20s, and his equally un-nerdy Ironman routine. As he detailed recently in his memoir What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, Murakami rises at 4am on most mornings, writes until noon, spends the afternoon training for marathons and browsing through old record stores and turns in, with his wife, at 9pm. As a regime, it is almost as famous as his novels and has the clean, fanatical air of a correction to the mess of his 20s. It is also the kind of discipline necessary to crank out 1,000 complicated pages in three years. To Murakami, built like a little bull, it's a question of strength. \"It's physical. If you keep on writing for three years, every day, you should be strong. Of course you have to be strong mentally, also. But in the first place you have to be strong physically. That is a very important thing. Physically and mentally you have to be strong.\" His habit of repetition, whether a stylistic tic or a side-effect of translation from the Japanese, has the effect of making everything Murakami says sound infinitely profound. He has written about the metaphorical importance of his running; that to complete an action every day sets a kind of karmic example for his writing. \"Yes,\" he says. \"Mmmmm.\" He makes a long contemplative sound. \"I need strength because I have to open the door.\" He mimes heaving open a door. \"Every day I go to my study and sit at my desk and put the computer on. At that moment, I have to open the door. It's a big, heavy door. You have to go into the Other Room. Metaphorically, of course. And you have to come back to this side of the room. And you have to shut the door. So it's literally physical strength to open and shut the door. So if I lose that strength, I cannot write a novel any more. I can write some short stories, but not a novel.\" Is there an element of fear to overcome in those actions every morning? \"It's just routine,\" he says and laughs loudly. \"It's kind of boring. It's a routine. But the routine is so important.\" Because there's chaos within? \"Yeah. I go to my subconsciousness. I have to go into that chaos. But the act of going and coming back is kind of routine. You have to be practical. So every time I say, if you want to write a novel you have to be practical, people get bored. They are disappointed.\" He laughs again. \"They are expecting a more dynamic, creative, artistic thing to say. What I want to say is: you have to be practical.\" A person who gets up that early can live almost two lives. It's a Murakami trope, this, the single life split in two, either through radical change in circumstance or in the gap between the exterior and interior life of a divided self. In his new novel, the heroine, Aomame – \"Green Peas\" in Japanese – starts off realistically enough stuck in traffic in a cab on a Tokyo expressway. It is 1984, a nod to George Orwell. To avoid being late, she gets out of the cab and takes a disused maintenance stairway down to ground level, where she finds herself in a parallel world, what she comes to call 1Q84. Like so much of Murakami's fiction, it combines a gripping realistic narrative with the kind of bonkers surrealism – levitating clocks, exploding dogs, an entity called the \"Little People\" which emerge through the mouth of a dead goat – designed to pull the reader up short and wonder if it isn't all nonsense, doubt that the author incorporates into the novel. \"People are left in a pool of mysterious question marks,\" says an editor in 1Q84 to his star writer. \"Readers are likely to take this lack of clarification as a sign of 'authorial laziness'.\" To which the fictional author replies, \"If an author succeeded in writing a story 'put together in an exceptionally interesting way' that 'carries the reader along to the very end' who could possibly call such a writer 'lazy'.\" In its first month of release, 1Q84 sold one million copies in Japan. Elements of Murakami's background are mysterious, even to him. He can't say why he decided to become a writer. It merely struck him one day, out of the blue, while watching a baseball game and having never had the slightest inclination in that direction. He was in his late 20s, running the jazz bar – he called it Peter Cat, after his pet. It was 1978. His period of rebellion was more or less over. He had grown up in the 1960s, the only child of a university professor and his homemaker wife and, along with the rest of his generation, rejected the course he was expected to take. He married straight out of university and instead of pursuing further studies, borrowed money to open the jazz bar and indulge his love of music. All around him his friends rebelled, too. Some killed themselves, something Murakami often writes about. \"They are gone,\" he says. \"It was a very chaotic time, and I'm still missing them. So sometimes I feel very strange to become 63 years old. I feel myself as a kind of survivor. Every time I think about them, I have some feeling that I have to live, I have to live very strong. Because I don't want to spend years of my life… it should be the very purpose, life. Because I survived, I have obligations to give fully. So, every time I write my fiction, from time to time I think of the deceased. Friends.\" Looking back, he sees how precarious his own situation was. He was heavily in debt, working long hours in the bar with his wife, unsure of his future. \"In 1968 or 69, anything could happen. It was so exciting, but at the same time, it was risky. The bets were so big. If you can win, you could get big bets, but if you lose, you are lost.\" He took a gamble with the bar? \"Aaaaargh,\" says Murakami. \"Marriage is where I took that gamble! I was 20 or 21. I didn't know anything of the world. I was stupid. Innocent. It's a kind of a gamble. With my life. But I survived. Anyway.\" His wife, Yoko Takahashi, is his first reader. The novel that came out of his brainwave at the baseball game was called Hear The Wind Sing and won a new writers' prize in Japan. For a while he continued to run the bar while writing and it was essential to his progress, he says: \"I had my jazz club and I had enough money. So I didn't have to write for my living. That is very important.\" When his novel Norwegian Wood sold more than three million copies in Japan, Murakami had no need to carry on with the bar, although he sometimes has a vision of a parallel existence in which he had stayed in that life. He is not convinced he would have been any less happy. \"Do I have a sense of alternative lives? Ummm-a. Yes. So I feel it's very strange, still. Sometimes I wonder why I'm a novelist right now. There is no definite career reason why I became a writer. Something happened, and I became a writer. And now I'm a successful writer. When I go to the States or Europe, many people know me. It was so strange. Some years ago I went to Barcelona and did a signing and, you know, 1,000 people came. The girls kissed me. I was so surprised. What happened to me?\" He writes intuitively, without a plan. His latest novel came to him while sitting in traffic in Tokyo. What if he got out on the gridlocked freeway and went down the emergency exit; would the course of his life change? \"That is the starting point. I have a kind of premonition it's going to be a big book. It's going to be very ambitious. That's what I knew. I wrote the novel Kafka On The Shore, maybe five or six years ago and was waiting for the new book to come; it came. It has come. I knew it was going to be a big project. It's just a feeling.\" How a novel the length of 1Q84 can, simultaneously, seem elliptical is part of Murakami's brilliance, although it can leave the reader feeling strangely unsatisfied. Artificiality in the novel can be excused by the author as commentary on the nature of artificiality itself and the deadpan tone is occasionally infuriating. \"Ever since he saw two moons in the sky and an air chrysalis materialising on his father's bed in the sanatorium, nothing surprised Tengo very much.\" As in earlier novels, some of the tenderest scenes are tangential to the main plotline. In Norwegian Wood, which Murakami wrote as conventionally as possible in the hope it would be a commercial hit, it was between the hero and his girlfriend's dying father. In 1Q84, it is scenes between Tengo, Aomame's love interest, and his own dying father, whom he found difficult to love. Most of Murakami's characters had unhappy childhoods, not coincidentally, he says. Nothing dramatic happened when he was growing up. And yet, he says, \"I had a feeling I was kind of abused. It's because my parents had hoped that this child should be like this; I was not.\" He laughs. \"So they expected me to get good marks at school, but I didn't. I didn't like to study too long. I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I'm very consistent. They expected me to go to a good school and get a job at Mitsubishi or something like that. But I didn't do that. I wanted to be independent. So I opened up a jazz club and got married when I was a university student. They were kind of unhappy about that.\" How was it expressed? \"They were just disappointed in me. It's tough on a kid to have that disappointment. I think they are nice people, but still. I was injured. I remember that feeling, still. I wanted to be a good kid for them, but I couldn't be. Myself, I don't have any kids. Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I'd had children. I cannot imagine it. I'm not so happy as a kid, and I don't know if I could be happy as a father. I have no idea.\" How, then, did he find the confidence to do what he wanted? \"Confidence; as a teenager? Because I knew what I loved. I loved to read; I loved to listen to music; and I love cats. Those three things. So, even though I was an only kid, I could be happy because I knew what I loved. Those three things haven't changed from my childhood. I know what I love, still, now. That's a confidence. If you don't know what you love, you are lost.\" Murakami's opinion on almost every topic is sought in Japan where he is the country's most recognised intellectual. He dislikes public appearances; is shy and modest, but will engage in national debate through his books. In the wake of the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway he wrote Underground, a set of journalistic essays about the event. He feels obliged to represent his country as a Japanese novelist and will agree to publicity abroad where he won't at home. And although he has translated many western novels into Japanese – including the works of his favourite novelist, Raymond Chandler, translating back the other way is too hard, he says. He would never translate his own novels; merely contest a word here and there with his regular translators. He was in Honolulu earlier this year when the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan. It has changed the country, he says. \"People lost their confidence. We had been working so hard, after the end of the war. For 60 years. The richer we became, the happier we become. But at the end, we didn't get happy, however hard we worked. And the earthquake came, and so many people had to be evacuated, to abandon their houses and homeland. It's a tragedy. And we were proud of our technology, but our nuclear power plant turned out to be a nightmare. So people started to think, we have to change drastically the way of life. I think that is a big turning point in Japan.\" He likens it to 9/11, which, he says, changed the course of world history. From a novelist's perspective it is a \"miraculous event\", too improbable to be true. \"When I see those videos of the two planes crashing into the buildings, it seems like a miracle to me. It's not politically correct to say that it's beautiful, but I have to say that there is a kind of beauty in it. It's awful, it's a tragedy, but still there is a beauty in it. It seems too perfect. I cannot believe it happened, really. Sometimes I wonder if those two planes hadn't crashed into the building, the world would be so different from what it is now.\" The change the Japanese are undergoing is partly, says Murakami, the reckoning that comes with losing so much and having to question what matters. His own priorities are simple, he says. For example, he doesn't know how much money he has. \"You know, if you are kind of rich, the best thing is that you don't have to think about money. The best thing you can buy with money is freedom, time. I don't know how much I earn a year. I have no idea. I don't know how much I pay in taxes. I don't want to think about tax.\" There is a long pause. \"It's miserable. I have my accountant and my wife takes care of that. They don't let me know anything. I'm just working.\" He must trust his wife! \"We've been married for 40 years or something. She's still my friend. We have a conversation, always a conversation. She helps me a lot. She gives me advice regarding my books. I respect her opinion. Sometimes we quarrel. Her opinion is so harsh sometimes. It can be.\" Perhaps he needs that. \"I guess so. If my editor did the same thing, I would get mad.\" Murakami shrugs. \"I can leave my editor, but I can't leave my wife.\" His father died two years ago, his mother is still alive. He hopes they were happy about his success as a novelist but remains doubtful. Murakami has his consolations. He is a member of a running club in Hawaii, by far the oldest in the group, he says. He runs, as he writes, every day. Consistency is all. \"I like to read books. I like to listen to music. I collect records. And cats. I don't have any cats right now. But if I'm taking a walk and I see a cat, I'm happy.\" • This article was amended on 18 October 2011.

Nothing yet, Lib Dem MPs agree. But watch them both. Clegg was criticised in the blogosphere for being judged slow to condemn Israel's seizure of the convoy – he waited 36 hours. It is a tension point with the Tories, one of many. As for the business secretary, his affectionate colleagues sense that Cable is not a happy bunny, even before he is asked to sanction lifting the cap on student tuition fees. Sir Ming Campbell has already said on TV that merely abstaining on fees – the coalition compromise – won't be enough for him. Yet by majority Lib-Con consent the coalition is working well at a practical level, despite the David Laws disaster. At PMQs yesterday Iain Duncan Smith could be seen chatting with his lefty Lib Dem deputy, Steve Webb. Clegg, fluent and assured in overnight interviews, sat next to David Cameron, content to forgo what would once have been his two weekly questions. Cameron won plaudits for being polite to everyone. But how long will any of it last? \"There must be 100 pitfalls ahead,\" says a Lib Dem MP who knows that many constituents elected him to keep the Tory out and are suspicious. He tells them that the coalition prevents Cameron calling a snap election and \"wiping us out\". Even five years of wear and tear could reduce their 57 MPs to 30 without electoral reform, on some estimates. With Cable's blessing, Simon Hughes, one of nature's oppositionists, is gearing up to win the election to become his successor as deputy leader. As de facto parliamentary leader Hughes would seek to keep the Lib Dem flame alive, organising shadow spokesmanships, demanding speaking rights, causing trouble. Labour will be keen to help troublemakers. So will many Lib Dem activists as policy battles take their toll. Among the 100 pitfalls the known unknowns include the eventual terms of the 22 June budget's tax reforms as they affect Clegg's determination to raise the income tax threshold for the poor and capital gains tax rates for the not-so-poor. Many Tories oppose both moves and hope George Osborne will feel free to treat Laws's successor, Danny Alexander, cavalierly as he would not have done Laws. In any case Alexander's attention may be divided, since he must also help Clegg press for \"fairer\" constituency boundaries and a yes vote in the referendum on the alternative vote.

Bloomberg and the Press Trust of India reported that not only would the government insist on its approval for the Cairn buyout, but it may also get state energy companies Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp and Gail, India's largest gas transmission and marketing company, to team up for a counter bid. The immediate crisis facing Vedanta however, is the setback to its plans for expansion in the aluminium sector. A government report released last week had accused the group of violations of forest conservation, tribal rights and environmental protection laws in Orissa. A panel of forestry experts subsequently confirmed the violations and recommended action against Vedanta, so the government's decision was expected, despite last-minute intervention by state chief minister Naveen Patnaik. Patnaik met prime minister Manmohan Singh to lobby for Vedanta and a steel project by South Korea's Posco. Vedanta, which wanted to extract bauxite from the tribal forest, for an alumina refinery it has built nearby, required clearance from Delhi under the country's forest and environmental laws. It had provisional environmental clearance , but it failed to clear the final hurdle under laws protecting the forests and granting rights to local tribal groups. Vedanta was accused of rushing ahead with the mining project without obtaining the consent of the tribal groups, a charge denied by the company. \"Our effort is to bring the poor tribal people into the mainstream,\" Vedanta Aluminium's chief operating officer, Mukesh Kumar, said. Vedanta's alumina refinery is sourcing bauxite from other locations in the state, but even here it has been accused of wrongdoing. Eleven of these mines are said to be \"illegal\", as they lack environmental clearance. N C Saxena, who headed the government's inquiry committee, was emphatic in his condemnation of Vedanta's mining project. \"Bauxite is mined in other countries too but not like this,\" he said. \"It has to be done in a sustainable manner and no flouting of environment laws should be allowed. And it should not be at the cost of local powerless people. Why should the poorest lose out?\" The main loser in Orissa would have been the Dongria-Kondh tribe which inhabits the upper reaches of the hilly forest. The campaign against the mining project had received widespread national and international support. \"The government has listened to the most powerless people on earth, it very clearly shows that democracy still works in India,\" said environmental activist Sunita Narain of the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment. \"The poor are saying that modern development is not giving them a livelihood,\" she added. \"It's an issue on which the country will have to take very tough decisions. India's biggest constraint to growth is the availability of land and water.\" But the long-drawn-out controversy over Vedanta's mining project also reflects Delhi's failure to devise an effective development policy for millions of forest-dwelling tribes in central and eastern India. \"The problem is that in mining projects the rightful stakeholders don't get their share,\" said Mohan Guruswamy of the independent thinktank Centre for Policy Alternatives. \"The habitat of the tribal peoples is degraded, their livelihoods destroyed and the women exploited. What we need is a constitutional arrangement that ensures the tribal groups have a voice and derive some benefit from development.\" The government's refusal to let Vedanta mine bauxite in a forest inhabited by poor tribes is seen as an unprecedented action in India. In the past, big corporations have usually had their way. Ramesh is hailed as the first environment minister who takes his job seriously. But the move is raising hackles not just in industry but among state governments that are keen to back prized projects. India's financial centre, Mumbai, for instance, needs a new airport, but the proposed site doesn't have environmental clearance as the project will destroy 400 acres of mangroves protecting the coast. The Economic Times reports that more than a dozen power projects, including a nuclear power plant and 55 iron ore mines are stalled in a coastal region south of Mumbai due to environmental concerns."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global/2011/feb/15/letters","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-15T13:59:01Z","webTitle":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 18 February 2011","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/feb/15/letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global/2011/feb/15/letters","fields":{"headline":"Guardian Weekly Letters, 18 February 2011","bodyText":"Andrew Rawnsley makes the serious historical error of supposing there to be a contradiction between David Cameron and George Osborne being perfectly sincere in their lethal policy of brutal and needless spending cuts and tax rises and the accusation that in doing so they are \"evil Tory bastards\" (Believe it: there really is no plan B, 4 February). Both judgments hold, and there is no shortage of horrible examples of dreadful policies pursued with deadly sincerity. What is at stake, however, is less evil Toryism and more fatal ignorance, not to say stupidity. Nigel Lawson and Geoffrey Howe may still be congratulating themselves on their policies coming out as right for Toryism as they did for their own pockets, but those policies did so by way of removing all investment from public health and education, shutting down the north of England and abandoning it to benefits paid for by North Sea oil, now drying up. Like their predecessors, Cameron and Osborne know nothing of the north and, as is plain, care less. Such patriotism as they profess is confined to seeing national wellbeing as merely a function of party success. They might do well to look up a book written by the member for Stockton on Tees in 1937 entitled The Middle Way. Its author was Harold Macmillan, who had some knowledge of economic history and some sense of responsibility to his constituency. Fred Inglis Canberra, Australia Journalism is dangerous Since Andrew Clark is a journalist, I'm surprised that he was surprised at his treatment by the Swiss police (Handcuffed and herded: my big Alpine adventure with Switzerland's police, 4 February). He didn't think they wear kid gloves, did he? As yet they haven't dragged someone out of his wheelchair or battered a newspaper salesman to death. He also complained that the arresting officer didn't speak perfect English. How many British police are able to speak a foreign language? However, the Swiss themselves were appalled that some of their journalists in Egypt were recently interrogated and threatened with death. Being a journalist is dangerous: 57 of them were killed in 2010. Felicity Oliver Ostermundigen, Switzerland Don't stereotype the aliens Until scientists can unequivocally pronounce that there is life on other planets, what right have they to scaremonger on such an important matter? (Get ready for an alien encounter, 21 January). How dare they assume that we will be under threat if this proves to be so? What has happened to us that we should feel compelled to defend ourselves from \"aliens\", other races and cultures and even religions, given that the majority of us profess to worship the same God? I fear we are not as advanced as we would like to think we are. Perhaps scientists fear a greater intelligence than their own; after all, we have yet to travel to and conquer planets that are many light years away from our own. If others, yet unknown, can do so, what advanced knowledge they must have; if they are hostile, we would be unable to defend ourselves against their greater power. In so doing we would threaten our own planet, given that we already have, with our misuse of nuclear power. Simon Conway Morris states that we should be prepared for the worst and that \"evolution on alien worlds is likely to be Darwinian in nature\". What clever little Darwinians they must be to thus be centuries ahead of us in knowledge. Perhaps these \"aliens\" may be light years ahead in ethical and moral standards also, and may seek to help and advance us. I did not realise that science is based on speculation and assumption. Heaven help them if \"ET might resemble us\". Jennifer Hampshire Nelson, New Zealand Green is not left-leaning I found to my surprise a very un-Guardian sort of comment in your story Protesters cast shadow over US billionaires' rally in the sun (4 February). The article pinpoints very well the rightwing atmosphere in the Koch brothers' gathering with apparent millions of dollars spent on lobbying and influencing politicians. But then there was this about protesters: \"Greenpeace, the environment group, joined forces with several other left-leaning organisations to hold a counter-rally to the Koch meeting.\" I am not a member of Greenpeace, but I did not know that Greenpeace was left-leaning. In the US nowadays, if you believe in climate change, you must be left-leaning. This is a drastically different approach than in Europe. Quite a few European \"greens\" are very conservative and have nothing in common with left-leaning organisations. They may not be Republicans or creationists, but I suppose that in the view of the US they are still left-leaning. Mike Breithoff Luxembourg, Luxembourg Brutal version of progress Tony Blair's paean to markets and globalisation in Sierra Leone (Greener future for Sierra Leone, 7 January) reflects the west's brutal version of progress. His \"good news\" puff piece extolls the benefits of agriculture dependent on pesticides, GE crops and heavy machinery that does not lift people out of poverty but makes them vulnerable to price swings and prisoners of agrochemical multinationals. Where the seasonal tropics provide a variety of soils, farmers utilise their soil catena from valley to hill with huge varieties of rice that ripen at different times to spread labour needs and to best use climatic conditions. Smallholders surrounded by forest can hunt and gather as well as make and sell crafts. A country flush with diamond mines apparently finds itself with nearly half the population impoverished and the answer lies in Blair's agrochemical input? I don't think so. Please invite real agronomists to write for your paper, not World Bank apologists: people like Coen Reijntjes, Bertus Haverkort and Ann Waters-Bayer, who co-wrote the book Farming for the Future. Reihana Robinson Port Charles, New Zealand Dump the dinosaur rock Sam Leith is wrong in his assertion that rock music is not being created by young people, and that they don't have an interest in it anymore – not every youth adores the terminally uncool X Factor (The supply of rock'n'roll is running out, 4 February). It's true young people don't care much for the great dinosaurs of rock so beloved of the nostalgia rock magazines – but then, exposure in those magazines is related directly to how much advertising your record company can buy, so we only see the same old faces over and over again, thus creating a stagnant scene. Oldie journalists are also to blame for refusing to acknowledge young talent, deifying the heroes of their youth and deliberating pulling the ladder up behind them – a testament to their own Grumpy Old Men attitudes. New young rock bands such as psychedelic garage rockers New York Alcoholic Anxiety Attack utilise the internet to considerable success and bypass the moldering ruins of the self-destroyed music industry. There's a rock revolution out there all right. Leith needs to get his ya-yas out and free his mind. Joolz Denby Bradford, UK Strange sort of payback While having a second read of Leo Hickman's article, I noticed on the top right-hand corner beneath the Weekly Review banner: 'Burn the stuffed animals' : Tiger Mother [Amy Chua] sparks bitter debate on how to bring up baby (Life on a burdened planet, 28 January). I couldn't help but smile over the unintended black humour. Do the editors subtly try to point out the solution to the global environmental crisis is torching the selfish over-consuming human species – the \"stuffed animals\" – of this planet? Payback for the Brazilian rainforests, I say. My compliments to Hickman, for his provocative article directly challenges the silent crisis of overpopulation, unlike the tepid fluff put out by National Geographic a couple of months ago on the same subject.

Skylarks rise from the long grass beside the temporary control tower. Inside the leaky, 50-year-old terminal building, the view from the Biggles Bar takes in low-lying nature reserves behind the shingle beach, the Ministry of Defence firing ranges and Dungeness nuclear power station. In the 1950s, before roll-on, roll-off ferries, film stars such as Diana Dors, Humphrey Bogart and Gregory Peck posed on the tarmac as their open-top cars were driven on to Bristol Freighter aircraft for the cross-channel hop to the casinos and racetracks at Le Touquet. Now owned by Sheikh Fahad al-Athel, a Saudi businessman, London Ashford airport – as it is known – is aiming to revive its aviation glory. Planning permission has been granted to extend the runway to handle larger planes and build a new terminal for up to 500,000 passengers a year. Numbers could rise to two million travellers annually. The decision by Shepway district council in Kent to support the application last month is the latest in a series of airport expansion schemes made possible by air traffic moving out from the capital's congested international hubs at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. London Southend airport, owned by the freight company Eddie Stobart, has received government approval for a similar development. The two to one vote by Shepway councillors after a seven-hour debate – which finished at 2am – has hardened battle lines. The council planning officials' recommendation to reject the application was overturned. Climate-change campaigners and environmentalists defending wildlife sanctuaries now confront flying enthusiasts and those eager to bring jobs to an area with few large employers. Posters depicting an airliner plunging towards Dungeness B nuclear power station with the caption \"60 Seconds to Disaster\" have been erected in Lydd. The outgoing local Conservative MP, Michael Howard, spoke in favour of the scheme at the council session, but John Denham, the secretary of state for communities and local government, sensitive to the scale of opposition, has suspended the process while he decides whether to order a public inquiry. A decision is due on 11 June. \"Those posters show far larger planes than we intend to bring into Lydd,\" said Tim Maskens, the manager of air traffic services at the airport. \"We will only have Airbus A319 and Boeing 737s for medium-haul flights to Spain, Italy, France and perhaps as far away as Greece. The airport was given permission to expand in the late 1980s, but an economic downturn and the Gulf War meant it was never pursued. The potential has always been there. Current policy is to use existing landing capacity wherever possible before building Boris Island [the mayor of London's proposal for an airport in the Thames estuary] or Heathrow's third runway. Smaller aircraft – 50 seaters – are already being forced out of the larger airports by higher landing fees.\" With a shuttle bus to the new hi-speed rail link at Ashford, Maskens maintained, journey times to central London would be barely an hour. \"The hassle of modern flying is getting out of order. Where else is the airport parking free and the check-in only half an hour? This is about going back to easier days of aviation.\" Lydd's only regular commercial flight is to Le Touquet; passengers are airborne for 20 minutes. A service to Jersey begins in July. Most of the traffic is twin-seater private planes and executive jets. The airport was open by the duke of Edinburgh in 1956 and at the height of its success Silver City airways, Dan-Air and other firms were carrying 250,000 people a year. Business collapsed in the 1970s. Sheikh al-Athel spotted its possibilities and purchased a controlling interest in 2001. As a director of Al Bilad, he came to attention for his role as a fixer for Saudi Arabia's multi-billion Al Yamamah arms deal. He has invested £25m and will put a further £25m into the expansion project which will create 300 permanent jobs. Ownership of the airport and an adjoining golf club are held through companies in the British Virgin Islands and Riyadh, according to Lydd Airport Action Group. \"A financial investor based in Saudi Arabia will have little or no interest in preserving the special qualities of Romney Marsh,\" the group's organiser, Louise Barton, has claimed. Opinions among residents appears evenly divided. Many welcome the prospect of employment at a time when the future of the nuclear industry at Dungeness is uncertain. \"It's a good idea,\" said Julie Downham, a care nurse working in Lydd. \"It would be good for jobs and those local businesses that are left.\" Martin Seare, an author who writes about the paranormal, described himself as a Martian, or Marshian, from Romney Marsh. \"The noise and the environmental damage will be terrible,\" he warned. \"This is our countryside and they are going to build a large airport spilling out dirty toxins that will kill the land.\" There were more than 12,000 objections to the scheme, including from Greenpeace, the RSPB, British Energy, the Council for the Protection of Rural England, Kent Wildlife Trust and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate did not, however, object. \"There's an amazing collection of wildlife in our reserves on the Dungeness peninsula,\" said André Farrer, the RSPB's protected areas campaigner. \"We have been neighbours of Lydd, but the increase from 3,000 to 500,000 passengers a year is worrying. Nitrogen from planes will change the local biology; birds do not tolerate large airports. This is one of our most important wildlife sites.

The atomic cheerleader has been good enough to put the latest numbers (pdf) up on its website but seems curiously willing not to draw it to anyone's attention by contacting journalists or other interested parties. Or is that connected with the fact that at a time when the government is poised to push the dayglo buttonfor a new generation of plants that the public's appetite for such is receding - fast. The figures from Ipsos Mori show that 65% of the public appear to agree that Britain needs a mix of energy sources to ensure a reliable supply of electricity - including nuclear and renewables - but that is down from the 72% recorded 12 months ago and comes after four years of steadily increasing support. Keith Parker, the chief executive of the NIA, is honest enough to admit the latest findings are a \"reality check\" for the atomic industry but he believes this should encourage it to redouble its efforts to \"promote greater understanding of our industry.\" In fact the fall in support for nuclear could suggest that the more people know about nuclear the less they want it because more has been written about this industry over the last 12 months than was the combined case over the three years, I would bet. The NIA also claims that the survey shows public familiarity with nuclear issues is increasing and yet \"some 68% of the public claim to know 'just a little' or 'almost nothing' about atomic power\". I will repeat that scary statistic. More than two-thirds of the public still know next to nothing or nothing about nuclear.

Yousef al-Otaiba commented bluntly that the benefits would outweigh the short-term costs of military action. \"We cannot live with a nuclear Iran,\" the envoy said at a conference in Aspen, Colorado. \"I am willing to absorb what takes place at the expense of the security of the UAE.\" Tehran hit back swiftly with a warning from a leading MP of a \"teeth-breaking\" response to these \"harsh and crude\" remarks and a possible ban on Iranian travel to the Gulf state, which does billions of dollars of trade annually with Iran. The UAE foreign ministry called the reported comments \"inaccurate and taken out of context\", but they were recorded by the Atlantic Magazine, which organised the conference. The ministry insisted that the UAE wanted a peaceful solution to the crisis over Iran's nuclear programme. The spat follows Iran's decision to scale back economic relations with the UAE after Abu Dhabi implemented the latest UN sanctions punishing Tehran for ignoring demands over that programme. The row also underlines wider nervousness in the Gulf about Iran, though the UAE is the most hawkish of its neighbours and has been in dispute with it over three islands since 1971. Controversy erupted in nearby Kuwait recently over an alleged spy ring for Iran's Revolutionary Guard, and there are concerns elsewhere about Iranian subversion against the Sunni Arab monarchies. Otaiba was quoted as saying that he \"absolutely\" wanted the US to use force to halt Iran's nuclear programme. \"Countries in the region view the Iran threat very differently,\" he said. \"I can only speak for the UAE, but talk of containment and deterrence really concerns me and makes me very nervous. Iran doesn't have nuclear power now but … what makes me think that once they have a nuclear programme, we are going to be able to be more successful in containing them?\" The ambassador's candid remarks were quickly picked up in the US and Israeli media but the damage was done long before an unconvincing official denial was issued in Abu Dhabi. \"I hope the government of the UAE will correct this viewpoint,\" said Kazem Jalali, spokesman for the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee. Analysts and diplomats are aware such views are often expressed in private by officials in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. \"Otaiba's remarks may or may not be a gaffe but they certainly reflect official thinking in Abu Dhabi,\" said Christopher Davidson, a Gulf expert at Durham University. \"They want to see more American boots on the ground, and they don't want to live in the shadow of a nuclear Iran.\" Davidson said that the UAE also needed to sound hawkish because it is open to accusations of sanctions-busting as Dubai, the closest to Iran of the UAE's seven emirates, is a key trans-shipment point for the Iranian nuclear programme. Iran and the UAE have close economic ties. Thousands of Iranian companies and businessmen operate in the country and bilateral trade is estimated at $10bn (£6.6bn) a year, mostly made up of Iranian imports. Masoud Daneshmand, head of the Iran-UAE Chamber of Commerce, complained on Tuesday that the Emiratis were going beyond what was required by the UN sanctions regime. Last week the UAE central bank asked financial institutions in the federation to freeze the bank accounts of 41 Iranians, including the managers of key companies owned by the Revolutionary Guards. The UAE also closed 40 international and local firms accused of shipping contraband and banned dual-use goods to Iran."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/may/13/coalition-environment-ministers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-13T13:59:08Z","webTitle":"Coalition environment ministers: who's who","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/13/coalition-environment-ministers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/may/13/coalition-environment-ministers","fields":{"headline":"Coalition environment ministers: who's who","bodyText":"Chris Huhne: energy and climate change secretary (Liberal Democrat) After a career as a City analyst and many posts as a financial journalist - including a period as Guardian economics leader writer - Huhne entered parliament in 2005.

Elected as MP for Meriden in the West Midlands in 1997, she was previously deputy director of the International Confederation of European Beet Growers in Paris, and a research fellow for the Centre for European Agricultural Studies at the University of Kent. From 1981-84 she was sugar beet commodity secretary for the National Farmers Union (NFU). With her husband, she co-owns Spelman, Cormack &amp; Associates, a food and biotechnology business. In opposition, she has served as shadow international development secretary and spokeswoman for environmental affairs for Theresa May. In 2004 she became shadow secretary of state for local and devolved government affairs and was later promoted to Conservative party chairman. She was appointed shadow secretary of state for communities and local government last year.

The watchdog denied that the move is designed to lead to further privatisations, despite the fact that the coalition government needs funds to deal with the massive public deficit, but admitted that if competition problems are unearthed in specific areas that could lead to more in-depth investigations. \"Effective infrastructure is crucial to the performance and productivity of the UK economy, and the quality of life of UK consumers,\" said Heather Clayton, senior director of the OFT's infrastructure group. \"There have been significant changes in ownership of infrastructure assets in both regulated and unregulated sectors of the economy over the past decade. We want to take this opportunity to step back and assess how these developments might have affected competition and consumers.\" The stock-take, which the OFT said does not follow any specific allegation of anti-competitive behaviour, will include examining the different forms of ownership such as private equity ownership, statutory corporations, infrastructure investment funds and limited companies. It is expected to be completed in autumn 2010. Over the past decade a slew of British infrastructure assets have changed hands as buyout firms have looked to capitalise on the dependable revenues of many utility companies and many of the country's crucial services are now owned by foreign companies. For instance, only two of the UK's household energy suppliers – Centrica and Scottish and Southern Energy – remain in British ownership, just over a decade after the market was opened up to full competition. Thames Water is owned by the Australian bank Macquarie, having previously belonged to RWE, which owns npower; Powergen is owned by German energy group E.ON; the nuclear power company British Energy is part of French group EDF; the airports operator BAA is owned by Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial; and Scottish Power is part of Spain's Iberdrola. The OFT is understood to have wanted to start the process earlier in the year but the general election forced it to hold off until now. \"It's not something we have dreamt up since (the coalition government was formed on) Tuesday, it's something we have been planning for a while,\" said an OFT spokeswoman. The OFT has recently carried out investigations into the bus industry, which lead to a referral to the Competition Commission, and estate agents \"but what we have not done is looked across the piste,\" she added, \"so we have a comprehensive view of what economic assets there are and who owns what.\" The review does not include the ownership of so-called social assets such as schools and hospitals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2009/nov/10/ed-miliband-nuclear-energy-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2009-11-10T00:05:02Z","webTitle":"Energy policy: Atomic dreams","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/10/ed-miliband-nuclear-energy-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/10/ed-miliband-nuclear-energy-policy","fields":{"headline":"Energy policy: Atomic dreams","bodyText":"The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday 13 November 2009 The leader below about the government's approval of 10 sites for the next generation of nuclear power plants said it is proposed that new plants would be placed next to existing ones. However, as we reported elsewhere in the paper, two possible sites, Braystones and Kirksanton, both in Cumbria, are in new locations. \"No government has sought to influence me in any way whatever,\" declared Sir Frank Layfield before giving the go ahead for the last nuclear power station to be built in Britain. His Sizewell B inquiry, which occupied Aldeburgh's Snape Maltings for much of the early 1980s, was tortuous and expensive. Its successor, Ed Miliband confirmed yesterday, will be swift and restricted, its scope directed by government to an almost Napoleonic extent. Mr Miliband is a convert to the nuclear cause, arguing that the price of not building a new generation of plants, in the form of higher carbon emissions, trumps the environmental and financial cost of going ahead. Yesterday he issued the new Infrastructure Planning Commission with its orders. There will be no drawn-out public inquiry into each new nuclear site, windfarm or power line. The IPC will review specific applications, and consult, but its remit will not allow it to question whether such things should be built, only where. The new planning process is already controversial and will become more so once it swings into full operation next year. Decisions will be taken quickly and once made cannot be overturned by ministers (a point the Conservatives intend to change). There are promises of consultation, but no right of veto for local people on big projects. Applications for smaller wind farms below 50MW will continue to be decided by local government – which might throw the industry's focus behind bigger ones. But Mr Miliband is right to set out an energy policy, and right that planning policy had to change to accommodate it. \"Saying no everywhere would not be in the national interest,\" he told the Commons. His aim is a near-zero level of carbon emissions from electricity production, but even if Britain faced no pressure to cut pollution, it would need to replace ageing power plants to keep the lights on and avoid a dangerous dependence on expensive imported gas. Half the energy secretary's statement concentrated on clean coal technology, glossing over its erratic progress, and the reality that even if carbon capture and storage is made to work, it will only have a marginal impact on emissions by 2020. The big focus was on nuclear, the planning challenge underlined by confirmation that all 10 possible sites are next to existing nuclear plants. It is hard to dispute Mr Miliband's logic that, if Britain is to meet its carbon targets, extra nuclear power will be required – though some will ask why, ruling out Dungeness because of the risk of floods, he is happy to build at Sizewell, on an eroded coastline. Yesterday's statements also leave the issues of funding and waste management unresolved. Fast-track planning is only the start."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk/2010/jun/02/cumbria-shooting-rural-industry","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-02T18:04:21Z","webTitle":"Shooting tragedy terrorises county of rolling hills and toiling industry","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/02/cumbria-shooting-rural-industry","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2010/jun/02/cumbria-shooting-rural-industry","fields":{"headline":"Shooting tragedy terrorises county of rolling hills and toiling industry","bodyText":"The backdrop to the shootings in west Cumbria is a lovely landscape with a hard edge, which has long made it the plain sister of the neighbouring Lake District. The gunman's murderous drive linked towns that stand within sight of magnificent fells such as Scafell Pike, Pillar and Steeple, but have earned their living from sometimes dangerous industries such as coal mining, chemicals and nuclear power. Wellington pit in Whitehaven, with its \"candlestick\" chimney designed by Sydney Smirke to harmonise with the most perfect Georgian streetplan in Britain – better even than Bath – saw 136 men and boys die in an explosion in 1910. As recently as 1947, another 104 were killed in the William pit, whose sealed-off tunnels still reach beneath the Irish Sea from their filled-in shaft near Whitehaven railway station. The picturesque hamlet of Boot, where the body of the suspect Derrick Bird was found beside his gun, has a similar history of mining and quarrying, with hundreds of accidents and local pubs notorious for brawls. Now a tranquil base camp for Scafell Pike, England's highest mountain, it was filthy with slag and iron ore from quarries and Nab Gill mine less than a century ago. The \"Little Ratty\" steam railway to the village from Ravenglass's small port, crammed with trippers in the current sunshine, was built to haul out the iron ore and stone. A 17th-century packhorse bridge over the Whillan beck, one of Boot's best backdrops for souvenir photos, served the same purpose for cartloads of slate from the western fells. West Cumbrians speak with the county's distinctive twang but have always been an ethnic mix, right back to Roman days, when legionaries from north Africa were stationed at the Solway end of Hadrian's Wall. In turn, Scots, Irish and Tynesiders migrated to work in successive industries including three – Seckers silks, Marchon detergents and Kangol berets and seatbelts – which were founded in the 1930s by central European Jewish refugees from the Nazis. Sellafield nuclear complex, close to Seascale, where at least two of today's killings took place, maintains the tradition of major industries, with other factories stretching north beyond Workington and south, via a grim-looking prison in Millom, to the huge shipyards of Barrow-in-Furness. Historically, the rough-tough nature of life in the area has seen its share of murder and violent crime, although nothing on the scale of today's tragedy in modern times. Less than a mile from the police cordons at Boot, however, stand the graves in St Catherine's churchyard of five victims of a mass killing in 1992 – Gail and Ian Spiro and their three teenage children, whose deaths in California were linked to arms-dealing and espionage. Brought up in Eskdale, Gail was shot with the children at a luxury ranch near San Diego, shortly before her husband's body was found in their camper van on a desert backroad at Coachwhip Canyon, killed by a cyanide injection. The case remains unsolved. • This article was amended on 3 June 2010. The original referred to Marshon detergents.

Just don't ask about the landing strip","bodyText":"Are we witnessing the beginning of a real-life satire, at once amusing and terrifying? Its theme is the smothering of the nuclear power risk by catastrophic climate change and the oil crisis. At the G8 meeting in Hokkaido last week the US president, George Bush, reiterated his plea for the construction of new nuclear energy plants. At the start of this week, Gordon Brown, announced the fast-tracking of eight new reactors and called for \"a renaissance of nuclear power\" in a \"post-oil economy\". It is as if a world that wishes to save the climate must learn to appreciate the beauty of nuclear energy - or \"green energy\", as Germany's Christian Democratic Union general secretary Ronald Pofalla has rechristened it. Given this new turn in the politics of language, we should remind ourselves of the following. A couple of years ago the US Congress established an expert commission to develop a language or symbolism capable of warning against the threats posed by American nuclear waste dumps 10,000 years from now. The problem to be solved was: how must concepts and symbols be designed in order to convey a message to future generations, millennia from now? The commission included physicists, anthropologists, linguists, neuroscientists, psychologists, molecular biologists, classical scholars, artists, and so on. The experts looked for models among the oldest symbols of humanity. They studied the construction of Stonehenge and the pyramids and examined the historical reception of Homer and the Bible. But these reached back at most a couple of thousand years, not 10,000. The anthropologists recommended the symbol of the skull and crossbones. However, a historian reminded the commission that the skull and crossbones symbolised resurrection for the alchemists, and a psychologist conducted an experiment with three-year-olds: if the symbol was affixed to a bottle they anxiously shouted \"poison!\", but if it was placed on a wall they enthusiastically yelled \"pirates!\". Even our language fails, then, when faced with the challenge of alerting future generations to the dangers we have introduced into the world through the use of nuclear power. Seen in this light, the actors who are supposed to be the guarantors of security and rationality - the state, science and industry - are engaged in a highly ambivalent game. They are no longer trustees but suspects, no longer managers of risks but also sources of risks. For they are urging the population to climb into an aircraft for which a landing strip has not yet been built. The \"existential concern\" being awakened across the world by global risks has led to a contest to suppress large-scale risks in political discussion. The incalculable dangers to which climate change is giving rise are supposed to be \"combated\" with the incalculable dangers associated with nuclear power plants. Many decisions over large-scale risks are not a matter of choosing between safe and risky alternatives, but between different risky alternatives, and often between alternatives whose risks are too qualitatively different to easily compare. Existing forms of scientific and public discourse are no match for such considerations. Here governments adopt the strategy of deliberate simplification. They present each specific decision as one between safe and risky alternatives, while playing down the uncertainties of nuclear energy and focusing attention on the oil crisis and climate change. The striking fact is that the lines of conflict within world-risk society are cultural ones. The more global risks escape the usual methods of scientific calculation and turn out to be a domain of relative non-knowledge, the more important becomes the cultural perception of specific global risks - that is, the belief in their reality or unreality. In the case of nuclear power, we are witnessing a clash of risk cultures. Thus the Chernobyl experience is perceived differently in Germany and France, Britain, Spain or Ukraine and Russia. For many Europeans the threats posed by climate change now loom much more largely than nuclear power or terrorism. Now that climate change is regarded as man-made, and its catastrophic impacts viewed as inevitable, the cards are being reshuffled in society and politics. But it is completely mistaken to represent climate change as an unavoidable path to human destruction. For climate change opens up unexpected opportunities to rewrite the priorities and rules of politics. Although the rise in the price of oil benefits the climate, it comes with the threat of mass decline. The explosion in energy costs is gnawing away at the standard of living and is giving rise to a risk of poverty at the heart of society. As a consequence, the priority which was still accorded energy security 20 years after Chernobyl is being undermined by the question of how long consumers can maintain their standards of living in the face of the steady increase in energy prices. Yet to disregard the \"vestigial risk\" of nuclear energy is to misunderstand the cultural and political dynamic of the \"residual-risk-society\". The most tenacious, convincing and effective critics of nuclear energy are not the greens - the most influential opponent of the nuclear industry is the nuclear industry itself. Even if politicians were successful in the semantic reinvention of nuclear power as green electricity, and even if the opposing social movements were to dissipate their energy through fragmentation, this is all nullified by the real opposing force of the threat. It is constant, permanent and remains present even when exhausted demonstrators have long since given up. The probability of improbable accidents increases with the number of \"green\" nuclear plants; each \"occurrence\" awakens memories of all the others, across the world. For risk is not synonymous with catastrophe. Risk means the anticipation of catastrophe, not just in a specific place but everywhere. It doesn't even have to come to a mini-Chernobyl in Europe. The global public need only get wind of negligence and \"human error\" somewhere in the world and suddenly the governments advocating \"green\" nuclear energy will find themselves accused of gambling recklessly and against their better judgment with the security interests of the population. What will become of \"responsible citizens\" who cannot sense these threats produced by civilisation, and hence are robbed of their sovereign judgment? Consider the following thought experiment. What would happen if radioactivity caused itchiness? Realists, also known as cynics, will answer: people would invent something, for example an ointment, to \"suppress\" the itching. A profitable business with a good future. Of course, persuasive explanations would immediately be offered explaining that the itching was unimportant, that it could be traced back to other factors. Presumably such attempts to explain things away would have a poor chance of survival if everyone ran around with skin rashes scratching themselves and fashion shoots and business meetings were accompanied by incessant scratching. Then the social and political ways of dealing with modern large-scale hazards would face a completely different situation because the issue under dispute and negotiation would be culturally visible. · Ulrich Beck is author of World Risk Society and professor of sociology at Munich's Ludwig-Maximilians University and the London School of Economics u.beck@lmu.de"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/blog/2010/dec/15/julian-assange-khodorkovsky-holbrooke-michael-white","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-15T11:21:47Z","webTitle":"Julian Assange is no hero – but Khodorkovsky and Holbrooke may qualify | Michael White","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2010/dec/15/julian-assange-khodorkovsky-holbrooke-michael-white","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/2010/dec/15/julian-assange-khodorkovsky-holbrooke-michael-white","fields":{"headline":"Assange is no hero – but Holbrooke and Khodorkovsky may qualify","bodyText":"Watching the TV news and reading newspaper accounts of Julian Assange's bail hearing I'm struck by the need some people have to embrace heroes, an impulse which is mirrored by an equally urgent need for villains, preferably American ones. Personally, I don't find Assange quite satisfactory in that role, for reasons I'll explain. But cheer up. In today's Guardian I can find two weightier candidates and the good news is that one is an improbable Russian, the other an American. Being only human, heroes often have feet of clay, and if not feet, other organs. They do great things or symbolise noble causes, but are personally vain or vindictive; they chase women or become autocratic. Life is messy like that, as the ancient Greeks explained long ago. I'm pleased to read this morning that former Grenadier Guards officer Captain Vaughan Smith has offered his family's ancient Norfolk estate (where hunting facilities are available) as a bail address for the WikiLeaks founder as he fights Swedish demands for his extradition over sexual assault allegations. Good for him, and it carries a ironical bonus: scourge of establishment rescued by establishment maverick, as Luke Harding and Sam Jones put it in today's witty Guardian account of the court hearing. There's not been a lot of humour – warmth even – in the WikiLeaks saga so far. I suspect it's not an Assange family trait any more than it's an Angry John Pilger trait. Since surfacing to face his accusers, Assange has attracted all sorts of familiar celeb support – exemplified by Bianca Jagger – so it's a further bonus that I've never previously heard of Captain Smith (47), restaurateur, farmer, war reporter. He seems to have had an interesting life so far without feeling the need to draw undue attention to himself. As for Assange, the Guardian's technology editor, Charles Arthur, tries to make sense of his career and attitudes in today's paper and has a bit of a struggle. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the ex-colleague who accused him of behaving \"like an emperor or slave trader\" was promptly suspended and is now setting up a rival outfit. Hmm. That figures. No humour, too much zeal, messianic qualities... Gosh, Assange is starting to sound like Nick Clegg – whom I did hear speak on the circuit last night. At a Christmas party given by Policy Exchange, the fashionable Tory thinktank (they all have their moment), the deputy PM certainly did not understate the coalition's ambitions. I came in late, just where he'd got to explaining that the coalition took office after 20 years of indisciplined public and private debt-building when the country was \"close to the collapse of the economic order\". But don't panic. The coalition is engaged in a \"series of transformations\" that will decentralise the state, rebalance the economy away from the financial sector and debt, spread power of all kinds more fairly across the country and across social classes, all this despite inheriting \"a culture which is very resistant to pluralism in politics,\" Clegg said. Well, good luck. If he manages 10% of that he will have done well and deserve our thanks. Contrast such talk with a junior minister with whom I chatted earlier in the day. How are things going? \"We're already behaving like the Labour government. We're all working in our silos, we're not talking to each other, we all hate the Treasury, where the civil servants are running the show. No 10 is in chaos.\" As summaries go that sounds more realistic in a world full of outraged naivety and misplaced indignation which can become exhausting after a while. Thus on today's Guardian comment pages Peter Wilby, a veteran hack of great charm, berates the Lib Dems for all sorts of betrayals – on tuition fees, nuclear power, cuts – and warns Clegg he won't get his AV referendum \"yes\" (Wilby is pro-PR) after such conduct. Indeed not (ho ho). Wilby goes on to argue that the coalition has no mandate and should have sought one as Lloyd George did in 1918 and Ramsay MacDonald in 1931 – such wholesome analogies – because voters only have one chance in five years to influence policy. This is nonsense on stilts but it is widely shared, despite this being a time when politicians are arguably too cowed by the relentless grind of public opinion, markets, media etc to take the wise, long view instead of plumping for the softer, safer option. But let's stay cheerful. Today's paper does pay tribute to two improbable characters with proper claims to heroic status. To mark today's verdict in the latest rigged trial of the Russian ex-oil-oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the Guardian carries a wonderful commentary by Boris Akunin, one of Russia's most popular crime writers. No Kremlin party invites for Akunin this Christmas because he places Khodorkovsky in a long line of what he calls Russian \"aristocrats\" – high-minded idealists who struggle for human freedom and dignity against what he calls the \"arrest-ocracy\" (I'm sure it sounds better in Russian), whose response is always to lock people up or murder them: the Tsar's \"third section\" becomes the Cheka, then the NKVD, the KGB and now the FSB of Vladimir Putin's \"mafia state\" (copyright WikiLeaks). Akunin realises how unlikely a hero Khodorkovsky is, a man who made a great fortune out of the looting of the old USSR when the 1990s privatisation of the economy was botched in the best Russian tradition – like quirky heroes Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov, all the way back to the eccentric Tolstoy and the doomed aristo-plotters known as the Decembrists. Khodorkovsky was charged with economic crimes – including avoiding tax on laundered cash, if you can follow that one. Once Russia's richest man as head of Yukos, his real crime, Miriam Elder reports in an adjoining article, was funding political parties that tried to oppose Putin. In his closing statement to the court, Khodorkovsky warned that much more than his own life and liberty are at stake today. \"A state that destroys its best companies, which are ready to become global champions, a country that holds its own citizens in contempt ... is a sick state.\" You can read the full statement here. And today's heroic American? I never much warmed to Richard \"Raging Bull\" Holbrooke as a public figure; too much the arrogant bully for my taste. Yet when you read the obits of the 69-year-old diplomat, one of the last products of the great cold war-era of reality-based public officials, you cannot be but impressed by his range, his energy and (sometimes) effectiveness. At least I can't. He died in Washington on Monday after a ruptured aorta during prolonged surgery that failed to save him. From Vietnam (tainted by it) to his Dayton Accords, which stopped the Bosnian slaughter, and the rescue of Kosovo (still causing trouble) and the Af-Pak border today, the Holbrookes of this world do more good than harm. They could have spent their lives making money (which is what Holbrooke did during Republican years) or having more fun than shouting matches with local tyrants. That's what the WikiLeaks saga is actually telling us, though many people will find it difficult to accept, Julian Assange among them. Today it's cocaine corruption in west Africa that worries western diplomats. Who else will try to stem it? I'm not sure Silvio Berlusconi wants the responsibility."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sustainable-business/budget-labour-green-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"sustainable-business","sectionName":"Guardian Sustainable Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-24T15:50:44Z","webTitle":"Labour budget to support new industries and cut government energy use","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/budget-labour-green-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sustainable-business/budget-labour-green-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK budget supports green industry and cuts energy use","bodyText":"Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling announced Labour's 2010 budget today, in which he confirmed earlier forecasts of the launch of a £2bn green infrastructure investment fund.

Infrastructure to replace \"aging nuclear power stations\" would also be put in place. Other green investments included £270m for a 2010-11 modernisation fund for science, technology, engineering and maths university courses starting Sept 2010, as well as a new fund to help to realise the commercial potential for British inventions. A £2.5bn growth package, partly funded from a tax on bank bonuses, would also boost training for young people, Darling announced. The government intends to pursue a \"cooperative approach\" with electric car companies. Darling argued that financial incentives were essential in persuading electric car manufacturers, such as Nissan, to build plants in the UK. Car scrappage schemes, according to government figures, had driven an increase in sales of nearly 30%. High speed UK rail transport links were confirmed as well as £100m for local roads, and £285m for motorway improvements. The government had no plans to cut spending, Darling announced, as cutting support \"would delay a return to growth\".

The Conservative leader made his comments in an interview in the Daily Mail in which he also said that he did not know Goldsmith was a \"non-dom\" until it was revealed by a newspaper at the weekend. Goldsmith has confirmed that he retained the non-domiciled tax status he inherited from his father, the billionaire Sir James Goldsmith. Being a \"non-dom\" means he does not pay tax on offshore income. At the weekend, when his tax status was revealed, Goldsmith said that he paid tax on his locally generated income and that he intended to give up being a non-dom. Cameron said he should do so as a matter of urgency. \"He's obviously going to end this status and become a full UK taxpayer and he needs to do that as rapidly as can be done,\" Cameron told the Mail. Cameron also said that all Tory candidates would have be resident in the UK for tax purposes. Yesterday, in a speech, Goldsmith himself said he would not be corrupted by power, and said politics had to enter a new era of transparency and integrity to regain trust, including on green taxes. Speaking at an event in London organised by a semi-spiritual group, Alternatives, he insisted no new nuclear power stations would be built under a Tory government, admitted he would not want the support of Rupert Murdoch's Sun and described the paper's campaign against Gordon Brown over his treatment of bereaved relatives in the Afghan war as repulsive. He also said that if a Cameron government did not make progress on environmental issues after one term in power, then the Tories' political share price would go \"through the floor\". In remarks lasting over an hour, Goldsmith admitted that he was seen by some as a wealthy Tory green toff, but refused to take questions on his tax status from reporters afterwards. He insisted: \"I find it hard to imagine how I would be corrupted by power because I have no great career path planned out.\" He said the reputation of politics had fallen to a new low, but that politics was changing for the good due to the MPs' expenses scandal. The controversy over his tax status did not lead Goldsmith to hold back on expressing stark views on other issues. He called for a mandatory ban on plastic bags in supermarkets, a scaling back of the BBC to its core purpose and the closure of the Food Standards Agency. He also said that Barack Obama had used up his political capital over his attempt to reform the US healthcare system and said no deal on carbon emissions would be possible at Copenhagen. The single biggest block to action on green issues in Britain, Goldsmith said, was the media. He said \"politicians are afraid of one thing and one thing only, and that is losing their job: they are afraid of being booted out in the subsequent election; that is the thing that motivates most politicians. As long as the media remains completely, cripplingly, violently hostile to green talk and green solutions, I do not think politicians will really have the courage to grapple with this issue.\" He said \"until politicians put a cost on those things that do have a cost, such as forest pollution, waste, use of scarce resources, we don't have a hope\". At the same time he predicted the fate of a Cameron government rested on its performance on green issues. \"If after five years we have not had a significant shift in the right direction, the political share price of David Cameron and the Conservative party will have gone through the floor. The Tory party will be brutalised.\" He said the admission that \"we cannot get out of this mess without green taxes is absolutely incumbent on total honesty and transparency, and you have got to be bullish, or there is no point in doing it\". He also said he hoped Rupert Murdoch would not be behind Cameron in power. He said the Sun's treatment of Gordon Brown over his letter to the mother of a bereaved soldier had left him with \"a very odd feeling, that my heart went out to Gordon Brown and I was repulsed by the Sun and I thought: 'My God, I did not want this newspaper to be backing my campaign.' It is immoral and unethical and wrong. \"The Conservative party by default got caught up by this, which is a shame.\" He said the party's association with the Sun had led to a fall in Tory support. Presaging a Conservative row to come, he predicted that if the party stuck to its existing policy, it would never allow the building of a new nuclear power station. He said Tory policy \"was to give a green light to nuclear power as long as there is no call on the taxpayer, not just in terms of building, but maintenance, security and disposal of waste. In the history of nuclear power there has never been a station built without huge use of taxpayers' subsidy.\" He also warned that the effect of environmentalists trying to suppress climate change deniers \"was only driving more and more people into the camps of sceptics. Environmentalists so used to be squashed at every moment have suddenly got a good stage, and they have not been sharing it. That is a an awful form of politics.

The announcement was the second piece of encouraging news from the US in 24 hourson the prospect of reaching a global deal on climate change. In his state of the union address on Wednesday, Barack Obama promised to keep pushing on his energy and climate change agenda. The intervention could boost the slim prospects of getting Congress to act on climate change - which is widely seen as a precondition for a global deal. In his letter to the UN, the state department climate change envoy, Todd Stern, said that America could cut carbon emissions by 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. However, he said, the commitment was contingent on Congress passing climate change legislation. The letter reaffirms the promise Obama made to the summit last month to cutUS emissions and work for a global climate deal. It says the 2020 commitment was a first step towards cutting America's global warming pollution by 42% in 2030, and by more than 80% by the middle of the century. \"The US submission reflects President Obama's continued commitment to meeting the climate change and clean energy challenge through robust domestic and international action that will strengthen our economy, enhance our national security and protect our environment,\" Stern wrote. He said America was acting on the assumption that other countries which signed the accord would take similar action. \"The United States is committed to working with our partners around the world to make the accord operational and to continue the effort to build a strong, effective, science-based, global regime to combat the profound threat of climate change,\" Stern wrote. Under the slight, 12-paragraph, accord reached at Copenhagen, industrialised countries and the rapidly emerging economies like India and China were expected to offer formal notification of their plans to act on emissions by January 31. However, the UN has since indicated that deadline is somewhat elastic, and there are fears that the momentum in the run-up to Copenhagen has fizzled away. Obama offered some sense of movement in his speech, refusing to back down on climate agenda despite running into opposition from Republicans, as well as Democrats from oil and coal states, and the industrial heartland. He told Congress he would carry on. \"I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy, and I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change,\" he said. \"But even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future. \" Obama's new vision for an energy and climate bill, spelled out on Wednesday, do not necessarily align with those of environmental groups or the liberal wing of his own Democratic party. He called for opening up new areas for offshore drilling and building more nuclear power plants. But his willingness to recommit his administration to the energy agenda could boost the slim prospects of getting a climate change bill out of the Senate this year. Democrat John Kerry and Republican Lindsey Graham have been lobbying hard among Republicans and conservative Democrats - as well as business leaders - to try and craft a compromise bill. Obama, in his support for nuclear power and offshore drilling, hit on some of the components Kerry and Graham have been discussing. But several Senators told reporters they still thought it unlikely the Senate would take up energy and climate before the end of 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/datablog/2010/apr/28/factfile-uk-environment-transport","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-27T23:05:00Z","webTitle":"Damian Carrington explains: What has happened to the UK's environment and transport policy?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/datablog/2010/apr/28/factfile-uk-environment-transport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/datablog/2010/apr/28/factfile-uk-environment-transport","fields":{"headline":"What has happened to the UK's environment and transport policy?","bodyText":"\"The green belt is a Labour achievement and we intend to build on it.\" So said deputy prime minister John Prescott in January 1998. In fact what the government did go on to build upon was the Kyoto protocol on climate change that Prescott had helped deliver just months before. Now enshrined in UK law is an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and near-term carbon budgets the get us on the way. The nation's carbon footprint has been shrinking, but largely due to the ongoing switch from coal to gas to generate electricity, the off-shoring of our manufacturing industry and its pollution and, latterly, the recession. Our housing remains astoundingly draughty, venting heat to the skies where the soaring number of cheap flights have been carrying people to holidays in the sun. And in an irony that even \"two jags\" himself might appreciate, the number of two-car households doubled in the decade to 2008. Thankfully, road casualties have thankfully fallen by a quarter in that time, even though number of miles travelled by car has risen. Rail travel and cycling are also on the rise now, but from a level way below that in the 1950s – a mere 2% of all journeys are now pedal-powered compared to Germany's 10%. We also recycle our rubbish much more than before, but our aversion to incinerating the rest means we are still the landfill kings of Europe. The low-carbon industrial and transport future now backed by all the main political parties is also starting from the bottom – just 2% of our energy is currently renewable, placing us near the foot of the EU league. But change is afoot – on home insulation, wind and wave power subsidies, carbon cuts for businesses, high-speed rail, and \"clean coal\".

This week many of the key people with the ability to break the deadlock in these talks met behind closed doors at the Major Economies Forum that Ed Miliband hosted in London (Miliband: climate change pact uncertain, 20 October). To unblock the UN process, rich countries must demonstrate to the developing countries that they are serious about getting an ambitious, fair and legally binding agreement at Copenhagen in December. That means developed countries urgently need to commit new money to help pay for low-carbon growth in developing countries. We estimate this will require a commitment of more than $160bn from developed countries each year by 2020. Developed countries must also urgently offer bold emissions cuts of more than 40% in their carbon emissions below 1990 levels between now and 2020. These two issues of money and ambitious reductions must top the agenda ahead of Copenhagen. Now is the time for the backroom deals to end, and for real leadership and action to begin.

This would commit government to cutting its own emissions by 10% next year. Climate change is the biggest threat to health that we face this century and, as the largest public sector employer in Europe, the NHS has a huge part to play in creating a sustainable, low-carbon, healthy future for us all. Already it is taking up the challenge, with over 40 NHS trusts and other healthcare organisations already signed up to 10:10, and more joining all the time. We urge members of parliament to show that they are prepared to take the necessary action to prevent the global health catastrophe that runaway climate change would cause. Signing up government including the Department of Health is an important first step and sends a strong message to everyone. Dr David Pencheon NHS Sustainable Development Unit, Prof Hugh Montgomery University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Prof Ian Gilmore Royal College of Physicians, Prof Mike Gill Climate &amp; Health Council, Muir Gray Campaign for Greener Healthcare, Dr Richard Horton The Lancet, Dr Robin Stott Climate &amp; Health Council • Lord Hunt's assertion that \"Putting nuclear energy at the very heart of our low-carbon economy is part of our credibility going into the climate summit in Copenhagen,\" rests on a dangerously naive world-view (UK is ideal for new nuclear power, 19 October). Developing country governments will look at these plans to power a high-consumption economy that many of them aspire to. This may well mean a 2050 world of hundreds of nuclear power plants across Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. We need to leave not only the technology of the 20th century behind, but political attitudes too. In a highly interconnected world, large-scale investment in technologies we would like to see replicated around the world should be at the heart of the UK government's response to climate change. Dr Simon Lewis Earth and Biosphere Institute • George Monbiot \"would choose nuclear dumping over climate breakdown\" as if this were the nub of the matter (Repulsive it may be, but climate crash would be worse, 20 October). Could he explain how many nuclear power stations worldwide would be needed to prevent climate breakdown? Has he a timetable for the worldwide construction and costing of these, that would deliver the required carbon reduction in time? And what about the substantial energy poverty of those who live in isolated environments, far away from these heavy industrial plants? Surely a more radical and imaginative proposal would be the adoption of existing low-tech methods and the localisation of energy supplies and conservation, with the resultant self-sufficiency and increase in living standards. Val Mainwood Wivenhoe, Essex • Nuclear power is not the only energy industry with a waste disposal problem.The \"spent fuel\" from burning coal and oil is called carbon dioxide. Disposing of CO2 properly (\"carbon capture\") is a much harder problem than nuclear waste disposal because: there is 10,000 times as much waste per unit of energy produced; CO2 is a high-pressure reactive gas, not an inert solid; CO2 has to be sequestered for ever. So here is the solution to nuclear waste disposal: for every 1,000 kg of CO2 pumped into an underground disposal site, drop in 1kg of high-level nuclear waste as a vitreous gravel. Andrew Coulson Musselburgh, East Lothian • While pointing out the exorbitant cost of nuclear power (A power play the consumer is bound to lose, 19 October), you assert that there is \"no difference\" between whether these costs are borne by consumers or the taxpayer. This is wrong – the difference is significant. Around 4 million households in the UK currently live in fuel poverty. Saddling these households with the burden of the nuclear bill is extremely regressive. By contrast, use of the taxation system makes for a progressive policy.

The SNP is regarded with deep suspicion by many on the left, as if there's a BNP in there just waiting to get out. But what no one seems to give Salmond credit for is leading the only party in the UK that is committed to defending explicitly social democratic values in government, removing Trident nuclear weapons, rejecting nuclear power in favour of renewable energy, blocking identity cards and establishing an open border policy for immigration. In his conference speech in Inverness Salmond received a standing ovation for saying that one Trident submarine in the Clyde is one too many. When did we last hear any UK party leader say that? The metropolitan left seems to have decided that there is nothing anyone can do about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in the UK – as if it is just a fact of political life. We have a Labour government that is committed to spending around £100bn on a weapons system that is a moral abomination, a military anachronism and a dangerous health hazard. Someone has to call a halt to this madness. In the UK, nuclear power is also regarded as a fait accompli, even though the vast majority of environmentalists are opposed to nuclear generation because of its cost and because there is no solution to disposing of the hazardous nuclear waste. Around Scotland's shores, there are 60 gigawatts of renewable energy in wind, wave, and tidal power, just waiting to be converted into useful power. Yet, without any real political debate, Gordon Brown has decided that there should be a new generation of nuclear power stations – and that the UK taxpayer is going to have to shoulder the burden of insuring them and cleaning up the toxic residue. If and when the Conservatives come to power, there is going to be a choice: accept the cuts and George Osborne's attempts to dismantle the welfare state, or challenge the deflationary logic of austerity and defend public services. At least there is no doubt which side Alex Salmond and the SNP are on. I'm not so sure about the other parties.

It is to launch 'great green fleet', a fighting force of ships, submarines and planes powered entirely by biofuels. The first group will be tested in 2012, and the navy plans for it to be operational by 2016. The push for greener fighting forces runs across the Pentagon. The military accounts for nearly 80% of the US government's energy consumption and the two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have made strategists acutely conscious of both the massive cost and serious security risks of the gas-guzzling ways of the past. By the time it arrives in the war zone, a gallon of gas can cost up to $400, according to a study by the Pew project on national security, energy and climate. The US military is also anxious to cut down on fuel convoys to reduce troops' exposure to roadside bombs and other risks. While a large proportion of Americans remain sceptical about global warming, the Pentagon does not. Its long-term strategic review earlier this year officially recognised global warming as a security threat. \"The department of defence takes climate change seriously,\" said Amanda Dory, deputy assistant secretary of defence for strategy. The Pentagon has committed to procuring 25% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. It is also looking to convert its fighting machine to greener sources of fuel. On Thursday, the navy will test an F/A-18 Super Hornet – the biggest gas-guzzler in the US air fleet – powered by a 50-50 mix of jet fuel and camelina, an oil seed grown in Montana. The army is also investing in portable wind generators and working to take its huge base in Fort Irwin California off the public electricity grid in the next decade, using a 500MW solar panel array. The Marine Corps, meanwhile, has a 10x10 campaign aimed at reducing energy and water use over the next 10 years. The navy has a head start on the other branches of the military. About 17% of its craft -aircraft carriers and submarines — are already fuelled by nuclear power. Aside from the green strike fleet, the navy hopes to get half of its energy consumption, on-shore and afloat, from alternative energy. But the military's idea of the plus sides advantages of going green may still not entirely chime with those of environmental campaigners. \"The over-riding reason was to make us better war fighters,\" said the navy secretary Ray Mabus."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2009/oct/21/1","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2009-10-21T11:38:40Z","webTitle":"Green light: Nuclear special, carbon calculator and ladybird invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/21/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2009/oct/21/1","fields":{"headline":"Green light: Nuclear special, carbon calculator and ladybird invasion","bodyText":"Nuclear power • Secret files reveal covert network run by nuclear police • Families face nuclear tax on power bills • Landfill sites may be used to dump radioactive waste • George Monbiot: I'd choose nuclear power over a climate crash Our nuclear special report this week lifts the lid on the technology that's at the centre of the UK's plans for a low-carbon future.

For days after the waves destroyed vast stretches of the Tohoku region's coast, patients filled the corridors of hospitals deprived of heat and water, and doctors examined thousands of patients, knowing essential drugs had been swept away by the walls of muddy water. And while they waited for supplies, they watched helplessly as elderly patients who had survived the tsunami succumbed to hypothermia. When aid workers arrived, they were greeted by scenes of devastation that would not look out of place in a war zone. But this tragedy was being played out in one of the world's wealthiest countries, fewer than 200 miles from the neon-lit opulence of its capital, Tokyo. One of them, a nurse who was part of an emergency medical team dispatched from Tokyo, has written about her experiences in a blog that offers one of the most detailed accounts yet of the tsunami's toll on the tens of thousands who survived. Thanks to an anonymous translator, every word of her online journal is available in English. The blog has received scant coverage in the mainstream Japanese media. But it has generated thousands of online comments, most of them messages of gratitude from evacuees and fellow aid workers, and others who simply drew strength from her words. The nurse has declined potential book and interview requests, and clung to her anonymity, as has the blogger who translated her journal into English in a single sitting. Painstakingly tapped into the nurse's mobile phone at the end of exhausting days touring evacuation zones and hospitals, the blog chronicles eight days that begin with trepidation and end with a reluctant return to Tokyo. In between, there are moments of despair and optimism, even humour. And floods of tears. The blog opens with the nurse preparing for her imminent assignment to Rikuzentakata, a town in Iwate prefecture where 2,000 of the 23,000 residents died and 80% of its 8,000 homes were destroyed. Before they leave, she and her fellow medical workers are told what they can expect to find, and warned to keep their emotions in check. The team leader tells them: \"The situation over there is beyond your worst imagination. If any of you have signed up with optimistic outlooks or [out of] a spirit of volunteerism, please leave the team now. \"No matter what happens at the site, DO NOT CRY. We are not going there to express our sympathy. We are going there to provide nursing and medical care. If you think YOU want to cry, think about how much the people there want to cry. The tears of a rich medical team from Tokyo will only be bothersome or even insulting to them.\" The nurse describes the moment she arrives in a snowbound Rikuzentakata, her nose irritated by a \"sharp, burnt odour\", the only sound that of military and media helicopters circling a town that, aside from a few gutted buildings, no longer exists. Her journey on foot to an evacuation site is punctuated by pauses to clasp her hands in prayer as troops pull yet another body from the rubble. She spends the first of many nights sleeping on the floor, \"packed like sardines, regardless of gender\" in a prefabricated hut located next to a makeshift mortuary. At the end of that first night, exhausted but unable to sleep, she begins her chronicle, pausing occasionally in a futile attempt to seek comfort in browsing old photos and messages from friends: \"I'd held in my tears all day, so I wrapped myself in a bath towel and cried until morning came.\" On her walks through ruined neighbourhoods she encounters residents in shock and eager to share their experiences with someone from the outside: \"They tell us that a pitch-black tsunami about 15 metres high went back and forth and swallowed everything whole. There were many people who were washed away while preparing to run or even while running away after the call for evacuation was made. \"We have religious ceremonies several times a year to pay respect to the ocean, and we've always lived feeling grateful . . . for the ocean, and still . . . our guide was shedding tears as we walked. \"I was already on the verge of crying myself, but I promised not to cry no matter what, so I turned my eyes away from reality and watched the clouded sky instead. \"As the wind blows, a sepia-colored photograph and a new year's greeting card with a picture of someone's baby come flying to my feet. And at every step or two, there is a red flag fluttering in the wind. A whole slew of flags – too many to even begin to count. These red flags are standing to mark places where bodies have been found. \"An old lady is standing in front of one of the flags. She might be about the same age as my own grandmother. 'Dear nurse from Tokyo, there was a house here that my husband worked so hard to build after the war. He never got sick once but now he's dead.' \"It was impossible not to cry.\" The extraordinary speed with which tens of thousands of troops cleared rubble from the roads through Rikuzentakata and dozens of other communities was a symbolic, yet ultimately cosmetic, sign of recovery. Beneath the ruins, the human tragedy was still unfolding: \"The streets have been fixed, and much heavy machinery has finally come into Rikuzentakata. And as the rubble is cleared, many dead bodies have emerged. \"Beneath the rubble, I heard the ringtone of a cell phone that finally had reception since the system recovered the day before. It was very difficult . . . painful when the body of a pregnant woman came out.\" Her moments of self-doubt – she muses on the futility of applying bandages to people suffering deep emotional trauma – are offset by small triumphs: the appearance of the sun after days of snow, the arrival of medical supplies, and a \"gourmet\" meal of rice balls, bread and Yakult. The unannounced return of lighting to one shelter is greeted by spontaneous applause: \"When everyone's effort takes shape in a visible form like this, it makes me feel like I've been pushed forward to work harder than ever before.\" The nurse witnesses firsthand the two most painful threads running through Japan's post-tsunami narrative: the large number of elderly victims, and the displacement of tens of thousands of children. Police figures released last week show that more than two-thirds of the 11,000-plus victims identified so far were aged 60 or over – and that 90% of them had drowned. The advanced age of many of those who died has come to be a defining characteristic of the tsunami. Japan has one of the greyest societies on earth; in the Tohoku region, the over-64s make up almost a third of the population. They also comprise a large proportion of the shelters' inhabitants. In the first week after the tsunami, Japanese media carried a report about troops arriving at a hospital in Futaba, 10km from the Fukushima nuclear power plant, to find 128 elderly patients, some of them comatose, who had apparently been left to fend for themselves. Fourteen later died, including two who did not last the bus journey to an evacuation centre. No one knows for sure yet how many children have lost both parents, although the official count is already more than 100. They include a four-year-old girl now living with her grandmother, and a teenage brother and sister who were taken in by their dance instructor. In one of her most emotional posts, the nurse writes about her friendship with an \"adorable\" six-year-old girl named Luna, whose mother's body was pulled from the rubble clutching her daughter's favourite dolls and books. In another passage, she recounts talking to a young boy who is poring over a mud-spattered comic about Doraemon, a blue cat with magical powers: \"I talked to a boy who had a fever and a loss of appetite. He showed me a Doraemon book covered in mud. I asked him what his favourite was of all of Doraemon's tools. 'I used to like the ozashiki tsuribori (indoor fishing mat), but now my favorite is the taimu furoshiki (wrapping cloth of time). I want to wrap up the whole city with the taimu furoshiki and make it go back to how it was before the earthquake.\" By the time the nurse returns to Tohoku in the summer, the medical focus will have shifted from the acute to the chronic phase, as people run the risk of succumbing to illnesses associated with life as evacuees: blood clots, stress-induced ulcers, pneumonia, high blood pressure and depression. Children will require counselling to overcome the trauma of seeing their homes and, in some cases, relatives and friends swept away. In April , many began a new academic year in schools with too many empty desks. Health workers are bracing themselves for a dramatic rise in the number of people with mental health problems, particularly among those who face months living in cramped shelters. Long-term care will require efforts as heroic as those that earned Takeshi Kanno, a 31-year-old doctor in Minamisanriku who saved countless lives on the day of tsunami, a place in TIME magazine's 100 most influential people. \"For a lot of people who up until this point have been able to ignore reality and what actually happened, as they get back on their feet they realise that their house is gone, or their children are dead, and they're being forced to confront these facts,\" said Toru Hosada, a volunteer doctor in Yamada, a port town in Iwate prefecture. \"A lot of them are extremely uncertain as to what they can do.\" Meanwhile, the anonymous nurse's blog seems to have brought comfort to many readers. \"On behalf of the people of Iwate and the whole Tohoku region I want to express my appreciation for your work. Thank you,\" says one. Another, who has family in Rikuzentakata, writes: \"There are many people whose homes have been swept away, their relatives swallowed up by the sea or saved. Knowing that you are there makes me feel better about not being there myself. It might make you angry to hear this, but please shed tears for all of those who have died. Thank you so much. It's dangerous underfoot there, so please take care.\" As she prepares to return to Tokyo on 23 March, the nurse is no longer troubled by the minor deprivations of life in the field. She \"bathes\" with baby wipes, stops fretting about her \"sticky hair\" and cleans her \"dirty, makeup-less face\" using tissues moistened with oolong tea. And as for the town she entered with such foreboding just over a week earlier: \"Rikuzentakata has become my second home, and I wish for the restoration of my homeland with all my heart . . . \"The truly hard times are still ahead of us. As news about the disaster begins to disappear from the TV and other media outlets, everyone else will start to forget, and the problems faced in the affected areas will only increase. More people falling ill, more sadness. It is of course a good thing that the rest of us make an effort to be cheerful and strong and return to our usual lives as best we can, but we must never forget about March 11.\" Read blog in English jkts-english.blogspot.com or Japanese blog.goo.ne.jp/flower-wing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/jan/17/gdf-suez-bid-for-international-power","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-17T20:19:55Z","webTitle":"GDF Suez launches International Power bid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jan/17/gdf-suez-bid-for-international-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/jan/17/gdf-suez-bid-for-international-power","fields":{"headline":"GDF Suez launches International Power bid","bodyText":"Europe's fifth-largest electricity generator, GDF Suez, is understood to have made a tentative takeover offer for the FTSE 100-listed International Power in a move likely to raise political concerns about the sale of essential British infrastructure. GDF Suez is 35% owned by the French government. With a market value of more than £55bn, it dwarfs International Power, which owns half a dozen power stations in Britain and is worth just under £5bn. The two companies are believed to have been in talks since before Christmas; last week the French government department that deals with state shareholdings gave its approval for a bid. GDF Suez, which also has operations in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East, has appointed the banks Rothschild, BNP Paribas and Goldman Sachs to thrash out the details of a cash and shares bid, according to weekend press reports. While GDF Suez's share price has performed poorly on the French CAC40 index over the past year, the company does have a rumoured €12bn (£10.6bn) in cash at its disposal. Some of its shareholders have been agitating for it to use those resources to expand more aggressively. News that a tentative approach has been made will increase pressure on the board of International Power to make an announcement to the London Stock Exchange, and a clarifying statement could come as early as tomorrow morning. There has been speculation about the future of International Power for weeks, and on Friday shares in the company closed up almost 5%. International Power was spun out of npower a decade ago and has operations across the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In the UK, it owns power stations at Derby, Rugeley in Staffordshire, Deeside in north Wales, St Austell in Cornwall and Saltend near Hull, and also has exposure to renewable energy through its First Hydro joint venture with Japan's Mitsui &amp; Co. It generates enough electricity to power 4m homes. Neither company would comment but any deal would put yet another part of the nation's infrastructure in foreign hands at a time when British companies still struggle to break into continental European markets and when politicians are becoming increasingly concerned about the security of gas and electricity supplies. Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, recently warned that foreign ownership of British companies could be a \"disadvantage\" to the country over a long period and warned that he was \"keeping a weather eye on this area\". Only two of the UK's household energy suppliers – Centrica and Scottish and Southern Energy – remain in British ownership, just over a decade after the market was opened up to full competition. International Power's former parent npower is now part of Germany's RWE. Thames Water is owned by the Australian bank Macquarie, having previously belonged to RWE; the nuclear power company British Energy is part of the French group EDF; the airports operator BAA is owned by the Spanish infrastructure group Ferrovial; and Scottish Power is part of Spain's Iberdrola. The debate about the UK's energy security and the role of British companies has spilled into the march towards renewable energy. The government has already tried to kickstart a green energy revolution, announcing projects that will see billions invested in offshore wind power, as well as turning to nuclear power to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the first batch of contracts to create the next generation of offshore wind farms went mainly to foreign bidders. Nine wind power consortiums have signed agreements with the Crown Estate, which has responsibility for renewable power in UK waters, to take their proposals through the planning stage. Only five of these include British companies.

Unrealistic experiments and crude engineering suggest that success may be beyond Burma's reach, say researchers for an opposition Burmese media group. They base their claims on information provided by Sai Thein Win, a former major in the Burmese army, who is said to have been trained in Russia in missile technology. He has since defected from Burma. \"The intent is clear and that is a very disturbing matter for international agreements,\" said the researchers, Robert Kelley and Ali Fowle, of the Democratic Voice of Burma. \"Burma is trying to build pieces of a nuclear programme, specifically a nuclear reactor to make plutonium and a uranium enrichment programme\". A report, Burma's Nuclear Ambitions, is being broadcast on the Arabic satellite television channel al-Jazeera today. \"What we have uncovered is the very beginnings of a nuclear weapons programme,\" Evan Williams, the programme's reporter, said last night. In a related development, Jim Webb, chairman of the US Senate foreign relations subcommittee on east Asia and Pacific affairs, said he had put off a visit to Burma because of new, albeit unsubstantiated, allegations that its military regime was collaborating with North Korea to develop a nuclear programme. \"Until there is further clarification on these matters, I believe it would be unwise and potentially counterproductive for me to visit Burma,\" Webb said. Kelley and Fowle's report, Nuclear Related Activities in Burma, contains a copy of what they say is a secret document from the country's \"nuclear battalion\", instructing a factory to build a \"bomb reactor\". According to a translation, the letter requests the production of material to make a bomb reactor needed for research \"for the use of special substance production\". It is signed by Lieutenant Colonel Win Ko. The request came from the No 1 Science and Technology Regiment, Thabeikkyin, and is dated 4 February 2010. It is colloquially referred to as the nuclear battalion, Kelley and Fowle say in their report. They say that the term \"bomb reactor\" was \"simply a very strong vessel to contain a violent chemical reaction\". Kelley and Fowle compare their source, Sai Thein Win, to Mordechai Vanunu, the technician who blew the whistle on Israel's nuclear weapons reactor at Dimona. Referring to hundreds of photographs they say he has smuggled out of Burma, they say: \"Photographs could be faked but there are so many and they are so consistent with other information and within themselves that they lead to a high degree of confidence that Burma is pursuing nuclear technology\". Despite their view that Burmese scientists are far from acquiring the technology or building anything dangerous, they say their analysis \"leads to only one conclusion; this technology is only for nuclear weapons and not civilian use or nuclear power\". They say the country's nuclear programme is headed by Dr Ko Ko Oo who has openly expressed his interests in \"nuclear matters\". They add that Sai Thein Win provided photographs of machinery that could be used for making uranium compounds, including uranium hexafluoride gas used in uranium enrichment. He is also said to have described \"nozzles used in advanced lasers that separate uranium isotopes into materials used for bombs\". Sai Thein Win's whereabouts have not been revealed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/marketforceslive/2010/jan/18/internationalpower-france1","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-01-18T15:41:32Z","webTitle":"International Power down after talks with GDF Suez end","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/jan/18/internationalpower-france1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/marketforceslive/2010/jan/18/internationalpower-france1","fields":{"headline":"International Power down after talks with GDF Suez end","bodyText":"Shares in International Power are now down after the company said its talks with France's state controlled power giant GDF Suez are over and that no agreement has been reached.

Berwin Leighton Paisner would like to make clear that they were not instructed by the government and that the note was written for a conference organised by Cityforum Government lawyers have warned ministers that legal challenges could delay its plan for the construction of nuclear power stations and exacerbate potential energy shortages. The fears are outlined in an internal advice note drawn up by City law firm Berwin Leighton Paisner for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR), looking at consultation on construction plans and how wider policy changes may affect the programme. \"The government aims to get national policy to parliament as quickly as possible, but it will face further legal challenges which are capable of knocking back the programme by a year or more, if it continues to give the impression that the [outcome of the nuclear consultation] process is a foregone conclusion,\" it argues. The lawyers highlight at least nine potential problems after the successful Greenpeace challenge to \"flawed\" market research conducted for the BERR. The Market Research Standards Board agreed with Greenpeace that consultation for the 2008 energy white paper had not been conducted in an even-handed way. Ian Trehearne and Tim Pugh, from the planning and environment practice of Berwin Leighton Paisner, say the first risk of legal challenge will come with the \"justification process\" of the planning bill, which is scheduled to pass into law before the end of the year. This could be followed by trouble early next year from the introduction of the strategic environment assessment (SEA) and strategic site assessment (SSA) of new power stations. There could be court action \"if the SEA and SSA processes become separated and inconsistent with European law as embodied in national law\", the advice note says. Care must be taken over the nomination of relevant sites for the construction of nuclear stations, the lawyers argue. \"There seems no doubt that if the system is to be capable of working properly without causing major disturbances and political dissatisfaction, the formulation of national policy in national policy statements will have to be precise about locations and sites. If not, the process risks being bedevilled by arguments about the potential of better sites. \"The consultations being undertaken by BERR in relation to nuclear sites at present seek to reduce the risk in this connection. The way has been prepared carefully, but it remains to be seen whether the new system will be able to deliver in a sensitive and transparent way which is satisfactory without delay from the courts or electoral upset.\" The potential legal pitfalls facing ministers are highlighted as the government tries to encourage the private sector to invest in a new generation of nuclear stations as the country's ageing fleet of reactors gradually comes off line. A new generation of nuclear plants is seen as crucial in meeting a future energy gap as well as providing low-carbon electricity to alleviate climate change. EDF, the French power group, has already promised to forge ahead with new stations, the first of which it hopes to have operating by 2017. Many experts question whether that schedule is realistic, and there is a risk of shortages as old power stations are decommissioned. The government is confident it can avoid any energy crunch but the note from Berwin Leighton Paisner makes clear this is far from guaranteed. Ann Harrison, a partner with commercial law firm Beachcroft and chair of a national planning group at the Environmental Law Association, said the advice note showed that ministers were likely to face legal obstacles every step of the way. \"They are going to have to be spot on in everything they do to minimise the risk of challenge,\" she said. The government's attempt to fast-track planning applications through its new bill could have the opposite effect. \"The new system is more complicated and could just invite further challenges, slowing everything up\", Harrison said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/may/31/mergers-acquisitions-vince-cable","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-30T23:05:05Z","webTitle":"Surge in bids for British firms by foreign buyers, study shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/31/mergers-acquisitions-vince-cable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/may/31/mergers-acquisitions-vince-cable","fields":{"headline":"Surge in bids for British firms by foreign buyers, study shows","bodyText":"Almost half of all UK-listed companies targeted in takeover bids in the past two years have been bought by overseas buyers, fuelling the debate over foreign ownership of British firms. According to research by the City law firm Wedlake Bell, 44% of mergers and acquisitions deals targeting UK-listed companies since the beginning of 2008 have been backed by overseas bidders. In the first quarter of this year the proportion of foreign bidders rose to 53% – almost double the 27% recorded in the first quarter of 2008 as foreign companies took advantage of the favourable bid conditions in the UK. The research comes as foreign ownership of British companies moves up the political agenda in the wake of the takeover of Cadbury by Kraft this year and the planned takeover of the transport company Arriva by Deutsche Bahn. Other high-profile deals in recent years, such as Tata's takeover of Corus – once British Steel – and the sale of the nuclear power producer British Energy to EDF of France, have led to crucial parts of the UK's industrial base passing into foreign ownership. Vince Cable, the business secretary, has pledged to rewrite the rules for takeovers to give the government the right to veto deals that are not in the national interest. He campaigned for changes when he was Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman and was fiercely critical of the Cadbury deal. Tim Bird, partner and head of the corporate team at Wedlake Bell, said: \"More and more foreign companies see the UK as a good place to invest. And the quickest way is to acquire companies. \"The return to growth of the UK economy is boosting the confidence of overseas investors, who clearly view the long-term prospects of the UK economy to be very good.\" The Wedlake Bell research suggests that the interest shown by overseas bidders in UK-listed companies can also be attributed to the stability in Britain of the corporate governance systems crucial to the success of takeovers. Bird said: \"The legal system in place to facilitate corporate takeover activity is well established and extremely competitive. Backing that up is a regulatory system that is transparent, robust and recognises the interests of both bidder and target. \"Even where the target company's assets are actually all overseas, the fact that they are listed on the London Stock Exchange does give a strong element of reassurance to the bidder. \"The current relative weakness of sterling also means UK-listed companies appear to represent much better value to overseas investors.\" The US remains the largest source of bids for British companies, with emerging market bidders such as China and India catching up fast. US companies were responsible for 30% of all overseas bids for UK companies over the past two years. The research also reveals that in the 12 months to March this year, 11% of overseas bids were from Chinese bidders, although there had been no bids at all from China in the previous year. Over the last two years 5% of bids for UK-listed firms were from India. The Financial Reporting Council is expected at the end of this month to propose new regulations designed to improve corporate governance of UK companies following last year's Walker review."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2010/sep/06/sir-graham-mont-liggins-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-06T17:41:08Z","webTitle":"Sir Graham 'Mont' Liggins obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/06/sir-graham-mont-liggins-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2010/sep/06/sir-graham-mont-liggins-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sir Graham 'Mont' Liggins obituary","bodyText":"Graham \"Mont\" Liggins, who has died aged 84, developed a life-saving treatment for premature babies, after showing that foetal lung maturation could be speeded up by administering a steroid. This gave babies born with lungs that were not functioning properly a chance to breathe and survive. His research changed medical practice and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Mont used to tell the story of his farming neighbour, knowing he was an obstetrician, asking why lambs so often die after premature delivery when dogs worry the ewes. Mont did not know, but he realised the question mattered and he wondered if it might have something to do with the stress-response steroid cortisol. He tested his hypothesis in a series of experiments and eventually proved that, at least in sheep, foetal cortisol release triggers labour. This was important, but he had also noticed something else. The lungs of premature lambs normally sank in water because they had failed to fill with air. However, if the ewe had been given corticosteroids prior to delivery, the lungs inflated normally and floated – the steroids had stimulated production of a soapy substance, surfactant, which was vital for lung aeration. Premature human babies also lack surfactant, and can develop a frequently fatal condition known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Over the next few years Mont and Ross Howie, a paediatrician colleague, randomly allocated steroids or placebos to more than 1,000 women in premature labour. Both RDS and mortality fell dramatically in the experimental group, and that simple treatment now saves the lives of many thousands of premature babies. Mont was born in Thames, on New Zealand's North Island, the fourth son of a doctor. His nickname arose from his childhood infatuation with the cartoon character Monty the Mouse. From 1944 to 1948 he studied medicine in Dunedin, on South Island, where he later worked as a GP to save up enough money to travel to Britain for specialist training. He met his wife, Celia, later Auckland's first female obstetrician, in Newcastle upon Tyne and together they worked for a short time in Cumbria, where Mont claimed to have regularly swum in the sea off the Windscale nuclear power plant. Celia blamed radioactive waste for the lymphoma he developed many years later. In 1959, he returned to New Zealand as a consultant at the National Women's hospital, in Auckland, where he met Bill Liley, the obstetrician who later performed the world's first intrauterine transfusion for rhesus disease, who suggested preterm labour as a topic for study. After minor projects on fertility treatment, Mont developed his experimental techniques, in particular his methods for studying the physiology of lambs in utero. He later refined them after visiting the University of Davis, California, and the Nuffield Institute for Medical Research at Oxford, run by Geoffrey Dawes. A natural outdoorsman, Mont epitomised the Kiwi \"No 8 wire man\" mentality: someone who can fix anything with whatever is to hand. For the next 30 years he combined clinical practice with animal physiology performed in his laboratory, a small wooden hut in the hospital grounds, and with Dawes led the science of foetal physiology. Mont was a scrupulously honest researcher. In California he blew the whistle, at some risk to his own career prospects, when he discovered a colleague fabricating data. When his steroid discovery paper was praised for the careful trial design he always acknowledged his debt to Howie. His treatment was not accepted overnight, though. The first report, in the journal Pediatrics in 1972, is now a citation classic but, incredibly, the Lancet had rejected it on the grounds that it would be of little general interest. Perhaps an obstetrician had reviewed it – obstetricians were certainly reluctant to implement it. They argued that other, smaller, studies had shown no benefit. Mont probably suspected that they were reluctant to advocate a treatment developed in a small faraway country such as New Zealand. Clinical obstetrics was in poor health at the time – in 1979, the evidence-based medicine pioneer Archie Cochrane awarded the specialty the wooden spoon for the worst use of randomised trials in all of medicine, and it took nearly 20 years before everyone realised that Mont had been right all along. Steroids work in all premature babies, and cost a few pence. The systematic review that finally pulled together all the evidence relating to their effectiveness is now a classic in its own right, and even forms the basis of the logo of the Cochrane Collaboration, the worldwide evidence-based medicine organisation.

So far, so normal, but this is also a vision of a zero carbon Britain: where not a single gram of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming and climate change are emitted to power our future lives. There are changes, however, some invisible, many more obvious. Cars will be electric, and instead of owning them many drivers will borrow from car clubs or lease them. Airlines will no longer fly short distances, and long-haul trips will be a rare treat. Workers from more traditional heavy-energy industries like steel or cement will need to retrain to work in insulating millions of buildings or back on the land, possibly involving big social upheavals. Dinner might be a roast, but poultry or pork because lamb or beef rearing would take up too much land and emit too many greenhouse gases; while mango and bananas will be a luxury as food imports have been halved. And the very landscape of Britain will look different too: instead of green and pleasant fields with grazing Fresian cattle there will be millions more acres of vegetables and grain to eat, and trees for biofuels or buildings. The vision of Zero Carbon Britain in 2030 is set out in a report published today by the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT), and backed by organisations including four universities and the Met Office, and experts including Sir John Haughton, former co-chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In just two decades it claims the nation can eliminate greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 637m tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2007. Ninety percent of this would be achieved by eliminating the most wasteful uses of energy, increasing renewable electricity and heating, and transforming land use and farming. The remaining 10% or 67m tonnes would be \"offset\" by capturing the equivalent emissions from the atmosphere by growing willow, ash, pine, oak and other trees on land freed up by almost abolishing animal grazing. Despite setting more ambitious timetables than demanded of Britain, the pace and scale of transition is \"entirely possible\", said Viki Johnson of the New Economics Foundation and one of the report's authors. \"The solutions exist, what has been missing to date is the political will to implement them.\" It was also an \"ethical responsibility\", said Alex Randall, a CAT spokesman. \"We have had 150 years benefiting from burning fossil fuels: we have built our schools, hospitals, roads, and everything we need. By making our reductions quickly we allow some scope for less developed countries to use what's left, rather than hogging this for our continuing development.\" The blueprint is divided into three key areas: mass insulation of homes and offices, smaller easier-to heat rooms, electric or biofuel vehicles, much less flying and driving and more public transport should cut energy from buildings and transport by 57%; generating a lot more renewable electricity using a range of clean sources, especially off-shore wind, but no nuclear power, should cut another huge tranche and generate millions of new jobs; and a \"revolution\" in diets would cut out a huge source of methane from livestock and free up land to grow biofuels and crops which \"sequester\" the remaining emissions from industry, soil degradation and other harder to eliminate sources. But, as an example of how much change is needed to achieve this goal, the first electric car buyers' guide, released today by the Environmental Transport Association, has just three cars with more than two seats, with the cheapest being the £20,000 C1 ev'ie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/dec/27/2010-environment-year-review","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-12-27T08:00:01Z","webTitle":"2010: The environment year in review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/dec/27/2010-environment-year-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/dec/27/2010-environment-year-review","fields":{"headline":"2010: The environment year in review","bodyText":"Britain A new coalition Tory/Lib-Dem government promised to be the greenest ever. But it proceeded to cut the budget of the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by 30%, prepared to sell off 635,000 acres of English woodland and forest, pressed ahead with new nuclear power and abandoned \"Warm front\" grants for the fuel-poor to insulate their homes. However, the British wind power revolution stayed on track with proposals for energy pricing, the new government fulfilled its pledge to halt a third runway at Heathrow, and made it possible for individuals to be paid to generate their own electricity with \"feed-in tariffs\". Deepwater Horizon The $40bn BP oil platform disaster was the largest accidental marine oil spill in history. Eleven people died and 17 were injured when the rig exploded on 20 April, and for the next three months a ruptured sea floor \"gusher\" spilt an estimated 4.9m barrels of oil, or around 200m US gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico. The jury is still out on the ecological damage done to the already polluted, and over-fished sea, but estimates range from long-term catastrophe to relatively minor harm. Climate talks 2010 saw the UN talks get back on track at Cancún. After the diplomatic debacle in Copenhagen in December 2009, when trust between countries broke down, it took three UN meetings in Bonn before nations finally started negotiating properly again. In the end, the Cancún talks failed to address key issues like the level of rich nations' emission cuts and made no extra money available for poor countries to adapt their economies. Biodiversity 2010 was UN's year of biodiversity and it culminated in 193 countries and 18,000 people meeting in Nagoya, Japan for a summit to address the alarming losses seen in forests, plant and animal species. Countries pledged to protect ecosystems, halve the rate of loss of natural habitats, protect marine, coral and coastal areas and restore at least 15% of degraded areas. Whether they have the political will to act and force though new laws is an open question. Meanwhile satellite imagery showed countries like China planting hundreds of millions of trees in 2010 but natural forests continuing to decline worldwide. Other research showed both the US and Canada with higher percentages of forest loss than Brazil, which in 2010 dropped its clearance rate almost 75%. The stolen climate emails What began in 2009 with the theft and the subsequent leaking online of hundreds of private emails and documents exchanged between many of the world's leading climate scientists, led to claims that they showed scientists manipulating and suppressing data to back up a theory of man-made climate change. This in turn threw serious doubts on the findings of the UN's Nobel prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its director, Rajendra Pachauri. But four separate inquiries completed in 2010 cleared professor Phil Jones, head of the University of East Anglia's climatic research unit, and his colleagues of the most serious charges. Instead, questions were levelled at the way in which they responded to requests for information. Pachauri survived attacks from right-wing newspapers in Britain but proposed major reform of the IPCC. Fish It was mostly a good year for oceans. The Obama administration reinstated a ban on offshore drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast, Chile saved a marine reserve known for its rare Humboldt penguins, blue whales and sea lions from the construction of a coal-fired power plant and the US banned bottom trawling in a 23,000 square mile area off the Southeast Atlantic coast. Sea protection group Oceana also reported that Belize became the third country in the world to ban all forms of trawling, Morocco and Turkey ended the use of illegal drift-nets and Chile announced the formation of the world's fourth-largest no-take marine reserve. Britain also announced a massive new marine park around the Chagos islands in the Indian ocean but outraged Mauritius when it became clear it that this was to prevent exiled islanders ever returning to their homeland. The bad news was that the EU failed again to stop exploitation of over-fished fishing stocks, reducing the allowable catch by only 5% in 2011. Temperatures 2010 was, provisionally, the hottest year recorded worldwide but it also saw some of the coldest temperatures and heaviest snow ever witnessed in Britain. Seventeen countries broke heat records, with an unprecedented heatwave and forest fires gripping much of Russia and the Middle east for weeks. An Asian record temperature of 53.7C (129F) in Pakistan and the third greatest loss of Arctic sea ice were also recorded. Strangely, while overall sea and land temperatures climbed to their highest levels in places where people mostly did not live, the more heavily populated temperate zones, including much of Britain, Europe and the US, experienced below average temperatures. The year ended with CO2 levels at their highest level ever recorded. Individuals of the year Rajendra Pachauri: the head of the IPCC admitted \"shortfalls and mistakes\" in the 2007 overview of climate science and was victimised, libelled and personally stung by right wing critics in the US and the UK. But he retained the backing of countries, won fulsome apologies in British papers and pledged to reform the sorely under-resourced body. Caroline Lucas: the first British Green MP convincingly won Brighton Pavilion constituency in the May general election and has quickly become a recognisable national figurehead. Pablo Solon: The UN ambassador became the face of Bolivia, the only country to stand against the low ambition shown by other countries in the Cancún climate summit. Bolivia also hosted the World people's climate summit where 45,000 people from 120 countries met in April to assert the \"rights of Mother Nature.\" Nnimmo Bassey: The Nigerian chair of Friends of the Earth International was awarded an alternative Nobel prize for his work which included taking Shell to court in Holland for its massive oil pollution in the Niger delta. Bryony Worthington: Blessings never ceased to rain on the director of carbon offset pressure group Sandbag. Having had a baby, she was then ennobled on the recommendation of the former energy secretary and now Labour leader Ed Miliband. But the Baroness will have to earn her spurs in the House of Lords. Simon Burkett: the former banker who left the City to set up the Campaign for Clean Air in London has almost single-handedly brought the UK government to its knees, begging for more time from Europe to lower pollution levels in London and forcing mayor Boris Johnson to act. Upwards in 2011 Population: The largely forgotten issue will get a mighty leg-up in 2011 when the global total hits 7 billion – less than 13 years after reaching 6 billion. GM crops: Africa is now the new testbed for GM crops as the biggest chemical companies press for entry into the poorest countries and argue that the technology will counter climate change. Climate: After Copenhagen, Climategate, and the US mid-term elections which scotched any US climate legislation for years, the heat came off politicians to act. This will change as the Durban UN conference approaches and countries are forced to submit more ambitious pledges. However, several court cases went against campaigners and could \"chill\" direct action. Geo-engineering: Like it or not, politicians and scientists are having to discuss the options open to remove emissions of politicians fail to persuade business and people to act. Downwards in 2011 Biodiversity: British conservation is in crisis with heavy government cuts. Meanwhile, countries are happy to sign up to targets but still loath to act to stop development and incremental losses of nature. Aviation. The decision to stop a third Heathrow runway was the high point of activists' attempts to curb the growth of aviation. From now on the agenda will move to less high profile regional airports."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jul/27/huhne-wind-nuclear-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-07-27T17:14:00Z","webTitle":"UK businesses face steep rise in energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jul/27/huhne-wind-nuclear-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jul/27/huhne-wind-nuclear-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK businesses face steep rise in energy bills","bodyText":"Businesses can expect to face a steep rise in energy bills after the government today published a comprehensive plan to cut greenhouse gases and end Britain's dependence on risky oil and gas imports. Although the individual policies had previously been announced in the coalition policy agreement or by ministers – and many were formerly Labour government initiatives – Chris Huhne, the energy and climate secretary, said the first annual energy statement provided more detail and a timetable for each move from consultation to legislation. Alongside the energy statement, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition published what it said was the first yearly estimate of the impact of its policies on customer bills. The estimate shows that compared to prices with no government action, combined annual gas and electricity costs for households would rise only £13 by 2020, but those for businesses would increase by hundreds of pounds a year. This is because businesses would benefit less from energy-efficiency measures available to households. A third document showing different policy options for meeting the pledge requirement to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050 was also published. It shows six \"pathways\" with different mixes of renewable energy such as wind and solar power, nuclear generation, and carbon capture and storage for gas and coal plants. Despite Huhne telling parliament he was confident new nuclear reactors would be built, one option shows that the targets could be met even without any new nuclear power plants to replace the current reactors when they go out of service by 2035. As a result of the policies, \"the lights are not going to go out on my watch\", said Huhne. The publication was welcomed by many groups and businesses involved in supplying and financing low-carbon power. Paul Golby, chief executive of power giant E.ON UK, said: \"These changes are essential to ensure we can all play our part in making sure the challenge of the trilemma is met – a low-carbon future with secure and affordable energy.\" However there were widespread concerns about continuing lack of detail and that progress would be hampered by a raft of new consultations and reviews of individual initiatives, including the promise to install \"smart meters\" in every home and testing new carbon capture and storage technologies. Ed Miliband, the shadow energy and climate secretary who formerly held Huhne's job, accused his successor of going \"backwards not forwards\" on several policies, including delays caused by further consultation on incentives for renewable heat, cutting promised funds for the green investment bank, abandoning some renewable energy targets, and comments by Huhne's Conservative energy minister, Lord Marland, that \"there should be no dramatic increase\" in onshore wind turbines. Huhne's Department of Energy and Climate Change also announced two weeks ago that it was cutting spending by £85m including £34m of support for low-carbon technology. Funding for many policies announced today will also depend on the outcome of a tough autumn spending review. \"Any fair-minded person looking at this statement will conclude that it is a huge disappointment – a huge disappointment to industry, to the country as well,\" added Miliband. Huhne said public spending had to be slashed because the Labour government departed – in the words of outgoing Treasury secretary Liam Byrne – with \"no money left\". \"I don't think he [Miliband] does the cause of progressive politics or green politics any good if he believes there's a bottomless pit [of money],\" added Huhne. Responding to big projected increases in energy bills, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said that, while business accepted there would be increased costs, it was concerned that mooted government ambitions for a higher target for renewable energy would push prices even higher, and urged ministers to help high energy users who were competing in international markets, such as steel companies. Other businesses could pass on the higher bills to customers, said Matthew Farrow, the CBI's head of energy. The projections assumed fossil fuel prices remain level at approximately US$80 (£51.46) a barrel of oil. Business bills would rise by less - and domestic bills be cut - if oil prices rose by the much higher estimates of the International Energy Agency or the US government, because of energy efficiency policies, said Huhne. \"The new study shows that a high-tech low-carbon future is within our grasp but it won't be achieved without massive public and private investment and a detailed plan,\" said Greenpeace executive director, John Sauven. \"Right now it's not clear that ministers are committed to unlocking that investment, and without it any plan is worthless.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2009/jan/22/yesterday-in-parliament","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2009-01-22T11:09:08Z","webTitle":"Yesterday in parliament","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/jan/22/yesterday-in-parliament","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2009/jan/22/yesterday-in-parliament","fields":{"headline":"Yesterday in parliament","bodyText":"January 21 session Police Daniel Kawczynski (Con, Shrewsbury and Atcham) said that police officers entered his Commons office without a search warrant demanding to see constituency correspondence.

He told Kawczynski: \"If it is as you say it is, then it is obviously extremely serious.\" In reply to Sir Patrick Cormack (Con, Staffordshire South), Lord said he would refer the matter immediately to the Speaker, Michael Martin. Unemployment David Cameron seized on the unemployment rise as evidence that the government's efforts to tackle the financial crisis were failing. The Tory leader told Gordon Brown that the British economy faced \"dark days\" and there was \"no real confidence that government policies are working\". The prime minister insisted that every job lost was a \"matter of regret and sadness for us all\". He promised to do everything in the government's power to help people back into work. Cameron said that the value of bank shares bought by the taxpayer in last year's bail-out had plunged by more than £20bn. But Brown accused the Conservative leader of being \"out of step with the rest of the world and out of your depth\". Obama Cameron joined the prime minister in sending good wishes to the new US president, Barack Obama. To cheers, Brown said: \"The whole house and the British people will wish to join the government in sending their best wishes to President Obama at the start of his presidency. I can assure the whole house we will maintain and strengthen our special relationship between our two countries.\" The Tory leader said: \"I agree that the whole house will be united in sending our best wishes to President Obama, who starts work with the goodwill of people right across the world.\" MPs' expenses The prime minister signalled that the government would not press ahead with proposals to exempt MPs from key parts of the Freedom of Information Act. He promised a free vote on changes to the expenses system. But he said that the FoI changes needed cross-party support and he would continue to consult on the issue. Israel Finding a lasting peace settlement between Palestinians and Israelis is the best hope of neutralising Iran's influence in the region, Brown said. He acknowledged that a deal seemed a \"distant prospect\" after the recent Israeli offensive in Gaza, but the international community had a \"duty\" to push the process forward. Brown urged Israel to complete its withdrawal of troops from Gaza as soon as possible. Council tax There can be \"no excuse\" for excessive council tax hikes, the local government minister, John Healey, said as he confirmed a 4.2% increase in town hall funding. He insisted that there were no \"exceptional circumstances\" to prevent sticking to a three-year funding deal and warned councils that tax increases for 2009-10 should be \"substantially\" below 5%. Healey threatened to cap those imposing higher levels. Sellafield Ministers will be asked to explain why MPs were not given the chance to object to terms and conditions granted to the new company running Sellafield nuclear site. Nuclear Management Partners was granted a £22bn contract but insisted on being fully indemnified against costs of cleaning up future accidents. Paul Flynn (Lab, Newport West) said that documents obtained under the FoI Act showed ministers deliberately used the summer recess to push through the indemnity. Martin said that he expected ministers to provide \"accurate information\" to the house. He added: \"You also raised the matter of how the contingent liability in relation to Sellafield was handled. I will ensure that you receive a response on that issue as soon as possible.\" Omagh The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, raised the work of Sir Peter Gibson, the intelligence services commissioner, whose report investigated allegations that vital intelligence about the Omagh bomb was held back. Gibson said that any information on the bombers taken from telephone intercepts monitored by the government's listening station, GCHQ, was passed to police but could not have prevented the atrocity. Woodward said: \"I commend Sir Peter Gibson for the thorough and exhaustive way he has approached the task in looking at lessons to be learnt in the sharing of intercept material on the day and around the time of the Omagh bombing.\" Bloody Sunday The Northern Ireland secretary said that the Bloody Sunday inquiry's Northern Ireland office would be closed to save costs. He told MPs: \"I am concerned about the costs and, as a result of that, I have arranged for the office in Northern Ireland to be closed, the size and costs of the accommodation to be significantly reduced in London, for the IT contracts to be renegotiated, and, as a result of this, we will make savings of around 20% of what would have been spent in the remaining months.\" Decommissioning Woodward said he was likely to be able to announce soon further progress on decommissioning in Northern Ireland. \"I hope to report to the house in the near future on that progress.\" He was responding after criticism over plans to extend by a year the deadline for loyalist paramilitaries to decommission weapons. Savers Savers are the \"innocent victims\" of the recession, Philip Hammond, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said as he urged the government to help boost their investment income. He said that savers had lost £22bn of annual interest income due to recent rate cuts and called on ministers to abolish the starting rate and basic rate of tax on savings to help raise returns. Stephen Timms, the financial secretary to the Treasury, said that Tory proposals left a \"large hole of several billion pounds\" in public finances and would require \"savage, swingeing cuts\" in spending. NHS The government is pushing ahead with plans for NHS Urgent Care Centres despite warnings that they are clinically unproven, Andrew Lansley protested. The shadow health secretary said that they were no substitute for a properly funded emergency care system and added that ministers' claims that improvements to primary care would cut the number of patients going to A&amp;E had been proved \"false and dangerous\". Alan Johnson, the health secretary, said that all changes to emergency care were designed to improve care for patients. The reorganisation was governed by rules set out by junior minister Lord Darzi of Denham in his NHS review – one of which was that it must be \"clinically driven\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/blog/2010/apr/22/green-question-tv-leader-debate","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-22T11:21:07Z","webTitle":"Which green question would you ask in the second leaders' debate? | Leo Hickman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/apr/22/green-question-tv-leader-debate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/blog/2010/apr/22/green-question-tv-leader-debate","fields":{"headline":"Which green question would you ask in the second leaders' debate?","bodyText":"Tonight the leaders of the three main political parties in the UK will conduct the second of their three live TV debates ahead of the general election on 6 May. According to the agreed schedule, the issues up for discussion will be \"international relations, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Middle East, UK defence, international terrorism, Europe, United States, climate change, China, international development\". The occasion is the one and only time that Gordon Brown, Nick Clegg and David Cameron will face a question from an audience member explicitly about the environment and, judging by the schedule, it will focus tightly on climate change. With audiences likely to be up near the 10 million mark, as was the case with last week's debate, and days of post-match analysis to follow, there's a lot riding on this one question. The exact wording of the question is, therefore, crucial. Do you ask a very specific question in the hope of getting a precise, wiggle-free answer? Or do you ask a much more open question in the hope that it attracts a wide-ranging, yet revealing answer that helps to clearly differentiate the leaders' attitudes to environmental issues? Friends of the Earth has been asking its supporters to send in their own suggestion for a question themed around broader environmental issues. Here are three that it suggested could be sent in for consideration by the TV debate organisers – on this occasion Sky News - if you were \"suffering from writer's block\": 1. What will you to do help secure an international agreement on climate change that commits rich developed countries to their fair share of emissions cuts, and which provides adequate public finance for developing countries to deal with climate change? 2. As factory farming relies heavily on imported feeds, which often leads to rainforests being cleared, how would you help UK farmers to produce food with less damage to our planet and the climate? 3. We all know Britain's economy needs rebuilding after the recent economic downturn. It also needs rebuilding as a low-carbon economy to avoid climate change. How will you ensure we do both at the same time? But what question would you ask the leaders if you were in the audience? When the parties' environmental spokesmen met last night at the Guardian debate, the arguments focused on aviation, nuclear power, windfarms, and the presence and influence of climate sceptics within their ranks. But what would the theme and exact wording of your question be? Perhaps you would want them to talk explicitly about the merits – or otherwise – of carbon trading or binding climate change legislation? Or, if you're a climate change sceptic, perhaps you might want to frame the question somewhat differently?

Switching all the UK's petrol and diesel road transport vehicles to electric models will require 16% extra electricity capacity, equivalent to 10GW or around six new nuclear power stations, they said. The 30m vehicles on British roads are responsible for a quarter of the UK's carbon emissions. In a report for the Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng) published today, experts identified several hurdles in cleaning up the environmental footprint of the UK's road transport. These included the development of better batteries, creation of a smarter electricity grid that is more flexible at managing demand for power, and the mass-rollout of recharging points. They also said that electrification of vehicles would not be enough on its own to cut CO2 emissions. \"Swapping gas guzzlers for electric vehicles will not solve our carbon emissions problem on its own,\" said Roger Kemp of Lancaster University, who chaired the RAEng's electric vehicles working group. \"When most electricity in Britain is still generated by burning gas and coal, the difference between an electric car and a small, low-emission petrol or diesel car is negligible.\" He welcomed car-makers developing electric models such as the Nissan Leaf and government backing for more charging sockets, but said popularising electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids with individuals \"is only one aspect of what is needed to reduce transport emissions.\" However, the report maintained that, if the government wants to meet its ambitious targets to cut the UK's carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, cleaning up transport will be crucial. The report called for \"robust leadership\" from the government in the big programme of change required, something that has been lacking with recent initiatives. \"For example, recent discussions on introducing smart meters to every household did not include the functionality required to manage electric vehicle charging, which could render the first generation of smart meters obsolete as the electric vehicle market grows,\" said Kemp. The RAEng called for greater clarity from the new coalition government about its own plans to incentivise the mass introduction of electric vehicles, which account for little more than a thousand cars on UK roads. The last government's plan to grant motorists up to £5,000 off the price of a new electric car is now being reviewed and may not survive spending cuts. There is also uncertainty over whether funds will go ahead for nationwide demonstration projects for several hundred cars and money for basic research into battery technology. The engineers said that, as a short-term measure, a likely alternative to fully electric cars might be a widespread adoption of plug-in hybrids, where a small internal combustion engine supplements a battery with a 50-100 mile range. This would allow full-electric cars to gain market penetration as second cars for city driving. In addition, the way people own cars might change, with more car clubs and shared vehicles. \"We face an uphill task,\" said Kemp. \"Cars are iconic and aspirational in a way that most other energy-consuming goods are not and are central to much of our contemporary culture. In Britain, you would not get 6.4 million people tuning in to TV programmes called Top Domestic Appliances or Top Condensing Boilers in the way they do for Top Gear.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2010/jun/12/sparks-ally-kennen-children-fiction","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-11T23:05:34Z","webTitle":"Sparks by Ally Kennen | Book review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/12/sparks-ally-kennen-children-fiction","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2010/jun/12/sparks-ally-kennen-children-fiction","fields":{"headline":"Sparks by Ally Kennen","bodyText":"With her latest book, Sparks, longlisted for the Guardian children's fiction prize, Ally Kennen has abandoned a key element of her award-winning formula. Unlike previous titles Beast, Berserk and Bedlam, this offering doesn't begin with the letter B. It does, however, still contain all the ingredients of a mighty fun read. Sparks also has a subtitle, one which neatly sums up the premise of the entire book: \"How to give Grandpa a Viking funeral\". Grandpa loved boats. In a letter to Carla, one of his grandchildren, read after his death, he reveals that he would have loved to have had a Viking-style funeral, with his remains \"sent out to sea on a burning boat at sunset, to sail off into eternity\". But he knows this is illegal, so he asks Carla to burn some important letters in that manner instead. (These letters were obviously ancient love letters between Grandpa and a woman who wasn't Grandma.) But Carla can't get the image of the burning longboat out of her mind. It soon becomes apparent to the reader that Grandma was not universally loved by the family when living; and Carla really doesn't like the idea of Grandpa having to lie next to Grandma in the churchyard for eternity. What, then, if she really was to carry out his wish? What if she could somehow get Grandpa's body out of the undertaker's, on to his boat and out to sea, in a blaze of flame? But who can Carla trust to help her, aside from her sister Penny and brother Woody? She settles for the Sparks, members of the Little Wichley Carnival Club. These children have a float in the upcoming Bigwich Carnival, which falls on the same day as Grandpa's funeral. She persuades them to change the theme of their float from Bananas in Pyjamas to Go Valhalla! Now they have a way of getting their Viking burial boat through town. Today in the UK, over 70% of dead people are cremated. Back in February, a Hindu man won the right in a British court to be burned on a traditional outdoor funeral pyre after his death. But a Viking funeral? As an adult reader, you just know that there's no way Grandpa's body is really going to end up being burned at sea, especially not in a family-based children's novel of this nature. This isn't a zany anything-could-happen romp, but is rooted in reality. Part of the fun is wondering just how close to succeeding the children will get and how they will eventually be thwarted. Getting a coffin out of the local morgue isn't child's play. A child reader, however, may well assume that anything could happen. The nearer I got to the end, the more I found myself thinking that there weren't enough pages for the burning not to take place. Surely it couldn't . . . No! But . . . There are some wonderfully comic and exciting moments in Sparks, including one where a dummy run goes disastrously wrong, leading to a serious security incident involving the local nuclear power station. Sparks is funny, entertaining and surprisingly moving and it is this – the relationship between members of the family, including that between Carla and the memory of her dead grandfather – that lifts the book above the ordinary. The fact that Mum has lost her father is not neglected. The fear of how she will react if Carla and the others are successful is one of the many dilemmas explored. In the end, though, what is left is love.

David Kennedy, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, said action was needed in four key areas. He said policies should be brought forward to reform the electricity market, and to make homes more energy efficient. Ministers need to protect efforts to encourage the development of electric cars and introduce measures to bring down the carbon footprint of UK farmers, he added. \"We've had a light-touch approach in the UK, we've talked a good game but what we've seen is emissions haven't fallen,\" Kennedy said. \"We need to do something different. What we have to do isn't news and is becoming very well known.\" Lord Turner, chair of the committee, said the recession has created the illusion that the UK is tackling climate change, but substantial declines in emissions are almost entirely the result of lower economic activity in the last year. While greenhouse gases fell by 8.6% last year, only a fraction of that was the result of measures to tackle climate change such as renewable energy or making homes more energy efficient. The second annual progress report from the government's advisory committee repeated the call it made last year step up efforts to drive down emissions, in order to meet targets to cut greenhouse gases. Kennedy said some loft and cavity wall insulation was put in last year, while there was a \"little bit\" of investment in renewables, but efforts needed to be ramped up over the next five to 10 years. He said continuing to implement green measures at the pace seen in 2009 would mean \"we won't deliver the carbon budgets\". He said the coalition agreement contained positive pledges to make homes greener, to introduce a floor in the price companies pay for emitting polluting carbon, and emissions performance standards for power stations to drive investment in clean energy. \"These commitments are at the moment good intentions. What we need is to translate these into crunchy policies in power, buildings, transport and agriculture,\" he said. \"The test of this government will be the policies they put in place over the next year or two. If we're going to see this step-change actually happen in two to three years, when it needs to happen, we've got to have the policies in place in the next year or so.\" Peter Young, the chairman of the Aldersgate Group, said: \"We welcome the committee's headline message that greater urgency is needed to meet carbon budgets. A number of the priorities identified by the committee are also commitments in the coalition agreement, such as electricity market reform and the implementation of a carbon floor price. Prompt action will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but will be vital for the economic recovery, boosting growth, jobs and competitiveness.\" Andy Atkins, the head of Friends of the Earth, said: \"It's extremely disturbing that, despite a similar warning from the committee last year, the recent fall in UK emissions is mainly due to the recession. This report is further evidence of the need to build our future prosperity on safe, green foundations.\" Yesterday, the government abolished the Infrastructure Planning Commission, a quango with the power to approve major infrastructure projects set up last year by the previous Labour administration to fast track large projects, such as nuclear power stations and offshore wind farms. Decentralisation minister Greg Clark said: \"New infrastructure is critical to the country's return to economic growth and we believe we must have a fast track system for major projects – but it must be accountable. The previous system lacked any democratic legitimacy by giving decision making power away to a distant quango.\" Replacing the IPC will be the Major Infrastructure Planning Unit, in which ministers will make the decisions on projects. Gaynor Hartnell, the chief executive of the Renewable Energy Association welcomed the move but added: \"The vast majority of renewable energy projects are smaller than 50MW and therefore will not benefit directly from these reforms. We need rapid and consistent decision making for projects approved by local authorities that strikes the balance between local accountability and strategic national priorities.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2010/jun/08/ayrshire-power-coal-stations-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-08T16:43:25Z","webTitle":"'Sloppy' errors in coal-power station plans, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jun/08/ayrshire-power-coal-stations-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2010/jun/08/ayrshire-power-coal-stations-plans","fields":{"headline":"'Sloppy' errors in coal-power station plans, say campaigners","bodyText":"The power firm hoping to build the UK's first new coal-fired power station equipped with carbon capture technology has been accused of making a series of \"sloppy\" and \"serious errors\" in its planning application. Environmentalists claim the mistakes in Ayrshire Power's proposal to build a £3bn 1,800MW coal-fired plant close to Hunterston nuclear power station raise significant questions about the credibility of its plans. Ayrshire Power, solely owned by the Manchester-based property and airports firm Peel Holdings, claims that 25% of the new plant's CO2 emissions will be caught by its carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment when it begins operations. The first power station application to be made in Britain under tight new UK and Scottish government climate change regulations, it aims to have nearly all of its CO2 emissions (90%) captured by CCS within five years of the technology being proven. However, Dr Richard Dixon, the director of WWF Scotland, said his analysis of the planning application suggested that Hunterston would only initially capture up to 22% of its carbon emissions. The documents were surprisingly \"sloppy\", he said, and suggested that Ayrshire Power's application was now less credible after Dong, the Danish energy giant, withdrew from the Hunterston consortium last year, citing the drop in demand for power due to the recession. While it owns windfarms and 24% of mining company UK Coal, Peel Holdings had never built a power station and is continuing to use the designs for Hunterston developed by Dong. \"Its technical credibility has gone right out of the window,\" Dixon said. The firm's project description states it will capture 327MW equivalent of CO2 when it first starts operation, while the electricity sent to the grid would total 1,625MW - 20.1%. There were other errors in the planning application, Dixon said. It mistook kilograms for grams in its \"CO2 emissions study\". In one passage, it gave the carbon intensity of overall UK electricity supplies as 560kg per kilowatt hour rather than 560g/kwh. It also gave confusing and apparently contradictory figures on the number of bulk container ships bringing in coal and biomass fuel from abroad. It said there were either 40 ships or 40 shipping movements involving biomass fuel. Dixon said a shipping movement was a one-way trip either in or out of port, so 40 shipping movements would involve just 20 ships. On coal deliveries, it talked about 40 ships docking each year in one part of the document, leading to 80 shipping movements, and 40 shipping movements in another. Dixon said: \"It rather suggests that this company isn't credible and shouldn't be allowed to build a £3bn power station.\" Duncan McLaren, the chief executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said it was very surprising the errors identified in the application had not been picked up by Scottish government officials in the \"gatekeeping\" document verification stage before Ayrshire Power filed its planning application. \"It's surely indicative that this is a small organisation relying on other people for the data and figures,\" he said. \"If this application shows such gross errors, then the Scottish government should've just said 'go away'.\" Ayrshire Power refused to respond directly to these criticisms, but said in a statement it was \"100% committed to the use of carbon capture and storage technology.\" The statement added: \"From day one the power station will have a fully operational demonstration carbon capture and storage unit in place which will result in at least 25% fewer carbon dioxide emissions. Once fully fitted with CCS technology the power station will be capable of capturing 90% of the carbon dioxide it produces. This will put Scotland at the forefront of carbon reduction and deliver safe, secure energy supplies for generations to come.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/apr/25/labour-liberal-democrats-green-manifesto","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2010-04-25T18:55:31Z","webTitle":"Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg  vie for green vote with eco manifestos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/apr/25/labour-liberal-democrats-green-manifesto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/apr/25/labour-liberal-democrats-green-manifesto","fields":{"headline":"Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg  vie for green vote with eco manifestos","bodyText":"Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg have gone on the attack today in an effort to win the environmental vote for what campaigners say will be the last parliament that can save the world from dangerous levels of climate change. Both launched green manifestos, with Labour's saying the Liberal Democrat ban on new nuclear power would \"endanger our energy security and climate change goals\", while the Lib Dems condemned \"a party that has had 13 years to deliver on the environment and failed\". The Lib Dems' key pledge was to set a target for a zero-carbon Britain. \"We will set – and stick to – ambitious targets for a zero-carbon future,\" said Clegg. In the first year of a new government, the Lib Dems pledge to redirect £3.1bn from other spending programmes to stimulate the creation of 100,000 jobs in renewable energy and home insulation initiatives. Their green manifesto also focused on air travel, promising to tax planes rather than passengers – meaning that empty aircraft or those carrying freight will be taxed – and to charge short-haul flights more if a low-carbon alternative is available. It promised new rail lines paid for by cuts in the major roads budget. Clegg urged voters to \"choose the only party that was taking a stand on saving the planet well before it became fashionable\", noting his party's support for the 10:10 climate change campaign, which the Guardian supports. The Lib Dem green manifesto says the target for a zero-carbon Britain could be offset up to 10% by buying credits from overseas projects. Labour sources said the pledge was an \"empty gesture\" because MPs have already voted for an 80% cut in emissions by 2050. At the Guardian's environment hustings debate last week, Ed Miliband, the climate and energy secretary, went on the offensive against the non-nuclear pledge, describing it as a \"big hole\" in the Lib Dems' plans, and accusing the party of \"ducking\" difficult choices. At the Labour manifesto launch, Brown made a pledge to give all pensioners over 75 who get pension credits a further £100 off their energy bills on top of the winter fuel allowance. \"That is fairness in action,\" said Brown, echoing his campaign slogan. Other new pledges concentrated on industrial policy. Labour has recently had some success in attracting wind turbine and electric car manufacturers to the country. The party said it would earmark 5,000 of the promised 67,000 apprenticeships for low-carbon trades. It also pledged to create low-carbon business zones in every region, following the existing marine energy hub in the south-west and the nascent electric car hub in the north-east. Other possibilities include building on the nuclear industry already in the north-west and concentrating the development of new carbon capture and storage technology for coal power in Yorkshire and Humberside, close to the emptying North Sea oil and gas fields where the emissions might be buried. Labour also revealed a new estimate – 500,000 – for the number of electric vehicles its policies would see on the road by 2020. Simon Hughes, the Lib Dem spokesman on energy and climate change, said: \"Labour's environment manifesto is nothing more than a programme for another five years of failure. It continues with the fictitious claim that they will create 400,000 new jobs when the government's own figures say that their policies mean they can't do this, and continue their refusal to move the UK to a 42% emissions target by 2020 [from 34%].\" He added: \"This country needs a low-carbon Britain, not just low-carbon zones.\" Martyn Williams, parliament campaigner for Friends of the Earth, welcomed the extra £100 for pensioners, but said: \"The difficulty is that Labour always tries to tackle fuel poverty by throwing money at people or by bringing fuel prices down, and not by ensuring that their homes are properly insulated.\" The Conservatives made no new announcements today, and in the leaders' debate last Thursday, David Cameron was the only leader not to include climate change in his opening or closing statements. During the debate, Clegg called climate change the greatest challenge, a view echoed today by Brown. The Lib Dem manifesto derided the Conservatives for \"aligning themselves with climate change deniers in the European parliament\", while Labour claimed that \"the Tories would threaten our future energy security … through their widespread opposition [to wind farms]\". The Green party, whose leader, Caroline Lucas, appears to have a good chance of becoming the party's first MP, was identified as having the most ambitious manifesto by Friends of the Earth. But Clegg warned against voting for a party \"that cannot make a difference in Westminster\". The commitments compared Labour and the Liberal Democrats agree on many of the targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonise the UK's energy supply, most of which are already in UK or EU law. They also share the aim of making Britain's notoriously leaky homes and buildings much more energy-efficient and developing a high-speed rail network and a smart electricity grid. But sharp differences remain. Labour Headliners • Use industrial policy, which has seen wind turbine and electric car makers invest in the UK, to create 400,000 green jobs by 2015. • Use \"active government\" – ie intervention – in markets to deliver a low-carbon energy sector. • Up to £5,000 discount for electric cars and 100,000 charging points by 2015. • Reduce aviation emissions to 2005 levels by 2050. • Ban all recyclable and biodegradable waste from landfill. Controversies • Back a third runway at Heathrow, but rule out any other new runway until 2015. • Back new coal power stations without requiring that all their carbon emissions are captured and stored. Crowd pleasers • £100 extra towards energy bills for those over 75. • Prosecution for a car owner if litter is thrown from it, plus seizure of cars used for fly-tipping. • Treble the number of secure bicycle parking spaces at railway stations. • Ban wild animals in circuses and maintain the fox-hunting ban. Liberal Democrats Headliners • Set target for a zero-carbon UK, but allow 10% of emissions to be offset overseas. • Spend £3.1bn in the first year on a green jobs stimulus which will lead to 100,000 jobs. • Tax planes, not passengers, to discourage empty flights, and tax short-haul flights more if trains or coaches are available. • A road-pricing scheme, making motorists pay for their use, offset by scrapping the vehicle excise duty tax disc. • Tax financial transactions and aviation and shipping emissions to help poorer countries moderate and adapt to climate change. Controversies • Rule out a new generation of nuclear power on the grounds of expense – a \"big hole\" in electricity generation, says Labour. • Scrap the new Infrastructure Planning Commission and return decision-making to local people – risks delays to renewable energy projects. • Commit the UK to a target of 40% emissions cut by 2020, breaking step with the EU. [• This segment was amended on 26 April 2010. The original said that the Liberal Democrats planned unilaterally to commit the UK to a 30% emissions cut by 2020. This has been corrected.] Crowd pleasers • Cut rail fares and make Network Rail refund one-third of ticket cost if rail replacement bus services are used. • £400 eco cashback scheme for new double glazing, boilers or solar panels. • Double woodland by 2005 and policies to \"increase tranquillity\" in the countryside. • Prevent \"garden-grabbing\" development by designating them as greenfield sites."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/may/17/iran-brazil-turkey-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-17T10:28:50Z","webTitle":"Text of the Iran-Brazil-Turkey deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/may/17/iran-brazil-turkey-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/may/17/iran-brazil-turkey-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Text of the Iran-Brazil-Turkey deal","bodyText":"JOINT DECLARATION BY IRAN, TURKEY AND BRAZIL (17 May 2010) Having met in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, the undersigned have agreed on the following Declaration: 1. We reaffirm our commitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and in accordance with the related articles of the NPT, recall the right of all State Parties, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy (as well as nuclear fuel cycle including enrichment activities) for peaceful purposes without discrimination. 2. We express our strong conviction that we have the opportunity now to begin a forward looking process that will create a positive, constructive, non-confrontational atmosphere leading to an era of interaction and cooperation. 3. We believe that the nuclear fuel exchange is instrumental in initiating cooperation in different areas, especially with regard to peaceful nuclear cooperation including nuclear power plant and research reactors construction. 4. Based on this point the nuclear fuel exchange is a starting point to begin cooperation and a positive constructive move forward among nations. Such a move should lead to positive interaction and cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities replacing and avoiding all kinds of confrontation through refraining from measures, actions and rhetorical statements that would jeopardize Iran's rights and obligations under the NPT. 5. Based on the above, in order to facilitate the nuclear cooperation mentioned above, the Islamic Republic of Iran agrees to deposit 1200 kg LEU in Turkey. While in Turkey this LEU will continue to be the property of Iran. Iran and the IAEA may station observers to monitor the safekeeping of the LEU in Turkey. 6. Iran will notify the IAEA in writing through official channels of its agreement with the above within seven days following the date of this declaration. Upon the positive response of the Vienna Group (US, Russia, France and the IAEA) further details of the exchange will be elaborated through a written agreement and proper arrangement between Iran and the Vienna Group that specifically committed themselves to deliver 120 kg of fuel needed for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR). 7. When the Vienna Group declares its commitment to this provision, then both parties would commit themselves to the implemention of the agreement mentioned in item 6. Islamic Republic of Iran expressed its readiness to deposit its LEU (1200 kg) within one month. On the basis of the same agreement the Vienna Group should deliver 120 kg fuel required for TRR in no later than one year. 8. In case the provisions of this Declaration are not respected Turkey, upon the request of Iran, will return swiftly and unconditionally Iran's LEU to Iran. 9. We welcome the decision of the Islamic Republic of Iran to continue as in the past their talks with the 5+1 countries in Turkey on the common concerns based on collective commitments according to the common points of their proposals. 10. Turkey and Brazil appreciated Iran's commitment to the NPT and its constructive role in pursuing the realization of nuclear rights of its member states. The Islamic Republic of Iran likewise appreciated the constructive efforts of the friendly countries Turkey and Brazil in creating the conducive environment for realization of Iran's nuclear rights."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/may/13/ministers-pay-cut-frozen","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-05-13T13:08:49Z","webTitle":"Ministers' pay to be cut – and frozen for five years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/13/ministers-pay-cut-frozen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/may/13/ministers-pay-cut-frozen","fields":{"headline":"Ministers' pay to be cut – and frozen for five years","bodyText":"David Cameron today redeemed his first pre-election promise by announcing that all ministers in his Lib-Con coalition will take a five-year pay freeze, as well as a 5% pay cut. David Cameron, speaking at the first cabinet meeting of his historic new coalition, urged his colleagues to seize the opportunity – and ordered them to keep their differences private, saying a special coalition committee would be established to ensure there was good partnership between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. The No 10 press office allowed cameras and microphones into the first parts of his meeting, and issued a diagram setting out where various cabinet ministers are to sit around the table. The chancellor, George Osborne, gave a sober assessment of the state of the economy, and the business secretary, Vincent Cable, drew laughter by saying his Indian relations had told him arranged marriages were sometimes better than marriages of love. A succession of cabinet ministers, ranging from the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, to the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, tried to dampen the euphoric mood today by stressing that very difficult decisions lay ahead on cutting the deficit. Hunt spoke of the \"very difficult challenges\" ahead. \"We are all very aware of the seriousness of the situation and, frankly, if we don't have a credible programme to reduce the deficit – and at the moment Britain has one of the least credible programmes amongst the developed economies – then we won't have the confidence of the world and the confidence of the country,\" he said. \"The encouraging thing is that I think there is an understanding across all parts of government that we have got to take very, very difficult decisions.\" Lansley said the health department would have to go further than Labour's planned £20bn efficiency savings over the next three years. Emerging from the cabinet, the schools secretary, Michael Gove, said: \"There was a sense of partnership and common purpose.\" Iain Duncan-Smith, the new welfare secretary, said it was if the two parties had been working together for years. Cameron was also busy today appointing his middle-ranking ministers, trying to ensure a political balance within his own party, and ensuring high-grade Liberal Democrats were also given ministerial posts in every department. Cameron's powers of patronage are slightly reduced since he does not have power through government whips to hand out plum posts chairing parliamentary select committees. All select committee chairmen are to be elected by MPs for the first time under proposals tabled by Tony Wright, the outgoing chair of the parliamentary reform select committee and due to be implemented in full by Sir George Young, the new leader of the Commons. Cameron was also facing his first serious flak as Labour started to protest over his plan to require a Commons majority of 55% before parliament could be dissolved. Chris Huhne, the new energy secretary, conceded the coalition was internally divided on the issue of building new nuclear power stations, but said they had agreed such stations should not be built with any public subsidy. If there was then a majority in parliament in favour of building such power stations on that basis, \"then new nuclear will go ahead,\" Huhne said. \"There are a whole series of compromises which have been struck in this agreement which I think are obviously unpleasant for each of the parties,\" he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2010/sep/27/alistair-darling-deficit-labour-conference","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2010-09-27T11:55:35Z","webTitle":"Labour conference: Alistair Darling, 'we ignore the deficit at our peril'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/27/alistair-darling-deficit-labour-conference","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2010/sep/27/alistair-darling-deficit-labour-conference","fields":{"headline":"Alistair Darling: 'We ignore the deficit at our peril'","bodyText":"Alistair Darling warned the coalition government that it was taking \"a huge gamble with growth and jobs\" as he used his last big speech in frontbench politics to defend Labour's economic record. The outgoing shadow chancellor said the rightwing ideology of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government was \"putting at serious risk the recovery we worked so hard to bring about\". But following the election of Ed Miliband as Labour leader, Darling insisted the opposition would not be taken seriously by voters unless it had a credible plan to cut borrowing. \"One of the lessons that Labour has learned – and learned well – in the past 20 years is that the message to the country has to strike a chord with ordinary people as realistic and credible. We have to be realistic or it just won't wash.\" The shadow chancellor, who was in charge of the Treasury during the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, said there was a difference between Labour's plan at the election to halve the deficit over four years and the tougher austerity package outlined by the coalition. \"You and I know that we cannot ignore the deficit. That would be as foolish as standing back and doing nothing when the crisis hit,\" he said. \"Our approach is measured and balanced. What we did over the last two years has worked. That's why our economy is growing, why borrowing is coming down. To abandon that balanced approach, as the Tories and Liberals are doing, will put tens of thousands of jobs at risk, and hit the living standards of millions of families.\" Darling said the UK's record peacetime deficit was not the result of Labour's extravagance but of measures taken to mitigate the impact of the recession. \"Of course there was another choice. We could have sat back and done nothing, letting people sink or swim. If we had listened to the Tories, who now decry our record, that's exactly what would have happened.\" The shadow chancellor said that even though the global crisis caused a collapse in activity much more severe than in the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, job losses and home repossessions had been far lower. \"Our judgment was proved right. Our approach worked.\" Darling said the Conservatives believed that government was always the problem and never the solution. \"And that's what's driving their approach now. The cuts they are making are the same old rightwing ideology dressed up as necessity. Their approach is dishonest.\" Fellow shadow ministers waded in to defend Labour's track record and criticise the pace and depth of proposed spending cuts. Liam Byrne, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that Miliband's call on the party to reflect with humility and pride on its record in office and look at what to do next to return to government was \"pitch perfect\". \"Nowhere is that more true than on the economy and on no other front did Labour deliver more,\" he said. The government picked the \"lesser of two evils\" by choosing to act to achieve recovery when the forces of the global economic storm hit Britain. No one had wanted the deficit to get so big, Byrne said, but the government did not want to see unemployment, repossessions and small businesses going bust as they had in the past recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, he said. He conceded that the Labour government did not get everything right, before adding: \"But I would rather a government that made mistakes, than a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference\". Byrne called for a new politics of aspiration combined from the \"best of old and New Labour in renewed Labour\". While Labour should not oppose every Tory cut, the fact was that the government was cutting £87bn over and above what was wise, he said. \"So we have to get out there and offer a vision that's different. A plan that's real but that doesn't flinch from some tough choices.\" Pat McFadden, the shadow business secretary, told delegates: \"The Tories and Lib Dems say that if only we cut the state fast enough and hard enough, the private sector will step up to the plate. But cut too fast or in the wrong places and you run a risk with recovery and prosperity.\" He said the package of measures put in place in response to the world recession saved British people from the pain of a far greater downturn. McFadden listed some counterproductive coalition cuts, such as the £3bn worth of investment allowances for manufacturing and the decision to scrap regional development agencies, which were designed to support businesses up and down the country. And he rebutted Tory and Lib Dem claims that some of the former Labour government's schemes had been a waste of money, calling on the government to reverse the \"stupid decision\" to cancel a loan to a steelworks. The £80m loan, which would have enabled Sheffield Forgemasters to make components for nuclear power plants, was cancelled as the government tried to rein in public spending. McFadden told the Labour conference the government was behaving like the banks in refusing to financially support British industry. Defending the former Labour administration's record on providing financial assistance, he said: \"It wasn't a waste of money to work with Nissan to make sure their first electric car was built here in Britain in the north-east. It wasn't a waste of money to put a loan guarantee in place for Ford to make the next generation of low-carbon diesel engines here in the UK either. \"And it wasn't a waste of money to grant the loan to Sheffield Forgemasters to try to make this country a world leader in the civil nuclear supply chain. Last week, Vince Cable made a speech attacking the banks and arguing for corporate change. Fine. We can agree on a lot of that. But in denying this loan the government behaved just like the banks they like to attack for not supporting industry. So together we will keep up the fight to reverse this decision.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2008/jan/11/wrap.haroonsiddique","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2008-01-11T09:53:08Z","webTitle":"Green light for new nuclear power stations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2008/jan/11/wrap.haroonsiddique","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2008/jan/11/wrap.haroonsiddique","fields":{"headline":"Green light for new nuclear power stations","bodyText":"Welcome to the Wrap GOVERNMENT GIVES NUCLEAR GO-AHEAD The Mail describes the government's decision to give the green light to a new generation of nuclear power stations as a \"belated acceptance of the inevitable\" in its leader. However, the paper says Britain's energy outlook is \"bleak\" because the decision has come 10 years too late. Both the Guardian and the Times splash on what must be the least surprising announcement of the year so far. The former says that despite the business secretary, John Hutton, insisting on no subsidies for nuclear energy, \"the small print of the white paper showed concessions had been given away\". Polly Toynbee, in the Guardian, criticises the move, saying the government has not paid off the \"still rising £5.3bn bill for the gigantic failure of British Energy\". \"This is like a conned householder buying another new roof from the same cowboy who destroyed the last one,\" she writes. A Times leader says yesterday's announcement was \"very welcome\" but \"fell short of the detail\", and concerns about the economics of nuclear power are also expressed elsewhere. \"Key ingredients are still missing,\" says the FT. \"The most vital of these, a stable price for electricity generated by nuclear energy, is far from guaranteed.\" The Telegraph's environment editor, Charles Clover, opines that it is \"difficult to see what else any cabinet could have decided\". But he adds: \"It is a disgrace that, 60 years after the beginnings of civil nuclear power, not country has solved the problems of nuclear waste satisfactorily\". The Independent agrees with the Guardian, describing pledges of no subsidies as \"empty promises\" and accusing the government of lacking \"a firm grip on either energy policy or the challenge of climate change\". But it is another environmental concern that occupies the paper's front page as it reports details of the \"world's cheapest car\". The Tato Nano, aimed at India's middle class, costs only 100,000 rupees (GBP1,277). \"Green activists predict trouble ahead for countries that already have inadequate infrastructures and soaring CO2 emissions,\" the paper warns. * Labour goes nuclear but row erupts over who will foot bill * Mail: Dash to go nuclear 'will add £250 to energy bills' * Times: Generation gap * Telegraph: Charles Clover on the nuclear decision * Independent: Can the world afford the Tata Nano? 'ALMOST AKIN TO TAKING BLOOD MONEY' The papers may disagree about how much Tony Blair is to be paid as a part-time adviser for the investment banking giant JP Morgan Chase, but they are united in their distaste. \"The smile that says: I'm in the money,\" says the Guardian, accompanying its headline with a picture of that famous grin. \"Mr Blair's search for riches is no surprise,\" the paper's leader says. \"In office, he was much too impressed by money and wealthy people, and he lacks a sense now of how his desire to earn so much, so fast, offends against ideas of public service and the founding principles of his party.\" The Mail is even more indignant. It splashes on the story with the headline: \"£1M-A-YEAR PAYBACK FOR IRAQ\". Blair has taken a job with a bank \"which is profiting from the Iraq war\", the paper sneers. It quotes Reg Keys, whose son Tom was killed in Iraq in 2003, calling it \"almost akin to taking blood money\". The comment piece is no less damning. \"The United States feels that it owes Mr Blair for delivering British military support. Yesterday, a small part of that blood debt was paid - in cold, hard cash.\" The FT is worried about the former prime minister mixing business with global politics - he is still the Middle East representative for the Quartet (the US, Russia, the EU and the UN). It urges him to \"make up his mind whether he wants to remain an active political figure or to become a 'trusted adviser' to people with money\". The highest estimate of his salary is in the Telegraph, which claims he will be paid £2m a year. \"Politicians are supposed to worry about enriching the nation: it leaves a sour taste in the mouth when they turn to enriching themselves,\" it says. * The smile that says: I'm in the money * Mail: Blair accused of taking blood money * Telegraph: Tony Blair to earn £2m as JP Morgan adviser EDMUND HILLARY DIES AGED 88 The Telegraph pays tribute to Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to climb Mount Everest, on its front page. Hillary's death, at the age of 88, was announced last night. New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, describes the Auckland-born mountaineer as \"the best-known New Zealander ever to have lived\". \"He dedicated much of his later life to humanitarian work, spearheading a campaign to set up schools and health clinics in Nepal and setting up the Himalayan Trust,\" the Telegraph says. The Guardian says that, in a 2003 interview with the paper, Hillary said his charity work, and not the Everest ascent, had given him the most pride\". The paper adds that, after reaching the peak with his climbing companion, Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, he later told a fellow explorer at base camp: \"Well George, we knocked the bastard off.\" * Edmund Hillary, conqueror of Everest, dies at 88 * Telegraph: Sir Edmund Hillary dies CHAVEZ SECURES RELEASE OF COLOMBIAN HOSTAGES The freeing of two hostages held in the jungle by Colombia's Marxist rebels since 2002 is a matter for rejoicing in many of the papers. Clara Rojas, a former Colombian vice-presidential candidate, and Consuelo González, a former member of the country's congress, were released in a deal brokered by the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. But, as far as the US is concerned, the good news seems to be tempered by the involvement of Chavez. \"The United States grudgingly acknowledged Chavez's role in Colombia\", the International Herald Tribune says. The Independent is also preoccupied by the involvement of Chavez, who called the US president, George Bush, \"the devil\". The paper says the release of the hostages was a \"propaganda coup\", adding that the \"triumphant Mr Chavez wasted no time in trumpeting his achievement\". * Chavez wins freedom for Colombian hostages REDKNAPP 'FAVOURITE' FOR NEWCASTLE JOB For the second day running, the back pages are dominated by Newcastle United's quest to find a new manager following the departure of Sam Allardyce. The Portsmouth boss Harry Redknapp is still the favourite, according to most of the papers, although the Mirror claims he has told friends he is \"in two minds\" about taking the job and rates the chances as \"60-40\" in favour. He has been offered £20m to spend and given the option of commuting by plane from the south coast, according to the Sun. However, the Guardian says the Blackburn boss, Mark Hughes, has emerged as joint favourite. \"Newcastle's apparent interest in Hughes was described as 'a sensitive subject' at Ewood Park yesterday, where officials were fearing an approach from the Tyneside club,\" the paper reports. * Hughes comes on strong for Newcastle job * Mirror: Redknapp's in two minds * Sun: Here's your GBP20m deal, 'Arry PROTESTERS SCUPPER CAMERON'S SMITHS SNAP An attempt by David Cameron to \"boost his street cred\" was scuppered by protestors, the Mirror delightedly reveals today.

The young couple who yesterday made their vows in the spring sunlight had little time to broker a prenup. When sceptical hacks pressed David Cameron and Nick Clegg on how they expected to make such a deeply unconventional union work, their answer, in essence, was that they could muddle through because they trusted each other. For richer, for poorer? The first question for both partners in the new Lib-Con alliance is just how solemn, how binding and how enduring their commitments really are. The crunch issue here is the proposal to fix the parliamentary term, the lock that holds the whole arrangement in place. On the face of it, yesterday's deal left no wriggle room: \"the next general election will be held on the first Thursday of May 2015\". This is a welcome surrender of prime ministerial power, and one that strengthens the hand of the Lib Dems by allowing them to walk away from the government without triggering an automatic election at which they would expect to suffer. There is a big question mark, however, over whether the legal lock against a snap poll can be made to stick. Can a sovereign parliament tie its hands against voting for an early dissolution without ceasing to be sovereign? The doubts grow with small print which reveals that the Commons would still be dissolved if 55% of MPs decide it is time to face the country. Some sort of a short-circuit mechanism is undoubtedly needed so time can be called on an impossibly hung parliament, but – with a little reflection – it is obvious that the test should be a prolonged failure to sustain or replace a functioning administration, as opposed to this arbitrary numerical threshold. This detail, however, was only one of several things on which there was no time to reflect. Another unresolved question is how roughly or otherwise the two governing parties should treat each other on the competitive field. It is a question that cuts to the core of our fast-changing political culture, and yet it is one which will need answering by the end of this month, with the special election in Thirsk and Malton called because of the death of a candidate. Messrs Clegg and Cameron brushed the issue off with a good-natured shrug yesterday, and indeed the shocked state of the press pack enabled them to take the same tack with inquiries about everything from the operation of prime minister's questions to the exact topography of where they will work in relation to one another. All of this will have to be worked out – and soon. The way that it is worked out will matter. But there is no reason why, with forethought and goodwill, the logistics should not be resolved. The thornier problem will be judging how much slack to cut dissident members of each of the tribes, when they cannot stomach the policies of the other. Yesterday's textual agreement contained several specific get-out clauses for Lib Dem consciences on particular issues, such as nuclear power. But government is at least as much a reactive as a planned business, and the mutual tolerance of the political partners will in time be tested by all manner of events that neither can currently foresee.

Build nuclear plants, change farming practices, move freight on to the railways? Reduce the amount of people flying? By using our national carbon calculator – a kind of energy and emissions reckoner for the UK – you can now for the first time see how your preferred policies would actually stack up. Want to electrify every car on the road? Just move the slider. Don't have enough power supply for that? Maybe add a few thousand wind turbines. Still can't get emissions low enough? Perhaps it's time to switch all homes to renewable heating systems. This new interactive tool joins two others: our quick carbon calculator, which allows you to quickly get a sense of your personal carbon footprint, and our climate simulator, which shows how various global emissions scenarios may play out in terms of future temperatures. But this new one is, we think, by far the most exciting (not to mention the most complicated to build). A few notes about the new calculator: • The aim is to get emissions down while also balancing the grid. • In its default state, it shows the UK as it is now – or, more accurately, as it was in 2007, the most recent year for which data is available. • You can use it to paint a scenario for next year, 2020, 2050, or whenever you like. • There's no fixed target: that depends on the date you have in mind and how much risk you're prepared to take with the climate. • The calculator is based on a data model put together by Danny Chivers, largely from government figures but drawing on some other sources where necessary. • The model includes the emissions created by the production of goods imported from other countries. Some would debate whether British consumers are entirely responsible for these \"offshore emissions\", but we felt it was important to include them. If you want to focus purely on domestic emissions, dragging the top slider to zero gives you a good approximation. While playing with the calculator myself, a few things really jumped out. First, the massive footprint of the goods we import from overseas. Second, the fact that some seemingly huge decisions, such as whether to build a new generation of nuclear power stations, turn out to be surprisingly small pieces of the overall picture. Third, quite how difficult it is to get emissions down to a sustainable level without tackling the overall level of consumption. We asked the candidates standing for the role of climate and energy minister in this year's general election to use the calculator to paint a picture of how the UK's emissions might look in 2025 if their policies were implemented. You can see the results here. • Ed Milband • Simon Hughes • Greg Clark Would you do things differently?

Egypt has long campaigned on the issue of Israel's atomic arsenal. Last month the Arab League called on the UN to declare the Middle East a nuclear-free zone. Saudi Arabia has been active too. Turkey also backs this demand as it offers to mediate between the west and Iran over Tehran's nuclear programme. Israel, constantly highlighting the danger from Iran, is estimated to have 150 to 200 atomic bombs, deliverable by aircraft, missile or submarine. Its programme was developed after France built a nuclear reactor at Dimona in the Negev desert in the 1950s. The so-called Samson option was seen by Israel's first generation of leaders as designed to prevent another Holocaust – its bombs reportedly bearing the slogan \"never again\". Israel, unlike Iran or Saddam Hussein's Iraq, never signed the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which allows countries to develop civilian nuclear power in exchange for forgoing weapons – supposedly the preserve of the five permanent members of the UN security council. India, Pakistan and North Korea have swelled the ranks of the weapons states, but unlike them, Israel has never come out of the closet, preferring a policy of so-called nuclear ambiguity – keeping its enemies guessing. Israel's official line has always been that it would not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East. Fears about Iran's nuclear ambitions have reinforced domestic support and perhaps international tolerance for Israel retaining its arsenal. In diplomatic terms, this has long been a no-go area for the US, Britain and other western countries. But the focus on Iran has also boosted Arab demands for a regional approach to disarmament. Last September, for the first time in 18 years, Israel, the US and other powers failed to prevent passage of a resolution by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) calling on Israel to sign the NPT and open up Dimona to international inspectors. Egypt played a key role in negotiating the NPT in the 1960s and tried but failed to link the renewal of the treaty in 1995 to the creation of a nuclear-free zone. Syria, an ally of Iran, denies harbouring nuclear weapons ambitions, a issue that was dramatically highlighted in 2007 when Israeli warplanes destroyed an alleged reactor on the Euphrates. \"There is widespread resentment in the region towards the NPT and what it seeks to achieve, its double standards and lack of political will,\" Egypt's UN ambassador, Hisham Badr, said recently. \"We in the Middle East feel we have, short of better word, been tricked into giving concessions for promises that never materialised.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2011/feb/25/kentucky-coal-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2011-02-25T15:31:00Z","webTitle":"Kentucky split between coal past and clean energy future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/25/kentucky-coal-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2011/feb/25/kentucky-coal-clean-energy","fields":{"headline":"Kentucky split between coal past and clean energy future","bodyText":"Kentucky is heading toward its energy future paddling in opposite directions. Some lawmakers want to boost the use of alternative energies, especially biomass, to diversify its fuel mix. But coal remains the backbone of its manufacturing-driven economy, and others are determined to keep it that way. The political dynamic playing out in Kentucky offers a local window into the larger national energy dilemma. The state is seeking the benefits of a clean economy, but coal is still the source of 92 percent of its electricity and brings in $3.5 billion in export revenue. Currently, state legislators are deliberating three bills to spur economic growth and rein in soaring electricity rates. One would foster clean energy development. The others would shelter the coal industry from Obama administration regulations on greenhouse gases that opponents say would kill industrial jobs. While it's true that Kentucky cheap coal has long attracted manufacturing industry — which currently employs 213,000 people in the automotive, steel and aluminum sectors — new figures suggest times are changing. Electricity rates have risen 41 percent on average over the last five years, delivering a blow to the state's big industries. Kentucky's cheap energy has become less of a competitive advantage. Manufacturing jobs have fallen 30 percent in the last decade, hitting the one-third of Kentuckians who live in low-income housing the hardest. At the same time, the state's smaller mines have become more expensive to operate, and newer machine-intensive technologies have cut back on manpower. As a result, coal mining jobs in Kentucky have fallen from 50,000 positions in 1979 to 18,000 today, according to the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development (MACED). Today, mining accounts for one percent of total non-farm employment in the state. \"The price of coal — to mine it, generate it and to try to manage the waste — is getting more expensive,\" said Elizabeth Crowe, director of the Kentucky Environmental Foundation. \"Meanwhile, the number of jobs created through clean renewable energy like wind, solar and hydro are really [rising] in some of our neighboring states\" but not in Kentucky. Government Overreach 'Costing Us Jobs' However, many legislators from both parties would disagree with the suggestion that coal can't power a jobs engine. In the Senate, the Natural Resources and Energy Committee approved a largely symbolic measure on Feb. 17 to make Kentucky a \"sanctuary state\" for the coal industry by exempting mines and power plants from \"the overreaching regulatory power\" of the EPA. Under the bill, the state's Energy and Environment Cabinet would go so far as to issue permits to coal mines previously denied by the EPA because of concerns over water pollution. \"As the overreaching EPA impact settles in on us, it's costing us jobs, it's putting us in a very perilous situation,\" said Chairman Sen. Brandon Smith, a Republican from the coal-mining town of Hazard, and the bill's sponsor. That same day, the committee's House counterpart approved a bill that would exempt Kentucky mines which produce coal for the state's use — not for export — from federal Clean Water Act requirements. The legislators contend they are protecting states' rights. But such pro-coal views are being met with growing citizen opposition. Earlier this month, Wendell Berry, the Kentucky author and poet, occupied the governor's office with 13 others for four days to protest government support of coal, while 1,000 protesters held a demonstration against mountaintop removal mining at the state Capitol. EPA Bashing 'Temporary Diversion' Len Peters, secretary of the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, told SolveClimate News that the pro-coal lawmakers introduced the bills as a way to show EPA their displeasure, and have even acknowledged that the state would lose substantial federal Clean Air Act funding if they're passed. Peters said the bills are merely a \"temporary diversion\" from Gov. Steven Beshear's long-term goals to diversify the state energy supply, which includes a seven-point strategy to get 25 percent of Kentucky's energy demand from energy efficiency, renewable energy and biofuels by 2025. The proposed Clean Energy Opportunity Act on the House floor, or H.B. 239, would take the Democratic governor's initiatives even further. Rep. Mary Lou Marzian, a Democrat from Louisville, introduced the bill earlier this month to establish a renewable and efficiency portfolio standard (REPS) for the state. Under the mandatory standard, renewable sources would account for 12.5 percent of utility retail sales by 2021, and utilities would achieve annual efficiency savings of up to 10.25 percent of retail sales in that period by reducing demand from manufacturers, businesses and homes. Jason Bailey, research and policy director for MACED, said that the House measure would take the first steps needed for a green energy transition. MACED is part of the Kentucky Sustainable Energy Alliance (KySEA), an organization of 30 businesses, nonprofit organizations and faith groups that drafted the bill. First Signs of Green Manufacturing \"We've built an economy around cheap electricity from coal-fired power that is coming to an end,\" Bailey told SolveClimate News. \"What we're really talking about for the next 10 years is that we need to take the first steps to position ourselves for the next phase, where by all indications, because of technology and policies, clean energy alternatives will take off [nationwide].\" Bailey said the REPS could help attract clean technology industries in an otherwise pro-coal state. \"You see a real correlation between states that are friendly to renewable energy and the location of renewable energy component and system manufacturing,\" he said. \"Manufacturers want a market for their products, and if Kentucky itself is not purchasing renewable energy systems, then it makes us less appealing. They want to go where the market is.\" Kentucky is starting to encourage green manufacturing ahead of its renewable energy market. Last August, the state received $53.4 million in federal stimulus funds from the U.S. Department of Energy to distribute clean energy tax credits and grants. Since then, the state finance authority has given Alternative Energies Kentucky Inc. preliminary approval for up to $390,000 in funding to build around 25,000 to 30,000 solar panels a year at its plant. ZF Steering Systems LLC also received a $28.6-million tax credit to make electric power steering gears for vehicles that consume 90 percent less energy than traditional hydraulic gears. General Electric in Louisville received $11.3 million of the same credit to make residential-scale heat pump clothes dryers, which use half the energy of standard dryers. Defining Renewables: Are Biomass, Coal Clean? Not surprisingly, state officials and green groups differ in defining how to develop actual renewable energy sources in Kentucky. The governor has assembled a biomass task force and expects the industry to account for more than half of renewable energy production by 2025. The task force estimates that biomass production could reach 25 million tons annually, or $3.4 billion in net output, and create about 14,000 jobs in rural communities. Earlier this year, the state finance authority awarded preliminary approval for up to $15 million in state tax credits to EcoPower LLC. A planned 58.5-megawatt biomass power generating facility is expected to operate in 2013. But whether burning tree parts for electricity should even qualify as clean renewable power remains up for debate in the United States. Conservationists say that biomass combustion produces more CO2 than burning fossil fuels, while the industry claims it's carbon neutral. For its part, the EPA is still considering both sides. Also disheartening to environmental groups is that coal would still make up more than 60 percent of the state's electricity portfolio under the governor's plan — though \"clean coal\" technologies would be implemented at 50 percent of coal-based facilities in the next 15 years to offset the harmful greenhouse gases emitted by the plants. An additional 15 percent of energy would come from nuclear power and natural gas, with biomass, hydropower and other renewables rounding off the top. Peters noted that carbon capture and storage (CCS) techniques are largely experimental for coal-fired plants and could take decades to carry out, while the biomass task force is still developing strategies for sustainable agricultural and forestry practices. Crowe of the Kentucky Environmental Foundation, which is also a KySEA member, told SolveClimate News that the state should instead bolster its utility-scale wind and solar energy industries, as those renewable sources don't require burning crops or proliferate coal practices that destroy the environment or pose health risks to Kentuckians. With No Wind, Negawatts are 'Paramount' Kentucky might not compare to California in terms of solar radiation, she continued, but it averages about as much solar radiation as New Jersey, a state with the second-most grid-connected solar capacity nationwide, at 127 megawatts. Kentucky has less than 0.1 megawatts in installed solar power. Wind energy, on the other hand, poses a real challenge to the Bluegrass State. Kentucky could potentially install about 61 megawatts in wind capacity, and only 0.01 percent of its land is considered a windy land area, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Neighboring states like Ohio have the potential to install 55,000 megawatts of wind power with 10.3 percent of land available for wind, while Indiana could install 148,000 megawatts and is one-third windy land area. Both groups agree that energy efficiency measures are paramount to picking away at Kentucky's dependency on coal-fired electricity. Industrial energy use in the state is nearly double the national average, and residents consume more energy per-capita than in almost any other state, according the energy cabinet. Peters said Kentucky had allotted $5 million in federal stimulus funds to hire energy managers in school districts statewide to retrofit and weatherize older buildings, install solar panels and minimize energy use so that savings can be poured into school curricula. According to the House clean energy bill, lower-income Kentuckians spend $1 of every $5 on home energy costs due to older housing and inefficient heating and cooling systems. Crowe said: \"Most people understand the problem it poses to society – it's less money for everything else that they need.\" • This article was changed on 25 February to reflect the wind capacity figures were potential installations, not actual installations"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2011/jan/23/justine-roberts-mumsnet-family-life-misogyny-eastenders","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2011-01-30T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"Mumsnet's champion Justine Roberts on family life, misogyny… and EastEnders","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jan/23/justine-roberts-mumsnet-family-life-misogyny-eastenders","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2011/jan/23/justine-roberts-mumsnet-family-life-misogyny-eastenders","fields":{"headline":"Mumsnet's champion Justine Roberts on family life, misogyny… and EastEnders","bodyText":"Last Wednesday Riven Vincent, a regular contributor to the forums of the parenting website Mumsnet, posted words of despair. She wrote that she had asked social services to take her severely disabled six-year-old daughter, Celyn, into care. \"We get six hours' respite a week,\" she wrote. \"I can't cope.\" The following morning, Celyn's face was on the front page of national newspapers – a vivid example of one of the people the spending cuts will hit hardest. David Cameron, who had promised that he would not do anything to harm disabled children, was caught – and still remains – on the back foot. According to some critics of the site, that's just where Mumsnet's 600,000 members like their politicians to be – if not on their knees. Charities working with disabled children have thanked Mumsnet for the publicity it has generated. Other commentators, however, while sympathetic to Celyn's family, are less than enchanted with the sight of the mummy-warriors marching forth yet again, exercising an influence they believe is disproportionate to their numbers. Certainly, Mumsnet attracts an extraordinary degree of venom. It has been labelled censorious, moralising, smug, vicious, bullying and sanctimonious, and accused of having members who are rude, dogmatic and as \"thick as mincemeat\" who remain immersed for hours in the subjects of weaning, nappies and nipples. Ever since politicians began courting the site as a way in to new media, murmurs of complaint on the blogosphere have grown into a roar. \"What the hell does Mumsnet think it is?\" seems to be the gist. And how does it manage to pull the strings of publicity so effectively? Justine Roberts, as its co-founder and now chief executive, is the most likely candidate for the role of puppeteer-in-chief. Her mother, Elizabeth, said of Justine in an interview: \"When talents were being handed out, she got more than her fair share. But her school reports all complained she messed about… She was the ringleader of a very noisy gang, and in a way she still is.\" Roberts is 43 years old, a former economist and sports correspondent, a Liverpool supporter, and a mother of four. She has a strong sense of humour, an infectious laugh and a very clear idea of how Mumsnet works. For those who choose to leave their prejudices at the door of \"Mumsnet Towers\" in north London, it's not all that difficult to understand its success as an online community and pressure group. In 1999, Justine and her husband, Ian Katz, now deputy editor of the Guardian, took their one-year-old twins on a holiday advertised as being family-friendly. \"The twins had diarrhoea and we didn't bring enough nappies. The man sitting next to us on the plane was passing us paper cups to catch the vomit,\" says Roberts. \"The holiday was so not family-friendly. And that's when the idea for Mumsnet was conceived.\" She and her co-founder, Carrie Longton, a television producer, decided on a website \"to make parents' lives easier by pooling knowledge, experience and support\". Roberts and a handful of university friends worked out of her back bedroom; it was five years before they could pay themselves a modest salary. \"If anyone knows how to make a profit out of the free internet, let us know,\" she jokes. Eleven years after Mumsnet's birth, some now see Roberts as a matriarchal Cromwell leading a righteous army of middle-class mums into war. Campaigns so far include a drive against the sexualisation of children; improved care for women who miscarry; and the perennial push for more family-friendly employers (a Mumsnet Jobs Club opens in the spring). Recently, Mumsnet triumphed in a battle over a £1.25m billboard campaign that declared, in one of a series of deliberately provocative statements intended to demonstrate the power of outdoor advertising, that \"career women make bad mothers\" (the poster was withdrawn). It has also tussled with Gina Ford, the parenting guru, who complained about insults posted about her on Mumsnet forums (the case was settled out of court). And most recently, it has challenged EastEnders over a storyline in which a mother who loses her baby to a cot death steals another child. \"A large number of Mumsnet people who'd suffered a bereavement felt strongly that they had a right to complain to an organisation to which they pay a licence fee, and which almost boasts that it educates via its storylines,\" Roberts says. \"They wanted Mumsnet to register the complaint. We didn't ask anyone to edit the storyline: that was the BBC's decision. \"We are very anti the idea of censorship generally. We run a site based on freedom of speech. I knew we would attract a lot of criticism, but sometimes it's still the right thing to do.\" Mumsnet draws 25,000 postings and a million hits a day. Apart from its popular chatrooms, it offers books and guides, and asks Mumsnetters to test products and interview stars and politicians. The site's members tend to be aged between 25 and 45 and come from all over the UK. They are more likely to live in the city; 75% of them have degrees; and their income tends to be slightly above average. In short, they mirror the path of women who have moved into further education since the 1970s. \"We also have a large proportion who would rather chew off their right arm than call themselves middle class,\" Roberts says. Social interaction on the site is often robust and blunt, and sometimes funny. Cruelty is not allowed; \"insensitivity\" is. \"Get the doormat tattoo off your head,\" one woman is instructed briskly. Critics detect a gang mentality that they say is reinforced by Mumsnet's own acronyms and slang – for instance, \"DH\" (darling husband), \"baby dancing\" (sex with a husband), and \"norks\", which, Mumsnet user \"Norkybutnice\" explains, means \"breasts\". It's strange, but hardly in the same league as Masonic rites and rituals. So why the resentment? \"I understand it,\" Roberts says. \"We have the highest-profile voice for women online. People who aren't mothers probably think: 'Hang on, that doesn't represent me at all.' I wish there were other voices out there that got as much profile as us. But there's also another level to the resentment, which is basic misogyny. Mothers are expected to behave in a certain way. They are not expected to talk about sex, or swear, or have opinions that challenge the stereotype.\" When Mumsnet tackles issues outside parenting, such as the economy or nuclear power, Roberts says, the tweets grow ever more offensive – for example: \"Britain is going to the dogs. Those being the ones in charge of Mumsnet.\" Roberts has been described as having \"a haggard face with dried-up ovaries\". Still, you can't travel in the wild west and complain about the bullets; the internet is rough. Roberts says she feels more frustrated than anything else. \"In any one day, Mumsnetters are called sanctimonious and prim – and then shrill leftwing harridan harpies. With more than 25,000 postings, you can find the prejudice you seek.\" What Mumsnet probably does epitomise is whatever the \"big society\" is supposed to mean, Roberts adds – \"people organising themselves to help each other, show small kindnesses and be communal.\" Riven Vincent illustrates her point. If you follow the thread, within minutes of her first despairing post, dozens of members moved rapidly from giving verbal support to offering practical help, supplying \"Dave's\" (David Cameron's) fax and address details, Facebooking and tweeting celebrities and politicians, asking them to act. Mumsnet is, in part, an online mutual aid society. One single mother who announced on the site that she had swallowed an overdose of pills was tracked down; members organised childcare and raised £2,000. It is also a home of virtual protest, but members are equally drawn from the three major parties, so a consensus is not always forged. \"Our members are a 24/7 focus group. If we're not too sure about what path to take, we consult with them,\" Roberts says. \"And they show us the way. We are conduits, not leaders.\" Roberts works full-time but the majority of the staff of 32 are part-time. Her mother says that her daughter and son-in-law live on the edge. Roberts laughs: \"By which she means, we're always late.\" Her mother also says that her twin granddaughters wrote a letter to Justine that read: \"You and Dad are never here. All we want is to be with you.\" Roberts chuckles again. \"The girls write a letter a day. It's usually espousing some injustice such as 'why my telephone shouldn't be confiscated'. I see a great deal of my children. The only person I don't see much of is my husband.\" She smiles. The Mumsnet Rules, co-written by Roberts, will be published in May. The organisation also has expansion plans. \"If I'm proud of anything,\" Roberts says, \"it's that we've given a public voice to those who didn't have one before. The most popular forum on Mumsnet is called 'Am I being unreasonable?', which says a lot about women's guilt and insecurities. I'd guess on a men's website it would probably be called 'You are being unreasonable'. There's still a lot of work to be done.\" • The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the Record column, Sunday 30 January 2011. We maintained that breastfeeding Mumsnet members tended to call their breasts \"nookies\", with one user giving herself the epithet \"Nookiebutnice\". Generally, site users affectionately nickname breasts \"norks\" and the member calls herself \"Norkybutnice\". \"Nork\", a 1950s Australian slang term, derives from New South Wales, where the prominent udders on a cow advertised Norco, the North Coast Dairy Co-operative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2010/mar/01/iran-iaea-chief-amano-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2010-03-01T18:29:48Z","webTitle":"Iran still failing to co-operate, says head of nuclear watchdog","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/01/iran-iaea-chief-amano-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2010/mar/01/iran-iaea-chief-amano-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Iran still failing to co-operate, says head of nuclear watchdog","bodyText":"Iran is still failing to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, its new head said today, strengthening those voices calling for new sanctions to force Tehran to comply with international demands. Yukiya Amano, addressing the first meeting of the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) since he took over as director-general, said he was unable to confirm that Tehran was engaged solely in peaceful nuclear activities \"because Iran has not provided the agency with the necessary co-operation\". Iran immediately rejected the charge. \"We have always welcomed and encouraged negotiations and talks,\" said its foreign minister, Manuchehr Mottaki, during a visit to Geneva. The exchange came as the United States and Britain orchestrate support for new United Nations action against Iran for its failure to cease uranium enrichment. Russia has moved towards the western position in recent weeks, while diplomatic efforts are focusing on persuading China ‑ one of the veto-wielding \"permanent five\" members of the security council ‑ to back a new resolution. Israeli officials said today they were optimistic that China would not use its veto after hearing Israeli arguments about the dangers of a nuclear-armed Iran. Israel ‑ which unlike Iran has never signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty ‑ is the only nuclear power in the Middle East. Amano, a Japanese disarmament expert, came under fire last month when he suggested Iran was trying to develop a nuclear-armed missile, fuelling fears in Tehran that he was taking a tougher line than his Egyptian predecessor, Mohamed ElBaradei. The first report produced during Amano's term used unusually blunt language to confirm that Iran had produced its first batch of uranium enriched to a higher purity — 20% — but said the Islamic Republic had failed to give inspectors the required advance notice. It also referred to the possible existence of past or current undisclosed activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile. International attitudes to Iran hardened last autumn after it revealed a previously unknown nuclear facility in the mountains near Qom, apparently to pre-empt exposure by the United States. Tehran insists its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/jun/20/ruth-sunderland-budget-cuts-growth","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-19T23:16:00Z","webTitle":"Austerity isn't enough, Mr Osborne.

Without growth, all the pain will be meaningless","bodyText":"Everyone knows that George Osborne's emergency budget on Tuesday is going to hurt. The question is whether the medicine will work, or prove to be a counterproductive exercise in fiscal sadism. The chancellor is likely to take a twin-track approach. He will present tough austerity measures, arguing that they are inevitable if we are to avoid a sovereign debt crisis. But to sugar the pill, he will also claim to be making the UK more competitive in order to unleash future private sector growth and enterprise. A National Insurance contribution holiday for employers in depressed regions is likely to be the centrepiece of the coalition government's efforts to avoid being seen as callous slash-and-burn merchants. The idea is to stimulate private sector employment and small business growth in areas dominated by the state. Other measures aimed at business are likely to include cuts in corporation tax, with Osborne setting out a five-year road map to reducing rates. These are steps in the right direction, but whether they will be enough to shield vulnerable regions remains to be seen. Over the summer, Osborne will be conducting a ferocious scrutiny of welfare spending, the results of which will be announced in October's Comprehensive Spending Review. Welfare cuts will be spun as a way of saving other Whitehall departments, such as education, from even more savage reductions and of preserving long-term investment and infrastructure projects. But all the cuts will be meaningless without economic growth. The notion that a wave of private sector enterprise will be unleashed as soon as we slash the state and clamp down on benefit scroungers is a familiar one from the 1980s – but in many regions of the UK, the Thatcherite revolution did not result in a vibrant surge of private industry, freed from the dead hand of the state and the unions, but a vicious slump whose scars remain today. Large tracts of the north, Wales, Scotland, the Midlands and parts of the south-west are dependent on public sector jobs, have high rates of long-term unemployment, and will be extremely vulnerable to a fresh round of cuts. The private sector will not pick up the slack by magic: these regions need intelligent government support. An NI holiday is one thing, but the coalition's decision last week to pull the plug on an £80m government loan promised to Sheffield Forgemasters, a supplier to the nuclear power industry, was ominous. If the UK is going to revitalise manufacturing and develop green technology, businesses such as this need backing. To his credit, Osborne is making some advances in steering the economy away from its over-reliance on the financial sector. He flagged up a new banking levy in his Mansion House speech last week: banks are braced for a new tax on balance sheets, as well as more restraint on pay and bonuses. Other measures have been well semaphored. A rise in VAT from 17.5% to 20% has been widely touted, though there is some speculation that Osborne may not do it, in order to deliver a pleasant surprise of sorts. An increase would hurt retailers and also be highly regressive, hitting poorer households proportionately harder than richer ones. Fears over stoking inflation may mean implementation is delayed, or phased in over several years. Rightly or wrongly, Osborne has the courage of his convictions on deficit reduction even in the face of concerns within the Obama administration that the accelerated austerity drive sweeping across Europe will cause a double-dip recession. Mervyn King has suggested that monetary easing could offset any dampening of demand caused by the chancellor's cuts, but with interest rates at rock-bottom, the governor has no scope to cut borrowing costs to stimulate the economy; all he could do is print more money through quantitative easing, and that is terra incognita. Osborne will be delivering the most difficult budget in recent memory, both politically and economically, and there is little margin for error. He has to bring down a record peacetime deficit and protect the UK's fragile recovery. It is not enough to slash public spending – he must do so without strangling growth. The scale of that challenge is daunting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2010/jun/02/edf-nuclear-waste-lobbying","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2010-06-02T18:13:25Z","webTitle":"EDF ran secret lobbying campaign to reduce size of nuclear waste disposal levy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jun/02/edf-nuclear-waste-lobbying","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2010/jun/02/edf-nuclear-waste-lobbying","fields":{"headline":"EDF ran secret lobbying campaign to reduce nuclear waste disposal levy","bodyText":"The nuclear industry is being offered what campaigners claim is a taxpayer subsidy on the disposal costs of waste from new reactors following a secret lobbying campaign, the Guardian has learned. The revelation will put further scrutiny on the new government's promise that there will be no subsidy for nuclear power. Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne, the new energy and climate change secretary of state, admitted to the Guardian this week that the government already faces a £4bn funding black hole over existing radioactive waste. The previous government had planned to charge the industry a high, fixed, disposal levy tied to the amount of nuclear waste it produced. It had also originally told the industry that responsibility for the waste should be transferred to the state only once the waste had been disposed of, at least 110 years from the start of a reactor's operations. Both proposals were deeply unpopular with the industry. In March, the Labour government published revised proposals that made significant concessions on both issues. Consultation on the plans will conclude this month. A spokesman for the energy department said the consultation was continuing but declined to comment on whether the new government would take a different approach to the previous administration. Documents released under a freedom of information request reveal the extent of behind-the-scenes lobbying last year in Whitehall by EDF Energy, the French firm that wants to build the first new reactors in the UK for decades. The lobbying focused on the two key proposals which were revised in March. In one meeting with officials from the energy department in July last year, EDF Energy's presentation concluded that the original proposals were \"non-acceptable\" [sic]. In another meeting in October, the presentation warned: \"At current levels, [the proposed] fixed price model will significantly impact the economics of NNB [nuclear new build] in the UK and could make an investment unattractive.\" In a letter in July to the department, the company even warned that the cost calculations could \"be open to challenge in future on the grounds of prudency\". A spokesman from Greenpeace said: \"These documents blow EDF's claim that they won't need any subsidies for new nuclear clean out of the water. They know full well that the economics of nuclear don't stack up and that new reactors will only ever happen if the British taxpayer is forced yet again to carry the atomic can.\" In an effort to protect the taxpayer from having to pick up the tab, last year the government proposed charging a very high fixed unit price for waste disposal. But EDF argued it was much too high. The revised proposal would allow operators to set aside a much lower amount for the first 10 years of a reactor's operation. The original plan had also been for the government to assume title – or responsibility – for the waste once it had been disposed of in a new underground storage facility, which has yet to be built. This transfer – and the transfer of funds by operators to the government to cover the costs – would take place after 110 years of the reactor beginning operation, at the earliest. But EDF said this would involve too long-term an investment risk, as the returns from their waste disposal fund would have to cover the costs when it matured over a century later. The consultation instead proposed the transfer taking place once decommissioning has been completed, after around 60 years. An energy department spokesman said: \"The allegation that outcomes of the consultation have been pre-agreed with industry have no foundation. The coalition has committed that there will be no public subsidy for new nuclear.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2008/apr/24/nuclear.utilities","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2008-04-24T08:31:20Z","webTitle":"German utility prepares to build two nuclear power stations in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/24/nuclear.utilities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2008/apr/24/nuclear.utilities","fields":{"headline":"German utility prepares to build two nuclear power stations in UK","bodyText":"E.ON, the German-owned utility which supplies gas and electricity to millions of customers in Britain, said yesterday that it planned to build two nuclear power stations in the UK. The company, which has run into controversy over its plans to build a coal-fired plant at Kingsnorth, Kent, wants to use a new generation of 1,600MW atomic reactor, designed by Areva of France. E.ON, which is also pressing ahead with wind farm developments, has not officially revealed where it wants to build the plants but sources say it is considering sites in the south of England now owned by British Energy. \"It's clear that a new generation of nuclear power stations will ensure that the UK will have a secure and reliable source of low-carbon power for decades to come, and E.ON is right at the forefront of those plans,\" said the firm's UK chief executive, Paul Golby. \"It's now up to us to work with our partners and with government to make that a reality.\" E.ON, which has been building its public profile in the UK by sponsoring the FA Cup, has signed a letter of intent with Areva and the German engineering group Siemens, to help build the plants, which are unlikely to be in place before 2018. E.ON has joined the French electricity provider EDF in making explicit its desire to press ahead with nuclear given government provision of the framework. There has also been speculation that RWE, of Germany, would like to construct a facility to replace the nuclear power station at Wylfa, on Anglesey, Wales. The momentum comes amid talks between E.ON, EDF and RWE with the UK's nuclear operator, British Energy, which generates 18% of the country's electricity from its existing facilities and owns the key sites that could be used for a new generation of plants. British Energy is a potential takeover target of EDF and RWE. Sources close to E.ON say the German group is interested in a small equity stake in the nuclear generator rather than full control but is fearful that EDF or another firm might buy the company outright and effectively gain a stranglehold on the best potential newbuild sites. It seems clear that E.ON would be willing to ask that the government or industry regulator prevents any one company getting an unfair advantage. EDF, the world's largest nuclear operator, could team up with Centrica, the owner of British Gas, to make a bid for British Energy, while RWE, possibly in cooperation with Vattenfall, of Sweden, could be another bidder for the UK group, which is owned 35% by the government. RWE is already reported to have proposed a 700p indicative offer for the UK nuclear firm, valuing it at £11bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
