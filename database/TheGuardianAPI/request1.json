With two successful community energy schemes already behind it, Ripple Energy is looking for investors for its third: the construction of a 42MW solar park in Derril Water in Devon, not far from the Cornish town of Bude. Once up and running in the summer of 2024, the project, which is being built by one of the world’s largest independent renewable energy companies, RES, will produce enough electricity to power 14,000 homes across Britain. Ripple says this co-owned venture – which will have about 70,000 panels – will be the first solar park in the UK to share its green electricity among its thousands of owners. Householders can invest as little as £25, although most people will probably want to put in a typical £3,000 to £3,600 – the amount required to buy enough generation capacity to cover up to 120% of their home’s annual electricity consumption. The company says this should result in average savings of at least £200 a year. Instead of paying the market rate for their electricity, they will in effect be paying the wholesale cost – the price the solar park would have got in the market. Of course, a lot depends on what happens to energy prices in the future. Ripple says it has designed the scheme to be similar to a consumer investing in their own rooftop solar panels – except that the panels just happen to be somewhere else in the country. An investment of £3,000 is significantly cheaper than buying your own rooftop solar panels. Home solar system installations start at about £7,000, rising to more than £12,000 if you add a decent battery. As well as those who can’t afford that, the scheme may appeal to people who live in a property where the roof isn’t suitable for solar panels. Sarah Merrick, the founder and chief executive of Ripple Energy, says that by offering consumer ownership, Derril Water solar park “will become a completely different kind of solar park, one owned by the people it supplies low-cost green power to”. She adds: “We want Derril Water to become a blueprint for consumer-owned solar parks around the world. The aim is to create a wave of green energy ownership that enables people to make a real climate impact, as well as stabilising their energy bills. We hope as many as possible become part of this pioneering project.” The firm says the solar park will save 19,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year. So how does it all work? Those putting their money in are actually buying shares in a cooperative society, one managed by Ripple. Between now and when the plant starts generating power, the household has to switch to one of the six approved energy suppliers, which include Octopus and E.ON. Provided you have bought enough capacity to meet 100% of your home’s electricity consumption, you should typically save about 20-25% off your electricity bills, it is claimed. This is automatically processed by your supplier, with the lower bills available for the next 40 years. Users are not getting a 100% electricity saving because the non-energy costs, such as the grid charges, taxes and supplier costs, still have to be paid. A typical household investing £3,600 upfront is expected to save at least £8,000 in total (£200 or so a year x 40 years), the firm claims, while at the same time helping the planet, although the actual savings will depend on future electricity prices. The savings rate is set each year. Further energy supply problems such as those following the Russia-Ukraine war would mean bigger savings. Equally, a collapse in prices would result in the opposite. One of the advantages of this scheme is that if you move, you get to take the panels and savings with you. It is no problem if you rent, and you also don’t have to find and hire contractors to have your own system installed. However, it is important to be aware that, unlike traditional investments, money invested in this scheme is not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the official body that steps in to protect UK customers when authorised financial services firms go under. However, investors can take some comfort in the fact that this is Ripple’s third scheme, and its partner, RES, is a big player in the renewables field. Ripple’s first project was a single wind turbine in Wales where 900 people signed up for co-ownership. Its second project, in Scotland, has eight wind turbines and is fully funded and under construction. About 5,600 co-owners and 19 business members own that scheme and will get their bills reduced when it starts operating by the start of 2024, or earlier. The latest project is Ripple’s first solar park. The buy-in cost is higher than that of the windfarms but users will be benefiting from the energy discounts for 40 years rather than 25. “When we launched our first windfarm, we were expecting it to take 13 or 14 years for users to get their investment back but since we launched, the prices have gone so high that it’s actually looking like the costs could be paid back through savings in maybe four years instead,” Merrick says. Once invested, the money has to stay in the scheme, meaning no withdrawals. Ripple may be able to “resell” your capacity to another household whose consumption has risen.

The offer is expected to close on 16 May, or earlier if there is very high demand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-24T20:00:14Z","webTitle":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand solar energy manufacturing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","fields":{"headline":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand solar energy manufacturing","bodyText":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand its solar energy manufacturing capacity as the industry booms and nations scramble to cut their over-dependence on China, a report by the Australian Australian PV Institute Institute says. The country is installing 4GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity a year already but meeting just 3% of that from a local supplier, Adelaide’s Tindo Solar. That annual installation tally, though, is predicted to triple by 2050, particularly if Australia becomes a major supplier of hydrogen produced by renewable energy for export. “We have a pressing need, we have the natural resources and we have a very sizeable market,” the report said. “Unless Australia gains control over the most strategic parts of the PV value chain, the development of any ‘green’ export market will be completely dependent on foreign powers.” Renate Egan, the APVI secretary and head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said China would remain an important supplier of panels to Australia but it was important to diversify supply, including by using local firms. “You can liken it to Europe’s reliance on gas from Russia,” Egan said, referring to shortages and soaring gas prices after Moscow imposed export curbs in retaliation to sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world is relying increasingly on solar energy generation for the energy transition [from fossil fuels],” she said. “They’re becoming aware of the risks … in that over 90% of the tech comes from China.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Covid pandemic helped spur demands for more local manufacturing capability when Australia struggled to secure supplies of vaccines and medical equipment. Ongoing supply chain disruptions, particularly as China maintains its Covid-zero policies, have given added impetus to calls for more domestic production capability. A spokesperson for the industry and science minister, Ed Husic, said solar was “clearly going to be a big part of Australia’s renewable energy future”. “The Albanese government will deliver dedicated support through Powering Australia – a $3bn co-investment stream as part of the National Reconstruction Fund,” he said. “A big part of its focus will be on renewables component manufacturing and low-emissions technologies, including production of batteries and solar panels. “By 2030, the government aims to have 82% renewables in the national electricity market. To achieve that, we will need to produce much more solar capacity on shore as well as having a diversity in our international supply chains.” The present trade tensions between Australia and China exacerbated “the potential threat to supply restrictions or sudden price changes”, the APVI paper said. “Adding to this risk is the growing concern over the possible use of forced labour in parts of China, where much of the silicon, wafers and steel used in PV components are produced,” it said. Egan said Australian technology was used in 90% of PV panels made today, underscoring the country’s scientific pedigree in the field. The country wouldn’t need to make all of the components in modules but could specialise. Local firms could make glass, aluminium frames, polymers or the electronics such as inverters, while leaving production of polysilicon – a key raw material – to others. “I think it’s at the top end of silicon refining and then module assembly,” Egan said. “We need to be making some smart decisions and deploying at scale.” The paper cited existing suppliers including Selectronic – one of the world’s oldest makers of inverters. SunDrive is a firm considering commercial-size silicon-based solar cell fabrication in Australia, while 5B is aiming at fast low-cost PV deployment to supply some of the multi-gigawatt-sized solar farms planned for northern Australia. “To succeed on a global scale, these emerging companies would benefit from market certainty and a coordinated effort to reach scale,” the paper said. Customers could include Sun Cable, a venture supported by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, that aims to build a 12,000-hectare solar precinct in the Northern Territory with 17-20GW capacity and 36-42GW-hours of energy storage. Forrest’s Fortescue group said last week it was planning 2-3GW of renewable energy using solar and wind plants between 2024-28. It was also working to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the global supply of decarbonisation technologies and was building the world’s largest electrolyser facility for the production of hydrogen in Gladstone as part of that effort."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-24T10:48:04Z","webTitle":"Barcelona school and residents create solar energy community","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona school and residents create solar energy community","bodyText":"A secondary school and a residents’ association have teamed up with Barcelona city council to create a solar energy community with the capacity to grow – rooftop by rooftop – across large areas of the city. The solar panels on the roof of Quatre Cantons secondary school in the former industrial district of Poblenou supply power to the school and 30 households in the surrounding area. Each household has 500W of free electricity at its disposal, equivalent to a 25% cut in their bill. The idea was first proposed in 2019, says Marike Charlier, spokesperson for the residents’ association, and began to become a reality in discussions with the Quatre Cantons school. César Ochoa, a maths teacher at the school who also sits on its sustainability committee, said the school’s desire to cut energy consumption dovetailed with the residents’ plans and, in a first for an energy community of this nature, the council agreed to foot the €94,000 (£80,000) cost of installing solar panels on the school’s roof. The 30 households then became clients of Barcelona Energia, the council-run electricity company, replacing the private company Endesa, although the latter has been slow to cede the connection. “Once it’s operational, the school will get 30% of the electricity generated,” Ochoa says. “That will supply only some of its needs, but this is just a pilot project. Obviously, during school holidays this energy will be available to whoever else needs it.” Solar power went into decline in Spain under the previous conservative government after it imposed a “sunshine tax” on individual consumers or energy communities, which the big power companies claimed were unfair competition. The tax was scrapped under the current government and solar installation is soaring, accompanied by a move towards localised, rooftop installations, such as Quatre Cantons, rather than huge solar parks miles from centres of population. Last year Spain produced about 46% of its energy through renewables but solar (1.8%) still lags behind wind (23%) and hydro (11.4%). Under Spanish law, solar installations can only supply power within a 500m radius (the rule is 2km in France and Portugal) but the idea was always to extend it beyond 500m from the school, says Charlier. She points out that there are 11 other public buildings within 500m (1,640ft) of Quatre Cantons where further installations could radically increase the power available and extend the scheme across the neighbourhood. The city council has set itself a goal of a five-fold increase in solar power across the public and private sector by 2030. “These energy communities are really special and they make it possible to find solutions that wouldn’t otherwise be viable, but it isn’t scalable for the whole city,” says Eloi Badia, councillor for climate change and ecological transition. “In the end, the solution for Barcelona is for everyone to have solar panels on their roof.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/22/landowners-call-for-scrapping-of-plans-to-ban-solar-energy-from-englands-farmland","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-22T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Landowners call for scrapping of plans to ban solar energy from England’s farmland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/22/landowners-call-for-scrapping-of-plans-to-ban-solar-energy-from-englands-farmland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/22/landowners-call-for-scrapping-of-plans-to-ban-solar-energy-from-englands-farmland","fields":{"headline":"Landowners call for scrapping of plans to ban solar energy from England’s farmland","bodyText":"Farmers have urged whoever succeeds Liz Truss as UK prime minister to abandon plans to ban solar energy from most of England’s farmland, arguing that it would hurt food security by cutting off a vital income stream. Truss, who resigned on Thursday, and her environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, hoped to ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land, the Guardian revealed last week. They planned to do this by reclassifying less productive farmland as “best and most valuable”, making it more difficult to use for energy infrastructure. Members of the Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents 33,000 landowners, told the Guardian having solar on their less productive land allowed them to subsidise food production during less successful years, as well as providing cheap power for their estates and homes in their local area. Mark Tufnell, the president of the CLA, grows oats, wheat and barley on his Cotswolds estate. He said: “We have members who say these are temporary sites if needs be, they are then able to concentrate on growing more food on their other land. “The solar would be on their less good land, and … if that is what they so choose to do, why shouldn’t they be allowed to do it?” He added that the land was not lost to agriculture as the sties were easy to remove, and the area could be grazed with sheep. “There is no reason as to why the area underneath it couldn’t be grazed with sheep, but it could also provide very good habitat for farmland birds and increase biodiversity so help the environment. “I don’t see that saying with the strike of a pen that we are going to exclude this land, I don’t see that it helps, and I think that it is unlikely to help food security in any case.” The real problem with the government’s solar strategy, he said, was how difficult it was to put solar on rooftops. Tufnell said: “There are so many things they could do that they aren’t doing, like incentivising solar rollout on roofs, changing the planning system to allow it. I already have 49kW, and I want to have another 100kW on my buildings, but the hardest thing to do is getting a connection to the grid at a price that is affordable. They are very slow, the price is incredibly high, and in my case I could have to put in a mini substation, which is very expensive. “What I am trying to do is put solar panels on a building which I am converting into offices and workshops, if there is any excess I would like to use it for the houses in the village. But it is becoming so difficult and expensive that it is very off-putting, and if I wasn’t so persistent I would think frankly I can’t be bothered.” Harry Teacher, a fruit and arable farmer in Kent, has a large solar park on his land, which helps bring in income when his farm has a bad year. He said: “We put in a park in 2014, ground-mounted panels on frames on about 61 acres of land. We are a fruit and arable farm but we are quite highly diversified, and any farmer has been encouraged to find sources of income other than arable, and solar panels were part of that diversification. For us it is a source of constant income. It gives our business a greater resilience.” Teacher does not understand all the fuss, adding: “As a proposition they are quite easily hidden by a large hedge. They don’t make noise, there are no moving parts. Carbon is a serious thing we all have to consider now, solar panels have to be part of that. If the argument is that the land is lost for food – you may be aware that the planning applications for solar parks are done on a temporary basis – ours is a 25-year period. If, for whatever reason, we run out of food, which is extraordinarily unlikely, we can pull it all up and restore it to agriculture. “We make unequivocally more from our solar panels than from farming. There is a gut reaction people have to any sort of greenfield development and it is more of a reaction to people’s response to seeing solar parks – I don’t think it’s a real fear for food production.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/apr/01/florida-solar-energy-bill-financial-incentive","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T09:00:17Z","webTitle":"Florida Republican bill ‘basically erases’ state’s only pro-solar energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/florida-solar-energy-bill-financial-incentive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/florida-solar-energy-bill-financial-incentive","fields":{"headline":"Florida Republican bill ‘basically erases’ state’s only pro-solar energy policy","bodyText":"In one of America’s sunniest states, a Republican-led Senate recently passed a bill that could hamper the growth of solar energy by removing a popular financial incentive among consumers. Environmentalists are decrying the measure, arguing that the expansion of rooftop solar is a necessary step in the fight against the climate crisis. The bill was passed in Florida, as another extremely sunny state, California, considered a similar update to its solar policies. “This is a bill that basically erases the only pro-solar policy in Florida,” said Heaven Campbell, state program director of the non-profit Solar United Neighbors. The new legislation in Florida would impact a policy known as net metering, through which solar power users who sell excess energy back to the grid in exchange for a billing credit. If signed into law, HB-741 would cut this incentives for rooftop solar owners, and allow utilities to charge fees that would raise the cost of switching to renewable energy. During the day, solar panels can produce energy beyond what is needed to power a home. Under the current net metering policy, the billing credits earned by solar users are applied to energy used at night or when it’s cloudy. They can also offset costs of installing rooftop solar. The legislation, sponsored by Senator Jennifer Bradley and Representative Lawrence McClure, would allow utility companies to “recover its lost revenues” from customers and, starting 2024, the rate of reimbursement would decline for new solar-panel owners. Critics of the bill warn that it would halt the growth of solar industry in the state and reinforce Florida’s dependency on fossil fuels. Roughly 90,000 customers or about 1% of all customers across the state have rooftop solar. Florida is the second-largest producer of electricity in the nation after Texas, with 75% of its in-state electricity coming from natural gas. Records obtained by Miami Herald and Floodlight reveal that Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) state’s largest power utility, had drafted the bill. FPL’s parent company also made a $10,000 contribution to Sen. Bradley’s political committee, bringing to question the impartiality of this legislation. FPL’s parent company has said that the contribution was not made “with the expectation of favor”. In a statement to the Guardian, FPL wrote: “We’ve been engaged in constructive dialogue with numerous lawmakers regarding this important issue. Ultimately, lawmakers decide the exact language that will be included in a bill.” In response to the Miami Herald and Floodlight’s investigation last year, a spokesperson for FPL said the utility does not oppose net metering, but that “we simply believe rooftop solar customers should pay the full cost of this investment”. Supporters of the bill largely view net-metering as a financial burden to non-solar customers. When introducing the bill on 11 January Bradley argued that under the current policy, people who can’t afford solar panels are subsidizing the cost for those who can. However, filings by FPL and Gulf Power Company show that 67 and 59% of their net metered customers respectively are low-to-moderate income, with most homeowners financing rooftop solar through loans. The bill would require customers with solar to “pay the full cost of electric service” and not be “subsidized by the public utility’s general body of ratepayers”. But with such a small number of rooftop solar owners in the state, critics wonder if this is the case of utility companies claiming a monopoly on solar. “It’s becoming more and more clear that FPL views all solar that happens outside of their control as not just lost revenue, but a lost opportunity for ownership,” Campbell said. FPL has 50 solar farms across the state, and is acquiring more land to install 30m solar panels by 2025. In a statement to the Guardian, FPL wrote: “We believe our customers and our state benefit the most when the largest amount of solar is installed at the lowest cost. Large-scale, universal solar is the fastest, most cost-effective way for us to bring more solar to Florida, while keeping bills low for customers over the long term.” Another potential revision to net metering is underway in California, the nation’s leading solar power state. The state utility commission proposed reducing subsidy rates for rooftop solar and adding a monthly charge for new solar owners. Some environmentalists have supported changes to California’s net metering policy, calling them “cost-effective and equitable”. As is the case in Florida, the California proposal is backed by the state’s utility companies Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. In 2016, following similar net-metering legislation in Nevada, many solar companies ceased their business in the state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/05/uk-householders-face-delays-of-up-to-15-years-for-solar-installations","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T08:20:28Z","webTitle":"UK businesses face delays of up to 15 years for solar installations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/05/uk-householders-face-delays-of-up-to-15-years-for-solar-installations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/05/uk-householders-face-delays-of-up-to-15-years-for-solar-installations","fields":{"headline":"UK businesses face delays of up to 15 years for solar installations","bodyText":"Businesses in the UK are facing waits of up to 15 years for solar installations on their homes due to a lack of grid connectivity, MPs have found. The environmental audit committee, which looks at green policies in government, has said there is a “dark cloud of delays” hindering the country from reaching its potential when it comes to renewable energy. An inquiry by the MPs into solar energy has found that the government’s ambition to install 70GW of solar by 2035 may not happen if these delays continue. It found that in some cases, customers were having to wait 10 to 15 years to secure a connection for solar installations. MPs said there were three key areas where the current approach on grid connection was delaying progress: a lack of physical infrastructure such as cables and transformers; poor availability of data on solar photovoltaic generation, particularly for small-scale installations; and a “queueing system” of applications where developers are applying for grid connections without the project having planning permission. Though the committee said solar energy did not need subsidies due to how cheap it was to generate, it did find that the costs of installation could be prohibitive. MPs recommended the government should consider consulting on how it could facilitate affordable loans for households, and to give a VAT discount to household battery storage. The committee is launching another inquiry into the lack of connectivity in the UK, looking at barriers hindering low-carbon technologies from connecting to the grid. It will also consider the potential for a smarter and more flexible grid that enables dynamic demand management and peer-to-peer electricity trading and storing. The chair of the committee, Philip Dunne, said the delays could stop the UK from reaching net zero emissions by 2050. He said: “There is potential for solar energy to have a bright future in the UK, but a dark cloud of delays for the industry hinders the ability to meet its full potential. Evidence to our committee made clear that the UK has the potential to fulfil the UK’s ambition of 70GW of generating capacity from solar. But sticking points for households around access to finance and VAT being slapped on batteries remain. “The ability for low-carbon energy sources, including solar, to be able to connect to the grid could seriously jeopardise net zero Britain. Our solar inquiry found that some developers wait up to 15 years for a grid connection: this simply isn’t good enough. We must make sure that concerns around infrastructure and planning are addressed swiftly. “Given our committee’s mounting concerns over grid connections for low-carbon energy projects, we are today launching a new inquiry that will consider this in greater detail. I encourage anyone with views on these issues to submit evidence.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/08/indian-coal-magnate-gautam-adani-becomes-asias-richest-person-after-solar-energy-drive","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-08T03:38:10Z","webTitle":"Indian coal magnate Gautam Adani becomes Asia’s richest person after solar energy drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/08/indian-coal-magnate-gautam-adani-becomes-asias-richest-person-after-solar-energy-drive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/08/indian-coal-magnate-gautam-adani-becomes-asias-richest-person-after-solar-energy-drive","fields":{"headline":"Indian coal magnate Gautam Adani becomes Asia’s richest person after solar energy drive","bodyText":"The Indian coal mining tycoon Gautam Adani has become Asia’s richest person thanks to a push into green energy that has boosted his fortune to $88.5bn. Adani has overtaken fellow countryman Mukesh Ambani to enter the top 10 of the world’s richest people, according to figures from Forbes and Bloomberg, after seeing his personal fortune rise by $12bn in the past year. Among the mega-rich whom Adani has leapfrogged to reach the world top 10 are Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who slipped down the table several places last week after losing $30bn of his personal fortune. Although Adani has become the face of big coal around the world with its pursuit of the hugely controversial Carmichael mine project in Australia, the mogul’s ascent into the top echelons of world billionaires is down to his expansion of green investments. His Adani Group controls the port of Mundra, India’s largest, in the mogul’s home state of Gujarat and he also owns 74% of Mumbai international airport. But his push into green energy has paid off handsomely in the past year with the listed company Adani Green Energy now his most valuable after its share price almost doubled in the past 12 months. The group is in the process of ploughing $70bn into green energy projects by 2030 with the aim of becoming the world’s largest renewable-energy producer. Adani found his ambitions dovetailed with those of Indian prime minister and fellow Gujarati, Narendra Modi, who leveraged India’s huge uptake in solar power to map out more ambitious goals for cutting carbon emissions at the Glasgow climate conference in November. India plans to reach a target of 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and that 50% of electricity capacity would come from renewables by the same point. It plans to be net-zero by 2070. Overseas investors in Adani and India’s solar revolution include the French oil company Total, which last year bought 20% of Adani Green Energy. “The Adani Group has spotted and entered all the happening sectors at the right time, which has appealed to a select band of foreign portfolio investors,” Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at Mumbai-based brokerage HDFC Securities Ltd, told Bloomberg. “The sectors are capital-intensive and the company has faced little difficulty in raising funds to expand.” Despite the greener outlook for Adani, the group is still pressing ahead with the giant Queensland mine in the face of fierce resistance from a rainbow coalition of anti-fossil fuel activists, biodiversity conservationists and Indigenous groups. The bitter battle over the mine has seen a succession of on-site protests, legal battles, and the use of a private investigator by the company to secretly photograph the family of activists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2023/may/05/that-one-ive-never-heard-of-africans-unimpressed-with-charles-celebrations","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T10:38:07Z","webTitle":"‘That one I’ve never heard of’: Africans unimpressed with Charles celebrations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/05/that-one-ive-never-heard-of-africans-unimpressed-with-charles-celebrations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/may/05/that-one-ive-never-heard-of-africans-unimpressed-with-charles-celebrations","fields":{"headline":"‘That one I’ve never heard of’: Africans unimpressed with Charles celebrations","bodyText":"On the streets of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, questions about the coronation are met with a blank stare. “That one, I’ve never heard of,” says David Ouma, a 36-year-old taxi driver. There is no buzz or chatter about the coronation of Charles III among the market traders or in the pubs – although it’s likely to make the front page of newspapers at the weekend. “I was thinking of gathering some friends to watch it, but I don’t know if there’ll be interest unless I package it as a catchup,” says Ken Gichinga, 38, an economist. What public interest in the royals there was in the African Commonwealth countries, such as Kenya and Nigeria, has shifted over the past few years as citizens focus on pressing national concerns. But the anointing of the king is likely to reignite debate around Britain’s brutal colonial history, as happened across the Commonwealth after the death of the queen. As he edges his way through rush-hour traffic in the suburb of Kilimani, Uber driver Joseph Njoroge, 45, is confused by the question. “I thought when his mum died he had already become king? I only know him as the heir but don’t know much about his personality.” Anne Macharia, a 43-year-old pharmacist, is also vague on the subject as she lifts her groceries from a trolley into her car at the shopping mall. “I know the coronation is this Saturday. I will watch if time allows. He was prince for a long time so it would be nice to see him get crowned.” But diehard history enthusiast Mark Baraza will be sitting in front of his TV on Saturday. The 30-year-old Kenyan programmer can’t wait to watch the ceremony. “It’s exciting,” he says. “They will be changing monarchs for the first time in more than 70 years. I didn’t witness the last one, so I will definitely be tuning in.” Baraza, a royal watcher, is looking forward to seeing the pomp and pageantry of the day. He has eagerly followed previous royal events, including Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s wedding in 2018, and Prince William and Kate Middleton’s in 2011. He watched Queen Elizabeth’s funeral last year. Her long reign, which began before most African countries gained independence, meant that many Africans learned about her in schools or or had seen her on TV. But the sense of “distant familiarity” with her, among a generation of the African Commonwealth – some Nigerians called her “Mama Charlie”, an affectionate term people on the continent use to refer to their mothers by using the name of a child – does not extend to King Charles. And he may have to deal with a reckoning on this imperial history. When he acceded to the throne last year, the British historian David Olusoga predicted that King Charles would have to navigate “changing attitudes in … the Commonwealth – countries that are collectively home to 2.5 billion people, most of them not white and 60% of them under the age of 29.” South Africans have already begun calling for the UK to return of the world’s largest diamond, the 530-carat Star of Africa, which will be set in a sceptre that will be held by the king on Saturday. For many in the Commonwealth, the diamond symbolises “repression, privileges and colonialism”, says the Conversation, a not-for-profit media website. In his speech to the Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Rwanda in June, the king suggested a change of attitude. To unlock the power of “our common future” he said, “we must also acknowledge the wrongs which have shaped our past. While we strive together for peace, prosperity and democracy I want to acknowledge that the roots of our contemporary association run deep into the most painful period of our history. “I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many, as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery’s enduring impact.” Stanley Arwa, a university student from Kisumu, Kenya, believes interest in the royal family could be rejuvenated. “The younger royals have lived in the era of social media – they can evolve,” says the 23-year-old, who considers the country’s colonial past a distant memory. But it’s not only Britain’s troubled history with much of the continent that has caused consternation. From online discussions among Africans, including in the diaspora, it appears the monarchy took a popularity dive over its treatment of Harry and Meghan, who wore a wedding veil that symbolically featured 53 flowers for the Commonwealth. The couple have made claims of racial bias and press intrusion, while their Netflix documentary made the news in Nigeria and Kenya. The involvement of African artists in King Charles’s coronation celebrations may signal an awareness of the damage that needs repairing. A concert at Windsor Castle on Sunday features the Nigerian singer-songwriter Tiwa Savage and South African opera soprano Pretty Yende. Yende called her invitation to perform “historic” and “generational”, while Savage told the BBC she was eager to “[bring] Afrobeats to Windsor Castle for the first time”. But when Savage announced her performance on Twitter, reactions were divided. Some congratulated her, happy to see African representation at the event, while others were critical, seeing her inclusion as tokenistic and her presence insensitive to Nigeria’s painful colonial past. Baraza remains at least one voice of optimism about the new king. “He has a chance to rebrand the outlook on Britain,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-18T08:00:45Z","webTitle":"Power to the people: the neighbours turning their London street into a solar power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/18/power-to-the-people-the-neighbours-turning-their-london-street-into-a-solar-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Power to the people: the neighbours turning their London street into a solar power station","bodyText":"Lynmouth Road appears unremarkable. It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area, in Walthamstow, northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes, geraniums in boxes, wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words “Power Station” printed in the font used by polling stations. Power, in the sense of the energy, is at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising, with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This year’s Cop27 climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change, yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels. The idea of cleaner power, generated closer to home, should feel like an obvious goal. But, at the moment, there are no large-scale programmes dedicated to making it happen. Instead, there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell. These two are on the roof of their house, sitting on a bed they have just assembled. It is made up with a knitted blanket, bright sheets and a cheap foam mattress that is plastic-wrapped against the elements. Facing one way you can see their narrow back garden that ends when it hits the railway embankment. Turn around and you look down into their street, Lynmouth Road, which Dan and Hilary want to turn into a solar power station. They are living on their roof as a crowdfunder for the project. “I think it will be fine,” says Hilary, who has been scanning both the sky and the weather forecast. “I only get scared when the children say they want to come up, then I turn to jelly.” The couple are artists and filmmakers. They live in the middle of the street, with their children, Esmé, 12, and George, 10, and the family’s two dogs. “It is a street that has a sense of community,” says Hilary, down from the roof and sitting at their kitchen table. “That became apparent with the Covid mutual aid group that was set up.” And it was during lockdown that a sentence from economist Ann Pettifor’s book, The Case for the Green New Deal, which makes a strong argument for total decarbonisation and a financial system based on fairness, struck both of them. The phrase was: “Every building a power station.” “We clung on to that,” says Hilary. There was also People’s Power by American writer Ashley Dawson. “He wrote about energy democracy and tackling the power monopolies within the energy industry,” she adds. The idea started to take shape. Could they make a home into a power station? And not just their home, but perhaps their whole street by linking the houses together into a grid? Buying and installing a solar system for an average three-bedroom house costs around £10,000, they discovered. Linking them together would be hard – the technology is complex, especially in an urban area with lots of individual buildings. They did more research. And then they started talking to neighbours. “Well, if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills, you’d be over the moon, wouldn’t you?” says Ejaz Hussain, 71, now retired. “If it comes off, I’ll know that I’ve been blessed.” Sipke Visser, 45, is a photographer and retoucher. He lives with his wife, their two children and his father-in-law. “I know Dan and Hilary, so I wasn’t that surprised,” he says, “But I do think if a complete stranger were to knock on my door, I would be very sceptical.” “We looked at putting solar panels up quite a few years ago and we found the cost of doing it was too much,” says Pippa Evans, 57, who works at an adoption and fostering therapeutic agency. “So I was intrigued when this flyer came through the letterbox. I wanted to know how it was going to work and if we could afford it. Were Dan and Hilary going to coordinate everything? I knew about their previous project. So I knew they were quite good at making things happen.” The previous project was Bank Job. In 2018, the couple started working in an empty building, a former bank on one of Walthamstow’s main streets. They printed artwork that looked like bank notes, complete with pictures of people from local community projects, and sold them, raising £40,000 in the process. Half the money went back to the local groups. And with the remaining £20,000 they bought up £1.2m worth of high-interest debt owed by people in the local community. “You can buy it for so much less because the assumption is that it won’t be paid off,” says Dan. They let the debtors know there was nothing left to pay, although GDPR rules meant this could only be done by sending letters via a debt broker. Then they packed up the paper records into a gold-coloured van and blew the whole thing up on wasteland outside Canary Wharf, the towers of the UK’s financial sector looming in the background. The documentary they made about the project came out in 2021 and the remains of the van are currently on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They describe Power Station as a natural evolution. “It’s also a show-and-do project,” says Dan. “We’re learning as we go and we’re sharing it as we learn it.” “We’re not setting ourselves up as experts,” adds Hilary. “There isn’t just one solution and we don’t know everything about kilowatts per hour, so we’re a conduit. We’re learning and educating ourselves and others and then also building partnerships with people who are experts.” Their own expertise, they say, is in making a project come to life and then drawing attention to the issues using art and storytelling. As of 2019 there were around 300 community energy projects in the UK covering 67,000 homes, according to the thinktank Green Alliance. The sector was hit when the government’s community energy strategy was scrapped, with at least 66 projects folding in 2017 and more becoming precarious. The initial grand design for Lynmouth Road was for an entire street interlinked, powered for free and managed by a cooperative. But the mixture of rented and private, leasehold and freehold, and various mortgages with various banks meant dropping uniform infrastructure across the rooftops would be almost impossible. “It turns out that not many people fully own their roof,” says Dan. While the whole street can’t be linked now, Dan harbours a dream of making this happen as the project grows and would love to see a community battery so that those who can’t have solar panels could also access power. And with 30 households involved – nearly half the residencies in Lynmouth Road – there is enough for the street to become a solar energy hotspot and model for what other streets could also achieve in terms of renewable power. The project, as it stands, will be funded in various ways. There are grants from organisations, such as the London Community Energy Fund. There’s the crowdfunder, running while Dan and Hilary sleep on top of their house. They have also printed a new run of bank notes to sell, the notes and large handprinting machines currently occupying half of their living room. Buying solar equipment in bulk brings the price down, so participating residents can offer to pay, but the scheme is free for those who need it to be. Each resident will be given a grant for their solar installation and deal with the company directly. As we sit on the bed on the roof, the surveyor from the solar company is finishing his assessments. He climbs the scaffolding at the back of the house to come and chat, although he doesn’t make it all the way up. “It’s a bit ironic, in my line of work, but I’m not great with heights,” he says. Not everyone in the street has wanted or been able to take part. “Some people just shut the door before we started speaking,” says Dan. “Then there were people who were dying or divorcing or moving. Or having a loft conversion.” Loft conversions came up a lot. They can make rooftops unsuitable for solar panels, but the more frequent issue was that of imminent building work. Andy Richford, 70, is one of the people planning a loft conversion. An editorial consultant working in scientific publishing and with a background in ecology, he believes the project will amplify a necessary message. “I’ve been banging on about it for years,” he says. “I might not be able to participate in terms of getting the panels, but making a difference is important to me. Putting solar panels on top of houses, with a direct feed into the house, means energy isn’t lost in transmission and we don’t have the worry of covering acres and acres of farmland or wild land.” The ground on which Lynmouth Road stands was once part of the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. The remaining marsh is less than half a mile away, some of it a Site of Special Scientific Interest and all of it popular with picnickers, dog walkers, runners and the occasional raver. The Lynmouth Road area, says Hilary, who has been looking into its history, was a watercress farm until the houses started going up in 1886. The Victorian era was Walthamstow’s first growth spurt. Boosted by new rail links, the land filled up with houses for workers. It remained a largely working-class area for most of the 20th century, but in the 2000s house prices accelerated andWalthamstow, with its garden terraces, good schools and decent transport links, became a prime location. Between 2012 and 2019, house prices more than doubled. “It used to be full of very long-term residents,” says Hilary. “One family staying in a house for decades. We moved in around 14 years ago and found a newspaper from 1945.” Dan also mentions a former resident, Dorothy Burroughs, who spent her 100 years living on the street, only leaving to briefly enter a care home before her death last year. Dorothy remembered when electricity first came to the houses in the 1930s. “She said that people needed to be shown what to do and how to use appliances. People would come round and demonstrate.” Ejaz Hussain has lived here since 1978. He has worked all of his adult life, including 20 years at a local food processing factory, now demolished to make way for flats. “I’m struggling, although the mortgage is paid. I’ve got two daughters, one at college, one about to go to university. We put them first. But the bills come in and the house needs repairs and I’m on my pension,” he says. Like many of his neighbours, he had also looked at solar panels, but had been unable to afford them. He has also watched the street change around him. “In the early days it was brilliant, simple. You said good morning to your neighbours, they said good morning to you. Then it got that if you said hello, people would give you a funny look.” The Power Station project, he says, has meant the people in the street talk to one another once more. “This is what we want, the community spirit,” he says. “It costs nothing to look after one another.” The collective nature of the scheme has been a draw for many of the residents. “We all have concerns about the environment,” says Chris Humphreys, 49, who works in education and lives with his wife, Catherine, and their two sons. “And you try and do your little thing, but to be part of something bigger is very appealing. You see what’s happening in the news at the moment and you know it won’t be those people who make changes for the better. It’s got to start at the grassroots. I’ve never been especially active politically, but I’m very happy to stand alongside our neighbours in what I think is hopefully a practical and positive solution.” “I want to be part of the solution, even if it’s just a small part,” says Dee Tweedie, 48, who has been involved with the project from the beginning and went door-to-door with Dan and Hilary to explain the idea. “We all want to save the planet and the prices of everything are rising in tandem… energy, food, mortgage. But you don’t always know what you can do when it’s just you and your family. It’s been lovely to meet so many of our neighbours. There’s camaraderie. Maybe that’s how it felt during the war.” “It’s building on the sense of community that started to grow during the pandemic,” says Pippa Evans. “To me, it’s almost as important as the energy. It’s within human nature to be self-centred at times and I think the political climate has encouraged that. But humans are sociable and we’re interdependent and those aspects can be emphasised when we’re working together and helping create something. As a community, we can make bigger changes than as individual people.” “The energy for what we do is drawn from anger, but I don’t think you would necessarily see that as a tone in our films or in our work,” says Dan. “But you wouldn’t see us here, doing all this, if we didn’t feel an intense sense of how absurd our political and social realities are. We’d like to see a kinder world, but we’ve created a system that profits a very narrow minority and so many more people could be living more meaningful and useful lives.” “I can be really angry,” says Hilary. “We live in a society where Matt Hancock can be on celebrity TV and you think, ‘What the fuck is going on? This is sick, it’s like The Hunger Games. And we acquiesce. And the corruption and vandalism of those in charge are just forgotten. At the same time, we can’t be paralysed,” she continues. “I hope this can wake others up and make them realise you can take action, and that the worst thing would be to sit in despair and do nothing.” The Power Station may not be actively producing energy just yet, but it has generated an idea that is already flowing to the rest of the area. Dan and Hilary are working with five local primary schools, including the one their son attends, to arrange funding and installation via the Solar for Schools project. People in neighbouring streets have started asking how they could join in. “We’re busy behind the scenes, working out how it could become a street-by-street model,” says Hilary. “I hope, after the first wave, when there are people sharing testimonials, others will want to be involved, too.” On their wall they have an aerial photograph of the road, with the houses already involved marked by coloured Post-It notes. “I was kind of heartbroken when the obstacles to doing the whole street started to pile up,” says Dan. “But I started to realise it doesn’t really matter. We have 30 households, and more and more people expressing interest. Three nearby streets are starting to organise themselves. And we can share what we’ve learned. You need someone to coordinate, otherwise scheduling the surveys is tough. You need at least 20 people. But you can go from there.” The surveys on Lynmouth Road are just wrapping up. If all goes to plan, the panels will start to go up in January. “I feel like we’ve promised people something and I want everyone to see it’s really happening,” says Hilary. But even without the solar panels, the street has started to change. “When society is organised from the top down, you feel reliant on the government to change things,” says Pippa Evans. “But if you have brave individuals who stand up and gather other people around them… We can stand up for ourselves, we can do things ourselves.” “We can be powerful, us, the people who should be powerless,” says Dan. He is on his rooftop with the street – and the geraniums and cats and wheelie bins – spread out two storeys below. “We do have the power to change things.” For all information on the Power Station, go to power.film.

Jeff Carpoff, the 50-year-old owner of the solar energy company DC Solar, was sentenced on Tuesday. His wife, Paulette Carpoff, 47, faces up to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty at the same time to money laundering and conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States. The couple started DC Solar, based in Benicia, as a legitimate company that made solar generators mounted on trailers, prosecutors said. But the company was later used in an “egregious scheme” to scam its investors, including Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. The Carpoffs used the money to buy and invest in more than 150 luxury cars, 32 properties, a subscription to a private jet service, a semipro baseball team, a Nascar racecar sponsorship and a suite at the new Las Vegas Raiders stadium. The couple has agreed to forfeit more than $120m in assets, including a fleet of collector cars and vacation homes in the Caribbean, Mexico, Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas purchased entirely with cash. Prosecutors said they intend to use the assets in partial restitution to victims of the fraud. The government already auctioned off 148 vehicles, including the 1978 Firebird previously owned by late actor Burt Reynolds, netting more than $8.2m. DC Solar marketed its generators between 2011 and 2018 as being able to provide emergency power for cellphone companies or to provide lighting at sporting and other events. But prosecutors say the owners began telling investors they could benefit from federal tax credits by leasing the generators back to DC Solar, which would then provide them to other companies for their use. In fact, prosecutors say the generators never provided much income, and early investors were paid with funds from later investors. Carpoff and others covered up the scheme with fake financial statements and lease contracts, prosecutors said. They eventually stopped building the mobile generators altogether, and at least half the company’s claimed 17,000 generators didn’t really exist, prosecutors said. Instead, they said Carpoff and others said the generators were in locations where they did not really exist. They traded identification number stickers on generators that had been constructed previously. And they hoodwinked investors during equipment inspections. “He claimed to be an innovator in alternative energy, but he was really just stealing money from investors and costing the American taxpayer hundreds of millions in tax credits,” Talbert said. The company was involved in $2.5bn in investment transactions between 2011 and 2018, costing investors $1bn, prosecutors said earlier. Among the investors was Berkshire Hathaway, which lost about $340m. The case represents the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the federal court district that covers inland northern California, according to acting US attorney Phillip Talbert. “Carpoff’s egregious scheme fueled his rapacious desire for luxury and prominence with showy, public expenditures,” said Sean Ragan, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Sacramento field office. Aside from the Carpoffs, five others have pleaded guilty to related offenses and are awaiting sentencing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-08T15:00:42Z","webTitle":"Stoke-on-Trent residents to sue council over ‘mis-sold’ solar power contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/08/stoke-on-trent-residents-class-action-lawsuit-council-mis-sold-solar-power-contracts","fields":{"headline":"Stoke-on-Trent residents to sue council over ‘mis-sold’ solar power contracts","bodyText":"More than 230 residents in Stoke-on-Trent are to launch a class action lawsuit against the city council after they claim they were “mis-sold” 25-year solar power contracts which have left some with faulty panels and unexpected bills. Council house tenants in the city said they feel “lied to” after being signed up to the contracts without realising, and facing years of what they believe is poor quality customer service and installation. Community Energy Scheme (CES) was launched in 2018 by the city council in conjunction with Solarplicity Energy, which sent staff door to door to encourage residents to sign up to the solar panel scheme. It now has 4,800 customers in the city. Tenants signed up to contracts on the spot with a signature on an iPad, but many residents said they thought they were only agreeing to have their home assessed for its suitability for solar panel installation. Cassandra Burton, 50, has lived in her three-bedroom semi-detached council property for 15 years, and was alone at home when someone from CES came. “I thought it was for them to do a survey on the property, check the roof basically. I signed the iPad and that was it, I never heard anything else from them,” she said. “I had no idea I’d signed up to a 25-year contract until we read a story in the newspaper about them.” She later found out her digital signature had been copied on to three separate documents. “I’m autistic, I was by myself, I didn’t have my partner with me, I just thought it was a council thing. I feel like they took advantage,” said Burton, adding that her solar panels were never hooked up to her electricity supply but she still received bills. “It’s a constant stress. Every single day I’m on the CES community group on Facebook to check what’s happening, what the latest advice is. I won’t let anybody in my house now,” she said. “Who doesn’t want more renewable energy? Who doesn’t want to help the Earth be a better place? But it makes me really angry.” Bibby Thomas, 58, said she specifically asked the salesperson to explain what she was signing when he came to her door in 2019. “He gave me this iPad, and I said: ‘I’m dyslexic, so I can’t read the whole lot. I’m not signing anything that shouldn’t be signing, am I?’ He said no, everything was fine, so I did a squiggle on it.” She claims no one mentioned a 25-year contract. A number of residents are to launch a class action lawsuit against the council and CES over how the scheme was sold to them. In response to concern expressed by customers, CES said they were given the option to keep their existing contract, swap to an updated contract with more user-friendly language and terms, or exit the agreement and switch back to receiving all of their electricity from the grid. The company insists the fact the agreements were for 25 years was stated on the CES website, literature, contracts and by sales teams, and that all tenants received a letter from the council explaining the scheme before being signed up. It also said the majority of tenants received a verification call to check they had been given the information. The Conservative-run Stoke-on-Trent city council gave Solarplicity Energy exclusive rights to install the panels on its housing stock, initially handing over the details of more than 1,000 homes it thought would be suitable, in return for £100 for each installation. Solar panels were also installed on empty council house properties, meaning prospective tenants had to sign up to the solar energy scheme as a condition of tenancy. The Stoke-on-Trent Labour councillor Desiree Elliott said the scheme had been “a failure and a scandal from the beginning”. She said: “The company involved has demonstrated time and again that it is not up to delivering a project of this size with any semblance of professionalism.” Residents said they were promised the solar panels would come with batteries, allowing them to store surplus solar energy to use in the evenings and on darker days, but these have only recently started being rolled out. CES said 200 tenant properties have had batteries installed since 2020. In 2019 Solarplicity Energy ceased trading after criticism from Ofgem and the Energy Ombudsman, who received 3,324 complaints about the company, and tenants have been switched to a different supplier, while still remaining part of the 25-year CES contracts. A Stoke-on-Trent city council spokesperson said the scheme was designed to support tenants “in lowering their energy bills and reducing carbon emissions”. “Supporting households to generate more sustainable, cheaper and greener energy is even more significant given the considerable rises in energy prices this winter. It is clearly not appropriate to comment any further on a matter that is subject to legal proceedings.” A spokesperson for CES said: “We have worked hard to get sustainable and affordable energy to those who would otherwise completely miss out. We’ve listened to concerns raised about the accessibility of language used in our contracts, and we’ve offered tenants the opportunity to make their own choice about how the solar energy being generated on their home is used. “We remain committed to making access to solar as easy and beneficial as possible, and tenants are welcome to contact us if we can provide them with any support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/apr/29/barcelona-installs-spains-first-solar-energy-pavement","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-29T15:19:04Z","webTitle":"Barcelona installs Spain’s first solar energy pavement ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/29/barcelona-installs-spains-first-solar-energy-pavement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/apr/29/barcelona-installs-spains-first-solar-energy-pavement","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona installs Spain’s first solar energy pavement ","bodyText":"Barcelona city council has installed Spain’s first photovoltaic pavement as part of the city’s drive to become carbon neutral by 2050. The 50 sq metres of non-slip solar panels, installed in a small park in the Glòries area of the city, will generate 7,560kWh a year, enough to supply three households. The city has contributed €30,000 (£26,000) towards the cost, the remainder being met by the manufacturer, Platio Solar. The viability of the scheme will be assessed after six months. “We’ll have to assess the wear and tear because obviously it’s not the same as putting panels on a roof, although they are highly resistant,” says Eloi Badia, who is responsible for climate emergency and ecological transition at Barcelona city council. “As for cost benefits, with a pilot scheme like this it’s difficult to know yet how much cheaper it would be if it were scaled up. We’re keen to install more on roofs and, if this scheme is successful, on the ground, to power lighting and other public facilities.” However, he points out that Barcelona’s high population density means it would be difficult to generate enough electricity within the city limits to become self-sufficient. “If we’re going to reach a target of zero emissions, we’re going to have to think about supplying electricity to blocks of flats, but we’ll also have to think of using wind and solar parks outside the city,” Badia says. “But installations on the ground like this open up new possibilities, and not just for Barcelona.” The Barcelona scheme follows the installation of a 25-metre stretch of solar cycle lane in the Dutch city of Utrecht last year. The electricity generated is used to power lighting and also heat the path in winter to prevent it from icing over. Most of Spain’s solar power comes from large farms in remote areas where land is cheap but which are a long way from centres of population. The move now is to increase capacity close to where it’s most needed, in cities. “What we need to focus on is green policies to create employment, specifically to install solar panels on 1m rooftops,” says Fernando Prieto, executive director of the independent think tank Sustainability Observatory. “This would take five years, generate enough electricity for 7.5 million people, create over 15,000 jobs and cut CO2 emissions by 4.2m tonnes.” He adds that it would lower the price of electricity and help citizens to become independent of the few power companies that dominate the industry. “However, instead of this simple project, we are building installations of over 1,000 hectares on agricultural land and woodland, often with a negative impact on the environment,” Prieto says. Under the previous conservative government solar installation came to an abrupt halt after punitive taxes were introduced. In 2018, the incoming socialist coalition scrapped the tax, triggering a boom in solar, with Spain now ranked 11th in the world for solar power and eighth for renewables overall. Major retailers have got in on the act and now firms such as Ikea, electronics giant Media Markt and the department store El Corte Inglés are offering domestic solar installations at an average cost of €5,000 for a three-bedroom house. Meanwhile, the government has announced plans to invest €1.5bn of EU Covid-recovery funds in the production of “green” hydrogen, using renewable energy to break up water molecules and release the hydrogen. Spain’s energy companies have said they will raise this to €8.3bn by 2030. • This article was amended on 30 April 2021. An earlier version referred to 7,560kW a year, when kWh was intended.

The company will also operate the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, which has plans to generate up to 26GW of wind and solar energy – about a third of the electricity generated in Australia today. Areh is in its early stages, but once complete – a task that will require up to US$30bn in funding – its backers expect it to be capable of producing 1.6m of “green hydrogen” from renewable sources a year. No financial details of the deal were announced, with a BP spokesperson saying the amount invested was commercial in confidence. However, market sources said that because Areh was at an early stage it was currently worth less than $100m. BP and other investors in the project – InterContinental Energy, CWP Global and Macquarie Group – are betting on a rapid increase in demand for renewable energy. Iron ore mining in the Pilbara is energy intensive and generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions, which big miners including BHP and Rio Tinto are keen to reduce. However, Areh is also designed to export hydrogen to customers overseas. BP predicts that at full capacity the Areh would be able to abate 17m tonnes of carbon a year. The company’s executive vice-president of gas and low carbon energy, Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, said Areh could become a “cornerstone project”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Areh is set to be one of the largest renewable and green hydrogen energy hubs in the world and can make a significant contribution to Australia and the wider Asia Pacific region’s energy transition,” she said. “It truly reflects what integrated energy is – combining solar and onshore wind power with hydrogen production and using it to help transform sectors and regions. “It also reflects our belief that Australia has the potential to be a powerhouse in the global energy transition, benefiting from both its existing infrastructure and abundant renewable energy resources.” Areh’s existing backers will continue to own a stake in the project, with InterContinental Energy holding 26.4%, CWP Global 17.8% and Macquarie 15.3%. CWP Global’s chief executive, Alex Hewitt, said BP would bring “a new level of engineering knowhow and technical expertise” in developing complex projects in remote locations. “At full capacity, Areh will require upwards of US$30B in project finance,” he said. “The race to green energy is on. Recent months have demonstrated the uncertainty and disruption that comes with over-reliance on fossil fuels. “Green hydrogen is a critical pathway for enhancing energy security and decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, like mining, steel-making and long-range shipping.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/26/number-of-uk-homes-installing-rooftop-solar-panels-highest-in-over-seven-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-26T16:54:37Z","webTitle":"Number of UK homes installing rooftop solar panels highest in over seven years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/26/number-of-uk-homes-installing-rooftop-solar-panels-highest-in-over-seven-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/26/number-of-uk-homes-installing-rooftop-solar-panels-highest-in-over-seven-years","fields":{"headline":"Number of UK homes installing rooftop solar panels highest in over seven years","bodyText":"The number of households installing rooftop solar panels reached its highest level in more than seven years in the first months of 2023 as energy-bill payers turned to renewable energy to guard against spiralling costs. Industry figures show that more than 50,700 households installed arrays between January and March, more than double the number in the same months last year and the highest figure since late 2015. The rooftop solar panels installed in the first quarter between them account for 265 megawatts of power, or half that of a typical coal-fired unit. Gareth Simkins, a spokesman for Solar Energy UK, said the number of installations has climbed steadily in recent years as households have become increasingly aware of the benefit to household bills and concerned about the environment. “In the last year, solar installations have been driven by the energy crisis. The war in Ukraine has driven energy bills higher and there has been a greater awareness that solar panels can help to save on costs,” he said. The competition watchdog launched an investigation last year into the domestic green power and insulation industry over concerns that households were not being treated fairly as they scrambled to cut energy bills. The Competition and Markets Authority said it was “concerned about the potential for poor practices, such as making misleading claims about potential cost savings, product performance and suitability”. The boom in new rooftop solar units, recorded by installers registered to the UK’s micro-generation certification scheme (MCS), was also more than double the number of installations reported during the first quarter of 2019, which marked the end of the government’s Feed-in Tariff (FiT) subsidy scheme. Solar installations reached a peak in late 2015 as households rushed to take advantage of lucrative government payments through the FiT scheme, which were cut by 65% from early 2016. The scheme was closed entirely in 2019. The Labour party accused the government of “actively dismantling” the UK’s solar industry after its decision to close the scheme without a replacement led to a collapse in installations and caused many smaller firms to go bust. Despite the recent boom, only 4.4% of the UK’s electricity is generated from solar, compared with 35.9% from gas and 23.3% from wind, according to figures from National Grid. The MCS gathers data from certified installers of rooftop solar panels, home batteries and heat pumps. It recorded its highest number of home batteries for the quarter with 351 systems installed, half the total number of installations by accredited installers to date. The actual figures for the installation of rooftop solar panels and batteries are likely to be higher than the MCS tally, which does not include work undertaken by unaccredited installers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/dec/19/thurrock-latest-council-declare-effective-bankruptcy","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-19T17:34:53Z","webTitle":"Thurrock becomes latest council to declare effective bankruptcy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/dec/19/thurrock-latest-council-declare-effective-bankruptcy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/dec/19/thurrock-latest-council-declare-effective-bankruptcy","fields":{"headline":"Thurrock becomes latest council to declare effective bankruptcy","bodyText":"Thurrock council has become the latest local authority to formally declare effective bankruptcy, as it grapples with a £500m deficit caused by a series of disastrous investments in risky commercial projects. The Conservative-run council in Essex admitted three weeks ago that it faces big cuts and job losses after revealing it had lost £275m on investments it made in solar energy and other businesses, and has set aside a further £130m this year to pay back investment debts. It is to approach the government for a financial bailout, saying it will not be able to meet its legal duty to balance the books over the next few months. The council will meet in the new year to discuss how it will manage its deficit. Thurrock becomes the fourth council to issue a section 114 “bankruptcy” notice in recent years, after Northamptonshire county council, Croydon, and Slough. Several other authorities have warned they are also struggling to balance the books. A section 114 notice, seen as the last resort for financially struggling councils, requires the authority to stop all but the essential spending needed to provide vital services, pay staff and meet its legal duties, while it works out a way of stabilising its finances. Mark Coxshall, the leader of Thurrock council, said: “Residents and staff should feel safe knowing that our street lights are still shining, our roads are continuing to be gritted during bad weather, and our most vulnerable friends and family are being looked after. “They can also be reassured that under my leadership we have started to grip our situation and have a clear sight of what needs to be done. The section 114 notice is a clear indication we are on the road to recovery. “I have already made it clear as the incoming leader that I have been shocked by the position the council is in and we do not take lightly the seriousness of the step we are being asked to take today.” However, the scale of the crisis in Thurrock has stunned the wider local government world, after revelations by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism showed that senior council officials had ignored warnings from financial experts over the “unprecedented risks” it was taking with public money. Thurrock had become one of the most indebted of all English local authorities in recent years after borrowing £1.5bn cheaply from the Treasury and fellow local authorities – 10 times its annual spending on local services – to enable a string of investments in solar energy and other businesses. It has been run on a day-to-day basis by government-appointed commissioners since September after ministers first became alarmed at the exceptional levels of debt and risk incurred by the council. John Kent, the leader of Thurrock’s Labour opposition, said: “The formal issuing of Thurrock council’s section 114 notice – the local government equivalent of bankruptcy – was, sadly, inevitable. For years, we have been warning about the possible consequences of the Conservatives’ disastrous financial mismanagement, but time and again we were laughed at, fobbed off and misled. “The suggestion that a section 114 notice is somehow good news – a ‘clear indication that we are on the road to recovery’ or merely a procedural step – is frankly insulting to the many council staff who will be fearing for their jobs, to vulnerable people fearing for the services they rely on and to all of us who will be paying the price for the Conservatives’ disastrous financial mismanagement of Thurrock council for decades to come.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-30T06:35:19Z","webTitle":"‘It’s got nasty’: the battle to build the US’s biggest solar power farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s got nasty’: the battle to build the US’s biggest solar power farm","bodyText":"When proposals for the largest solar plant ever conceived for US soil started to gather pace – a plan that involves spearing several million solar panels into the flat farmland of northern Indiana – something in Connie Ehrlich seems to have snapped. Ehrlich, 63, is part of a longstanding farming family in Pulaski county, the site of the new solar project, but doesn’t live in the county and previously only rarely dabbled in its usually somnolent local politics. She has carved out a comfortable life in a sprawling mansion set on 10 acres (four hectares) of land, just outside the city of Lafayette, and is known locally for her donations to medical research and her small fleet of deluxe cars with personalized license plates. But to Ehrlich the idea of transferring 13,000 acres of prized farmland to solar energy production seems to have been so unthinkable that it demanded an extraordinary response. Within months of the project being proposed she had mobilized her wealth to fund a flurry of lawsuits, spearheaded a sometimes-vituperative pressure group and spent $3m buying new plots of land, including a cemetery, on the fringes of the project. Ehrlich even acquired an office nextdoor to the solar developer’s own premises – and in its window a cartoon has been placed showing Joe Biden shoveling cash into the mouths of solar developers, depicted as pigs in a sty. The solar farm, which could have its goal of completion next year delayed because of the lawsuits, has stirred up strong feelings among some in Pulaski. “It’s got nasty, really nasty,” said Derrick Stalbaum, a hog farmer who also acts as president of the county’s board of zoning appeals. “It’s surprising as we live in a quiet area with a huge sense of community usually.” The opponents of the solar project, a $1.5bn venture appropriately called Mammoth that is set to span an area almost as large as Manhattan, say they are defying an egregious assault on time-honored farming traditions and are standing up to a newcomer that threatens to warp their pastoral way of life with Chinese-made technology. “We need to protect America’s farmland,” Ehrlich wrote in a February post for the Pulaski County Against Solar group’s Facebook page. “Not only from being sacrificed for the inefficient, unreliable energy generation, but from foreigners’ interest!” The ongoing fight is a sobering reminder of how Biden’s ambitions for a mass transition to renewables, aimed at averting the worst ravages of the climate crisis, will in significant part be decided by the vagaries and veto points of thousands of local officials, county boards and Connie Ehrlich-style opposition across the US. Localized battles over new solar projects threaten to proliferate as the industry, buoyed up by the huge tax credits available for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act, seeks to expand. Over the past year, solar projects in Ohio, Kentucky and Nevada have all been delayed or sunk by irked local people. Ordinances restricting solar, wind and other renewable energy facilities have been passed in 31 states. The prospect of solar energy projects occupying a chunk of American land has stirred unease among farmers, and even among some environmentalists, that valuable forests, wetlands and fertile soils may be sacrificed. If the US really is to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050, researchers at Princeton University have estimated that solar production could have to grow more than 20-fold, occupying an area that, put together, would be equivalent to the size of West Virginia. “We are absolutely seeing local opposition to solar arrays across the US,” said Samantha Levy, climate policy manager at American Farmland Trust. “About half of solar development is going on the best, most productive farmland and that is causing some concern because it’s not like we are making more land. We need to have a smart solar buildout and not hollow out these farming communities.” But for developers, the challenges posed by opponents such as Ehrlich are infuriating. “It’s just throw spaghetti and see what sticks,” said Nick Cohen, chief executive of Doral Renewables, the Israeli-founded developer behind the Mammoth project in Indiana. “It only takes one person to file a lawsuit and this feels like a one-person crusade to burn down the town.” Cohen said his dealings with Ehrlich have been “civil but direct” and that Doral holds out hope of being an amiable neighbor to its foe. The project won’t fell trees or disturb any fragile ecosystem, he pointed out. “If people have real concerns we can work it out,” Cohen said. “But the conduct here is so irrational and perplexing. Connie and [a] small group of followers are working against the best interests of the entire community.” The episode is also a demonstration of how an era of toxic politics and vicious online vitriol can quickly sour a community like Pulaski. Some people have left their church because of arguments with other congregants over the solar plant, while even family members have been at odds with one another. Stalbaum, the head of the board of zoning appeals, said while most people in the county are either supportive or apathetic about Mammoth, a faction of people are so outraged they have taken to following and videoing him and other members of the board, or idling in cars outside their homes. Anonymous phone calls, meanwhile, were made to a school where Stalbaum was previously a teacher to cryptically warn that he was not suited to be around children, he said. On Facebook, supporters of the project have been called “roaches” and “traitors” and, in one instance, seemingly compared to Adolf Hitler. “I can only imagine how intimidating he is around children!!” one poster wrote about Stalbaum. “This is no longer really about the solar applications; it’s more about driving the community apart,” said Stalbaum. “I have been attacked pretty hard for this, simply because this project meets our county requirements.” Much of the debate in Pulaski county about solar has become entangled in national resentments, with several unprompted attacks on Biden in public hearings for supposedly forcing through the Green New Deal, or for allowing Mexican immigrants to somehow take precious farmland along with the solar developers. In Pulaski, a county where Donald Trump outperformed Biden four to one in the 2020 election, flags hanging outside homes declaring “Let’s Go Brandon” and, less euphemistically, “Fuck Biden” are commonplace. *** Pulaski county appears to be an otherwise unassuming location for what will be one of the largest solar projects in the world. A rectangular slice of agricultural northern Indiana, Pulaski is home to about 12,000 people, a number that is declining, and a lot of corn. Peppermint is grown here, too, and sold to the Wrigley Company for gum flavoring. A ripple of excitement was felt in nearby Fulton county in 1978 when the partial skeleton of a hulking mastodon was discovered in a drainage ditch, exquisitely preserved in peat. It was this 10,000-year-old specimen that would give the Mammoth project its name, although Doral was more excited by quirks of infrastructure and geology – the area has flat, sandy ground ideal for solar and is a meeting point for two vast electrical grids, called MISO and PJM, that service tens of millions of Americans and will allow Mammoth to dump converted sunlight into both of them for consumption. In July 2019, Cohen was introduced to a farmer named Norm Welker. Welker’s land, Cohen said, was “right on the bullseye, exactly where you’d want to be.” Transmission lines run through Welker’s fields in Starke county and, crucially, Welker himself has been unsentimental about turning away from half a century of planting and harvesting corn on this land. “You couldn’t dream of a better project for us,” said Welker, a 62-year-old who has a short, clipped moustache and is almost more enthused by the idea of solar than the developers themselves. The money helps, of course – Welker’s 1,075 acres in Starke county will be leased for the next three decades at $1,000 an acre a year. “It’s five times what I’d make through corn,” he said. “It’s crazy money.” Construction began on Welker’s land earlier this year and a grid-like pattern of pilings driven into the soil is already in place. Long steel tubes are placed horizontally upon the pilings, with brackets on top to affix the solar panels, which are awaiting clearance for import from Malaysia. Wiring dangles from some of these poles, and cables lie in partly dug trenches, ready to connect the output to an inverter which will then help propel electrons into the grid. The panels will automatically rotate east to west, chasing the sun throughout the day, shaking off snow in the winter. But the whole system is fairly simple to slot together and is shorter than the serried ears of corn Welker would normally grow here. “It’s so passive, I mean, it’s even more benign than wind,” said Kevin Parzyck, a senior project manager for Doral. A few years ago, officials in Pulaski rejected an application to build wind turbines in the county. “With wind you’re actually spinning a generator,” Parzyck said. “The crickets make more noise than these solar panels do.” To Welker, solar is an evolution of farming rather than a betrayal of it. He already harvests the sunlight for his crops, he reasons, and considers fears of food shortages by taking land out of production overblown given that 40% of all US corn is already mashed up for another form of energy – ethanol, which is added to gasoline. Farmers are also routinely paid by the federal government to keep tracts of land free from crops, in order to bolster the price of corn. The rows of nodding metal and glass will contrast with the surrounding fields of corn, but it’s a moot point as to whether they are more unnatural or harmful to the surrounds. Wild grasses and wildflowers are springing up around the metal pilings, bringing back insect life to a landscape that is typically bombarded by pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. America’s corn belt, which stretches from Indiana to Nebraska, produces a fifth of the world’s maize, a stunning feat of agricultural might that has deforested large areas, stripped away topsoil and made the land, by one measure, 48 times more toxic than it was 25 years ago. “I’m gonna retire, I’m gonna restore habitats – it’s likely there’ll never be a cornfield here ever again,” said Welker. He has a further 500 acres in Pulaski county he hopes to give over to solar, too, but there he faces the tenacious obstacle of Ehrlich, whom he knew as a neighbor when she went to community college in Indianapolis and then married Donald “Jerry” Ehrlich, founder of the Wabash trucking company. Now the relationship is somewhat strained. “It blows my mind! It’s my farm – why do I need my neighbor’s permission to do this?” Welker asked, suddenly enraged. “I’m not doing any harm to you. What’s the deal with this woman? These people are nitwits.” The Guardian made multiple requests to Ehrlich and her lawyer for comment. There was no response to these requests. The Mammoth project – which will generate 1.3 gigawatts of renewable energy, enough to power more than 200,000 households annually in coal-dependent Indiana – is split into three distinct areas encompassing dozens of landowners, which looks on a map like a collection of Jenga blocks scattered on to the landscape. Two of these areas are in Pulaski, which has a county ordinance that requires special hearings to consider changing the use of land for solar. This opportunity to stymie the project was seized upon by Ehrlich and her group. The first hearing – by the county’s board of zoning appeals, a five-member body that issues typically mundane decisions about land use – in July 2020 was eagerly anticipated. Outside, people livestreamed proceedings via their phones and speakers were set up so the overflow crowd could listen in. Inside, Stalbaum tried to maintain a sense of order. A procession of local residents stepped up to speak at the microphone, the supporters of solar stressing it would help sustain farms for future generations and raise vital tax revenue for ailing public services. Opponents, meanwhile, were more pointed, often invoking a divine plan for this land and taking aim at local officials who would stray from this. “I don’t want my back yard to be a guinea pig!” exclaimed Riley Cervenka Tiede, Ehrlich’s niece, a recording of the meeting shows. “As a farmer I take great pride in the beautiful land that God has blessed us with and believe it should stay to be used to grow crops.” Tiede warned that property values would decline if solar arrived – there is somewhat threadbare evidence of this – and raised the spectre of a disastrous fire. On the Facebook streamed comments, people pondered if birds and plants would be fried by the glare from the panels, perhaps in response to a different, and unusual, type of solar farm in California that caused some birds to spontaneously combust after flying into its beams of concentrated sunlight. “Firefighters, police, please stand up,” Tiede implored, as applause thundered for the first responders. “Their lives are more important than a few landowners getting money!” When Nathan Origer, head of community development for Pulaski, attempted to explain that revenue from Mammoth could be used to help lower taxes for landowners – Mammoth will plow about $1.5m a year into Pulaski’s coffers, about a fifth of the county’s revenues from income tax – a man off camera shouted, “You’re full of shit!” Mark Cervenka, Ehrlich’s brother who farms land in Pulaski, said locals had been ambushed by a “disturbing, frightening and disgusting” solar plan. “I’m a farmer and always will be. I believe the land should be used the way God intended it to be,” he added. Things get so heated at one point a woman stormed toward the board members and started shouting indecipherably at them while holding up her phone. Stalbaum asked two burly sheriff’s deputies to remove her and muttered, “You’re not helping your cause here.” The board voted unanimously to allow a special exception for the solar project in the wake of the gathering, although with conditions, pushed for by Ehrlich and allied local resident Jennifer Knebel, that new trees will block the sight of the solar panels, noise will be kept to a minimum and wide buffer areas of open land will be kept at the project boundaries. Just 20% of the project area will be covered by the actual solar panels, which are disparagingly called a “sea of black glass” by opponents. Ehrlich has not been sated by this partial victory. According to Knebel, the group has spent “hundreds of hours” pondering the issue, usually coming to hearings with reams of notes to read out. Doral has had to muster a cadre of experts to counter claims the silicon and aluminum panels will give off deadly radiation, or that they will kill sandhill cranes by blinding them or will leach poison into the soil. “I feel like they got just about everything they could get apart from outright banning solar,” said Origer. “But whatever everyone did, it wasn’t enough. I have to conclude that it is at least partially an ideological thing. Ms Ehrlich simply doesn’t think that solar is good.” In a flurry of online posts, op-eds and speeches, Ehrlich has claimed solar developers “prey upon financially struggling counties”, questioned the efficacy of renewable energy and complained that the energy generated won’t be used by the county itself, a striking protest given Pulaski farmers’ routine sale of corn to be consumed across the US. “How can some landowners believe they have the right to do whatever they want with their land while destroying someone else’s property and quality of life?” Ehrlich posted in July last year on her group’s Facebook page. Public records show that Ehrlich has spent about $3m to buy three plots of land in Pulaski since 2020, including a cemetery near the town of Francesville. Some of the land is within a mile of the planned Mammoth project. Meanwhile, Ehrlich and eight other complainants have filed lawsuits to try to overturn the approval of the land use, dispute a tax abatement given to Doral and stop the county’s subsequent move to make it easier for developers to set up in Pulaski county. In September, Ehrlich got some reward for her efforts – the Indiana court of appeals ruled that Mammoth had not submitted a complete application for the project’s zoning. The state supreme court may now be called upon for further judgment, although the developers do not expect to be halted by what they frame as an administrative redo. “It doesn’t make much sense to me that she would purchase land for very high prices in the neighborhood if she thinks property prices will go down because of the project,” said Cohen. “She hasn’t been willing to compromise to discuss a mutual solution. All of the millions of dollars we are spending on lawsuits, that could’ve been put into the community. There’s nothing I would like more than to have them as our friends.” A detente doesn’t appear likely, however, if you take a trip to Doral’s project headquarters in Winamac, a small town that is Pulaski’s county seat. On the main road into Winamac is a huge billboard that reads “No to industrial solar” and, once you get to the Doral office, the opposition is hard for the developers to ignore. Ehrlich spent $100,000 on a former cigar store, public records show, that is a footstep from Doral’s own office. The windows are plastered with anti-solar posters, including the cartoon of Biden shoveling cash into the mouths of solar developers depicted as pigs. “Protesting – that’s Connie’s job,” said Welker, as he looked at the strange juxtaposition of the two offices. “Nick and I stopped in one time and tried to have peace talks, but she’s just, ‘No. I’m here to save Pulaski county from solar panels.’ That’s her job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/first-thing-us-debt-ceiling-talks-productive-as-biden-and-mccarthy-to-meet","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T08:59:13Z","webTitle":"US debt ceiling talks ‘productive’ as Biden and McCarthy to meet | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/first-thing-us-debt-ceiling-talks-productive-as-biden-and-mccarthy-to-meet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/first-thing-us-debt-ceiling-talks-productive-as-biden-and-mccarthy-to-meet","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: US debt ceiling talks ‘productive’ as Biden and McCarthy to meet","bodyText":"Good morning. Joe Biden and the House Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, have held a “productive” phone call on the continued impasse over the debt ceiling and promised to meet today after the president returned to Washington. McCarthy, speaking to reporters after the call, said there were positive discussions on solving the crisis and that staff-level talks were set to resume later on Sunday. Asked if he was more hopeful after talking to the president, McCarthy said: “Our teams are talking today and we’re … meeting tomorrow. That’s better than it was earlier. So, yes.” Biden, who arrived back at the White House late yesterday evening after his trip to Japan, said the call with McCarthy had gone well. “We’ll talk tomorrow,” he added. Speaking from the G7 summit in Japan on Sunday, Biden said he would be willing to cut spending together with tax adjustments to reach a deal, but that the latest offer from Republicans on the ceiling was “unacceptable”. What will happen if a deal isn’t struck? Less than two weeks remain until the 1 June deadline, upon which the Treasury department has said the federal government could be unable to pay all its debts. Without raising the debt limit, the US government will default on its bills, a historic first, with likely catastrophic consequences. Federal workers would be furloughed, global stock markets would crash and the US economy would probably drop into a recession. US and Papua New Guinea sign security agreement amid Pacific militarisation concerns The US has signed a new security pact with Papua New Guinea amid concerns inside the country about increasing militarisation as the US competes with China for influence in the Pacific. The state department said the agreement would provide $45m to help improve security cooperation, including protective equipment for the PNG defence force, plus help in mitigating the effects of climate change, tackling transnational crime and HIV/Aids. But a draft copy of the defence cooperation agreement leaked last week sparked concern in PNG about the extent of US military involvement in the country, with reports it gives US personnel and contractors legal immunity, allows aircraft, vehicles and vessels operated by or on behalf of the US to move freely within its territory and territorial waters and exempts US staff from all migration requirements. Students at several universities have held protests at campuses against the signing of the agreement, amid concern it would upset China. What has PNG’s prime minister said? James Marape denied that US staff would have legal immunity and said no amendments would be made to the constitution or laws of the country. He said the country faced significant security challenges. “I need to strengthen and protect my country’s borders and ensure the safety of my people,” he said. “So this has nothing to do with geopolitics, this cooperation will strengthen our defence and help build our capacity.” Bakhmut remains ‘epicentre’ of combat, Ukraine’s armed forces say Fighting is continuing in Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update, after Russia claimed to have completed the “liberation” of the eastern city over the weekend. Ukrainian officials rejected the claims. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russian forces had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Russia had also carried out airstrikes on Bakhmut. It has been impossible to verify the conflicting statements over the devastated city, which has assumed symbolic importance as a measure of which side has the resilience to prevail in the war overall. Confusion has reigned over the situation in Bakhmut after the Russian claim, which cannot be verified independently. Ukrainian officials said they still had a foothold in the city and were encircling it, while the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said at a G7 summit in Hiroshima on Sunday: “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of this.” What else happened at the G7 summit? The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not meet at the G7 summit. Lula da Silva said he was “upset” they did not manage to meet, adding his Ukrainian counterpart seemed uninterested in negotiating peace with Russia. Why is China upset? Beijing has accused the G7 nations of collaborating to “smear and attack” China, after the weekend summit issued a communique that warned Beijing over its “militarisation activities” in the Asia-Pacific region. After the summit, China summoned the Japanese ambassador to register an official protest, and warned the UK to stop “slandering” the country to avoid further damage to bilateral relations.

Climate check: How solar farms took over the California desert: ‘An oasis has become a dead sea’ Deep in the Mojave desert, a sparkling blue sea shimmers on the horizon. Visible from the I-10 highway, it is an improbable sight: a deep blue slick stretching for miles across the Chuckwalla Valley, forming an endless glistening mirror. But something’s not quite right. Closer up, the water’s edge appears pixelated, with the look of a low-res computer rendering, like frozen waves. Over the last few years, this swathe of desert has been steadily carpeted with one of the world’s largest concentrations of solar power plants, forming a sprawling photovoltaic sea. On the ground, the scale is almost incomprehensible. The Riverside East Solar Energy Zone – the ground zero of California’s solar energy boom – stretches for 150,000 acres, making it 10 times the size of Manhattan.

Last Thing: Couple who helped Koreans stranded in US blizzard feted as heroes in Seoul A US husband and wife who sheltered 10 South Korean travelers in their home during a deadly snowstorm last Christmas have gone to Seoul and been feted as heroes. Alexander and Andrea Campagna went to South Korea’s capital as part of a 10-day tour of the city organized as a token of gratitude for the husband and wife who opened up their home in Buffalo, New York, to strangers in need. “To see everyone in Korea again is such a blessing,” Andrea Campagna, 43, told reporters in Seoul in reference to those whom she and her husband aided. “They ended up in the right place at the right time. Now we have people we can call friends for a lifetime.” The blizzard on 23 December that brought together the Campagnas and their newfound Korean friends was brutal. Officials said more than 22in of snow fell in Buffalo that day, and 40 people died for reasons linked to the blizzard, which the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, memorably described as “a war with Mother Nature”.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the plan with the prime ministers of Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Denmark and Luxembourg. Norway’s prime minister and Britain’s energy security minister, Grant Shapps, also committed at the summit in Ostend, Belgium, on Monday to build more wind farms, develop “energy islands” – connected renewable generation sites at sea – and work on carbon capture projects. “We are unlocking our offshore energy ambitions,” the Belgian energy minister, Tinne van der Straeten, said. “Coordination is absolutely essential. If each of the nine countries acts alone, we’ll collectively fail. Planning is at the core of everything.” Aiming to both curb reliance on Russian gas and radically reduce the use of CO2-emitting fossil fuels, the nine countries aim to boost their combined North Sea offshore wind capacity to 120GW by 2030 and 300GW by 2050. All the leaders recognised the scale of the task, which will require massive investment. Macron also said it was also important that the infrastructure was produced in Europe and the jobs created were European jobs. “We don’t want to repeat the errors we’ve committed in the past, deploying equipment made on the other side of the world,” he said. Scholz described the summit as “very important” and Von der Leyen said the North Sea would soon be “the powerhouse of Europe”. Several leaders also stressed the need to protect Europe’s offshore wind farms and their interconnectors from sabotage and espionage following reports of Russian spy ships in the North Sea and last year’s sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. The capacity targets represent a further doubling of goals announced at a similar four-country summit in Esbjerg, Denmark, in May 2022, three months after European energy markets were plunged into turmoil by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander de Croo, said developments since then meant energy was “more than ever a geopolitical topic” and the countries would standardise infrastructure to ensure North Sea wind farms could be built faster and cheaper. The Netherlands and Britain announced plans for Europe’s biggest cross-border electricity link connected to an offshore wind farm, while the EU and Norway pledged to develop infrastructure to capture and store CO2 from depleted North Sea gas fields. Britain has 45 offshore wind farms producing 14GW, with plans to expand capacity to 50GW by 2030. Germany has 30 producing 8GW, followed by the Netherlands with 2.8GW and Denmark and Belgium, both with 2.3GW. France aims to expand massively to 40GW by 2050, an official said. They added: “Offshore wind energy will probably be the main source of renewable energy production between 2030 and 2050, far ahead of solar energy and land wind farms.” The investment required to ensure the North Sea wind energy targets are met is huge – the EU recently calculated €800bn would be needed to reach 300GW by 2050 – and wind energy companies have said significant state funding will be essential. Industry association WindEurope said Europe should be building the offshore infrastructure to add 20GW in output a year, but is creating capacity for only 7GW annually because of supply problems with key turbine parts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/09/latest-ipcc-report-offers-key-lessons-for-australia-but-is-anyone-listening","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-08T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Latest IPCC report offers key lessons for Australia but is anyone listening?

","bodyText":"Perhaps the message was too familiar. With the unofficial election campaign under way, and the prime minister mired in escalating allegations of bullying and duplicity, a major report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the world’s most respected climate science body – quickly disappeared from the Australian news cycle this week. The report, the third major release from the IPCC’s sixth assessment of the published evidence, focused on greenhouse gas emissions cuts – what has happened to date and what is necessary from here. Headlines told part of the story: it was “now or never” if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The report suggests that threshold is already practically out of reach without using technology to suck carbon dioxide from the sky. Keeping heating below 2C, which would trigger damage several magnitudes worse than 1.5C, will require an “abrupt acceleration” of effort after 2030. In a sane world, this alone may be enough to make it a focus of political discussion, now and through the election. But there was much more. The report suggests a rapid reduction in emissions over the next decade is within the world’s grasp – if leaders, policymakers and investors are motivated. Here are some key lessons relevant to Australia. We have the technology Any suggestion there isn’t technology that could deliver deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions this decade – as scientists and leaders at UN climate talks have repeatedly said is necessary – should be dispelled by this report. This is a key point in Australia given the Morrison government’s “technology, not taxes” mantra. The Coalition’s focus is on supporting technologies that are not yet commercially viable with an expectation they will deliver cuts mostly after 2030 and closer to 2050. It rejects calls for policies to rapidly deploy clean technology now, equating them to “taxes’’ that increase costs. The IPCC report tells a different story. It takes a global view and is not policy prescriptive, but says there are options available to cut emissions across all areas that already make economic sense. In several cases it suggests they would cost less than continuing with the polluting status quo. As the Australian National University’s Prof Frank Jotzo, a lead author on the report, spelled out this week, the IPCC found global emissions could be cut by 50% by 2030 through affordable steps. Jotzo says the general findings of the report are “very readily applied to Australia”. Solar and wind power are the obvious cases. Their average costs fell by 85% and 55% respectively in the decade to 2019. The IPCC estimates building a lot more of both could cut emissions by about 5bn tonnes a year – nearly 10% of the global total – by 2030 while saving governments and consumers money compared with the alternative. They could deliver nearly 3bn tonnes more for a relatively low cost. The ramifications for Australia are potentially significant. Compared with nearly every other country, it has vast amounts of sun and wind and no shortage of space in which to harness them. The IPCC implicitly supports the idea that there is a strong economic argument to quickly boost renewable energy deployment beyond the current pace of expansion as part of a campaign to “electrify everything”, including transport, farms and major industry. The report lists other options that could lead to cuts that were either cheaper than what we have now or would cost relatively little. Programs that reduce demand for energy are a big one – they save money. Other familiar ideas that could be accelerated include improving buildings’ and industry’s energy efficiency, boosting carbon sequestration in agriculture and stopping native forest clearing. Other cheap options are yet to get much traction in Australia at the federal level. Transport is a big one. The IPCC’s data suggests shifting to more fuel-efficient cars and trucks and relying more on public transport, bikes and e-bikes makes economic sense and is good for the planet. These aren’t revolutionary ideas, just ones that have been resisted until now. On fue- efficient cars, the Coalition planned a policy that would have required a reduction in average emissions from the national car fleet – basically, forcing auto companies to sell cleaner cars – but dropped it after industry and internal pushback, despite receiving advice it could benefit the economy by up to $13.9bn. It is part of the reason the Australian car fleet remains dirtier than other comparable countries and the country trails most others in embracing electric vehicles. Yes, fossil fuels are still the problem Despite persistent claims to the contrary from industry and fossil fuel-friendly MPs, the IPCC makes it clear that promotion of coal and gas – a favourite pastime of Australian politicians – is making it harder to keep global heating to 1.5C. The basic argument is straightforward: if existing fossil fuel plants run for their expected lifetimes, the world will blow the carbon budget to keep the temperature rise below that level. New developments only add to that. To keep the goals of the landmark Paris climate agreement within reach, countries should embark on a dedicated effort to decommission, cut back and cancel fossil fuel projects – or be prepared to spend even more on nascent technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In reality, both are likely to be needed. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, thundered this point as the report was released, describing investments in new fossil fuel projects as “moral and economic madness”, and that countries that were increasing fossil fuel production – not activists – were “the truly dangerous radicals” on climate change. He didn’t name Australia this time – that was last month when he called it a “holdout” on climate change for refusing to strengthen 2030 emissions reduction targets – but the message was clear. The Morrison government has not been swayed. It is backing a “gas-fired recovery”, including opening up new basins with the potential to release extraordinary amounts of greenhouse gas, as vital for the country’s future after the pandemic. Labor does not oppose the expansion. Scott Morrison has also declared the country’s coal plants should run for “as long as they possibly can” and the resources minister, Keith Pitt, cheered a recent surge in coal and gas demand after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Australia is the world’s third-biggest fossil fuel exporter, with government economic forecasts suggesting it will export more than 200m tonnes of thermal coal and about 80m tonnes of gas each year between now and 2027. The government argues there is no need to change this until demand dries up. It says developing countries need coal and gas to grow, that gas reduces emissions overseas by replacing coal (no evidence supplied) and that the focus should be on steps that give fossil fuels a future in a low-emissions world, including developing technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) and “blue” hydrogen made with gas. But the IPCC suggests supporting continued use of fossil fuels overseas can lock in polluting energy sources that are increasingly more expensive than renewables. And attempting to add CCS to fossil fuel energy just makes it even more expensive. Little evidence CCS will play a major role This is a big one in Australia, where governments have committed more than $4bn to try to make the technology viable. The Morrison government has kicked in hundreds of millions. The IPCC makes clear CCS – stopping emissions going into the atmosphere, usually by burying them underground – will have to prove economically viable for fossil fuels to have a future in a world that keeps heating below 2C. Despite having targets that assume more than 3C of warming, Australia is notionally committed to this. One of the government’s “stretch goals” under its technology investment roadmap is to get the cost of CCS to under $20 per tonne of emissions. The IPCC report suggests this remains a long way off. A table on the likely average cost of technologies available this decade puts CCS among the most expensive. The science body has revised down its assessment of how much of global electricity it expects to come from fossil fuels with CCS in 2040 since the last time it reported from 5% to 3%. The report says polluting industries want CCS to work as it could “allow fossil fuels to be used longer”, reducing the likelihood of assets becoming stranded. But despite having been promised for decades, and having had billions of dollars in funding committed to it in Australia alone, CCS still only captures about 0.3% of the 34.6bn tonnes of annual global emissions released burning fossil fuels. It makes a difference when we act This one shouldn’t be overstated, for obvious enough reasons. Global emissions continue to rise, though the pace has slowed since 2010. But there is evidence that serious efforts to cut emissions work. In 2016, steps such as accelerating available technology, backing energy efficiency and slowing deforestation lowered the global total by 5.9bn tonnes. That’s about a 10% cut. The report says at least 24 countries have cut emissions in absolute terms over at least a decade. The problem is that these cuts are outweighed by rapid growth elsewhere. In Australia, the government points to evidence that national emissions are down about 20% since 2005 – and has called on other countries to “follow our leadership” – but the headline number relies on greenhouse accounting sleights of hand that mask the reality. Fossil fuel emissions – the main game – were rising before the Covid-19 lockdowns hit due to increases from transport, mining and major industry. Government projections suggest those sectors will do little to reduce their impact before 2030. The claimed reduction since 2005 mostly happened when Labor was in power, between 2007 and 2013. Even then, it was mostly due to state policies that slowed the country’s extraordinary pace of forest destruction for agriculture, particularly in Queensland. Australia is still clearing native forests, just at a slower pace. Under greenhouse accounting, that counts as a cut in annual emissions. But it is not evidence of a country transforming its economy. The IPCC report suggests there is another way ahead.

The new environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, is understood to oppose solar panels being placed on agricultural land, arguing that it impedes his programme of growth and boosting food production. To this end, say government sources, he has asked his officials to redefine “best and most versatile” land (BMV), which is earmarked for farming, to include the middling-to-low category 3b. Land is graded from 1 to 5, and currently BMV includes grades 1 to 3a. Planning guidance says that development on BMV land should be avoided, although planning authorities may take other considerations into account. Currently, most solar farms are built on and planned for 3b land, so this move would scupper most new developments of the renewable energy source. Extending BMV to grade 3b would ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land. Much of grade 4 and 5 land is in upland areas that are unsuitable for solar developments. During her speech at the Conservative party conference last week, the prime minister, Liz Truss, reeled off a list of “enemies”, including green campaigners, who make up what she characterised as the “anti-growth coalition”. However, green campaigners say blocking the building of renewables would make her government part of such a group. Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK, said: “The UK solar sector is alarmed by attempts to put major planning rules in the way of cheap, homegrown energy. Solar power is the answer to so many needs and policy demands: it will cut energy bills, deliver energy security, boost growth and help rural economies. Ranil Jayawardena’s opposition to solar farms must surely make him part of the anti-growth coalition.” To get this policy over the line, Defra would have to get signoff from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. It is understood that BEIS ministers are against the move, as they are trying to show that they are not only deregulating the oil and gas industry and fracking, but also renewable energy. However, No 10 is understood to be sympathetic to the idea, with Truss having vowed to block solar farms on agricultural land during her election campaign. Dustin Benton, policy director at the thinktank Green Alliance, said: “It would be odd to redefine ‘best and most versatile’ agricultural land to include soils that aren’t of high quality, just to block solar farms. It sounds like a tactic that the ‘anti-growth coalition’ might employ. “The UK desperately needs to expand renewables so we don’t have to pay the extortionate cost of gas. Solar is one of the fastest energy sources to be deployed, so we should move quickly to build more in light of the gas crisis.” Andy Mayer, chief operation officer at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: “The government cannot on the one hand declare war on ‘the anti-growth coalition’, while on the other enforcing a right to veto developments, or waste time and money with excessive regulation. “Farmers and green entrepreneurs are itching to provide solutions to the false claim that energy and food security cannot coexist. The City of London is ready to fund them. Long-term solutions to grid congestion and storage are possible. Market reform can provide a level-playing field for competition. Communities can benefit through more personal rewards from permitted development. “That is what a supply-side revolution to encourage growth while supporting a transition to a cleaner greener future looks like. Not rigid rules, plans and targets that confuse, contradict and encourage opposition to change.” Ed Miliband, shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, said: “If the government goes ahead with blocking solar energy, it will be yet more unilateral energy disarmament from a government that has a 12 year record of driving up bills by blocking clean power. The blame for this plan lies squarely with the prime minister who has repeatedly opposed solar energy, the cheapest, cleanest, quickest form of power–and it will be the British people who pay the price in higher bills, higher gas imports and energy insecurity.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to deny this change was on the cards, simply saying the government had been looking at options to support farming and economic growth while protecting nature and delivering on net zero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-16T20:00:41Z","webTitle":"Australia’s ‘sun tax’: solar energy supporters split over how to make electricity grid fairer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jul/16/australias-sun-tax-solar-energy-supporters-split-over-how-to-make-electricity-grid-fairer","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s ‘sun tax’: solar energy supporters split over how to make electricity grid fairer","bodyText":"Michael Streatfeild was an early solar adopter. About a decade ago he withdrew $15,000 from his mortgage to install a 3.6kW system of panels on a north-east facing section of his roof in western Sydney. Three years ago, in a bid to wipe out his reliance on coal-fired grid electricity, he added a 4kW system and positioned it to catch sun later in the day, when it comes from the north-west. The sharp fall in the cost of solar in recent years meant the second system, though bigger than the first, cost just $5,000, a third of what he paid in 2011. Together, the two systems have all but wiped out his electricity bills – his last two brought refunds of about $100. Streatfeild is part of a rapidly expanding Australian story. About 2.8m households have solar systems, with another 3m expected to join them over the next decade. The flood of solar energy those houses create in the middle of the day when the sun is high is rapidly and dramatically transforming the electricity grid. At peak moments, slightly more than half the electricity across the national market is now from renewable sources, compared with about 30% across the year. In his first speech this week, the new head of the energy market operator, Daniel Westerman, set a target of the entire grid being able to run entirely on renewable energy, at least for brief moments, by 2025. According to regulators and some analysts, this solar influx, while welcome, is also causing potential problems by creating “traffic jams” in a system that was largely designed to send energy from a few large generators to homes and businesses. This prompted the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) in March to propose a change that could give network providers the power to charge people who export electricity into the grid at times when it is not needed. It argued the change was necessary to make room for more household solar systems and batteries to be connected to the grid, and to make the system fairer for all users. The commission, which makes rules for the electricity system, suggested two-way pricing that better rewarded solar and battery owners who send power to the grid at peak times – the early evening, for example. It also recommended new incentives that would give customers more reason to buy batteries or electric vehicles, or set up their homes to consume the power they generate at busy times. The proposal has proved divisive, pitting against each other those who want to see a rapid expansion of solar but who have different views about what is required to get there. From Streatfeild’s perspective, the potential new impost is unreasonable, but not surprising. A former police officer and member of the advocacy group Solar Citizens, he says he was motivated to get panels by the climate stance of the then opposition leader Tony Abbott and thoughts about the future his grandchildren faced. “I wanted to be able to say to them, ‘I didn’t fuck this Earth up for you, I did the best I could’,” Streatfeild says. He believes big electricity generators and networks have a history of profiteering and should bear any transformation costs, while solar consumers should be rewarded for bringing down the wholesale electricity price by undercutting ageing – and increasingly unviable – coal-fired power plants. “It’s really bad management by the network operators, in my opinion,” Streatfeild says. “They should have foreseen the need for all this. They seem to just want to screw us again.” Solar Citizens has a similar position. It has labelled the AEMC’s proposal a “sun tax”, and says solar homes and businesses should be rewarded for the benefits they provide, not penalised. “People have invested in solar in good faith,” says Ellen Roberts, Solar Citizens’ national director. “Any time that people have invested in something and the rules change it is breaching a fairness principle.” But arguments over fairness and solar power quickly become complicated – the same principle is invoked by supporters of the AEMC proposal. They say the change is needed in part to ensure a more equitable system for poor households that cannot afford solar panels and therefore bear a greater share of network charges. The AEMC’s draft rule followed proposals from an unlikely collection of groups, including the power distribution company SA Power Networks and welfare organisations the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and the St Vincent de Paul Society. Kellie Caught, senior adviser on climate and energy for Acoss, says the country needs a rapid transition to renewable electricity, but the question is who pays for it. Roughly a third of households are renting, so they can’t install solar panels and rely more heavily on – and pay more for – the poles and wires provided by electricity networks than those with solar. Caught says people with solar panels did not create the problem regulators are trying to address, but she believes the proposed rule change would benefit both grid security and consumers. “At the moment, the people who can least afford it are carrying more of the network costs,” she says. She says it is important the change empowers consumers with solar by giving them, and not network operators, the choice over whether they pay to export electricity at busy times or just accept a limit on how much they can send to the grid. Dylan McConnell, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne Climate and Energy College, also argues cutting emissions must be prioritised, but socially just. He cites research by the Grattan Institute in 2015 that suggests the effective subsidy paid by non-solar households to those with solar would be $3.6bn out to 2030. McConnell says at the heart of the debate is a question of whether household solar owners have a right to earn revenue by exporting to the grid, given they save money by using their self-generated solar energy at home, and whether that right comes with a responsibility to contribute to the infrastructure changes needed to ensure it is possible. Bruce Mountain, the director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, strongly disagrees. He argues the change proposed by the AEMC is based on a fallacy as the poorest households share the financial benefits of increased solar uptake at a level that far outweighs the additional network costs they face. He also suggests there is no evidence that more solar in the grid in the middle of the day is a problem that could not be addressed at low cost. “There simply isn’t good evidence of a problem to which export charging is a solution,” Mountain says. State governments have raised concerns about the change to varying degrees. Both Victoria and Queensland have indicated they do not support export charges. Some states have suggested grandfathering any cost so it does not affect people who already have panels. Other submissions to the AEMC argue to be effective the change must ensure solar owners who do what it wants – export their electricity when it is most needed – are well rewarded. They say it needs to become attractive to buy a household battery, or an EV that can both draw and export power to the grid. Neither technology has received the level of government support offered for rooftop panels when they were at similar levels of uptake a decade ago. Coincidentally or otherwise, the AEMC this week released a separate draft plan it says will make it easier for small battery owners to send electricity to the grid and earn revenue. The commission argues the average solar household with a system of between 4kW and 6kW will still do well after its proposed rule change. It estimates they will save about $900 a year on power bills – about $70 less than currently – and that households without solar would have their bills reduced as they would no longer have to pay for solar export services they do not use. It says alternatives to introducing an export cost, such as blocking people’s solar exports when the grid is under strain, or building more poles and wires to allow greater solar traffic, would be more expensive for consumers. The former would also have the effect of reducing the amount of renewable energy coming into the grid. The commission’s chief executive and chair, Benn Barr and Anna Collyer, emphasise that the rule change would not mandate an export charge, but allow networks to put forward proposals. The change would start in 2025. Barr says all governments support what he describes as a profound shift – a recognition for the first time that electricity networks need to take power from houses, not just get it to them. “What it means is those businesses now have an incentive and an obligation to upgrade the grid to get more solar, and be ready for when electric vehicles come,” Barr says. “It has kind of got lost a bit, but it will really change the ways those businesses do work, and benefit consumers across Australia.” A final decision on the rule change was initially due earlier this month but is now expected on 12 August."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2023/feb/07/welsh-universities-face-jobs-being-lost-eu-research-funding-ends","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T17:57:08Z","webTitle":"Welsh universities face 1,000 jobs being lost as EU research funding ends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/feb/07/welsh-universities-face-jobs-being-lost-eu-research-funding-ends","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2023/feb/07/welsh-universities-face-jobs-being-lost-eu-research-funding-ends","fields":{"headline":"Welsh universities face 1,000 jobs being lost as EU research funding ends","bodyText":"Universities in Wales face more than 1,000 skilled jobs being lost because of the withdrawal of EU structural funds, with leaders saying that the replacement finance promised by ministers will not match the lost support. Since 2014 Welsh universities have received about £370m in research projects from EU structural funds but, after the UK’s withdrawal, its support for 60 ongoing projects will end this year. Prof Paul Boyle, vice-chancellor of Swansea University and chair of the Universities Wales research and innovation network, told MPs that the projects and the jobs could be saved with an urgent injection of £71m in bridging finance to keep them running. “Stepping back from the cliff edge would save hundreds of jobs, support a range of cutting-edge innovation projects that are driving economic growth, and provide direct investment in areas that the UK government has stated are at the heart of its own levelling up ambitions,” Boyle said. “In an increasingly competitive global marketplace, we risk failing to exploit one of this country’s most enduring and internationally recognised strengths.” One example, funded through the European structural and investment fund, is Swansea University’s Specific project, which aims to create buildings that can store and release heat and electricity from solar energy, including through printable solar cells and material that can store summer heat for use in winter. The project has created seven spin-off companies, and works with hundreds of private sector partners. Geraint Davies, the Labour MP for Swansea West, said: “These projects are important to our UK ambition to crank up sustainable economic growth, so their sudden loss would be a big blow to our communities our economy and all our longer-term interests. “That’s why providing immediate bridging funding of just £71m is of such importance.” The payments from the structural fund comes to an end this year, with the Westminster government promising to cover the funding through its £2.6bn UK shared prosperity fund. But delays and uncertainty over distribution means the current projects may be forced to close down before the funding is allocated. Cardiff University said 12 of its projects were due to end this year, and a further five projects already in the process of closing after funding ran out last year, with about 100 jobs at risk. Colin Riordan, Cardiff University’s vice-chancellor, told Research Professional News: “The aim of these projects was to create jobs and stimulate economic activity through innovation, so it’s going to be a big loss not just in terms of the university but also the region.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/22/black-carbon-pollution-from-tourism-and-research-increasing-antarctic-snowmelt-study-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-22T16:00:13Z","webTitle":"Black carbon pollution from tourism and research increasing Antarctic snowmelt, study says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/black-carbon-pollution-from-tourism-and-research-increasing-antarctic-snowmelt-study-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/22/black-carbon-pollution-from-tourism-and-research-increasing-antarctic-snowmelt-study-says","fields":{"headline":"Black carbon pollution from tourism and research increasing Antarctic snowmelt, study says","bodyText":"Black carbon pollution from tourism and research activities in Antarctica is likely increasing snowmelt on the continent by an estimated 83 tonnes for each visitor, according to new research. Scientists have estimated that the black carbon produced by vessels, planes and diesel generators results in 23mm of additional snowmelt each summer in the most frequently visited areas of the ice-covered landmass. More than 74,000 tourists visited Antarctica in the 2019–2020 season, nearly double the figures from a decade ago. A team of researchers sampled the snow yearly between 2016 and 2020 at 28 sites spanning 2000km from Antarctica’s northern tip to the Ellsworth Mountains. They focused primarily on the Antarctic peninsula, where about half of the research facilities on the continent are located and where an estimated 95% of Antarctic tourist trips are made. The team estimated that 53,000 tourists visited Antarctica annually between 2016 and 2020. Study co-author Dr Raúl Cordero, of the University of Santiago Chile, said Antarctic snow was the cleanest on Earth, typically with baseline levels of black carbon around one part in a billion. “That is 1000 times less than what you would find in the Himalayas, and 100 times less than what you can find in the Andes or in the Rocky Mountains,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Black carbon levels at sites on the Antarctic peninsula were between two and four times higher than on other parts of the continent. “What black carbon is doing is making the snow darker [so it] is absorbing more solar radiation,” Cordero said. “That extra energy is accelerating the melting of the snow.” He believes a limit on the number of tourists to Antarctica may need to be adopted. The team quantified the likely snowmelt by calculating how black carbon pollution reduced the snow’s albedo – a measure of how well a surface reflects solar energy. They calculated that an Antarctic researcher’s black carbon footprint was about 10 times greater than a tourist’s. “We estimated that … the snow that is melting faster because of the activities carried out by a researcher would be closer to 1000 tonnes,” Cordero said. “Every researcher is using vessels, planes, helicopters, generators – and everybody’s using diesel for powering these.” Cordero said that while the amount of pollution-induced snowmelt is far less than the ice and snow lost to global warming, the study highlighted the need for a transition to renewable energy sources. “There are technical alternatives to diesel that could be used in Antarctica,” he said, citing the Belgian research station, Princess Elisabeth Antarctica, which is primarily powered by wind. Prof Andrew Mackintosh, head of the school of earth atmosphere and environment at Monash University, who was not involved in the research, said the link between black carbon pollution and increased surface melt was well established in other parts of the world. “In the Antarctic peninsula the two major processes [affecting melting] would still be warming oceans melting ice shelves from beneath, or warming surface air temperatures that are melting the ice from above,” Mackintosh said. “If we have even greater surface warming in [the] decades to centuries ahead, as is projected for the Antarctic peninsula, then the additional black carbon on the surface will cause even more melt than would have occurred otherwise,” he said. “Human activity is causing the polar regions to warm, but the burning of … [fossil] fuels has a direct consequence in terms of surface melt as well.” “If you can get rid of the greenhouse gases in the first place, you’ll reduce the temperature increase,” he said. “There’s also the added benefit of less darkening of the snow surfaces.” Cordero said: “Antarctica is the last continent more or less unpolluted. I think we should try to keep it that way.” The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/nov/29/thurrock-council-admits-disastrous-investments-caused-500m-deficit","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-29T20:18:58Z","webTitle":"Thurrock council admits disastrous investments caused £500m deficit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/29/thurrock-council-admits-disastrous-investments-caused-500m-deficit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/nov/29/thurrock-council-admits-disastrous-investments-caused-500m-deficit","fields":{"headline":"Thurrock council admits disastrous investments caused £500m deficit","bodyText":"A Tory-led council has admitted a series of disastrous investments in risky commercial projects caused it to run up an unprecedented deficit of nearly £500m and brought it to the brink of bankruptcy. The staggering scale of the catastrophe at Thurrock council in Essex – one of the biggest ever financial disasters in local government – is contained in a report made to the council’s cabinet, which reveals it has lost £275m on investments it made in solar energy and other businesses, and has set aside a further £130m this year to pay back investment debts. Thurrock has appealed to the government for an emergency financial bailout and warned that it will have to push through a drastic programme of cuts to local services and staff redundancies, along with a probable fire sale of buildings, land and other assets as it attempts to stay afloat. Council tax rises are also likely. There was astonishment in the wider local government world at the scale of the financial disaster. “What we are seeing in Thurrock is shocking and unprecedented. I have not seen anything like this in my 30-year career in local government,” said Rob Whiteman, the chief executive of Cipfa, the public sector accountants body. Thurrock had become one of the most indebted of all English local authorities in recent years after borrowing £1.5bn – 10 times its annual spending on local services – to enable a string of investments in solar energy and other businesses. Three years of investigations by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) have helped force Thurrock to reveal the full scale of its investments, including hundreds of millions lent to companies owned by businessman Liam Kavanagh to invest in 53 solar farms. According to the BIJ, Thurrock invested £655m in Kavanagh’s companies, and expects to lose £188m on the deal. It also expects to make a £65m loss on its investment in a company called the Just Loans Group, which went bust in June, and millions more on a series of other deals that turned sour. In common with many other councils Thurrock attempted to offset the effects of years of austerity cuts to its funding by borrowing cheaply from the Treasury and investing in commercial business in the hope this would provide an alternative income stream. By 2019, English councils had borrowed over £6bn for this purpose. Concerns over Thurrock’s exposure to risky commercial investments led a panicked government to send in a team of commissioners to run its finances in September. The cabinet report reveals Thurrock’s finances are now in a significantly far worse state than originally thought just a few weeks ago – and could get even worse. The report predicts a further black hole in its budget of £185m in 2023-24, suggesting that it may have to declare effective bankruptcy. Three councils, Croydon, Slough and Northamptonshire, have gone insolvent in recent years, the former two after running up huge debts on borrowing. “This is a grave position and at this point the council cannot find a way to finance their expenditure in-year and is unlikely to achieve a balanced budget for 2023-24 without external support,” the report says. The council’s Conservative leader, Mark Coxshall, issued a statement saying that services would continue to operate as normal for now and staff would continue to be paid. But he also warned that there would be “extremely difficult decisions to come” in what he called “uncertain and unsettling times”. He added: “These are shocking numbers but the first stage to creating a good plan for recovery is to understand the full extent of the problem. I know that Thurrock residents will be concerned, and rightly so, about what this means for local services. Please rest assured that this report is the first stage of planning for our recovery.” John Kent, the leader of Thurrock council’s Labour opposition, said Thurrock residents will be paying the price for the Conservatives’ catastrophic handling of the council’s affairs for decades. “This report lays bare the culmination of six years of Conservative leadership of Thurrock council,” he said. “Just what were those Conservative councillors who make up the council’s cabinet doing? Are we really expected to believe they didn’t notice what was going on under their very noses? “The Tory cabinet are absolutely complicit in this scandal and with every new revelation their position becomes even more indefensible.” • This article was amended on 30 November 2022 to remove a reference to the Thurrock council report as being “internal”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/20/down-to-earth-ipcc-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T15:23:58Z","webTitle":"Down to Earth: The path to radically lower emissions tucked away inside the devastating IPCC report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/20/down-to-earth-ipcc-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/20/down-to-earth-ipcc-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Down to Earth: The path to radically lower emissions tucked away inside the devastating IPCC report","bodyText":"This piece first appeared in Down to Earth, the Guardian’s climate and environment newsletter. Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday It feels impossible. The world has to slash carbon emissions by almost half in the next seven years to remain on track for just 1.5C of global heating and avoid the worst of climate impacts. Yet emissions are rising. However, tucked away in the recent (and devastating) landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a chart that provides the road map for an escape from catastrophe. It assesses with extraordinary clarity the potential for emissions cuts of more than 40 options. You can view it here. The simplicity of the chart is deceptive. It was compiled by a team of the world’s best scientists, based on 175 studies. Its power is amplified by the fact that it was signed off by all of the world’s governments, from the cleanest and greenest to the darkest petrostates. So what does it show? First, solar and wind power are by far the best option, with the potential to cut a staggering 8bn tonnes from annual CO2 emissions by 2030. That is equivalent to the combined emissions of the US and European Union today. Even more startling is that most of that potential can be achieved at lower cost than just continuing with today’s electricity systems. “What struck me especially was that wind and solar was so big,” Prof Kornelis Blok, at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told me this week. Blok, who led the work on the chart, identified the winners: “The big five are wind, solar, energy efficiency, stopping deforestation and reducing methane emissions.” Just as important as the winners in this analysis are the losers. Nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS) each have just 10% of the potential of wind and solar, and at far higher cost. The same applies to bioenergy – burning wood or crops for electricity. It’s no wonder that the UK’s energy strategy, published last week, received significant criticism: it goes heavy on nuclear and CCS, while ignoring onshore wind. After wind and solar, the biggest prize is stopping the destruction of forests and other wild places, the IPCC scientists found. That has the potential to cut 4bn tonnes of emissions a year by 2030, not far off double the fossil fuel emissions from the whole of Africa and South America today. Including the restoration of degraded forests adds almost 3bn tonnes. Much of this could be achieved for less than $50 per tonne – half the price polluters pay for carbon permits in Europe today. Energy efficiency in buildings, industry, lighting and appliances remains a no-brainer – 4.5bn tonnes a year by 2030 – as does slashing methane emissions, particularly from leaky fossil fuel installations. The latter could save the equivalent of about 3bn tonnes. There are some interesting details too. A shift to “sustainable diets” – ie eating much less red meat in rich nations – could cut 1.7bn tonnes of emissions, equivalent to all the annual pollution from fossil fuel giant Russia. A push towards public transport, bikes and e-bikes has the potential to cut emissions more than the rollout of electric cars, showing both are needed. An often overlooked option – burying charcoal in fields (biochar) – is relatively costly to implement but potentially huge. Along with avoiding the ploughing of fields, which releases carbon, biochar could save 3.4bn tonnes of CO2 a year. The IPCC chart is a map of climate optimism. It shows we can cut emissions by half by 2030 with options costing at most $100 per tonne, which is a bargain when set against the further damages that climate inaction will inevitably bring. The solutions – wind, solar, trees, energy saving and methane cuts – require no new technology. But what they do require is a resource heavily lacking so far: the political will to push aside vested interests and rapidly pursue the policies that will work. “The chart is a very useful hitlist,” says Blok. “I think every country can take it and see in which areas they could do more. If we don’t achieve [a 50% cut in emissions by 2030], it will not be because of a lack of options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/30/eu-plans-to-loosen-state-aid-rules-renewables-investment-tax-credits-biden-green-subsidy","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-30T15:02:24Z","webTitle":"EU plans to loosen state aid rules to boost renewables investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/30/eu-plans-to-loosen-state-aid-rules-renewables-investment-tax-credits-biden-green-subsidy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/30/eu-plans-to-loosen-state-aid-rules-renewables-investment-tax-credits-biden-green-subsidy","fields":{"headline":"EU plans to loosen state aid rules to boost renewables investment","bodyText":"The EU is stepping up its green subsidy race with the US through plans to loosen state aid rules on tax credits for renewable energy projects. European policymakers have been under pressure to respond to the US president Joe Biden’s $369bn (£298bn) Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to encourage renewables investment in everything from electric cars to wind turbines. The European Commission plans to loosen state aid rules to enable investment into production facilities in green industries, according to draft plans. EU member states are divided over whether to introduce the new rules and how long for, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the plans. The draft proposals reportedly suggest some of a €800bn (£705bn) Covid-19 recovery fund could be redirected towards tax credits. “The provisions on tax benefits would enable member states to align their national fiscal incentives on a common scheme, and thereby offer greater transparency and predictability to businesses across the EU,” the draft said. Europe’s energy system has been under intense scrutiny since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent throttling of gas supplies into Europe. Brussels intends to set new targets for green industrial capacity and simplify the approval process for renewables projects. It plans to increase the level at which deals are scrutinised by the commission under state aid rules. Biden’s new rules, introduced last autumn, have reinvigorated the renewables market in the US, leading to a wave of new projects. The president hailed the legislation as “the biggest step forward on climate ever” on signing the bill last year. It has been estimated that the legislation could reduce US emissions by about 40% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, bringing Biden close to the goal of cutting US emissions in half by the end of the decade. Companies, investors and politicians have called for Europe and the UK to follow suit, with Jozef Síkela, the Czech minister of industry and trade, equating the US programme with “doping in sport”. In Britain, ministers have been accused of discouraging renewables investment by extending a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas firms to electricity generators, including wind and solar projects on older contracts. Chris Hewett, the chief executive of the industry body Solar Energy UK, has accused the government of offering more generous tax terms to oil and gas projects and “tilting the playing field against renewables”. Meanwhile, the shadow climate change secretary, Ed Miliband has said a Labour government would form an “anti-Opec” alliance of countries dedicated to renewables, to bring down energy prices and promote clean technology. On Monday, the oil and gas company BP said global carbon emissions were expected to fall quicker than it had previously expected as a result of the war in Ukraine and Biden’s efforts to encourage green investment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-07T12:00:45Z","webTitle":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/07/energy-dashboard-how-electricity-generated-great-britain","fields":{"headline":"Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?","bodyText":"Great Britain has one of the most diverse ranges of electricity generation in Europe, with everything from windfarms off the coast of Scotland to a nuclear power station in Suffolk tasked with keeping the lights on. The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country’s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action. The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of “baseload” power – from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants – and “intermittent” sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries. By 2030 it is hoped that 90% of the energy imported by interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources. The technology behind Great Britain’s power generation has evolved significantly over the last century. The first integrated national grid in the world was formed in 1935 linking seven regions of the UK. In the aftermath of industrialisation, coal provided the vast majority of power, before oil began to play an increasingly important part in the 1950s. In 1956, the world’s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 at Windscale (later Sellafield), was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Coal use fell significantly in the 1990s while the use of combined cycle gas turbines grew. Now a combination of gas, wind, nuclear and biomass provide the bulk of Great Britain’s energy, with smaller sources such as solar and hydroelectric power also used. From October 2024, coal will no longer be used to generate electricity. Methodology The charts visualise Great Britain’s electricity generation data. Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK and is not included in the figures. Energy generation data is fetched from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service public feed, provided by Elexon – which runs the wholesale energy market – and is updated every five minutes. Elexon’s data does not include embedded energy, which is unmetered and therefore invisible to Great Britain’s National Grid. Embedded energy comprises all solar energy and wind energy generated from non-metered turbines. To account for these figures we use embedded energy estimates from the National Grid electricity system operator, which are published every 30 minutes. Import figures refer to the net flow of electricity from the interconnectors with Europe and with Northern Ireland. A positive value represents import into the GB transmission system, while a negative value represents an export. Hydro figures combine renewable run-of-the-river hydropower and pumped storage. Biomass figures include Elexon’s “other” category, which comprises coal-to-biomass conversions and biomass combined heat and power plants. The Guardian does not make any attempt to fix potential mistakes in the data feeds; all figures should be taken as indicative."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/09/australia-federal-budget-2023-climate-environment-energy-saving-measures-households-double-glazing-solar-panels-hydrogen","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-09T10:00:12Z","webTitle":"Households offered $1bn help in budget to install energy saving measures ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/09/australia-federal-budget-2023-climate-environment-energy-saving-measures-households-double-glazing-solar-panels-hydrogen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/09/australia-federal-budget-2023-climate-environment-energy-saving-measures-households-double-glazing-solar-panels-hydrogen","fields":{"headline":"Households offered $1bn help in budget to install energy saving measures ","bodyText":"About 110,000 households will be able to receive $1bn in low-cost loans for double glazing, solar panels and other energy improvements in changes the Albanese government says will make homes cheaper to run and easier to keep cool and warm. It’s part of a $1.6bn “energy savings plan” announced in Tuesday’s budget that includes $300m funding to improve social housing and $310m in tax deductions for businesses that invest in renewable energy and energy efficiency measures. The government also announced $2bn for a “hydrogen headstart” program that it said would help two or three large-scale renewable hydrogen developments bridge the gap to being commercially viable. Experts say “green” hydrogen is likely to be crucial in manufacturing some products currently made using fossil fuels, such as steel and aluminium. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the global shift to clean energy was “Australia’s biggest opportunity for growth and prosperity”, and the government was making the “biggest ever investment in Australia’s energy transformation”. On the natural environment, the budget included $121m to create an Environment Protection Australia (EPA) as part of an upcoming reform of conservation laws. Household energy The household energy savings plan was flagged in December as part of a Labor-Greens deal to pass laws that capped gas prices to limit the rise in electricity bills. The government agreed then there would be a “significant” budget package targeted at low-income people and renters. It also follows a campaign led by Saul Griffith, a former energy adviser to the US government and now head of Rewiring Australia, who had suggested a $13.5bn package to electrify homes. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said Australia’s housing stock was mostly inefficient, reflected in the country being ranked 58th out of 63 countries for per capita energy use. He said $1bn in loans and mortgages would be issued through a “household energy upgrades fund” run by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The CEFC would partner with banks to upgrade homes with “battery-ready solar PV, modern appliances and other improvements to keep them warmer in winter and cooler in summer”. Eligibility criteria has not been decided. It will be worked out by the CEFC and finance providers. The scheme is expected to start next year. Bowen said Australia’s social housing stock was particularly poor, having mostly been built before minimum building standards were introduced. He estimated upgrades would cut energy consumption by about a third for residents of 60,000 social housing homes. Hydrogen The government said the funding for green hydrogen – created using wind and solar energy – would put the country on track to have 1 gigawatt of electrolyser capacity by 2030. The budget promises $2bn in total, but only $156m over the next four years. Though the extent of its future role remains unclear, green hydrogen has increasingly been backed by national governments, particularly the US through last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, which included A$527bn for clean energy – a figure so large it has prompted concern it would draw investment away from other countries. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Bowen said the hydrogen commitment would “position Australia to take advantage of the immense jobs and investment potential of the technology”. Chalmers said backing hydrogen would mean Wollongong, Gladstone and Whyalla could “make and export everything from renewable energy to green steel”. Environmental protection In Tanya Plibersek’s environment portfolio, the budget included $121m over four years to establish the EPA, and $51.5m for another new body, Environment Information Australia, to provide data on the threatened species and ecosystems. Plibersek said the EPA would be a “tough cop on the beat”. There was $7.7m to help implement the government’s “nature repair market” legislation, which is currently before parliament and promises a framework for private investment in biodiversity protection. Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday the Coalition was likely to back the laws, which are an expansion of a pilot it proposed while in government. Scientists have estimated about $1.7bn a year is needed to fix Australia’s degraded ecosystems and wild places. Other measures The budget also included: $18m to reform management of Australia’s contentious carbon offsets scheme in line with recommendations from a review headed by Prof Ian Chubb. There was $5.9m to audit forest regeneration projects, which some experts say are not leading to real emissions cuts on the scale promised. $872.5m in savings from scrapped water projects announced under the former Coalition government. It included $595m over seven years from axing the controversial Dungowan dam in NSW. Previously announced measures including a net zero authority to help manage the shift to a clean economy; a capacity investment scheme to underwrite clean, dispatchable electricity generation; and $262.3m for upgrades to degraded national parks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/21/solar-farms-energy-power-california-mojave-desert","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-21T10:00:25Z","webTitle":"How solar farms took over the California desert: ‘An oasis has become a dead sea’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/21/solar-farms-energy-power-california-mojave-desert","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/21/solar-farms-energy-power-california-mojave-desert","fields":{"headline":"How solar farms took over the California desert: ‘An oasis has become a dead sea’","bodyText":"Deep in the Mojave desert, about halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix, a sparkling blue sea shimmers on the horizon. Visible from the I-10 highway, amid the parched plains and sun-baked mountains, it is an improbable sight: a deep blue slick stretching for miles across the Chuckwalla Valley, forming an endless glistening mirror. But something’s not quite right. Closer up, the water’s edge appears blocky and pixelated, with the look of a low-res computer rendering, while its surface is sculpted in orderly geometric ridges, like frozen waves. “We had a guy pull in the other day towing a big boat,” says Don Sneddon, a local resident. “He asked us how to get to the launch ramp to the lake. I don’t think he realised he was looking at a lake of solar panels.” Over the last few years, this swathe of desert has been steadily carpeted with one of the world’s largest concentrations of solar power plants, forming a sprawling photovoltaic sea. On the ground, the scale is almost incomprehensible. The Riverside East Solar Energy Zone – the ground zero of California’s solar energy boom – stretches for 150,000 acres, making it 10 times the size of Manhattan. It is a crucial component of the United States’ green energy revolution. Solar makes up about 3% of the US electricity supply, but the Biden administration hopes it will reach 45% by 2050, primarily by building more huge plants like this across the country’s flat, empty plains. But there’s one thing that the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) – the agency tasked with facilitating these projects on public land – doesn’t seem to have fully taken into account: the desert isn’t quite as empty as it thought. It might look like a barren wilderness, but this stretch of the Mojave is a rich and fragile habitat for endangered species and home to thousand-year-old carbon-capturing woodlands, ancient Indigenous cultural sites – and hundreds of people’s homes. Residents have watched ruefully for years as solar plants crept over the horizon, bringing noise and pollution that’s eroding a way of life in their desert refuge. “We feel like we’ve been sacrificed,” says Mark Carrington, who, like Sneddon, lives in the Lake Tamarisk resort, a community for over-55s near Desert Center, which is increasingly surrounded by solar farms. “We’re a senior community, and half of us now have breathing difficulties because of all the dust churned up by the construction. I moved here for the clean air, but some days I have to go outside wearing goggles. What was an oasis has become a little island in a dead solar sea.” Concerns have intensified following the recent news of a project, called Easley, that would see the panels come just 200 metres from their backyards. Residents claim that excessive water use by solar plants has contributed to the drying up of two local wells, while their property values have been hit hard, with several now struggling to sell their homes. “It has been psychologically gruelling,” says Teresa Pierce, who moved here six years ago. “From the constant pounding of the metal posts to the endless dust storms. I now have allergies that I’d never had before – my arms burn all day long and my nose is always running. I feel like a prisoner in my own home.” Elizabeth Knowles, director of community engagement for Intersect Power, the company behind the Easley project, said it knew of residents’ concerns and was exploring how to move the project further from the community. “Since being made aware of their concerns, we have been in regular contact with residents to listen to their concerns and incorporate their feedback into our planning efforts.” ‘90% of the story is underground’ The mostly flat expanse south-east of Joshua Tree national park was originally identified as a prime site for industrial-scale solar power under the Obama administration, which fast-tracked the first project, Desert Sunlight, in 2011. It was the largest solar plant in the world at the time of completion, in 2015, covering an area of almost 4,000 acres, and it opened the floodgates for more. Since then, 15 projects have been completed or are under construction, with momentous mythological names like Athos and Oberon. Ultimately, if built to full capacity, this shimmering patchwork quilt could generate 24 gigawatts, enough energy to power 7m homes. But as the pace of construction has ramped up, so have voices questioning the cumulative impact of these projects on the desert’s populations – both human and non-human. Kevin Emmerich worked for the National Park Service for over 20 years before setting up Basin &amp; Range Watch in 2008, a non-profit that campaigns to conserve desert life. He says solar plants create myriad environmental problems, including habitat destruction and “lethal death traps” for birds, which dive at the panels, mistaking them for water. He says one project bulldozed 600 acres of designated critical habitat for the endangered desert tortoise, while populations of Mojave fringe-toed lizards and bighorn sheep have also been afflicted. “We’re trying to solve one environmental problem by creating so many others.” Such adverse impacts are supposed to be prevented by the desert renewable energy conservation plan (DRECP), which was approved in 2016 after years of consultation and covers almost 11m acres of California. But Emmerich and others think the process is flawed, allowing streamlined environmental reviews and continual amendments that they say trample conservationists’ concerns. “The plan talks about the importance of making sure there’s enough room between the solar projects to preserve wildlife routes,” says Chris Clarke of the National Parks Conservation Association. “But the individual assessments for each project do not take into account the cumulative impact. The solar plants are blocking endangered species’ natural transport corridors across the desert.” Much of the critical habitat in question is dry wash woodland, made up of “microphyll” shrubs and trees like palo verde, ironwood, catclaw and honey mesquite, which grow in a network of green veins across the desert. But, compared with old-growth forests of giant redwoods, or expanses of venerable Joshua trees, the significance of these small desert shrubs can be hard for the untrained eye to appreciate. “When people look across the desert, they just see scrubby little plants that look dead half the time,” says Robin Kobaly, a botanist who worked at the BLM for over 20 years as a wildlife biologist before founding the Summertree Institute, an environmental education non-profit. “But they are missing 90% of the story – which is underground.” Her book, The Desert Underground, features illustrated cross-sections that reveal the hidden universe of roots extended up to 150ft below the surface, supported by branching networks of fungal mycelium. “This is how we need to look at the desert,” she says, turning a diagram from her book upside-down. “It’s an underground forest – just as majestic and important as a giant redwood forest, but we can’t see it.” The reason this root network is so valuable, she argues, because it operates as an enormous “carbon sink” where plants breathe in carbon dioxide at the surface and out underground, forming layers of sedimentary rock known as caliche. “If left undisturbed, the carbon can remain stored for thousands of years,’” she says. Desert plants are some of the oldest carbon-capturers around: Mojave yuccas can be up to 2,500 years old, while the humble creosote bush can live for over 10,000 years. These plants also sequester carbon in the form of glomalin, a protein secreted around the fungal threads connected to the plants’ roots, thought to store a third of the world’s soil carbon. “By digging these plants up,” says Kobaly, “we are removing the most efficient carbon sequestration units on the planet – and releasing millennia of stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, the solar panels we are replacing them with have a lifespan of around 25 years.” For Alfredo Acosta Figueroa, the unstoppable march of desert solar represents an existential threat of a different kind. As a descendant of the Chemehuevi and Yaqui nations, he has watched as what he says are numerous sacred Indigenous sites have been bulldozed. “The history of the world is told by these sites,” he says, “by geoglyphs, petroglyphs, and pictographs. Yet the government has chosen to ignore and push aside the creation story in the name of progress.” His organisation, La Cuna de Aztlan, acts as custodian of over 300 such sites in the Lower Colorado River Basin, many of which, he says, have already been damaged beyond repair. He claims that a 200ft-long geoglyph of Kokopelli, a flute-playing god, was destroyed by a new road to one of the solar plants, while an image of Cicimitl, an Aztec spirit said to guide souls to the afterlife, is also threatened. “The solar projects cannot destroy just one sacred site without destroying the sacredness of the entire area,” he adds. “They are all connected.” He cites a 2010 report by the California Energy Commission, which includes testimony from the heritage experts Dr Elizabeth Bagwell and Beverly E Bastian stating that “more than 800 sites within the I-10 Corridor and 17,000 sites within the Southern California Desert Region will potentially be destroyed”, and that “mitigation can reduce the impact of the destruction, but not to a less-than-significant level”. The Bureau of Land Management declined a request for an interview. In an emailed statement, its public affairs officer, Michelle Van Der Linden, did not directly address questions about solar plants’ water use, health issues, or ecological and archeological impacts, but said the agency operated within the applicable laws and acts. “The DRECP effort was a multiple-year collaborative discussion resulting in an agreement reached between the BLM, numerous environmental groups, partners and stakeholders, in regards to the application and decision process related to renewable energy projects. Project issues were and continue to be identified and addressed through the National Environmental Policy Act process, which includes the opportunity for public engagement and input and also addresses many of the cumulative impacts and additional environmental, social and economic concerns mentioned.” ‘So many other places we should put solar’ But a more fundamental question remains: why build in the desert, when thousands of acres of rooftops in urban areas lie empty across California? “There are so many other places we should be putting solar,” says Clarke, of the National Parks Conservation Association, from homes to warehouses to parking lots and industrial zones. He describes the current model of large-scale, centralised power generation, hundreds of miles from where the power is actually needed, as “a 20th-century business plan for a 21st-century problem”. “The conversion of intact wildlife habitat should be the absolute last resort, but it’s become our first resort – just because it’s the easy fix.” Vincent Battaglia, founder of Renova Energy, a rooftop solar company based in Palm Desert, agrees. “We’ve been led to believe that all solar is good solar,” he says. “But it’s not when it molests pristine land, requires hundreds of millions of dollars to transmit to city centres, and loses so much power along the way. It is simply preserving the monopoly of the big energy companies.” California recently reduced the incentive for homeowners to install rooftop solar panels after it slashed the amount that they can earn from feeding power back into the grid by about 75%. Forecasters suggest that, after doubling in size from 2020 to 2022, the market for residential solar installations is expected to decrease by nearly 40% by 2024 as a result. Battaglia is optimistic that home energy storage is the answer. “Batteries are the future,” he says. “With solar panels on rooftops and batteries in homes, we’ll finally be able to cut the cord from the big utility companies. Soon, those fields of desert solar farms will be defunct – left as rusting relics of another age.” Back in Lake Tamarisk, the residents are preparing for the long battle ahead. “They picked on a little town and thought they could wipe us out,” says Sneddon. “But they can’t just mow us over like they did the desert tortoises. “They thought we were a bunch of uneducated redneck hicks living out here in the desert,” says Pierce. “We’re going to show them they were wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/plants-that-thrive-in-colder-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-29T08:15:43Z","webTitle":"Plants that will thrive in our colder homes | James Wong","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/plants-that-thrive-in-colder-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jan/29/plants-that-thrive-in-colder-homes","fields":{"headline":"Plants that thrive in colder homes","bodyText":"It’s a time of year when plant shops seem to be flooded with many of my favourite old-school Victorian houseplants, which these days are thought of – paradoxically, thanks to the widespread adoption of central heating – as incredibly tricky to grow. As so many of these cool-climate species look incredibly exotic, we tend to assume that their decline soon after we get them home is down to our own failure to spoil them with the steamy jungle conditions we are convinced they must require. I think it’s reassuring to know that the reality is usually the exact opposite. With the current energy crisis causing many of us to consider reducing how many rooms we heat, and the temperature across our homes generally being lowered to a level that’s decidedly chillier, some of these species could really start to come into their own. I first saw Cymbidium orchids at one of the huge displays of seasonal plants that filled plant nurseries in Singapore during Chinese New Year in the late 1990s. Every year, these stores would literally quadruple in size, with all sorts of unusual, imported species, from 10ft cherry trees in flower, to picture-perfect rice plants sporting full ears of grain and decorated with red silk ribbons, spilling out on to pavements, grass verges and even adjoining car parks. Back then, the sheer size of these orchids’ blooms and their incredible “corsage” forms just blew my mind. Little did I know that they would prove to be totally impossible for me to keep alive in the heat of the lowland tropics. Three decades on, wandering around central London in the depths of winter, I frequently spot the same genus all over the place in the yards of basement flats, in pots on the concrete patios of council blocks and sitting on forgotten window ledges, where they seem to be thriving outdoors in cold, damp and distinctly un-jungly conditions. It’s a similar case with almost all citrus plants. Given the combination of warm temperatures and low light levels in winter, many will react by almost instantly shedding their leaves, which can be really tricky to recover from in the spring, leading to a rapid decline. While these light-loving species will handle a wide range of temperatures, the combination of warm temperatures driving up their metabolic rate coupled with the lack of light (meaning they don’t have the solar energy to fuel this desire for growth) is kind of like hitting the brakes and the accelerator at the same time on their biology. This is also exactly the case for a wide range of cool-climate houseplants from gardenias and forest cacti, to maidenhair ferns and cyclamen. In fact, cooler winter conditions can be of benefit to houseplants in general, most of which were originally popularised long before central heating became the norm. When you remove central heating from the equation, you remove the damaging effect it has on plant metabolics, and also the raised humidity that comes with it.

On Tuesday, intense storms and heavy rain left thousands without power in Geelong and the Bellarine peninsula in Victoria, while lightning lit up the skies in New South Wales. According to Weatherzone, about 133,000 lightning strikes were recorded within a 100km radius of Blacktown in western Sydney. Ben Domensino, a Weatherzone meteorologist, has forecast that “Australia will see widespread and locally heavy rain over the course of this week.” “The rainfall being predicted over eastern and south-eastern Australia this week will come from daily shower and thunderstorm activity,” he said in a statement. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Why are storms more common in summer? Most storms occur between September and March, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Thunderstorms require warm, humid air to form, and strike more commonly in the summer months when solar energy is abundant. There are three key components required to produce a thunderstorm, according to the BoM: High moisture in the atmosphere, which can sometimes be identified by the presence of low clouds or haziness in the morning. An unstable atmosphere, with high temperatures near the ground that fall sharply with increasing height. A trigger that lifts air up vertically in the atmosphere, through differences in air density. This can arise from local variations in heating, or the approach of a front or low pressure trough. “High moisture levels, especially near the coast, affect the tropical north of Australia in the summer half of the year,” the BoM has previously noted. Conditions in the northern half of Australia between October through March were favourable for thunderstorms, it said. “Lower pressure lies across northern and central Australia, and gives rise to the vertical motion and low level convergence that favour thunderstorm development.” But it also said “severe winter storms linked to cold fronts are common in the south-west of Western Australia and south-east South Australia.” What effect does climate change have on thunderstorms? According to the CSIRO’s 2022 state of the environment report, daily rainfall totals associated with storms have increased in Australia since 1979, especially in northern parts of the country. “This is primarily due to an increase in the intensity of rainfall per storm,” it found. In future decades, Australia is projected to experience fewer tropical cyclones, but an increased proportion of high-intensity storms with higher rainfall. Rainfall events are predicted to intensify with global heating, as the atmosphere is able to hold about 7% more water vapour for each degree of warming. Rapid storm-related extreme rainfall events may intensify at an even higher rate, according to the Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub, because “the additional moisture in the atmosphere may also cause more intense convection for thunderstorms”. Short duration rainfall intensity could increase by about 15% for each degree of warming, it has warned. Historical analysis by the BoM found no consistent link between peaks and troughs in thunderstorm frequency and El Niño or La Niña events. However, it found “some evidence that thunderstorms tended to be less frequent over south-eastern Australia” – Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra particularly – during strong El Niño years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T14:00:06Z","webTitle":"Solar to soon offer grid more capacity than coal, consultancy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","fields":{"headline":"Solar to soon offer grid more capacity than coal, consultancy says","bodyText":"Australia’s rooftops now boast 20 gigawatts of solar panels and will soon have the capacity to produce more electricity than the country’s entire coal industry, according to the industry consultancy SunWiz. Almost one in three Australian households have solar photovoltaics – or solar panels – the highest penetration in the world. Queensland had the highest share of solar panels installed on dwellings deemed suitable for the technology with an 82% penetration, ahead of South Australia’s 78%, New South Wales’ 51% and Victoria’s 43%. The take-up of solar PV has quickened. It took about 11 years for Australia to reach its first 10GW of capacity, while the second 10GW took just four years, according to SunWiz. Combining the household solar panel capacity with the 11GW of large-scale solar plants, “solar energy is already Australia’s largest fuel source for electrical power in Australia”, according to Warwick Johnston, the managing director of SunWiz. Once AGL Energy closes the remaining units of its 1680MW Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW’s Hunter Valley next month, rooftop solar alone will have more so-called name-plate capacity than Australia’s remaining coal fleet, SunWiz said. That measure refers to the output a device is intended to be able to produce. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Queensland’s relatively sunny climate has encouraged residents there to host 5.2GW of solar PV, with the 1 millionth rooftop solar panel system to be installed soon. NSW is installing the most additional capacity of any state, with almost 100MW being added monthly, SunWiz said. Rooftop solar is often the largest supplier of electricity during the middle of the day, helping to drive demand in the national electricity market to record lows, including during the December quarter. The relative abundance of solar power, though, is creating challenges for large-scale generators, particularly operators of coal plants that struggle to ramp output up and down to meet fluctuating demand. According to a report by Green Energy Markets for the Clean Energy Regulator, the next 10GW of rooftop solar will take just over three years to be installed. Total installations will near 3GW in 2023 and exceed 3.2GW next year, setting a new annual high after the industry recovered from the Covid-related disruptions to supplies from China. Consumers, too, are increasingly focused on the prospect of power prices rising and staying high, according to Tristan Edis, director of analysis at Green Energy Markets. “The price of a system had gone up quite a bit” in 2021-22, at a time when electricity prices had started to drop, Edis said. “And then kind of all hell broke loose with the forward market,” he said, referring to future prices on the electricity market. The Australian Electricity Regulator in May 2022 lifted its default power prices by as much as 20% in a decision delayed by the Morrison government until after the federal election. Since then, the Albanese government has intervened with price caps for coal and gas in a bid to limit the size of further increases. Households that have solar are also increasingly looking to expand or more likely replace older, smaller units, the Green Energy Markets report said. “Upgrades and replacements accounted for 19% of total PV capacity installed in 2022 and we expect that this will increase to 27% by 2027,” the report said. SunWiz’s Johnston said the market for rooftop solar “is not at saturation point – that’s still a long way off”. More households were also taking up larger solar systems particularly if they planned to add batteries or operate electric vehicles. About 15% of solar system installations now also include batteries, he said. The prospects for large-scale solar, though, were not so promising, at least in the near-term. “The pipeline of solar farms under development has dried up, and we expect it to be the worst year for solar farms since Australia started their rollout in earnest in 2018,” Johnston said. The headline on this article was amended on 1 March 2023 to clarify that while solar now has more capacity than other energy sources in Australia, it is not the largest single source of electricity generation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T18:11:38Z","webTitle":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","fields":{"headline":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","bodyText":"The government’s latest budget will do little to meet the UK’s net zero carbon goals, missed opportunities to create a green economy, and would saddle households with high energy bills driven by fossil fuel prices, green campaigners and experts have said. Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, was a self-styled “green Tory” as a backbencher, and in his speech gave a nod towards the UK’s green ambitions with a boost for nuclear power and for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But missing from the budget was any hint of the hoped-for focus on home insulation, any strengthening of the windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, or removal of the barriers to onshore windfarms. Instead, the continuing freeze on fuel duty will benefit drivers of fuel-guzzling SUVs, and would leave the UK on the starting blocks while other countries – including the US, the EU and China – are racing ahead in creating green jobs, analysts said. Luke Murphy, associate director for energy and climate at the IPPR thinktank, said: “There is a global race to the top in reaching net zero, and the UK now risks falling seriously behind our competitors. The government needs to learn the lessons from the US and Europe, ramp up public investment, and bring forward a green industrial strategy, safeguarding our economy and environment for the future.” Hunt repeated his mantra of four Es for the UK’s future investment – enterprise, education, employment and everywhere. Josh Burke, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, part of the London School of Economics, said: “This budget has failed to deliver a long-term, economy-wide investment plan to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient growth. The two Es missing from the industrial strategy are the environment and energy.” Ami McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the focus on small nuclear plants, called small modular reactors, and CCS, both early-stage technologies, missed out far more realistic opportunities to pursue low-carbon power. “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?” she asked. “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.” Hunt announced no new spending on home insulation, and did not bring forward spending on energy efficiency allocated for 2025, despite clear research showing that insulation can keep people’s homes warmer amid high energy bills, and calls from the government’s own statutory climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, to prioritise insulation. Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: “We are disappointed that the chancellor appears to be taking his foot off the pedal. By failing to bring forward planned spending on energy efficiency measures, he has missed a golden opportunity to both reduce energy bills and decarbonise the housing sector.” Transport policy was another missed opportunity, added Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the New Economics Foundation. Drivers of larger cars are the biggest winners from the continuing freeze on fuel duty, while people on lower incomes are more likely to use lower-carbon public transport. “The government is continuing to subsidise polluting travel and disproportionately benefiting higher earners, with the 13th freeze on fuel duty in a row,” said Stirling. After the budget announcement, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs he was “busting a gut” to get solar power on rooftops, including those of large buildings such as warehouses. He told the environmental audit committee he was working to remove the requirement for planning permission for solar installations above 1MW, which was inhibiting installations on the roofs of commercial buildings. But he indicated he would not mandate solar power on the rooftops of new houses, as some MPs urged him to do. He said the government would require, in its forthcoming future homes standard, that new homes must produce 75% less carbon dioxide than homes built in 2013, but that ministers would leave up to housebuilders how this was achieved, because mandating particular technologies would “reduce innovation”, he claimed. “There is more than one way to skin a cat,” he told MPs. “The hesitation is over saying ‘this is the only thing you can put in’.” Shapps also promised a far greater green push to come, after the budget. The government is obliged by a high court ruling last year to publish by the end of this month clear plans on how to reach the net zero target. A response to the review of the net zero target by Chris Skidmore, published early this year, will come out at the same time. The announcement, due in a fortnight, will contain plans to boost hydrogen, wind power, solar energy and heat pumps, according to Shapps. “There will be much more I can say then,” he told MPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/22/america-green-energy-obstacles-fossils","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T11:00:32Z","webTitle":"America’s big shift to green energy has a woolly mammoth problem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/22/america-green-energy-obstacles-fossils","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/22/america-green-energy-obstacles-fossils","fields":{"headline":"America’s big shift to green energy has a woolly mammoth problem","bodyText":"America’s renewable energy drive needs more than a million miles of new transmission lines but emerging resistance includes opponents worried about building them in one of the country’s richest areas of ice-age fossils. The Greenlink West project would build a 470-mile-long transmission line bringing clean electricity north of Las Vegas to Reno in Nevada, but it cuts through an area containing everything from woolly mammoth tusks to giant sloths to ancient camels. The pushback has highlighted a major, and growing, challenge to Joe Biden’s attempts to expand clean energy in order to tackle the climate crisis – how to quickly build vast new networks of electricity transmission across America without falling afoul of local communities and green groups. If the US is to eliminate planet-heating emissions by 2050 it will need to increase the capacity of its current 700,000 circuit-mile network of poles and wires by threefold, researchers have estimated, in order to electrify key components of everyday life and shift intermittent wind and solar energy to areas where the sun isn’t shining or wind isn’t blowing. The nascent stages of this gargantuan effort, the scale of which hasn’t been seen since the US built out its highway system in the 1950s, is already facing opposition from various conservation groups, locals and fossil fuel interests from New England to the Arizona desert. “Transmission is contentious because it’s long, it’s linear, so it affects a lot of people,” said Jessica Wilkinson, North America renewable energy team lead at the Nature Conservancy. “We are seeing local concerns being raised and they are growing as these projects increase in size. It’s all new to people.” Suddenly, as lawmakers jostle over ways to speed up new projects, local opposition seems likely to grow. “It’s only been energy nerds like me into this, most people haven’t really thought about it,” said Tim Latimer, chief executive of Fervo Energy, a developer of geothermal projects. “But this is the next big barrier to renewables. There really is no transition without transmission.” Those committed to preventing the defilement of valued landscapes are now placed in a conundrum where an unprecedented amount of infrastructure development is needed to protect those landscapes, as well as people, from global heating. Sherri Grotheer, president of the Protectors of Tule Springs Fossil Beds, said that she is “very concerned” about climate crisis but that she wanted federal authorities to come up with an alternative route for Greenlink than slicing through the Nevada monument, which could disturb fossils that are hundreds of thousands of years old. “Sometimes kneejerk reactions can cause unintended consequences and we know there are innumerable fossils left here, there is evidence of fossils everywhere just under the surface,” she said of Tule Springs, a 23,000-acre monument situated north of Las Vegas protected for its fossils under the auspices of the National Park Service since 2014. “It’s one of the most significant fossil sites in the continental US and maybe beyond,” said Grotheer. “It’s just very cool. I just want them to look at alternative routes. There is also the concern of putting projects like this in national parks, because then you think ‘where does this end?’” For developers of renewable energy projects, however, the lack of transmission capacity is a major headache. Even as clean energy projects have gathered pace, turbocharged by last year’s $370bn in climate spending via the Inflation Reduction Act, they face frustrating waits to be connected to a fragmented, congested electricity grid. The typical wait is now nearly four years, with much longer delays than this experienced by some companies. While the tap of new funding for renewables is now gushing, it risks being wasted due to the lack of a metaphorical hosepipe. The US Department of Energy has said there is a “pressing need” for new infrastructure, with California alone needing to add more than $9bn-worth of new transmission to avoid rolling power blackouts as wildfires and other climate-driven disruptions mount. “We need to solve this problem if we are going to deal with climate change,” said Latimer. Fervo has been able to establish geothermal projects in Utah and Nevada – tapping into the steam from underground heat to spin turbines – but Latimer said other opportunities have been hampered by the lack of grid opportunities. “I can’t tell you how many places we’ve seen and thought, ‘Wow, the geology is excellent for geothermal, but we just can’t get the transmission,’” he said. “It’s difficult to get private finance for something where you can’t get revenues for nine more years, so you just give up. The system is gummed up but that is just the tip of the iceberg because many people don’t even try to get a spot in the line.” Wilkinson said that smart planning can avoid disturbing valued landscapes and help reduce this tension. A recent report she co-authored found that while an area the size of Texas is needed for new renewable projects and their power lines in the US, this can be shrunk by more than half if sited in an efficient way, avoiding sensitive habitats and prized cropland. “We have the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss and there is an assumption we will need to trade off a lot on the nature side to fix climate change, but that’s not the case,” she said. “Time is of the essence, we need to transition to renewables quickly, but there is a way to do it smartly that can balance conservation and development.” Congress is now grappling with how to speed up the permitting of new transmission projects, as part of the negotiations over the debt ceiling. Republicans and Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat senator, want to weaken environmental impact reviews of new developments, a prospect that environmental groups are wary of as an avenue for fossil fuel projects such as the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a gas project championed by Manchin that gained a key approval from the Biden administration earlier this month. The White House, meanwhile, has indicated it supports expedited permitting, but not a wholesale watering down of environmental laws. “Right now, the permitting process for clean energy infrastructure, including transmission, is plagued by delays and bottlenecks,” admitted John Podesta, a senior Biden climate adviser, in a speech last week. Podesta said he recently learned that a transmission line he thought was approved under Barack Obama’s presidency still hadn’t been resolved. “That’s unacceptable,” he said. “We got so good at stopping projects that we forgot how to build things in America.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/jan/25/late-night-recap-jimmy-kimmel-mike-pence-classified-documents","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-25T16:28:32Z","webTitle":"Jimmy Kimmel on Mike Pence’s classified documents: ‘It’s an epidemic’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/25/late-night-recap-jimmy-kimmel-mike-pence-classified-documents","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/jan/25/late-night-recap-jimmy-kimmel-mike-pence-classified-documents","fields":{"headline":"Jimmy Kimmel on Mike Pence’s classified documents: ‘It’s an epidemic’","bodyText":"Jimmy Kimmel Oscar nominations were announced on Tuesday morning, and though Avatar: The Way of Water received a nod for best picture, James Cameron was not nominated for best director. “Which is what you get for making us put on those dumb glasses for four hours,” Jimmy Kimmel joked on Tuesday evening. Another nomination for best animated short went to a movie called My Year of Dicks, whose title cracked presenter Riz Ahmed up. “I’d never heard of the movie before,” Kimmel laughed. “I went to look up My Year of Dicks and now my computer won’t turn on.” Kimmel then returned to the perennial late-night topic of late: classified documents found in various politicians’ private residences. This time, it was Mike Pence, who returned about a dozen classified documents found in his Indiana home to the FBI. “Mike Pence has them too now!” Kimmel exclaimed. “This is unbelievable. It’s an epidemic.” The Pence news was especially interesting, Kimmel noted, because the former vice-president was specifically asked about taking classified documents home in an ABC news interview from November. Asked if he kept any, Pence answered: “I did not.” “Is that your final answer?” Kimmel said. “Because according to his lawyer, they discovered the documents in January” in “Mike’s kitchen, behind the Pence family mayonnaises”. Of all the people, Donald Trump came to Pence’s defense, posting on Truth Social: “Mike Pence is an innocent man. He never did anything knowingly dishonest in his life. Leave him alone!!!” “Unfortunately that post came two years and 18 days late,” Kimmel said. “When they were planning to hang him, he was like ‘you made your bed, I wish I could help.’” Stephen Colbert On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also addressed Pence’s classified documents. “Wow, that is tough news for Mike Pence, and fantastic news for Joe Biden,” he joked. “Unlike Pence’s former boss, Pence wasn’t hoarding the documents,” Colbert added. The former VP said he took them home by accident, and they were found by one of his lawyers who Pence asked to search his home out of an “abundance of caution”. “An ‘abundance of caution’ is why Mike Pence leaves the room when TV commercials come on,” Colbert quipped. “So evidently, everybody in US government just has classified documents lying around their houses,” he continued. “This never used to happen. Previous veeps had methods to dispose of this kind of thing. Al Gore would immediately recycle documents, and Dick Cheney would shoot them in the face. “I mean, to think Mike Pence’s legacy could be tarnished by one stupid mistake. Well, two stupid mistakes,” he said over a photo of Pence with Donald Trump. Additionally, four more Oath Keepers were found guilty of seditious conspiracy for January 6 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. “They should be happy – they tried to break into a government facility, and now they get to live in one,” Colbert said. The Daily Show And on the Daily Show, guest host Wanda Sykes panned a television ad for oil and gas – not a particular company, just the concept of oil and gas. “Those greedy, oily bastards,” she said. The ad, paid for by a group called Energy Transfer LP and run during a football game, ponders what would happen if oil and gas disappeared by having various objects – phones, clothing, hair color, a football about to be kicked on TV, the TV itself – turn to dust. “See this proves, y’all, that we’re doing something right, because they’re getting nervous,” said Sykes. “Because we’re buying electric cars, we’re switching to solar energy, and they’re like ‘but we also make footballs!’ “But you know what, I will agree with them on one thing: if there was no oil our world would be unrecognizable,” she added. “It would look like this,” she said next to a picture of a screensaver-green meadow. “What’s all that green shit at the bottom? Is that grass? I mean, I heard about it in history class, I don’t know.” Sykes also noted that the household objects turning to dust resembled the Thanos snap in the Avengers. “So these guys are in the boardroom like, ‘we need to improve our image – we could be more like Thanos, right?’” she laughed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T04:32:39Z","webTitle":"Queensland windfarm to provide enough power for 1.4m homes with new $2bn investment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/28/queensland-windfarm-to-provide-enough-power-for-14m-homes-with-new-2bn-investment","fields":{"headline":"Queensland windfarm to provide enough power for 1.4m homes with new $2bn investment","bodyText":"One of Australia’s biggest windfarms will double its capacity to 2,000 megawatts, providing enough power for 1.4m homes and accelerating Queensland’s exit from fossil fuel-sourced electricity. Spain-based Acciona Energia announced on Monday it would extend a windfarm already being built within the MacIntyre Precinct, a region about 200km south-west of Brisbane. That first stage involves just under $2bn in investment and the construction of 180 wind turbines, each standing about 230m high with 5.7MW of capacity. The MacIntyre region is being developed in partnership with CleanCo, the Queensland government’s renewable energy arm, and has an expected start date in 2024. “With this project we expect to dramatically accelerate the decarbonisation of Queensland’s electricity grid,” said Acciona’s managing director in Australia, Brett Wickham. “Workers can move from one large-scale project to the next whilst staying in the same area.” The state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the expansion plan was “a strong endorsement that Queensland is a renewable energy superpower”. Two months ago, Queensland announced a $62bn plan to accelerate its decarbonisation efforts, including an end to coal-fired power stations by as early as 2035. Up until then, the state had been the national laggard in terms of the share of renewable energy in the grid. The announcement of another $2bn to be pumped into renewables comes days after the Clean Energy Council said new commitment for large wind and solar plants had hit the lowest level in at least five years in the September quarter. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Just one new project, at 400MW, reached financial close during the period, down almost two-thirds on a year earlier. The council blamed policy uncertainty in recent years – particularly at the federal level – for the investment slowdown. Known as the Herries Range project, Acciona’s extension would also host 180 wind turbines and support as many as 600 additional jobs during construction, the deputy premier, Steven Miles, said. The state’s energy and jobs plan boasts more than 50 large-scale renewable energy projects that are operational, under construction or have reached financial commitment from developers, the government said. Prior to Monday’s announcement, New South Wales had signed up the most new projects and capacity over the past year, with eight projects accounting for more than a third of new projects and 65% of new capacity nationally, according to the Clean Energy Council. Victoria had the next most with six new projects accounting for 19% of new capacity, while Queensland had six projects (at 6% of capacity) and WA with three projects (and 4% of capacity). Acciona’s focus on windfarms rather than solar may be a template for other big energy companies. AGL Energy, for instance, has plans to invest as much as $20bn over the next decade or so into renewables and storage as its coal-fired power plants close. Its focus is likely to be on wind rather than solar energy because of the need to complement rather than compete with the spread of solar panels on households across the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/25/keeps-going-driving-first-production-ready-solar-car-lightyear-0","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-25T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘It keeps on going’: driving the world’s first production-ready solar car","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/25/keeps-going-driving-first-production-ready-solar-car-lightyear-0","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/25/keeps-going-driving-first-production-ready-solar-car-lightyear-0","fields":{"headline":"‘It keeps on going’: driving the world’s first production-ready solar car","bodyText":"Winding past the ochre-coloured plateaux of the Bardenas Reales natural park in northern Spain, Roel Grooten nudged me to take my foot off the accelerator. The car continued to barrel down the open stretch of road, its speed dipping only slightly. “It keeps on going,” said Grooten, the lead engineer for the Dutch car company Lightyear, as we whizzed through the lunar-like landscape. “What you feel is nothing holding you back. You feel the aerodynamics, you feel the low-rolling resistance of the tyres, of the bearings and the motor.” It is this streamlined design that the company credits for allowing it to muscle its way into a space long overlooked by most car manufacturers. As early as November, the company will start delivery of what it describes as the “world’s first production-ready solar car” – the Lightyear 0, a €250,000 (£215,000) sedan draped in 5 sq metres of curved solar panels that top up the electric battery while the car is driving or parked outdoors. “If we would have the same amount of energy that we harvest on these panels on any other car that uses three times the amount of energy to drive, it becomes useless. It becomes a very expensive gimmick,” said Grooten. “You have to build this car from the ground up, to make it as efficient as possible, to make it this feasible.” In optimal conditions, the solar panels can add up to 44 miles a day to the 388-mile range the car gets between charges, according to the company. Tests carried out by Lightyear suggest people with a daily commute of less than 22 miles could drive for two months in the Netherlands without needing to plug in, while those in sunnier climes such as Portugal or Spain could go as long as seven months. But whether the company’s gamble on solar will pay off remains to be seen, said Jim Saker, professor emeritus at Loughborough University and president of the Institute of the Motor Industry. “You’re having to pay an awful lot of money and have solar panels stuck on the car for just 44 additional miles. The question mark at the moment is the fact that, in reality, is that actually worth it? The actual concept isn’t bad. It’s just whether the technology is actually viable to make it economically sustainable for anybody wanting to do this.” Sales of the Lightyear 0 would probably be limited to a handful of early adopters, he added. “But in reality, it’s not a commercial proposition at the moment.” Others questioned the idea of a car being touted as a salve to the ever deepening climate crisis. “The most sustainable way to approach car ownership is actually to avoid it entirely, if you can at all,” said Vera O’Riordan, a PhD student focusing on low-carbon pathways and policies for passenger transport at University College Cork in Ireland. While electric vehicles may have a limited role to play in rural areas that lack public transport, she cited research suggesting these vehicles are often sold to high-income households in urban areas. “So you have to ask yourself the question: are you serving this individualised, very inefficient, very harmful and traffic-inducing transport in urban areas where it could otherwise be perfectly met by public transport and walking and cycling?” The need to move away from cars to tackle the climate emergency is – perhaps surprisingly – echoed by Lex Hoefsloot, the 31-year-old chief executive of Lightyear, who has raised about €150m in investment to get it running. “It would be great, I fully agree,” he said. “But I think we’re not going to change our lives too much. Perhaps, when we’re really panicking in 20 years, we might. But in the meantime, we have to work around that.” Since 2016 the company has championed solar energy as a key part of this work-around, envisioning solar cars capable of running on clean energy and accelerating the transition away from polluting fossil fuels. “People were saying it wasn’t possible, mostly because of the limited amount of solar power you could get on a car,” said Hoefsloot. His own experience, however, suggested otherwise. The Lightyear 0 – a sleek four-wheel drive – traces its roots to a squat box-on-wheels that ferried four helmet-clad university students across the Australian outback to win in its class in the 2013 world solar challenge. “If it works in Australia, then it works everywhere. That was the thinking,” said Hoefsloot, who founded Lightyear with four other members of the solar challenge team. “Early days, I must admit there was a hesitation whether we should go full car manufacturing, because we all know it’s not the easiest thing. But there was nobody else out there that was really willing to or doing something similar.” In recent years there has been an upswell of interest in integrating solar panels into cars: Mercedes-Benz recently revealed plans to outfit an upcoming electric car with rooftop solar panels, while Toyota has at times offered limited-capacity solar panels as an add-on to its Prius hybrid. Next year, Munich-based Sono Motors plans to roll out a €28,500 solar-assisted family car, while the California-based startup Aptera Motors said in 2020 that preorders for its futuristic three-wheeled solar electric vehicle sold out in less than 24 hours. With months left before the Lightyear 0’s production run, there are still kinks to be worked out, from a stiff steering wheel to the buzz that at times fills the car when the air conditioning kicks in. Once you are in the car, there is little about the driving experience that feels different from other electric cars – “That’s a huge compliment, that’s what we’re aiming for,” one staff member tells me – save for a smattering of reminders about the constant drip feed of solar energy. One screen shows exactly what cells are feeding off the sun at any given moment, while another quantifies how much solar energy is being absorbed. In an effort to use as much of this solar energy as possible, the windswept design eschews side-view mirrors for cameras and runs off lightweight electric motors tucked into its wheels. The body panels are crafted from reclaimed carbon fibre and the interiors are fashioned from vegan, plant-based leather with fabrics made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The 20-minute test run is probably the only time I will sit at the wheel of the Lightyear 0. With its hefty price tag – ideally paid by those who have an outdoor parking space to maximise the car’s gain from the sun – it is not a car for the masses. Instead, the company envisions the production run, which will offer up to 946 vehicles for delivery across Europe and the UK, as a beginning of sorts. “This is a small scale to validate to the world that we can produce a car,” said Telian Franken, the prototype team lead. From there, the company will shift its focus to a second solar-assisted electric car it is aiming to sell for about €30,000 as early as 2025. “We’re trying to make the difference, not for the millionaire who can afford a €250,000 car, but to get us to the point where the average person can get off grid – get a reliable sustainable vehicle that beats toe-for-toe any econo-box you can get at the time,” said Franken, citing the Toyota Corolla or Honda Accord as examples. “That’s what we’re trying to beat – and replace – because it’s not sustainable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/nov/30/thurrock-council-repeatedly-ignored-warnings-of-risks-to-public-money","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T18:59:17Z","webTitle":"Thurrock council ignored bankruptcy warnings and took ‘unprecedented risks’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/30/thurrock-council-repeatedly-ignored-warnings-of-risks-to-public-money","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/nov/30/thurrock-council-repeatedly-ignored-warnings-of-risks-to-public-money","fields":{"headline":"Thurrock council ignored bankruptcy warnings and took ‘unprecedented risks’","bodyText":"The Tory-led Thurrock council, which is on the brink of bankruptcy after losing hundreds of millions of pounds on failed commercial investments, repeatedly ignored warnings from financial experts over the “unprecedented risks” it was taking with public money, it has emerged. According to documents obtained by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), Thurrock’s top finance official failed to act despite being cautioned about the scale, speed and risky nature of the council’s investments. According to the BIJ, Sean Clark, the corporate director of resources at Thurrock council, was the senior official behind a string of business deals in which it borrowed £1bn – several times its annual spending on local services – to invest in bonds linked to solar energy and other businesses. They included £655m invested in a solar farms company, Toucan Holdings 1, which went into administration this month, and £94m in Just Loans Group plc, a business lender which went bust in June. These two deals alone have left the council exposed to potential losses of up to £250m. Thurrock admitted on Tuesday that it faces a near £500m budget deficit this year – thought to be the biggest of its kind seen in local government – after writing off £275m on deals that went sour and setting aside a further £130m to pay back investments debts. The council has been forced to go cap in hand to the government for a bailout to keep it afloat and has warned it may have to drastically cut services and jobs, sell off assets and raise council tax as it attempts to recover from what opposition politicians called the “catastrophic handling” of its affairs in recent years. Clark, who earned £130,000 a year, was suspended on full pay from his role in September after the government sent in commissioners to take over the running of the council’s finances amid ministerial concerns over the “the exceptional level of financial risk and debt incurred”. According to the BIJ, Clark was personally warned in March 2018 by the council’s financial advisers Arlingclose of its urgent concerns regarding the council’s “extreme” appetite for risk. Arlingclose said in a letter it felt this was a level of risk “well beyond” all of its other clients, even those who had adopted relatively aggressive strategies. “The scale, risks and speed of implementation of the council’s activities which are based around a significant ‘borrow to invest’ strategy is of particular concern to us,” the letter said. It highlighted risk areas including £370m invested in unrated bonds, high levels of debt and “huge exposure” to local authority funding. The letter continued: “The council’s activities could be viewed as going well beyond what is prudent even though, we appreciate, the pressure to adopt more commercial practices within the significant financial and political issues exists within local government and at Thurrock in particular.” Clark subsequently terminated the council’s relationship with Arlingclose. Separately, an internal report into Clark’s conduct, leaked to the BIJ, alleges he failed to act upon Arlingclose’s concerns, or properly advise other senior figures, including senior councillors, of the risks associated with the investment strategy. The report referred to a “systematically lax” culture of due diligence on investments under Clark. “Evidence indicates that the quality of governance in place for a £1bn investment programme was inadequate and the scale of the delegated authority was too great.” Clark did not respond to requests from the Guardian for comment. Thurrock council said it did not comment publicly on internal employment matters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/07/10000-litres-day-pitch-qatar-world-cup-huge-impact-gulf-waters","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-07T11:25:28Z","webTitle":"10,000 litres a day for each pitch: water strain in the Gulf and the Qatar World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/07/10000-litres-day-pitch-qatar-world-cup-huge-impact-gulf-waters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/07/10000-litres-day-pitch-qatar-world-cup-huge-impact-gulf-waters","fields":{"headline":"10,000 litres a day for each pitch: water strain in the Gulf and the Qatar World Cup","bodyText":"As the World Cup approaches, Qatar is going to need at least 10,000 litres of water every day for each of its stadium pitches. Based in a region with virtually no access to fresh water, it is going to rely on desalination – the practice of debrining saltwater so it is drinkable. It seems like an elegant solution – but the problem is that desalination, which is projected to boom by 37% across the Gulf region in the next five years, has huge environmental costs, in terms of the fossils fuels used to carry out the process, and the marine environment. But without it, how can the arid region possibly quench its thirst? Forty-three per cent of the world’s desalination capacity comes from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Despite the scarcity of water, the GCC are among the highest consumers of it in the world, and heavily dependent on desalination plants. The United Arab Emirates has one of the highest per capita water consumption rates in the world, with people using roughly 500 litres a day – 50% above the global average. Yet many GCC countries such as the UAE are still keen to promote water-rich lifestyles through desalination efforts. Manicured lawns and waterparks are commonplace across cities, and at the Dubai fountain show, every half hour throughout the day more than 83,000 litres of water shoot up as high as a 50-storey building. But with populations rising, the region’s water industry is facing increasing pressure. “These plants essentially have rivers running through them. If you look at the desalination capacity across the GCC as a whole, the volume of water flowing through that is about four times the amount of water flowing down the Thames,” says Will Le Quesne, the Middle East programme director for the UK Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. Maryam Rashed Al Shehhi, an assistant professor of civil infrastructure and environmental engineering at Khalifa University in the UAE, says: “Desalination is our main source of fresh water. It’s a very arid region, and annual rainfall has decreased. So it’s very scary to think about any other sources of water.” Since the 1950s the GCC have been at the vanguard of desalination. The southern coasts of the Gulf are dotted with more than 300 desalination plants – mostly in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain. Powering the world’s greatest concentration of desalination requires a significant amount of energy. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, makes up a fifth of the world’s output, with roughly 30 desalination plants burning through 300,000 barrels of crude oil a day. In fact, most desalination plants are oil or gas powered, operating with either thermal processing technology, which collects steam from boiling water and condenses it, or the more modern reverse osmosis technology, which relies heavily on electricity produced using natural gas to power pumps that force water through very fine membranes, essentially straining out the salts in the water. “Either way, you need quite a lot of energy. That can be derived from a lot of sources including by burning fossil fuels,” says Le Quesne. So although Qatar maintains the World Cup will be carbon-neutral, climate organisations are already expressing doubts. The water demands alone are eye-watering. The tournament will need to manage pitches across eight stadiums, and more than 130 additional training grounds. The delicate and complicated process of creating the right turf for football in the Qatar climate just as the weather begins to cool means the groundsmen have to mimic winter, expert Haitham Al Shareef told Reuters, blowing chilled air over the grass and watering the pitch with at least 10,000 litres of desalinated water. And for emergencies, “a 425,000 sq metre reserve of grass – some 40 soccer pitches worth – is growing at a farm north of Doha”. The water consumption of that patch is not recorded. And despite national commitments to reducing carbon emissions and meeting net zero targets, the region is expecting to do more desalination, not less, with capacity planned to expand 37% by 2027. This could be devastating for the Gulf’s marine ecosystem, says Le Quesne. Desalination is one of the worst marine pollution drivers around the world, producing brine, a highly saline waste fluid usually released into the sea as saltier, toxic and warmer seawater. It can contain chemicals such as chlorine, heavy metals, and anti-foaming agents that are added during the desalination process, which can harm coral reefs and smaller marine organisms that live on the seabed. Along with water, smaller organisms also risk getting sucked into the system and can get impinged, crashing into the screens of the intake pipes, or entrained, travelling with water reaching the plant, resulting in severe injury and death. “The microscopic plants of the sea, things like fish eggs, will all get drawn into the system and experience very high levels of mortality. Most of them are typically destroyed on their way through the system,” says Le Quesne. With growing environmental concerns, GCC countries including the UAE and Oman are exploring methods involving solar energy. By far the most ambitious plan is Saudi Arabia’s solar dome, the world’s first zero-brine discharge desalination plant. Announced in 2020, the project is now being prototyped as part of Neom, the outlandish $500bn (£447bn) planned megacity. Partnering with a London-based company, Solar Water, the 20-metre high dome made from glass and steel is proposed to be surrounded by mirrors that will collect sunlight to heat up the seawater, condense it in a separate chamber, and distill it into fresh water. “The dome itself will be illuminated by this strong sunlight. It’ll look like a sparkling jewel in the desert,” says Christopher Sansom, a professor of concentrating solar power at the University of Derby and a director at Solar Water. But although the solar dome will, the designers say, be cheaper to build and operate than conventional plants, it will also produce significantly less water. Though Saudi Arabia has no shortage of sunlight, solar-powered desalination can have its limitations, says Sansom. Any interference with clouds or wind can stop the power from being generated. Dust is another factor that can hinder the technology. In a desert environment such as Saudi Arabia, solar panels need to be wiped clean. While promising, Al Shehhi says desalination plants running completely with solar energy is not yet practical and more research is needed into implementing more renewable energy into the desalination process. “It’s a challenge. The amount of water pumped every day from the Gulf to be desalinated is huge,” she says. And that is before a World Cup is added into the equation. • This article was amended on 10 October 2022. An earlier version referred incorrectly to “144 pitches across eight stadiums”. The headline was also changed to more accurately reflect that the Qatar World Cup is part of the water strain issues affecting the Gulf region, rather than the sole cause of it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2023/may/22/herm-channel-islands-car-free","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"This tiny Channel Island – population 65 – feels like a place cut adrift: exploring car-free Herm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/22/herm-channel-islands-car-free","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2023/may/22/herm-channel-islands-car-free","fields":{"headline":"This tiny Channel Island – population 65 – feels like a place cut adrift: exploring car-free Herm","bodyText":"At 6.30am, I walk to the empty beach at Belvoir Bay. The sand is soft, the sky is pink, Normandy lines the horizon. The only sounds are the murmur of the waves and the piping of oystercatchers. I plunge into the sea. Immediately, the cove is filled with terrible swearwords: I force myself to stay in the water, spluttering and cursing but growing less cold with each swimming stroke. Hours later, sipping coffee while overlooking another deserted beach, my skin is still zinging and my mood is irritatingly smug. A dunking in the bay is an apt way to start the day on Herm. The tiny, comma-shaped Channel Island – stretching just under 1.5 miles from top to bottom, and less than half a mile across – feels like a place cut adrift. This is emphatically a good thing. The island has a permanent population of 65 and a history that yawns back to the Neolithic era. Puffins breed on its southern cliffs; rabbits nibble in its flower meadows; migrant warblers cluster in its pine groves. You’ll find no cars, or even bikes, and the primary school has four pupils. The island’s name sounds like a hesitation, but its pretty hills, woods and beaches demand to be savoured in the here and now. Well, most of the time. Shortly after my arrival on the 15-minute boat crossing from Guernsey, a spring downpour brings gale-force winds and horizontal rain. It gives me the chance to do an inventory of the harbourside buildings – one hotel, two pubs, a handful of stone cottages, an old prison big enough for one – and to watch the waves being whipped into a dark fury. When the storm passes and the sun returns the island feels washed clean, the sands flowing white into a turquoise sea. I’m here for a short visit, partly to find out more about Herm’s drive to become less carbon-reliant. “I always say the scenery is a mix between the Caribbean, the North York Moors and the Pembrokeshire coastline,” says the island’s CEO Craig Senior. (Yes, an island with a CEO: Herm is owned by the States of Guernsey, which leases it for use as a visitor destination. The current tenants are former Guernsey residents John and Julia Singer, who had their first date on Herm in the mid-90s and took on the lease in 2008.) Craig is a gregarious Rotherham United fan, here since 2019 with his wife and children. He is tailed by his dog, Harvey, who has the run of the island and is possibly the world’s happiest sproodle. “Herm’s part of the British Isles, it’s part of the Channel Islands, but more than anything it’s just Herm,” he says. There’s simultaneously lots to do – eat, drink, swim, walk, kayak, birdwatch, jog, mooch, poke your nose into the millennium-old chapel, stargaze, sleep – and little in the way of diversion. If that sounds contradictory, welcome to Herm. As well as the White House hotel, which has sea views and serves classy evening meals, visitors can stay in self-catering cottages or at one of two campsites. The island knows how to draw a crowd in summer (among its various events, Utah Saints played a gig here in 2022, with DJ-producer Sasha doing the same this September), but in the shoulder season it feels like a seaborne secret. It’s also somewhere that is trying to do things the right way. Herm has been making strides to become more eco-friendly over the last couple of years. The Isle of Herm ferry service from Guernsey runs on biofuel – hydrotreated vegetable oil – and 60% of the boilers on the island have been converted to do the same, with the rest to follow. Solar panels are at campsite washblocks, and a tender is out for a solar energy farm in one of the more isolated meadows. “We’re on a bit of a journey,” says Craig. While there is more to be done to reduce the island’s footprint, he is proud of what has been achieved. Six nature trail boards have recently been erected around the coast, a granite quarry has been reinvented as a zen garden, and all glass bottles are now crushed to provide hardcore for the shaggy-hedged lanes that thread the island. Craig suggests I take a stroll around Herm’s perimeter. The coastal path looks simple but hides nooks within nooks. The north of the island is low and sandy, dotted with rock pools and ancient tombs, while the south is high and wooded. There are bluebell drifts and deep caves, eucalyptus thickets and headlands that attract kestrels, gorse plateaux and hulking sea stacks. There are puffins in Puffin Bay and shells on Shell Beach. The ferry is coming into Herm’s harbour when I start the walk, and again when I finish two hours later. I get chatting to the skipper, Chad Murray, who has sailed these waters since doing a Duke of Edinburgh award, when he was 12. He’s Guernsey-based but used to come to Herm for Christmas with his children, bringing his own spruce tree across on the boat. “I love it over here. It’s just calming. It’s also a designated Ramsar site, which means it’s a wetland of international importance,” he says. Murray is planning on introducing summer boat tours around the island, to allow people to spot seals, seabirds and other marine life. I spend the next two days moving at Herm pace. I rent a kayak and bob along the east coast, staring at Sark as terns dive into the waves for fish. I meander around the lanes, listening to wrens and chiffchaffs singing in the blackthorn. I watch guillemots flying low over the sea, past the humped neighbouring isle of Jethou. I learn that the woman who runs the beach cafe is also one of the island’s firefighters (three callouts in five years, though nothing calamitous), and that the man who looks after waste management is also the island’s police officer (no one can remember the last arrest). And I try Channel Island ales at the Mermaid Tavern, where the ceiling is covered in pump-clips and cabbage palms stand over the beer garden. The Singers are passionate about looking after the island’s natural environment. This is evident when I join five residents for a beach clean, something arranged several times a year. It’s reassuringly fruitless. We spend 45 minutes walking two beaches and find a couple of washed-up plastic stirrers, a length of ship’s rope and a copper oxide-coated penny from the reign of King George VI. Previous custodians of the island have been similarly committed to keeping Herm unspoiled (with the possible exception of the Prussian prince who held the tenancy in the early 1900s and introduced wallabies). The most longstanding tenants were Peter and Jenny Wood, here for almost half a century from 1949. Jenny summed up Herm as a place “where time has trod lightly and the passing centuries made little impress on the lovely contours”. Well, quite. The island is a joy. Just brace yourself if you’re taking a sunrise dip. The White House hotel has doubles from £145 B&amp;B (from £237 in July-Aug). Self-catering cottages from £261 for three nights (or from £1,204 for minimum seven nights in July-Aug). Equipped camping from £85 a night in a tent sleeping six to eight.

The rate of the rise is even more striking, the fastest for 66m years, with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. The causes (I): fossil fuel burning Billions of tonnes of CO2 are still pumped into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. The slight reduction in 2020 as a result of coronavirus lockdowns was no more than a “tiny blip” in the continuing buildup of greenhouse gases, according to the World Meteorological Organization, and emissions have rebounded. The causes (II): forest destruction The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to CO2 emissions. It is also a significant cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth. The causes (III): methane emissions Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and emissions are increasing faster than at any time in 40 years of observations. Farming, especially cattle, as well as fossil fuel extraction and landfill sites, are responsible. Warming wetlands may also be contributing. The consequences: global temperature rise The planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population have risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. The consequences: rising sea levels Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually experience their cities being submerged, from New York, to London, to Shanghai. The consequences: shrinking Arctic sea ice As heating melts the sea ice, it reveals darker water that absorbs more of the sun’s heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America. The upside (I): wind and solar energy is soaring Huge cost drops have helped renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. The cost advantage over fossil fuels is even greater with the price rises following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and to tackle difficult sectors such as aviation and steel. The upside (II): electric vehicles The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast and governments are setting end dates for the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will rapidly dominate. The upside (III): battery costs Renewable energy is intermittent, varying as the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies with longer storage duration, such as green hydrogen, will also be needed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/aug/16/climate-proof-home-energy-clean-solar","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-16T11:00:34Z","webTitle":"Imagining the climate-proof home in the US: using the least energy possible from the cleanest sources","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/16/climate-proof-home-energy-clean-solar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/aug/16/climate-proof-home-energy-clean-solar","fields":{"headline":"Imagining the climate-proof home in the US: using the least energy possible from the cleanest sources","bodyText":"Dealing with the climate crisis involves the overhauling of many facets of life, but few of these changes will feel as tangible and personal as the transformation required within the home. The 128m households that dot America gobble up energy for heating, cooling and lighting, generating around 20% of all the planet-heating emissions produced in the US. Americans typically live in larger, more energy hungry dwellings than people in other countries, using more than double the energy of the average Briton and 10 times that of the average Chinese person. This sizable contribution is now coming under the scrutiny of Joe Biden’s administration, which recently put forward a raft of measures to build and upgrade 2m low-emissions homes. “Decarbonizing buildings is a big task but it’s an essential task,” said Michael Regan, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Rapid change will be needed to avoid disastrous climate change. To get to zero emissions by the middle of the century, the sale of fossil fuel boilers will have to end within five years, all new buildings will have to run on clean electricity by 2030 and half of all existing buildings will have to be fully retrofitted by 2040, a recent landmark International Energy Agency report warned. “The appliances we use at home have tended to be overlooked but they are contributing a significant amount to climate change and we need to address that,” said Mike Henchen, an expert in carbon-free buildings at RMI. “That will touch people’s lives – our homes are our refuges, the places we know best. But hopefully the change will also make people’s homes more comfortable, safer and healthier, as well as reduce the climate impact.” So what will the climate-adapted homes of the future look like? Designing the home to use less – and cleaner – energy Changes on both the outside and inside of our structures will shape the future of climate-proof homes. According to Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, homes will have to follow three interlocking mantras: “using the least energy possible from the cleanest sources at the right time”. Solar panels on roofs will become more common while, in rented or apartment accommodation, community solar schemes could provide an alternative. Solar panels can also be married with home batteries to help store excess energy which, along with proper insulation, will help keep a house functioning even during the sort of lengthy power blackouts Texas experienced earlier this year. Such a scenario opens up the possibility of utility companies operating an automated network of homes, as is the case in parts of Vermont, to manage demand and supply, rather than rely on hulking centralized infrastructure. “Having solar panels, batteries and water heaters all orchestrated and distributed makes the home a part of the energy system and can provide a lot of savings,” said Henchen. Power use will become smarter and more automated, with technology helping spread energy use throughout the day to work in tandem with a grid powered by variable wind and solar, rather than cause big surges in demand that require the burning of gas or coal. New tools for heating and cooling the home Another energy efficient move will be to properly insulate homes. In fact new homes could be pre-fabricated in factories and fitted on site to reduce gaps where heat can escape. Deep reductions in emissions will involve revamping the major appliances in the home, such as the water heater, furnace and air conditioning unit. As these items become older, they become wasteful and they will need to be replaced by more efficient appliances that run off clean electricity. Some of these replacements will be relatively innocuous, such as the installation of heat pumps, which will be in the basement or on the side of the house. Heat pumps work on principles similar to a refrigerator, shifting heat from outdoors indoors and vice versa. They can heat and cool your home and can also heat your water with an efficiency rate four times greater than a gas-powered version. The changes you’ll notice in everyday life Other changes will be more obvious in day-to-day life, such as replacing incandescent lightbulbs with LEDs, installing low-flow shower heads and phasing out gas stoves in favor of electric induction stovetops. Such a change may be unnerving to dedicated home cooks but proponents point to the swifter heat-up time, reduced indoor air pollution and negated risk of injuries to the hands of curious children . “People will get used to technology like induction cooktops. There are already top chefs out there giving out the message that they don’t have a worse performance than gas,” said Rohini Srivastava, a buildings expert at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. The phase-out of gas will also remove the need for a carbon monoxide detector in the home, although in the western US, air purifiers may become a standard feature in an age of growing wildfire smoke. At what cost? All of this will cost money – about $70,000 for the average American household to decarbonize, according to Rewiring America. And broader, systemic changes will need to take place to make housing denser and centered around transit lines and walkable communities to reduce car use, as well as a concerted effort to make homes resilient to the storms and fires spurred by the climate crisis. Climate advocates are calling for a slate of government support to aid this transition – San Francisco is currently working out how to make the $5.9bn switch to electrify all its homes currently powered by gas – but stress that the public will need to view the changes as painless. “The only way we will be able to do this is if the home feels just as comfortable and user-friendly as it has always been” said Cunningham. “You need to be able to take hot showers, be cool in summer and warm in winter and not know the difference in terms of how that is all powered.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/31/renewable-energy-contributes-record-687-of-power-to-australias-main-grid-for-brief-period","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-31T06:27:12Z","webTitle":"Renewable energy contributes record 68.7% of power to Australia’s main grid for brief period","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/31/renewable-energy-contributes-record-687-of-power-to-australias-main-grid-for-brief-period","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/31/renewable-energy-contributes-record-687-of-power-to-australias-main-grid-for-brief-period","fields":{"headline":"Renewable energy contributes record 68.7% of power to Australia’s main grid for brief period","bodyText":"Renewable energy generation hit a new record on Friday, briefly contributing more than two-thirds of the power in Australia’s main grid. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), the milestone was set at 12.30pm, with a contribution of 68.7%, or 18,882MW, from renewable sources. The figure is 4.6 percentage points higher than the previous record, which was set on 18 September. Of total power in the grid on Friday, 34% came from distributed solar, which outstripped black coal’s contribution of 22%. Renewable penetration rates are measured in 30-minute intervals, and illustrate contributions to the grid within a short period of time. “It’s very different to 100% renewables 24/7,” said Alison Reeve, climate change and energy deputy program director at the Grattan Institute. “Nevertheless, it does show how much the grid is changing.” “Five years ago the maximum that we’d managed to get to was 30%, and five years before that, I don’t know that anyone was even measuring [renewables], it was so small.” Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup One challenge of the energy transition was managing fluctuating contributions from renewable sources, Reeve said. “Once the solar has dropped out [at night], the percentage that you need to ramp up your non-renewables up to is a lot higher,” she said. “One of the things that is gradually driving particularly coal-fired power plants out of the market at the moment is that they can’t ramp up and down that quickly … they’re not good at switching on and off over a couple of hour periods.” Gas and hydro generators are more responsive at short timescales. Because of high gas prices currently, “when those gas generators come on they set quite a high price in the electricity market,” Reeve said. Hydro generators have recently been limited in their operation because of the wet weather on the east coast of Australia, she added. “They can’t send too much water down the river because they don’t want to make any flooding worse,” she said. Another challenge was replacing the “system’s stability” that coal and gas provide to the electricity grid – the ability to drop and raise generation slightly in order to “keep the voltage in the grid balanced”, Reeve said, which will require more long-duration storage infrastructure such as batteries. “Until we figure out a way to get that balancing role done by other things like pumped hydro and batteries, and we have enough of those in the system, there will be a natural upper limit on how much renewables penetration we have, particularly once you move beyond the instantaneous … and start to talk about what we can sustain over four or eight hours.” Reeve described these as “solvable problems”, but which required ironing out of details including costs, storage location and how the services would be valued. A July report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) found Australia was now among the world leaders in cheap solar energy. Behind China and India, in 2021 Australia had the third-lowest utility-scale solar cost in the world, of $0.042 USD/kWh (AU$0.065). This represented a 21% year-on-year drop in price. According to Irena data, the average cost of electricity from utility-scale solar has dropped by 90% in Australia since 2010."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/25/australias-first-carbon-neutral-telco-do-telstras-environmental-claims-about-belong-stack-up","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T00:00:06Z","webTitle":"Australia’s ‘first carbon-neutral telco’: do Telstra’s environmental claims about Belong stack up? | Temperature Check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/25/australias-first-carbon-neutral-telco-do-telstras-environmental-claims-about-belong-stack-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/25/australias-first-carbon-neutral-telco-do-telstras-environmental-claims-about-belong-stack-up","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s ‘first carbon-neutral telco’: do Telstra’s environmental claims about Belong stack up?","bodyText":"Telstra’s low-cost mobile and internet company Belong is in the middle of a nationwide advertising campaign that is memorable for its imagery of a sliced-off bloodless thumb crawling up a snow-driven mountain. “The average Australian is estimated to scroll the height of Everest on their phone every month. That’s why we proudly offset our network emissions,” the advert declares. Belong reminds customers often on its website that it is Australia’s “first carbon-neutral telco”. An advertising executive said their campaign for the telco showed “that with Belong’s carbon-neutral mobile and internet, you can feel good about scrolling”. That carbon neutrality, like that of its parent company Telstra, is certified through the government’s Climate Active program, but relies almost entirely on buying large quantities of overseas carbon offsets. Companies globally are coming under scrutiny for relying on offsets to meet climate pledges. A UN expert group has said offsets should only be used as a last resort after companies have made actual direct cuts. So how did Belong get to claim it was carbon neutral? According to disclosures made to Climate Active, over three years from 2018/19 to 2020/21 – the most recent periods available – Belong’s in-house efforts (such as optimising heating and cooling systems and upgrading equipment) led to a reduction of just 1,652 tonnes of CO2. But the annual savings actually went down in that time from 816t in the first year to 377t in the third year. Over the same period, the company bought 201,933t of carbon offsets to cover the rest of their emissions. More than 80% these offsets were created in 2014 by a windfarm in China. In a statement, Telstra said Belong’s next report to Climate Active would show a further 4,790t of CO2 of emissions reduction between financial year 2021 and 2022. This reduction reflected “continued progress in targeted emissions reduction activity” towards a target to cut absolute emissions by 50% by 2030. “To date, 14% of this target has been achieved, largely as a consequence of significant investment in energy efficiency.” Belong also offers secondhand phones, allows customers to keep using their own modems and encourages mobile phone recycling. First Nations first? Belong said in a company blog in late 2021 that as it “started moving towards certification” its chief principle was “three words with a lot of meaning: First Nations First”. But that hasn’t been the case when it comes to which offsets the company has chosen. Just 320t – or 0.16% – of its offsets over the three years relate to one Indigenous-led project in Queensland. A Telstra spokesperson said: “The ‘First Nations First’ line is not something that we have ever used in our marketing or advertising and we acknowledge and agree it was wrong for it to be used in this way and given such prominence in the blog.” A statement said Telstra and Belong did “an enormous amount of work with and for First Nations’ communities”, and consults and takes “advice from indigenous stakeholders inside and outside the company, including on our environmental programs”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Telstra’s carbon neutral claim Belong’s owner, Telstra, also uses Climate Active to claim it is a “carbon neutral” organisation. In the six months from January to June 2021, Telstra bought 1.01m tonnes worth of carbon offsets. But apart from buying offsets, what did the company do to cut emissions? Telstra has a target to cut its “absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030”. The company’s disclosure to Climate Active says it spent $8.6m on “energy and emissions reduction initiatives” to deliver an annual saving of 10,413 tonnes – just over 1% of the cuts the company claimed from buying offsets (for context, Telstra made about $3bn profit that year). Only about 7% of the offsets Telstra bought were Australian, with the bulk of the rest from renewables projects in India. Dr Alex Lo, of Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, published research this month on the use of renewable energy projects as offsets. About 38% of Telstra’s offsets were related to Indian solar energy projects from 2019 and 2020, which Lo says “require scrutiny”. One critical factor for a project to generate carbon credits is it must be “additional” – that is, the project would not have happened without investments through the carbon market. Lo says solar power prices in India dropped by about 85% between 2010 and 2019 while at the same time, international carbon prices were low, “which means credit incomes can hardly be seen as a key driving force of project development”. Telstra said it did “not agree” its carbon offsets were not additional, and the company carried out extensive due diligence. “All Telstra projects are additional,” the statement said, adding it viewed carbon offsets as a “temporary ‘bridge’ measure”. The company said it expects the proportion of offsets linked to renewables to “diminish over the coming years, as we shift our efforts to developing and maturing markets for nature-based solutions”. The company had a target to “enable renewable energy generation equivalent to 100% of our consumption by 2025” and had bought a farm to plant 150,000 native trees and shrubs that would sequester about 160,000 tonnes of CO2 over the next 25 years. Coral claims The shadow environment minister, Jonathon Duniam, accused the government last week of ignoring a report on the health of the Great Barrier Reef from the marine park’s management authority that showed the reef had been in “good health for a number of years now”. The report did say the reef had been through relatively benign years, but warned the threats from the climate crisis were “escalating”. Speaking to Sky News Australia’s Outsiders program, Jennifer Marohasy, an Institute of Public Affairs fellow, said the reef was in great health and questioned reports from John Brewer Reef near Townsville during last year’s mass coral bleaching – the first mass bleaching, authorities said, in a usually cooler La Niña year. Marohasy visited John Brewer in April “to have a look at the corals” and said “by coincidence” scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) were also there conducting an underwater survey. “They reported zero bleaching,” said Marohasy, saying this was despite aerial surveys reporting 60% of corals bleaching at the same site. “It’s crazy,” she said. This was “disinformation” said presenter Rita Panahi. Is it? Aims told Temperature Check they did not carry out any in-water monitoring in April, when Marohasy visited, but had been in the water on 6 March – nine days before aerial surveys recorded 60% bleaching on the reef flat. That in-water survey found “coral bleaching was variable in different parts of the reef”, Aims said, with some parts of the reef showing no bleaching and others between 10% and 30%. The amount of heat stress faced by the corals jumped in the nine days between the in-water survey and the aerial survey. So was it “crazy” that aerial surveys had a different result than in-water checks that involved divers being pulled for two-minute bursts 81 times around the reef’s 15km perimeter? Aims said the same results shouldn’t have been expected, because they came from different times, used different methods and examined different parts of the reef (in-water surveys included deeper corals but aerial surveys only counted corals in the top 6m of water). An Aims statement said: “While there are differences between the results, the in-water survey results on 6 March 2022 correlate reasonably well with the aerial surveys on the 15 March. “It is important to note that peak heat in 2022 for the [reef] occurred on 14 March. If one visited John Brewer Reef in April, about a month after peak heat stress, conditions may have cooled and corals would have been on a path to recovery from moderate levels of heat stress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jun/07/biden-climate-change-defense-production-act","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-07T12:00:53Z","webTitle":"Activists hail Biden’s use of security powers to boost clean energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/07/biden-climate-change-defense-production-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jun/07/biden-climate-change-defense-production-act","fields":{"headline":"Activists hail Biden’s use of security powers to boost clean energy","bodyText":"Environmental groups have welcomed Joe Biden’s invoking of national security powers to rapidly expand the production of clean energy technology as a significant advance in the effort to curb dangerous climate breakdown. Biden has triggered the Defense Production Act, a cold war-era law used to compel businesses to ramp up production of certain materials to aid national security, to boost the output of solar panels, building insulation, transformers for power grids and heat pumps, which are used to efficiently heat and cool homes. The US president has also provided a two-year exemption to solar panel companies from tariffs on imported parts, easing the flow of technology from China and other countries for use in the US, a country where only 2.8% of electricity comes from solar power. The moves have been applauded by climate activists who have pressed for Biden to use the breadth of his presidential powers to act on the climate crisis. Activists have sharply criticized the president in recent months over the continuing failure to pass major climate legislation through an evenly divided Senate, as well as Biden’s calls for bolstered oil production to offset gasoline prices that have risen amid the war in Ukraine. “We are in a climate emergency, an emergency we can only confront when our government steps up and launches a second-world-war scale mobilization to justly transition to renewable energy,” said Varshini Prakash, executive director at the youth-led Sunrise Movement. “This is a great step by the administration, and we urgently hope to see even more significant executive actions follow.” Biden has declined to declare a climate emergency, as has been done in countries such as the UK, or to set a phase-out of fossil fuels. But his administration said use of national security powers to create a “stronger clean energy arsenal” was evidence of “bold action to build an American-made clean energy future”. The use of the Defense Production Act will allow the US Department of Energy to invest in companies that can build renewable energy facilities and manufacture parts for technology such as solar panels. The administration expects domestic solar manufacturing will now triple by 2024, allowing more than 3.3m homes each year to switch to solar energy. A shift to cleaner sources of electricity would also help protect against energy bill volatility and provide efficiency to households, say proponents – heat pumps, for example, can save homes $1,000 each year from space heating alone. The administration has also sought to stress the benefits of weaning the US off the supply of fossil fuels from countries such as Russia. “Reducing America’s dependence on gas and oil is critical to US national security,” said Kathleen Hicks, deputy secretary of defense. Jean Su, director of energy justice at the Center for Biological Diversity, said Biden’s latest actions represented a “tremendous sea change” in his approach to tackling the climate crisis. “Biden’s executive moves give critical momentum to the needed transition to solar energy,” said Su. “We hope this use of the Defense Production Act is a turning point for the president, who must use all his executive powers to confront the climate emergency head on.” Scientists have said the world must cut planet-heating emissions in half this decade, and zero them out by 2050, to avoid even more disastrous heatwaves, floods, drought and other damaging climate impacts. Biden, who shares this target, won’t be able to achieve it, however, though executive action alone. The US has never passed major climate change legislation and the president’s attempts to do so have been stymied by Joe Manchin, the pro-coal Democrat who has been a crucial swing vote in the Senate. It’s unclear whether any climate bill will be able to succeed ahead of November’s midterm elections, which are expected to deprive Democrats of control in Congress."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/13/trust-farmers-to-make-the-right-choices-on-solar-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T16:22:05Z","webTitle":"Trust farmers to make the right choices on solar projects | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/13/trust-farmers-to-make-the-right-choices-on-solar-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/13/trust-farmers-to-make-the-right-choices-on-solar-projects","fields":{"headline":"Trust farmers to make the right choices on solar projects","bodyText":"The new environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, appears to believe that farmers and local communities are unable to make the right choices about which land should be used to produce food and which to produce energy (Ministers hope to ban solar projects from most English farms, 10 October). This is not a new problem for farmers. In the 19th century, my predecessors chose to produce energy on one-third of my farm and food on two-thirds. Without the oats grown on a large part of the farm, we could not have fed the horses enough energy to allow them to help us to produce human food on the rest of the farm. It may come as a shock to Jayawardena, but modern progressive farmers are constantly seeking to balance not just food and energy production, but also carbon sequestration and biodiversity enhancement. I believe we have the ability, by working together with communities, environmentalists and others, to deliver each of these things in balance, but only if we are allowed the flexibility to choose our own solutions. If we are dictated to by governments with little or no understanding of the complexities or trade-offs involved, it is almost inevitable that we will fail on not just food security and energy security but also climate change and reversing the biodiversity crises. Stuart Roberts Harpenden, Hertfordshire • The environment secretary’s initiative to define more farmland as the “best and most versatile” and end its loss to huge solar farms is overdue. Changing open countryside into large blocks of fenced-off panels should never have been permitted to start. In 2014, the coalition government envisaged solar arrays being on industrial roof space, and its then agriculture minister, Liz Truss, spoke against using farmland. Truss promised in her leadership campaign to see this through. The scale of damage was highlighted in two parliamentary debates earlier this year, on 9 March and 8 June. If Ranil Jayawardena can remove the distinction between grades 3a and 3b in the agricultural land classification, he will doing the nation a wider service. It dates from the 1960s, and farming practice and husbandry has changed so much since then that it is meaningless. All it does is give work to consultants paid by housebuilders and solar energy companies to test soils and report that land is grade 3b or lower, so that it can be developed. Planning restrictions on windfarms have saved many English landscapes from large turbines and made wind energy companies go offshore. Extending the protection of farmland from development by ending the grade 3a/3b distinction would have a similar beneficial effect: keeping our land for food and making solar developers use industrial roof space. Mark Sullivan Campaign to Protect Rural England, West Midlands region • The environment secretary is reportedly opposed to solar farms because they take land out of food production. This need not be the case. Developing agrivoltaic technology is demonstrating that crops can be very successfully grown under raised solar panels. Duncan Forbes Charlbury, Oxfordshire • It’s a common misconception that solar farms are incompatible with agricultural use of the land.

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency will announce on Friday it will grant $45m over the next eight years to the University of NSW-based Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics. Most of the money will be spent within the first five years. The money will ensure as many as 60 scientists will retain funding, although the annual funding is at about the rate of the previous 10-year grant. It will involve two additional partners, the University of Sydney and CSIRO’s Newcastle energy group, and will seek to foster further growth by drawing in commercial partners. “Australia has all the ingredients to become a renewable energy superpower with this Government working collaboratively to ensure secure, affordable and reliable energy that drives down emissions,” the energy minister, Chris Bowen, said. “It’s a global race [and] we’ve for a long time we’ve been at the front of that, and been able to attract people internationally … and that’s still the case,” said Prof Renate Egan, who is UNSW’s lead at the centre. Australian researchers have pioneered a range of solar technologies with as much as 90% of the world’s annual panel production drawing on that pedigree. The Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, Monash University, University of Queensland, and CSIRO’s Clayton unit in Melbourne are partners of the centre. Martin Green, the UNSW professor who has long led the centre’s research, developed cells with a 20% efficiency of converting sunlight to electricity in 1989 and doubled that rate for lab cells by 2014, among a long list of achievements. Centre graduates also pepper many of the world’s big solar firms. “The next decade promises to be the most exciting and important in solar photovoltaics, ever, with massively increased uptake and technological change,” Green said. Egan said solar energy now provides only 3-4% of global electricity and about 15% in Australia. “We need to take that to over 50% here and internationally,” to enable the transition of fossil fuels and limit the impacts of heating climate, she said. “We’re really only just beginning on the solar technology development.” The extended research would help Arena meet its goals of mass production of solar cells with a 30% efficiency at a cost of 30 cents a watt by 2030. Panels on the market now can operate with 23-24% efficiency, at the cost of about 70 cent/watt. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Achieving those goals will not be easy. The new funding will work on so-called tandem cells that stack two or more layers of materials to capture more energy of the spectrum of light, and operate more durably, particularly under higher temperatures. “We know it’s possible, but we’re going to end up with a completely different material set, and a different structure,” Egan said. The need to identify new minerals is driven in part because the present use of silver in particular will soon be challenging for the solar industry globally. With production doubling every three years for the past three decades, the solar PV industry consumes about 10% of the world’s silver in its 200 gigawatts of capacity added yearly. “So we can’t double and double it, otherwise we’re using 50% of the world’s silver, and that would clearly create a supply bottleneck and a price challenge,” Egan said, adding several alternative materials are being worked on but more research is needed. The centre will also look to collaborate more to develop manufacturing capacity in Australia. At 4GW of panels being installed annually, the local market is nearing the volumes necessary to justify onshore production, particularly if plans by Sun Cable and other firms for giant solar farms of 20GW each or larger proceed, she said. Australia’s best prospects might be in silicon refining, with wafer and cell processing done elsewhere and final module work done locally, she said. Richard Corkish, another UNSW professor and the centre’s chief operating officer, said the funding extension will be critical because there are only a few ways the world can reduce emissions from energy use at a pace fast enough to head off the climate crisis. “The big two are solar PV and wind” along with improved energy efficiency, Corkish said. “And in the long term, solar PV will be the one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/07/hydrogen-clean-fuel-climate-crisis-explainer","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-07T08:30:31Z","webTitle":"Is hydrogen really a clean enough fuel to tackle the climate crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/07/hydrogen-clean-fuel-climate-crisis-explainer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/07/hydrogen-clean-fuel-climate-crisis-explainer","fields":{"headline":"Is hydrogen really a clean enough fuel to tackle the climate crisis?","bodyText":"Hydrogen is the smallest, lightest and most abundant molecule in the universe. On Earth, it does not occur by itself naturally, but can be separated from water (H2O) or hydrocarbon compounds (fossil fuels) like gas, coal and petroleum to be used as an energy source. It’s already used for rocket fuel, but it is now being pushed as a clean and safe alternative to oil and gas for heating and earthly modes of transport. Political support is mounting with almost $26bn of US taxpayer money available for hydrogen projects thanks to three recent laws – the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Chips Act. Hydrogen is politically hot, but is it the climate solution that its cheerleaders are claiming? Why all the hype about hydrogen? The short answer is that the fossil fuel industry sees hydrogen as a way to keep on drilling and building new infrastructure. Friends of the Earth has tracked how the industry has successfully deployed its PR and lobbying machines over recent years to get policymakers thinking that hydrogen is a catch-all climate solution. Research by climate scientists (without fossil fuel links) has debunked industry claims that hydrogen should be a major player in our decarbonised future, though hydrogen extracted from water (using renewable energy sources) could – and should – play an important role in replacing the dirtiest hydrogen currently extracted from fossil fuels. It may also have a role in fuelling some transportation like long-haul flights and vintage cars, but the evidence is far from clear. However, with billions of climate action dollars up for grabs in the US alone, expect to see more lobbying, more industry-funded evidence and more hype. What’s the difference between blue, grey, brown, pink and green hydrogen? Extracting hydrogen is energy intensive, so the source and how it’s done both matter. Currently, about 96% of the world’s hydrogen comes from coal (brown) and gas (grey), with the rest created from nuclear (pink) and renewable sources like hydro, wind and solar. Production of both grey and brown hydrogen release carbon dioxide (CO2) and unburnt fugitive methane into the atmosphere. This super-polluting hydrogen is what’s currently used as the chemical base for synthetic nitrogen fertilisers, plastics and steel among other industries. Blue hydrogen is what the fossil fuel industry is most invested in, as it still comes from gas but ostensibly the CO2 would be captured and stored underground. The industry claims to have the technology to capture 80-90% of CO2, but in reality, it’s closer to 12% when every stage of the energy-intensive process is evaluated, according to a peer-reviewed study by scientists at Cornell University published in 2021. For sure better than nothing, but methane emissions, which warm the planet faster than CO2, would actually be higher than for grey hydrogen because of the additional gas needed to power the carbon capture, and likely upstream leakage. Notably, the term clean hydrogen was coined by the fossil fuel industry a few months after the seminal Cornell study found that blue hydrogen has a substantially larger greenhouse gas footprint than burning gas, coal or diesel oil for heating. Green hydrogen is extracted from water by electrolysis – using electricity generated by renewable energy sources (wind, solar, hydro). Climate experts (without links to fossil fuels) say green hydrogen can only be green if new renewable sources are constructed to power hydrogen production – rather than drawing on the current grid and questionable carbon accounting schemes. The industry disagrees: “Strict additionality rules requiring electrolytic hydrogen to be powered by new renewable energy is not practical, especially in the early years, and will severely limit the development of hydrogen projects,” said BP America. “There may be some small role in truly green hydrogen in a decarbonised future, but this is largely a marketing creation by the oil and gas industry that has been hugely overhyped,” said Robert Howarth, professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, a co-author of the paper on blue hydrogen. What’s at stake? In addition to $26bn in direct financing for so-called hydrogen hubs and demo projects, another $100bn or so in uncapped tax credits could be paid out over the next few decades, so lots and lots of taxpayers’ money. Fossil fuel companies are also using hydrogen to justify building more pipelines, claiming that this infrastructure can be used for “clean hydrogen” in the future. But hydrogen is a highly flammable and corrosive element, and it would be costly to repurpose oil and gas infrastructure to make it safe for hydrogen. And while hydrogen is not a greenhouse gas, it is not harmless. It aggravates some greenhouse gases, for instance causing methane to stay in the atmosphere for longer. “This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in actual zero-emission solutions, but could be a disaster if the federal government pours scarce resources into infrastructure and technologies that could make the climate crisis worse and cause further public health harms,” said Sara Gersen, clean energy attorney at Earthjustice. “Sowing confusion about hydrogen is a delay tactic, and delay is the new denialism.” Is there any role for hydrogen in a decarbonised future? Yes, but a limited one – given that it takes more energy to produce, store and transport hydrogen than it provides when converted into useful energy, so using anything but new renewable sources (true green hydrogen) will require burning more fossil fuels. According to the hydrogen merit ladder devised by Michael Liebreich, host of the Cleaning Up podcast, swapping clean hydrogen for the fossil fuel-based grey and brown stuff currently used for synthetic fertilisers, petrochemicals and steel is a no-brainer. The carbon footprint of global hydrogen production today is equivalent to Germany’s annual greenhouse gas emissions, so the sooner we swap to green hydrogen (created from new renewables) the better. This could also be useful for some transportation, such as long-haul flights and heavy machinery, and maybe to store surplus wind and solar energy – though none are slam dunks for hydrogen as there are alternative technologies vying for these markets, said Liebreich. But for most forms of transport (cars, bikes, buses and trains) and heating there are already safer, cleaner and cheaper technologies such as battery-run electric vehicles and heat pumps, so there’s little or no merit in investing time or money with hydrogen. Howarth said: “Renewable electricity is a scarce resource. Direct electrification and batteries offer so much more, and much more quickly. It’s a huge distraction and waste of resources to even be talking about heating homes and passenger vehicles with hydrogen.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T15:25:19Z","webTitle":"De facto ban on solar farms in England to continue, Coffey signals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","fields":{"headline":"De facto ban on solar farms in England to continue, Coffey signals","bodyText":"The de facto ban on solar farms will be continued by Rishi Sunak’s government, the environment secretary has signalled. Thérèse Coffey, fresh from her visit to Cop27, suggested to parliament that she would be continuing with policy plans initiated under the former prime minister Liz Truss, which would block solar power from most farmland. Under Truss, Defra officials were looking at how to redefine “best and most versatile” land (BMV), which is earmarked for farming, to include the middling-to-low category 3b. Land is graded from 1 to 5, and currently BMV includes grades 1 to 3a. Planning guidance says that development on BMV land should be avoided, although planning authorities may take other considerations into account. This would mean 60% of all agricultural land would be off-limits to solar farms. It was hoped the Sunak government would reverse this decision, as to reach net zero targets, the country needs a huge expansion of renewables. However, when asked by the shadow climate minister Kerry McCarthy on Thursday, Coffey signalled she would be keeping the policy. She said: “It’s really important we make the best use of our land to have that food security … It’s also really important when considering land use to consider the best place to put renewable energy, which by and large most people would agree, let’s use our best agricultural land for farming and make use of brownfield sites for a lot of these energy projects, too.” Backing her up, in response to the Conservative MP Siobhan Baillie, who is campaigning against solar in her Stroud constituency, the environment minister Mark Spencer said: “She should be assured that my officials are working closely with other departments to ensure the right balance between boosting food production and energy security.” McCarthy told the Guardian: “It is beyond belief that this government is still considering blocking new solar developments during an energy crisis. This will drive up bills, risk our energy security and prevent us meeting our crucial climate targets. “From the ban on onshore wind to blocks on solar, every week it becomes clearer that Rishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age. Labour’s plan would cut energy bills for good, creating thousands of good, green jobs and making Britain a clean energy superpower.” The solar industry was also unimpressed by the statements. Chris Hewett, the chief executive of Solar Energy UK, told the Guardian: “Since the resignation of Liz Truss and Ranil Jayawardena, all the ministerial statements from the departments that matter on energy policy, the Treasury and BEIS [Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy], have all been explicitly supportive of more renewables and specifically solar farms. “This gave the impression that anything that happened under Liz Truss’s brief tenure was to be disregarded, including the leaked proposals for changes to land classification leading to a de-facto ban on solar farms. “The new prime minister’s support for renewables at Cop27, as a means to deliver economic growth and energy security, reinforced that message. It is concerning that Thérèse Coffey has not clarified the position of her own department but existing policy already balances energy and food security effectively.” Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, James Cartlidge, said the new government was “serious about delivering cheaper, cleaner and more secure power” and would include solar farms in future auctions for “contracts for difference”. He added that the existing English planning system was “designed to take account” of the need to balance “community interests, food security and securing a clean, green energy system for the future”. Sunak has previously shown antipathy towards solar panels, and during the summer in his first run for leader he promised that “good agricultural land” would not be used for renewables. When asked if Coffey’s remarks meant she would be pushing for the block on solar farms, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to give an on-the-record comment but confirmed they had been looking at options to support farming and energy security while protecting nature and delivering on net zero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/28/mike-cannon-brookes-to-back-new-agl-board-members-in-bid-to-clean-up-climate-polluter","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T09:52:00Z","webTitle":"Mike Cannon-Brookes to back new AGL board members in bid to clean up climate polluter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/28/mike-cannon-brookes-to-back-new-agl-board-members-in-bid-to-clean-up-climate-polluter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/28/mike-cannon-brookes-to-back-new-agl-board-members-in-bid-to-clean-up-climate-polluter","fields":{"headline":"Mike Cannon-Brookes to back new AGL board members in bid to clean up climate polluter","bodyText":"Tech billionaire and climate activist Mike Cannon-Brookes will back four new members to the board of AGL in his latest bid to steer Australia’s biggest power generator and carbon polluter towards a lower emissions future. Cannon-Brookes, who in May used his clout as AGL’s largest shareholder to block AGL’s plans to split into two companies, will support the four independent non-executive directors to transform the company, according to a media release by his family company, Grok Ventures. The four include Kerry Schott, the former chair of the Energy Security Board, Prof John Pollears, CSR board member, Christine Holman, and solar energy veteran, Mark Twidell. “Grok believes the AGL Board needs to expand to include a broader range of skills, expertise and capabilities to reset the strategic direction and culture of this historic company,” the statement said, referring the 185-year-old firm. “In Grok’s view the current board of five would benefit greatly from new directors who bring different and much needed skills to undertake the urgent transformation of AGL,” it said. The missive came on the eve of AGL’s plan to release its updated strategy to the sharemarket on Thursday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cannon-Brookes, whose fortune derives mostly from his co-founding of software services giant Atlassian, earlier this month objected to the choice of Patricia McKenzie as the new chair of AGL “given her involvement in the failed demerger”. AGL has faced a year of turmoil include seeing off a takeover bid led by Cannon-Brookes and Canadian asset manager Brookfield in February and March. The company had sought to demerge into a mostly retail arm and a company with its remaining coal-fired power plants. AGL’s Liddell power plant in the New South Wales Hunter Valley will fully close by next April. According to plans announced in February, the neighbouring Bayswater plant was to close “no later than 2033” while its Loy Yang A power station in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley would run until 2045. Cannon-Brookes has said he wants AGL to exit all coal by the mid-2030s. The four new board candidates would be voted on at AGL’s annual general meeting, planned for 15 November. AGL chair, Patricia McKenzie, said the company shared “the ambition of our many shareholders for decisive action on climate change as well as a strong and sustainable AGL”. “AGL respects the right of shareholders to nominate candidates for election as directors.” She said the board’s recommendation on each resolution to be considered at the AGM will be published in October. Two other shareholders, Sentient and Snowcap, issued statements in support of the board nominations. “Sentient considers that businesses and governments are underestimating the complexity of accelerating the energy transition,” a spokesperson said. “We believe there are tremendous opportunities for AGL in the energy transition and as impact investors we wish to see the company succeed,” the spokesperson said. “To do so however, it is important that AGL brings in new board directors with the right experience to enable it to manage the orderly closure of stranded assets, grow its business, while responsibly meeting the needs of customers, staff and the community.” Similarly, Chris Kinnersley from Snowcap, said AGL’s board “urgently requires fresh ideas and a renewed culture of excellence” “We believe the shareholder nominees provide the relevant experience critical for navigating a successful turnaround,” he said.

A report by the Clean Energy Council, representing renewable energy companies and solar installers, has called for more local renewable energy production and manufacturing and a “certificate of origin” scheme to counter concerns about slave labour in mineral extraction and manufacturing in China, Africa and South America. Released on Tuesday, the paper said slavery in all supply chains was a global problem. But Australia is on a trajectory towards generating the vast majority of its electricity from solar, wind, hydro and batteries by 2030 and needs to play an active role in addressing it in renewable energy industries. “We’re at a moment in time when renewable energy supply chains are going to be scaling up significantly,” Dr Nick Aberle, the Clean Energy Council’s energy generation and storage policy director, said. “That means now is a critical opportunity to shape the future direction of those supply chains.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The report cited detailed allegations of forced labour and slavery in supply chains for solar and wind energy and battery storage. Examples included that: About 2.6 million Uyghur and Kazakh people have been subjected to coercion, “re-education programs” and internment in the Xinjiang region of north-west China, which is the source of 40-45% of the world’s solar-grade polysilicon. A report by the United Nations office of the high commissioner for human rights three months ago found Xinjiang was home to “serious human rights violations”, and the US has listed polysilicon from China as a material likely to have been produced by child or forced labour. On batteries, there were major issues with the mining of between 15% and 30% of the world’s cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Amnesty International found that children, some as young as seven, were working in artisanal cobalt mines, often for less than $2 a day. Mining conditions were reportedly hazardous, and workers often did not have adequate protective equipment and were exposed to toxic dust that contributed to hard metal lung disease. On wind energy, there had been rapid growth in demand for balsa wood used in turbine blades that had reportedly led to workers in Ecuador’s Amazon region being subject to substandard labour conditions, including payment being made with alcohol or drugs. The demand for balsa has also reportedly increased deforestation, and affected the land rights of Indigenous people in Peru. Some balsa wood suppliers have more recently provided Forest Stewardship Council certifications, which verifies responsible forest management and fair wages and work environments. NSW’s anti-slavery commissioner, Dr James Cockayne, said urgent action was needed to address “the severe modern slavery risks in Australian renewable energy supply chains and investments”. “We need to see industry, government, the financial sector and civil society working together to provide access to competitively costed, slavery-free renewable energy,” he said. “If we don’t, modern slavery risks significantly complicating the just transition to a decarbonised economy.” Aberle said the government should create a taskforce of government, industry and civil society representatives to develop a plan to ensure Australia’s clean energy supply chain was “reliable, cost effective and slavery free”. He said strategies that should be explored included whether to establish domestic supply chain capabilities and how to improve “traceability and detectability” within existing supply chains. The report, compiled with the consultants from Norton Rose Fulbright, cited the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which came into force earlier this year and created a presumption that any products made in Xinjiang were linked to modern slavery and could not be imported into the US unless an importer provided “clear and compelling evidence” that there was no slavery in a product’s supply chain. It said a globally recognised certificate of origin scheme would be complex but was “imperative to achieving landmark change”. Existing examples of work in this area included a solar stewardship initiative launched in September 2022 and a global battery alliance that was developing a “battery passport” system to improve traceability. The Australian and US governments earlier this year said they wanted to break their near-complete reliance on China for clean energy and critical mineral supply chains, citing evidence the country was responsible for about 80% of solar energy technology manufacturing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2021/dec/11/weatherwatch-for-solar-panels-some-like-it-not-too-hot","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-11T06:00:01Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: for solar panels, some like it not too hot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/dec/11/weatherwatch-for-solar-panels-some-like-it-not-too-hot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/dec/11/weatherwatch-for-solar-panels-some-like-it-not-too-hot","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: for solar panels, some like it not too hot","bodyText":"When my mother installed solar photovoltaic panels on her roof in the Scottish borders, I was sceptical that they would produce much energy.

We are going to need solar energy to reach net zero, so it is important we find the best places to situate solar farms. Cloudy locations are pretty hopeless, for obvious reasons, but places that tend to be cold, sunny and breezy (like much of the UK and Ireland) are surprisingly good.

But the decision by the business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, to oppose her publicly over solar energy plans is still a dramatic one that leaves her looking even weaker and more exposed. Having previously stressed his support for fracking, and oil and gas drilling in the North Sea, Mr Rees-Mogg used an article in the Guardian to deny that he opposes green energy. While Ms Truss wants to restrict new solar installations on farmland, Mr Rees-Mogg’s deregulatory fervour extends beyond fossil fuels to renewables as well. Ms Truss’s anti-solar scheme is so ill-judged that all voices raised against it are welcome. But Mr Rees-Mogg’s enthusiasm for new oil and gas means that he must never be mistaken for a friend to green causes. He is right to point out that carbon-intensive imports are just as damaging to the atmosphere as UK-based industries. But while his backing for solar and wind may make him a more consistent free-marketeer than the prime minister – who is against red tape except when it blocks something she dislikes – the risks to the environment from all those like him who champion growth at the expense of nature remain huge. Renewed enthusiasm for fossil fuel projects is one aspect of this government’s reactionary and dangerous agenda. Two more are the promises to scrap hundreds of environmental regulations governing areas such as water quality (already shockingly poor), and to remove wildlife protections from new low-tax investment zones. The decision to review a post-Brexit farming payments scheme that took six years to set up – and which has already led to enhanced protection for wildlife in pilot areas – offers further proof of the government’s disdain for all things green. Ms Truss made this explicit when she targeted climate campaigners as part of an “anti-growth coalition”. So far, she shows no sign of paying attention to warnings from senior figures including William Hague that she is on the wrong track. But concern about the government’s new direction is spreading. Ministers are at odds not only with environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace, but also with mass-membership charities beloved of many Tory voters, including the National Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Paul Miner, from the countryside charity CPRE, described the reversals on fracking and other issues as “a litany of betrayal and broken promises”. Precisely how the anger prompted by these anti-green policies will manifest itself remains to be seen. Already, charities have called on members to contact MPs, and they will be emboldened by a speech from the Charity Commission’s chair, Orlando Fraser, affirming their right to engage in political activity. With another crunch UN climate conference fast approaching, and a new report from scientists pointing to a further decline in animal populations, conservation groups and their supporters are right to be alarmed. It is widely understood by voters in the UK – and judging from polling, by a majority of people around the world – that the next few years offer a final opportunity to prevent climate-linked destruction on an unimaginable scale. Under Boris Johnson, Conservative environment policies were nowhere near ambitious enough. But under Ms Truss, they are already far worse. Her hang-the-consequences short-termism would never have won a general election.

But growing crops underneath the panels is, and the process has had such promising trials in Kenya that it will be deployed this week in open-field farms. Known as agrivoltaics, the technique harvests solar energy twice: where panels have traditionally been used to harness the sun’s rays to generate energy, they are also utilised to provide shade for growing crops, helping to retain moisture in the soil and boosting growth. An initial year-long research collaboration between the University of Sheffield, World Agroforestry and the Kajiado-based Latia Agripreneurship Institute has shown promising results in the semi-arid Kajiado county, a 90-minute drive from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi and this week the full project will be officially launched. For example, cabbages grown under the 180, 345-watt solar panels have been a third bigger, and healthier, than those grown in control plots with the same amount of fertiliser and water. Other crops such as aubergine and lettuce have shown similar results. Maize grown under the panels was taller and healthier, according to Judy Wairimu, an agronomist at the institute. “We wanted to see how crops would perform if grown under these panels,” said Wairimu. But there is another pragmatic reason behind the technology: doubling up the output of the same patch of earth to generate power and cultivate food can go a long way towards helping people with limited land resources, she said. According to Dr Richard Randle-Boggis, a researcher at the University of Sheffield’s Harvesting the Sun Twice project, the trial initiative will determine the potential of agrivoltaic systems in east Africa. “We needed to build a test system to see if this technology will be suitable for the region,” Randle-Boggis said, reiterating that, unlike conventional solar mini-grid systems, agrivoltaics have the additional benefits of improving food and water security, while strengthening people’s resilience against the climate crisis, as well as providing low-carbon electricity. The solar panels do not just reduce water loss from plants and the soil – their shade mitigates some of the stress experienced by plants due to high day temperatures and UV damage, Randle-Boggis said. Agrivoltaics can have a notable impact on household income in remote locations such as Kajiado. “Women here can spend up to 300 Kenyan shillings (£2) on a bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) fare to the market just to buy vegetables worth 100 Kenyan shillings,” said Anne Macharia, head of training at Latia Agripreneurship Institute. The solar panels can be placed three metres from the ground, providing ample room for a farmer to work below, or higher in bigger systems to allow access for agricultural machinary. Randle-Boggis acknowledged the technology has limitations, but says that in “areas of Kenya which are not currently suitable for horticulture, it may be possible to grow other crops under the improved environmental conditions under the panels”. In other countries including France, the US and Germany, the technology has been employed successfully."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/feb/10/gas-fired-power-falls-to-lowest-level-since-2005-as-coalition-pushes-ahead-with-its-gas-fired-recovery","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-09T16:30:02Z","webTitle":"Gas-fired power falls to lowest level since 2005 as Coalition pushes ahead with its ‘gas-fired recovery’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/gas-fired-power-falls-to-lowest-level-since-2005-as-coalition-pushes-ahead-with-its-gas-fired-recovery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/gas-fired-power-falls-to-lowest-level-since-2005-as-coalition-pushes-ahead-with-its-gas-fired-recovery","fields":{"headline":"Gas-fired power falls to lowest level since 2005 as Coalition pushes ahead with its ‘gas-fired recovery’","bodyText":"The sharp rise of renewable energy led to it providing more than 30% of Australia’s electricity in 2021, while gas-fired power fell to its lowest level in 16 years. Data collected by OpenNEM, an open source platform, shows renewable energy provided 31.4% of electricity within the national market covering the eastern states and South Australia last year. It was 32.2% in the separate West Australian grid. The national figure has quickly surged beyond the national renewable energy target, which required electricity retailers to sell about 23% of generation from solar, wind and hydro plants by 2020. Gas-fired power – which is being backed by the Morrison government through hundreds of millions of dollars in funding as part of what it calls a “gas-fired recovery” from the pandemic – has fallen to its lowest level of generation since 2005. It now provides just 5.7% of the total. Its decline from a high of 12.8% seven years ago is largely attributed to its relatively high cost and the sharp increase in the amount of cheaper solar and wind energy available. Coal-fired power provides 62.8% of electricity, its lowest level in both proportion and total amount since the interconnected national market began in 1999. Back then, it was 95.4% of grid generation. Tim Baxter, a senior researcher with the Climate Council, said renewable energy had increased dramatically since 2018, when it was about 20% of the total share. The surge had initially been largely driven by a rush to fill the national renewable energy target, which the Morrison government did not extend or replace. It had continued due to the plunging cost of solar and wind, state-based renewables schemes and corporates increasingly promising support for zero-emissions energy. “Electricity is now the cheapest it has been in almost a decade, and we have solar and wind to thank for that,” Baxter said. The most significant rise has been in household solar systems. More than 3m homes have photovoltaic panels, including at least 360,000 systems installed last year, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. Regulators say that has created some new grid management challenges as solar energy floods into the system and makes other forms of generation uncompetitive when the sun is high in the middle of the day. Solar energy provided 12.3% of electricity generated in the national market. Nearly two-thirds of that came from rooftops, the rest from large-scale farms. Wind contributed 11.3% of electricity and hydro power 7.8%. Gas-fired fall In contrast, gas-fired power had declined due to it being the most expensive electricity fuel available. Baxter said while there may be some year-to-year variation, the fall in its use for power was expected to continue as other “dispatchable” sources that could be called on when required became available. They included pumped hydro, batteries, virtual power plants and demand response programs. Baxter said it made the government’s support for gas power – including $600m for a new gas-fired generator at Kurri Kurri in the Hunter Valley and another four listed for potential public underwriting – look “increasingly irresponsible and economically reckless”. “Let’s be clear, this record [of solar and wind lowering electricity prices] has nothing to do with the federal government, which has been missing in action and leaving all the heavy lifting to the states and territories,” he said. The Kurri Kurri gas plant, to be built by the public owned Snowy Hydro company, has been criticised as unnecessary to ensure a secure electricity supply is maintained once the nearby Liddell coal plant shuts next year. Kerry Schott, the former head of the Energy Security Board, was among those who said a new gas plant in the Hunter did not make commercial sense given there were cheaper and cleaner alternatives, but the head of Snowy Hydro, Paul Broad, this week predicted the country would continue to build “a lot more” gas-fired stations. Federal Labor last week said if it won the upcoming federal election it would require the Kurri Kurri station to run on 30% green hydrogen made with renewable energy when it opened next year, and 100% green hydrogen as soon as possible. Chris Bowen, the opposition energy and climate spokesman, said this could cost up to another $700m, inflating the potential total to $1.3bn. Green hydrogen has been widely backed as a significant future energy source as the world cuts greenhouse gas emissions, but some experts have ranked electricity generation near the bottom of its likely commercially viable uses. It is seen as important in creating “green” steel, aluminium and ammonia, among other products. Labor has also promised a $20 billion off-budget “rewiring the nation corporation” to accelerate the construction of planned electricity grid links. Modelling for the opposition by the firm RepuTex suggested it could lead to renewable energy providing 82% of electricity by 2030, compared with 68% on the current trajectory under the federal Coalition. The Greens say the country should be aiming for 100%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/06/government-will-not-intervene-to-help-famers-with-rising-food-prices-therese-coffey-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-06T20:09:49Z","webTitle":"Thérèse Coffey rules out help for farmers and consumers facing higher costs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/06/government-will-not-intervene-to-help-famers-with-rising-food-prices-therese-coffey-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/06/government-will-not-intervene-to-help-famers-with-rising-food-prices-therese-coffey-says","fields":{"headline":"Thérèse Coffey rules out help for farmers and consumers facing higher costs","bodyText":"The government has ruled out making any intervention in the market to help farmers or consumers with high food prices, the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, has said. Food prices have soared in the past year, in part owing to higher input prices such as energy, fertiliser and animal feed. Last month, food price inflation hit a fresh high of 12.4%, with poorer households hit hardest. Farmers have also complained that supermarkets are driving down the prices they pay to producers at the farmgate, leaving them making tiny profits. A report published last week by the food charity Sustain found farmers made less than a tenth of a penny in profit from a supermarket loaf selling to consumers for £1.14, and just a penny in profit from a £2.50 block of mild cheddar cheese. But Coffey, secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs since Rishi Sunak took office in September, refused to criticise supermarkets and said the government would not be taking action. “I am not going to be particularly critical of supermarkets – overall, having a competitive supermarket environment has done a lot to help consumers,” she told the environment food and rural affairs committee of MPs on Tuesday afternoon. “I don’t think we are at the stage of a market intervention directly when it comes to pricing.” She acknowledged the growing demand for food banks around the country, and pointed to steps such as the forthcoming increase in benefits and measures to reduce energy bills, but declined to promise any further support. She said: “It is not the role of government to provide free food.” In her first grilling by MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee since taking up the post, she also said she was “very disappointed by the water companies” and acknowledged concern over sewage flows into waterways. She said water company bosses were being summoned to account for their actions next week, and that they would be subject to more monitoring and would have to submit “real-time data”. She stopped short of promising to crack down on sewage flows into rivers and beaches. Coffey did, however, give comfort to those hoping for an expansion of renewable energy across the UK countryside. She moved away from the position adopted by Sunak in his leadership campaign, when he rejected solar farms on UK agricultural land, and said a government review of land use to be published in the first half of next year would take a “balanced” view. She told the committee that land graded 3b for agricultural use – judged to be moderate quality, capable of producing cereals and grass – could be used for solar farms. She said: “I’m not suggesting by default I want to put solar over every bit of 3b land. I think we do need to get that careful balance across that and make the best use of land. I’m more inclined about brownfield sites and certainly thinking through how farms and others can do a lot more self-energy production. I’m already conscious there are challenges about connecting to the grid.” She added: “But undoubtedly, you know, we have 14 gigawatts of solar now. Right now, the ambition within the energy security strategy is to raise it up to 70 gigawatts.” The farming minister, Mark Spencer, confirmed the government was not going to ban solar farms from 3b land. He told the Guardian: “I believe Beis [the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy] and Defra are looking together at this, how we best use land and a land use framework is coming. But I am not in favour of a broad brush approach. “We shouldn’t be stopping farmers who want to diversify their income from doing that as that would be harmful so I’d have no problem with them putting some solar panels down on 3b land. But we can’t then have thousands and thousands of acres taken away that could otherwise be used for food production. It has to be a balance.” Dustin Benton, policy analyst at environmental think tank Green Alliance, welcomed the apparent shift in the government’s stance. “It’s refreshing to see ministers hint at a practical approach to making solar and farming work together,” he told the Guardian. “We know that putting solar panels on cropland or grazing land while continuing to grow food reduces yields by just eight per cent, and can even increase yields in hot and dry summers. The government needs to focus on helping farmers to make the most of their land, including where their land is best used for clean energy or for nature.” The solar industry also welcomed the move. “It will be a great relief to the solar industry to hear that Thérèse Coffey supports existing planning rules, which have successfully encouraged development away from the best quality agricultural land while recognising the critical need to expand solar farms in response to the climate and energy price crisis,” said Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK. “This looks like a significant shift from the anti-solar rhetoric of her predecessor,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/oct/24/keir-starmer-backs-stiff-sentences-for-climate-protesters-who-block-roads","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T12:16:03Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer backs stiff sentences for climate protesters who block roads","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/24/keir-starmer-backs-stiff-sentences-for-climate-protesters-who-block-roads","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/oct/24/keir-starmer-backs-stiff-sentences-for-climate-protesters-who-block-roads","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer backs stiff sentences for climate protesters who block roads","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has said he would continue with Tory plans for stiff sentences for climate protesters who block roads, despite reiterating Labour’s pledge for no new oil and gas licences, as two Just Stop Oil activists caked a waxwork of King Charles. Starmer’s pledge to impose a moratorium on new oil and gas projects puts Labour policy in line with the demands of Just Stop Oil, whose supporters have been blocking roads and carrying out other protests in central London every day this month. Hours after Starmer’s comments on Monday morning, two supporters of the group stepped over the rope barrier separating the public from a waxwork of King Charles at Madam Tussauds in London, before smearing its face with chocolate cake. In comments circulated shortly after by Just Stop Oil, the pair, Eilidh McFadden, 20, from Glasgow, and Tom Johnson, 29, a painter-decorator from Sunderland, said: “The science is clear. The demand is simple. Just stop new oil and gas. It’s a piece of cake.” The action is the latest iconoclastic protest staged by climate activists. The Friday before last, Just Stop Oil made headlines around the world when two of its supporters hurled tomato soup on to Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflowers in the National Gallery in London. On Sunday, two activists with Letze Generation or Last Generation flung mashed potato on to Claude Monet’s Les Meules or Haystacks, in Potsdam, Germany. Both paintings were behind glass and were undamaged. But Just Stop Oil’s most disruptive actions so far in October have been on the streets. Crews of activists have blocked some of central London’s busiest roads every day this month, enraging politicians, rightwing papers and many members of the public. Speaking on LBC, Starmer confirmed that a Labour government would back proposals to introduce stiff sentences for people who protest by blocking roads. Similar proposals, currently before parliament as part of a new public order bill, would introduce 51-week sentences for “lock on” protests – in which activists use chains, locks, glue or other equipment to attach themselves to immovable objects or each other – a regular tactic of climate protesters. The bill also includes new offences of interfering with key national infrastructure, obstructing major transport works and causing serious disruption by tunnelling. In a phone-in discussion with Nick Ferrari, Starmer said that in his previous role as director of public prosecutions “we always had laws available” to prosecute people taking direct action. But he added: “What we were pushing for in that was longer sentences for those who were gluing themselves to roads and motorways, because that’s where you are putting lives at risk. We didn’t get that through, but that’s what I wanted.” Despite his opposition to the climate activists’ tactics, elsewhere in the interview Starmer promised there would be no new oil and gas licences granted under Labour as Just Stop Oil demands. “We accept there’s got to be a transition, so where there is oil and gas already being yielded that needs to continue as part of the transition, but no new sites, no new fields to be opened,” he said. “We need to transition to renewables. We can do it … we can double our onshore wind, we can triple our solar energy and we can quadruple our offshore wind – and the sooner we do that, the better. I do think that new nuclear, as well, and hydrogen are part of the equation.” The uproar over the latest actions by Just Stop Oil and its sister group in Germany comes as another report reiterated that there can be no new oil and gas projects if the world is to stay within 1.5C of global heating. The report, by the International Institute of Sustainable Development, said there was a “large consensus” across research that “developing any new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C” above pre-industrial levels. It also said global oil and gas production must be slashed by at least 65% by 2050 to remain within 1.5C, identified by the Paris agreement as the limit to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. The findings echo the International Energy Agency’s conclusion that any new oil and gas fields are incompatible with its 1.5C pathway."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/27/new-berlin-art-museum-of-the-20th-century-climate","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T13:50:26Z","webTitle":"Criticism mounts of ‘climate killer’ modern art museum in Berlin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/new-berlin-art-museum-of-the-20th-century-climate","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/27/new-berlin-art-museum-of-the-20th-century-climate","fields":{"headline":"Criticism mounts of ‘climate killer’ modern art museum in Berlin","bodyText":"A vast modern art museum under construction in Berlin has been castigated by conservation experts and architecture critics for its poor environmental credentials, as the energy crisis intensifies scrutiny of the efficiency of new buildings. The Museum of the 20th Century, designed by the Swiss star architects Herzog and de Meuron, is intended to propel the German capital into the top tier of world cities for modern art, competing with New York’s Moma and London’s Tate Modern. Variously nicknamed “the barn” and “the beer tent” due to its sprawling A-frame shape and low-hanging roof, the museum was hailed as a “building of the future” when its plans were first made public. However, in recent months there has been growing criticism of its main construction material, concrete – one of the highest contributors to carbon dioxide emissions – and of its open and transparent internal structure, which will require a highly sophisticated ventilation system to maintain temperature and humidity levels. Stefan Simon, a leading expert in conservation science and proponent of “ecological museums”, has called the museum a “climate killer”, a “structural nightmare” in regards to its upkeep and running costs, and a big “step in the wrong direction” that will fail by a considerable margin to meet the EU’s climate neutrality goals. He estimates the museum will be several times less energy efficient than many old museums in Berlin, using 450 kilowatt hours of energy per sq metre a year – about four times the amount required by the similarly prominent Altes Museum, built in 1830 to house classical antiquities. Simon’s criticism is all the more damaging given that he works at an institute within the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation under whose auspices the project is taking place. The building’s energy inefficiency has been known about for some time, but has been brought into focus by the soaring consumer and business bills resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. The estimated cost of the building had already prompted controversy, having already doubled from €179m (£155m) to €450m. The federal audit office has declared the project to be “overpriced and unecological” and has called for a more sustainable design, arguing that as a building financed from taxpayers’ money, the museum’s creators have a specific duty to set an example. Nikolaus Bernau, a leading architecture critic, called the building a disaster from both an ecological and economic viewpoint. “Ecologically speaking the whole thing is an absolute disaster beyond all expectations, largely due to the fact that it is completely air permeable … leading to very large streams of air, which have to be either cooled or warmed, depending on whether it’s summer or winter,” he told the Deutschlandfunk Kultur radio station. Ventilation costs involving heating or cooling air would be “immense”, he added. Herzog &amp; Meuron have said little about the project, other than to comment that the escalation in costs had much to do with the need to dig deeper into Berlin’s marshy ground to increase the building’s volume after the museum’s surface area was seen to encroach too much on the adjacent St Matthäus church. Jacques Herzog has referred to “its truly massive rooms”, and the technical challenges they bring with them, as having added to the cost. The architects have argued that the building’s facades have been designed to protect the artworks from direct sunlight. In response to the criticism, Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, has granted the prestige project an extra €10m out of this year’s budget in order to tackle its deficiencies. The culture minister, Claudia Roth, has asked for the design to be revamped, with less concrete used and sustainable measures employed such as rainwater collection and solar energy panels introduced. Experts have dismissed her suggestions as insufficient and at best cosmetic. She has predicted the building, which will hold works by artists including Gerhard Richter, Joseph Beuys and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, will become “the coolest museum in the city” though recently admitted it currently “does not have such a good image”. Roth has been cautious about criticising her predecessor Monika Grütters, a Christian Democrat, who was a leading figure behind the project’s launch. But as a leading Green party member her reputation is arguably on the line if she fails to address the chaos. In a recent opinion piece for Die Zeit, Tobias Timm, an expert on the German-speaking art world, led calls for Roth to halt the project temporarily, at least during the energy crisis. He suggested that climate protesters who had in recent months glued themselves to works in German galleries and elsewhere in the hope of drawing attention to the environmental crisis should pay more attention to “CO2 generator” museums such as Berlin’s modern art gallery. The building, part of a major revamp of Berlin’s museum landscape, has been under discussion for decades and will allow thousands of artworks that do not fit inside the existing Neue Nationalgalerie to be permanently brought out of long-term storage. • This article was amended on 28 November 2022 to clarify that the museum’s estimated energy usage was calculated on an annual basis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/29/companies-using-carbon-credits-to-cover-their-tracks-says-iron-ore-billionaire-andrew-forrest","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-29T13:19:46Z","webTitle":"Companies using carbon credits to ‘cover their tracks’, says iron ore billionaire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/29/companies-using-carbon-credits-to-cover-their-tracks-says-iron-ore-billionaire-andrew-forrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/29/companies-using-carbon-credits-to-cover-their-tracks-says-iron-ore-billionaire-andrew-forrest","fields":{"headline":"Companies using carbon credits to ‘cover their tracks’, says iron ore billionaire","bodyText":"Carbon offsets are questionable, dangerous and far from a good investment for companies hoping to reduce their environmental impact, Australia’s richest man has said. Andrew Forrest, a billionaire turned philanthropist who made his fortune in mining and minerals, is turning his vast iron ore extraction operation, Fortescue Metals Group, into a zero carbon business. Unlike most companies, Fortescue is not seeking net zero greenhouse gas emissions but what Forrest described as “real zero”. To achieve net zero, many companies use carbon credits, awarded for projects such as planting trees or preserving existing forests, to count against their greenhouse gas emissions. Forrest thinks this is a mistake and instead plans to use entirely renewable energy and zero-carbon technologies to transform his business. “Companies think they can continue piling emissions into the world, and cover their tracks with carbon offsets,” he said. “But carbon credits are really questionable,” he told the Guardian in an interview in London. “We are pushing beyond carbon credits.” Having examined the market for carbon credits, Forrest has concluded that only about 10% to 15% of available credits represent real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. “I am an ecologist and I have seen how these credits get valued. Some are from just planting trees where trees would have been growing anyway,” he said. “Carbon credits are dangerous.” They are being relied upon increasingly as companies seek to become net zero but questions about the market for offsets are intensifying. Earlier this week, the airline Easyjet announced it would no longer use carbon offsetting to reach its net zero goals, but will invest further in low-carbon technologies for aviation. The Guardian conducted a wide-ranging investigation of the market for forestry credits last year and found numerous problems, including “phantom credits” and questions over whether credits awarded for preserving and planting trees represented genuine “carbon sinks”. Forrest said the carbon markets merited deep investigation. “There are all sorts of cranks out there selling carbon credits,” he said. “This abuse must stop.” Forrest’s Minderoo Foundation charity targets plastic pollution , modern slavery and the climate crisis. Nicknamed Twiggy, he has announced plans to give away most of his $27bn fortune, has been criticised in Australia for controversial proposals on welfare for low-income people, for mining on Indigenous land, and by those who argue that tax is a better redistribution of wealth than philanthropy. Fortescue, whose profits topped US$6bn (£5.5bn) last year, will use solar and wind power, electric vehicles, hydrogen and hydro-electricity with pump storage to make its operations zero carbon by the end of this decade. Surplus renewable energy would be used to pump water uphill during times of excess generation, to be released to generate power when needed. Forrest insisted the strategy was not only technically feasible but could be achieved at a profit, thanks in part to the plummeting cost of wind and solar energy, and the soaring price of fossil fuels. “The biggest cost saving is on buying the fossil fuels,” he said. “Wind and sun don’t send you a bill at the end of the month. We have seen [from the Ukraine war and global gas crisis] how foolhardy it is to rely on fossil fuels.” Heavy industries, such as mining, have long been regarded as among the hardest sectors to decarbonise, but Forrest said the falling costs of renewable energy generation and the rapid development of technologies, such as batteries and hydrogen, meant there was little excuse for the sector not to move swiftly. He urged other companies to follow his lead. “The question is not why are we doing it – it’s why everyone else is not doing it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/27/victoria-pledges-nations-most-ambitious-renewable-energy-storage-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-27T04:37:42Z","webTitle":"Victoria pledges nation’s most ambitious renewable energy storage targets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/27/victoria-pledges-nations-most-ambitious-renewable-energy-storage-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/27/victoria-pledges-nations-most-ambitious-renewable-energy-storage-targets","fields":{"headline":"Victoria pledges nation’s most ambitious renewable energy storage targets","bodyText":"The Andrews government has pledged to legislate Australia’s largest renewable energy storage targets in a bid to accelerate the state’s transition to renewables and lower power prices. Under the targets, Victoria would reach 2.6 gigawatts of renewable energy storage capacity by 2030 and 6.3 gigawatts of storage by 2035 – enough to power about half of Victoria’s current homes at their peak energy usage. If re-elected in November’s state election, the government would introduce the legislation to parliament next year. Andrews said adding more renewable energy supply would create downward pressure on household power bills, boost jobs and provide certainty to investors in the sector. “We intend to continue delivering more and more renewable energy,” Andrews said. “We need the storage capacity to sit alongside that so you can soak up that energy when it’s in plentiful and abundant supply and then dispatch that out to households and businesses when it is needed.” He said the storage goals would make it more likely the state will meet its target of halving emissions – using a 2005 baseline – by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Victoria also has a legislated a target of 50% renewables by 2030. “We are keen to not only meet our 2030 targets, but if we can exceed them, then obviously that’s a good thing for jobs, good thing for households and a pretty good thing for the planet as well,” Andrews said. Last week, the state’s greenhouse gas emissions report revealed Victoria’s emissions fell to 30% below 2005 levels in 2020. This drop followed the closure of the Hazelwood coal plant in 2017 – due to not being economically viable – which cut the state’s emissions output by about 10%. Victoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the storage targets were a crucial part of transition to renewables. “Doing that early, doing that with ambition, doing that with guidance from government is so important for investors to get on and actually deliver the projects that are going to ensure that we manage the energy transition,” she said. The targets will complement Victoria’s investment in wind and solar energy by soaking up the energy and dispatching it back into the grid when needed. Kane Thornton, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, said the targets would increase energy storage, thereby allowing more investment in solar and wind energy and lowering power prices. “The more of something you put into the grid, the lower the prices,” he said. “The significant jump in storage planned between 2030 and 2035 is the latest recognition that Victoria’s remaining coal generators are unlikely to last much beyond 2030.” The storage targets will include short and long-duration energy storage systems – which can hold more than eight hours of energy – including batteries, hydroelectricity and hydrogen technologies. In March, the Andrews government unveiled Australia’s first offshore wind targets that could generate enough energy to power 1.5m Victorian homes by 2032. The opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said the government’s pledge was “not a bad suggestion” but stressed that Victorians needed immediate cost of living relief. The state government predicted the storage targets would create and maintain 12,700 jobs and underpin $1.7bn in investment between 2023 and 20234. To support the targets, the Andrews government has also committed to investing $119m from its $540m renewable energy fund in a 125-megawatt battery and grid-forming inverter – to help stabilise the grid – between Bendigo and Red Cliffs. The opposition on Tuesday vowed it would invest $1m in creating a fuel price comparison app – similar to NSW’s model – if it won the state election. The app would require fuel stations to publish their prices and provide consumers with real-time information on petrol prices near them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/sep/28/our-bid-for-more-solar-panels-was-left-out-in-the-cold","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-28T06:00:00Z","webTitle":"Our bid for more solar panels was left out in the cold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/sep/28/our-bid-for-more-solar-panels-was-left-out-in-the-cold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/sep/28/our-bid-for-more-solar-panels-was-left-out-in-the-cold","fields":{"headline":"Our bid for more solar panels was left out in the cold","bodyText":"We had solar panels fitted in 2019 as part of the Solar Together initiative, and this year wanted to add to them. We chose Green Energy Together as it had done Solar Together projects with our council. We paid a £1,340 deposit. There was then a rather odd silence, but finally scaffolding and two installers appeared. The installers hadn’t been told the panels had to be fitted in addition to those already there, so the kit they had brought was inappropriate. Since then, in spite of daily phone calls and promises from the company that someone would ring back, nothing has happened. We eventually cancelled our order by phone and email, and asked for the return of our deposit and the removal of the scaffolding. Again, there has been silence, even from the company director we emailed directly. We are concerned that this company has over-reached itself while holding on to our money (and that of a lot of other people, if Trustpilot is to be believed). We are also concerned that the scaffolding is still on our house and is a security risk. Solar panels are an obvious route amid an energy crisis, and it is worrying this path seems to be made so difficult and full of obstacles. AJ, London The irony is the Solar Together scheme promises to make solar energy more accessible and more affordable to households who might not otherwise risk the investment. Councils group buy the best available deal from a vetted company at auction, and households who have registered an interest are sent a quote. Many households have benefited from the concept, but some installers, who auctioned their services, may have accepted more work than they can handle. Green Energy Together’s Trustpilot page makes for alarming reading, not just because 69% of reviews rate the company as bad or poor for the same reasons you cite, but because Trustpilot itself warns that it’s had to remove fake reviews. Trustpilot tells me that the company had ignored a formal demand to cease its “abuse” of the platform after “multiple suspected fake four-and five-star reviews” were detected. It says: “Ultimately, this enforcement action did not deter the business and, as a result, in June we terminated its paid subscription with Trustpilot. We also placed a warning banner on its Trustpilot page alerting consumers to its abuse of our platform.” So far, so bad, for a company whose website declares it keeps alive the “principles and values” of the late Queen. I put this alleged abuse – and the details of your ordeal – to Green Energy Together’s director, Nick Elbourne. He blames supply chain shortages and claims customers were sent a newsletter advising them of delays until the end of October. As for the Trustpilot abuse, he says that the platform had not provided enough information about the fake reviews for him to “diagnose the issue”. Over then to iChoosr, which runs the Solar Together scheme, and claims to vigorously vet the suitability of installers it works with. It also insists it caps the number of households which can apply for a quote if its installers reach full capacity. It told me Green Energy Together has, so far, completed 2,000 installations, but Covid and Brexit had created “unprecedented issues” with supply chains and staffing. “We are aware of some customers who have not had such a smooth journey, as we run our customer services alongside those of the installers that win our auctions, and we are working with Green Energy Together to resolve issues,” it says. Green Energy Together got in touch with you after I’d alerted iChoosr to your plight.

In doing so, they have even managed to unite the free-market, anti-net-zero Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank with green groups, the energy industry and the Labour party in opposing the plans. Banning solar farms from most of England’s farmland would place Truss squarely in opposition to the policy priorities she set out in her own speech to the Conservative party conference. Under the banner “get Britain moving”, the prime minister said she wanted faster economic growth, lower energy bills, reinforced energy security, more renewables and action to tackle the climate crisis. Yet the solar ban would hold back investment, lead to higher energy bills, lock in continued gas imports, stop renewable growth and stall efforts to reach net zero emissions. Truss said her ambition was to unleash “growth, growth and growth”. This will be news to the investors waiting to pour up to £20bn into new UK solar projects, according to the Financial Times. Her speech decried the “anti-growth coalition” that she said was “always [for] more taxes, more regulation and more meddling”. So farmers looking for more income may balk if Truss bans them from adding to growth by giving their fields over to solar while continuing to graze livestock. She said growth meant “businesses creating jobs”. But perhaps not the tens of thousands of jobs that industry group Solar Energy UK says its sector could be created by 2030. Truss touted her government’s efforts to “shield people from astronomically high [energy] bills”. But her ban would block new solar projects, which are quick to build and generates electricity nine times more cheaply than gas. She talked of “fiscal responsibility” and “bring[ing] down debt” – and yet higher bills will raise the cost of her “energy price guarantee”, which could add as much as £140bn to the national debt. Warning of dependence on “authoritarian regimes for cheap goods and energy”, Truss said she would take “decisive action to reinforce our energy security”. Yet she is also decisively against new solar, each 5 gigawatts of which would cut UK gas imports by 2%. Truss said her government was “delivering more renewables” and in an earlier speech had pledged to “speed up our deployment of all clean and renewable technologies, including … solar”. So she must be disappointed to learn that her officials believe an effective ban would slow things down. Finally, the Conservative leader told the party faithful that she would “deliver on our commitment to net zero [emissions by 2050]” and “tackle climate change”. Her government remains committed – at least as of early September – to a fully decarbonised power sector by 2035. Is this why Truss wants to block new solar? The technology, after all, plays a major role in the net zero pathways published by her climate advisers the Climate Change Committee – and I estimate that each 5GW of new solar would cut UK emissions by 2m tonnes of carbon dioxide. The real reasons for Truss and Jayawardena’s antipathy are unclear. Since they cannot oppose solar on grounds of cost, growth, energy security or climate, they are now citing food security. Yet solar occupies a tiny fraction of the UK, is usually on less productive agricultural land and is frequently co-located with grazing. At less than 0.1% of the country, solar covers a smaller land area than airports, golf courses or Christmas trees. Solar also covers a significantly smaller UK land area than biofuel crops, even though Carbon Brief analysis shows solar delivers 50-100 times more driving distance per hectare. Moreover, the farmland supposedly under threat from solar is facing more serious pressures from elsewhere. “The biggest threat to prime farmland in the UK is not solar farms,” says Prof Richard Betts, technical lead of the third UK Climate Change Risk Assessment report. “It’s climate change.” One of the only remaining possibilities is that the prime minister simply dislikes the way solar farms look. If so, the Liz Truss who says she wants less regulation, more growth, cheaper bills, more renewables, greater energy security and lower emissions may need to have words.

In a stunning coup that blindsided the network’s high-profile founders, a unit of Adani’s sprawling conglomerate said on Tuesday that it will be acquiring a 29.18% stake in NDTV in a complex deal involving one of the network’s investors. Under Indian takeover regulations, the move triggers an open offer for a stake of another 26%. If that is successful, Adani would be left with a controlling stake of 55%. NDTV – which was founded in 1988 by journalists Prannoy Roy and his wife, Radhika Roy – operates national channels in English and Hindi, along with a business channel and online news websites. But it revealed on Tuesday that it knew nothing about the takeover until Adani announced its move. “The NDTV founders and the company would like to make it clear that this … was executed without any input from, conversation with, or consent of the NDTV founders, who, like NDTV, have been made aware of this exercise of rights only today,” it said in a statement. One of the nation’s most popular news organisations, NDTV is regarded as one of the few media groups that takes a critical view of Modi’s BJP-led government policies. Guatam Adani is a strong ally of Modi, who has been known to fly on Adani corporate jets. Jairam Ramesh, communications spokesman for the opposition Congress party, said the takeover was “noting but concentration of economic and political power, and a brazen move tostifle any semblance of an independent media”. Dipti Lavya Swain, founder and managing partner at DLS Law Offices, said: “From NDTV’s statements, it seems this may not be a friendly takeover which generally is as per agreed terms and mechanism, and in fact, may end up being a hostile takeover.” The network is also the home of India’s most respected news broadcaster and anchorman, Ravish Kumar, who is also senior executive editor of NDTV. But one media commentator said that the takeover could see an exodus of personalities from NDTV. “[NDTV] was unabashedly pro-Congress and anti-BJP,” said author and media entrepreneur, Minhaz Merchant. “The Adani buyout will see an exodus of anchors and the channel will move editorially from left to centre.” The takeover will also pit Adani against his billionaire rival, Mukesh Ambani, boss of the huge Reliance Industries group, which is already an established power in the country’s media sector through a controlling interest in Network18. In March, Adani, who has seen his wealth balloon in recent years thanks to investments in solar energy, made his first bet in the media sector by taking a minority stake in local digital business news platform Quintillion. But the proposed NDTV transaction marks Adani’s highest-profile media bet to date. “NDTV is the most suitable broadcast and digital platform to deliver on our vision,” Adani Group executive Sanjay Pugalia said in the statement. While Adani did not disclose financial details of the group’s planned 29.18% stake purchase, it said its subsequent open offer would be for 294 rupees ($3.68) per NDTV share, which would be worth 4.93bn rupees. That open offer price is at a 20.5% discount to NDTV’s Tuesday’s close of 369.75 rupees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-rare-earths-mining-them-cant-cost-the-earth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-18T17:25:52Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on rare earths: mining them can’t cost the Earth | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-rare-earths-mining-them-cant-cost-the-earth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-rare-earths-mining-them-cant-cost-the-earth","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on rare earths: mining them can’t cost the Earth","bodyText":"Rare earth elements may be in short supply but they are not rare. Even the rarest, thulium, is more than 100 times more common than gold. But only a few countries – such as the US, Australia and Brazil – contain deposits substantial enough to mine. Crucially, climate solutions – such as solar energy, wind energy and electric vehicles – depend on rare earth elements, which have unique magnetic and luminescent properties. The trouble is that their production and disposal is environmentally destructive. It is worrying, therefore, that the European Union this week said that it wants lower regulatory barriers to mining raw materials needed for a green transition. To get to net zero, Europe will require up to 26 times the amount of rare earth metals in 2050 compared with today. Demand is also increasing because of digitalisation. The EU, like the UK, is dependent on imports, while the geopolitics of supply chains are increasingly unstable. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths. Russia is the fourth-largest supplier. The west views this as a significant potential threat to its security of supply. Given Russia’s attempts to weaponise its gas supplies, this is not an unreasonable belief. Consumers would notice if supplies were disrupted. Rare earths are critical to clean energy technologies used today; every Toyota Prius has more than 9kg (20lb) of lanthanum in its battery. It’s not only the future of the planet at stake, it’s the future of our defence too. Nato is almost 100% dependent on rare earth imports from China. A US Virginia-class submarine requires about four tonnes of rare earth materials. China has been willing to use key minerals as a political weapon. After tensions between Beijing and Tokyo boiled over in 2010, China blocked rare earth exports to Japan. Mining for rare earth minerals generates large volumes of toxic and radioactive material. The transition to climate neutrality cannot mean replacing a reliance on dirty fossil fuels with a dependence on raw materials, the extraction of which leaves large tracts of the Earth uninhabitable. Clean ways to recover these rare earths efficiently from discarded products are being developed. More companies are using recycled minerals in their manufacturing processes. Apple’s iPhone 12 is made from 98% reused rare earths. Japanese carmakers are cutting down on their use. Guillaume Pitron wrote in his book The Rare Metals War that over the next three decades “we will need to mine more mineral ores than humans have extracted over the last 70,000 years”. This cannot end up costing the Earth. China established its dominance over the rare earths industry because of lax environmental regulations and a cheap workforce. It has paid a high price. Today, 10% of its arable land is contaminated by heavy metals, and 80% of its groundwater isn’t fit for consumption. Technological advance on a global scale should not replicate such ecological destruction. A scramble for Africa, which is rich in rare earths but largely unexplored, is under way. Major powers are already pushing for deals. Capital would be attracted to a continent where labour is inexpensive and environmental protections are virtually nonexistent. But the world cannot sustain a race to the bottom in rare earths. What is needed is, first, to enact tougher regulations to stem the damage done by mining companies and then for the United Nations to get an enforceable agreement on high global standards for rare earth extraction and processing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/12/rishi-sunak-stop-start-policies-harming-uk-green-investment-says-net-zero-tsar","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-12T16:32:27Z","webTitle":"Sunak’s stop-start policies harming UK green investment, says net zero tsar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/12/rishi-sunak-stop-start-policies-harming-uk-green-investment-says-net-zero-tsar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/12/rishi-sunak-stop-start-policies-harming-uk-green-investment-says-net-zero-tsar","fields":{"headline":"Sunak’s stop-start policies harming UK green investment, says net zero tsar","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak has been criticised by his own net zero tsar, who says the UK risks missing its green targets due to inconsistent policies and lack of commitment to pledges. In his net zero review, seen by the Guardian, Chris Skidmore said a large barrier to renewable energy was a lack of confidence in the government, which has inconsistent policy support for green energy, with measures such as Sunak’s new electricity tax. Skidmore, the Conservative MP for Kingswood, was asked by the former prime minister Liz Truss to write a review on the policy to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. He was asked to find out what was working with the policy regarding not putting more carbon into the atmosphere than the UK absorbs, and to make the business case for the goal. One issue mentioned throughout the report is a lack of policy commitment. Skidmore said: “The overwhelming impression I got was we will make net zero more affordable if we are able to deliver further and faster, which requires certainty and consistency of approach. We need to de-risk investment, which will actually drive down the costs of net zero, and if the recommendations put forward by my review are followed we will create incentives to invest in renewables. “The review recognises we have fallen behind, but it sets out how we can be world-leading in these areas once again. We need to remove the barriers that are in place at the moment.” Dan McGrail, chief executive of the trade body RenewableUK, said: “Sudden policy changes like the imposition of the electricity generator levy, which kicked in at the start of this year, have put investment at risk.” Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK, said: “Skidmore is right to demand the replacement of stop-start policies with certainty for investors.” Skidmore cited agriculture as one of the main culprits of carbon emissions, and said its share of emissions could, by 2030, grow from 12% to 30%. To encourage people to eat more environmentally friendly foods, Skidmore recommended “eco-labelling” rather than a tax or ban on foods such as red meat. He also said that farmers had been disincentivised from farming in an environmentally friendly way by the confusion around the government’s post-Brexit nature-friendly agriculture payments, and that there had been missed opportunities for nature-based solutions with most policy focused on woodlands and peatland rather than many other carbon sinks such as wetlands. In the review, Skidmore called for a stable policy environment, with consistent support for renewables, as well as a reform of the way the government financially helps renewable energy projects to make that more attractive for investors. But climate campaigners criticised the review for being unambitious and for not calling for strong policies to avert the climate crisis. Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “Whilst there is much useful analysis of the problem the review stops short of recommending the kind of muscular policies that would really drive change towards the massive growth in renewables which will be necessary. “Without a strong push from government the renewables revolution will still proceed, because the economic logic dictates it should. But it won’t happen at the pace it needs to in order to forestall some of the worst effects of climate change.” While the review says the UK needs a “rooftop revolution” for solar panels and suggests making planning decisions easier to enable this, it stops short of recommending mandates for solar panels on new builds, or more funding to encourage take-up. Parr added: “All credible scenarios of our future economy rely on renewable energy being the backbone of the future energy system, and the review should have said government needs to change the remit of the regulator to include net zero delivery, insist on solar panels being on new roofs, expand the scale of renewables contracts and rapidly lay out the location of the offshore electricity grid. Instead, the government seem like a mildly curious spectator, wondering why their aspirations aren’t materialising without ever intervening to make them happen.” The renewable energy industry has tentatively welcomed the review, with industry leaders saying it contains good ideas that should be adopted by the government. McGrail said: “If the government is looking to increase the economic benefits of the UK’s decarbonisation ambitions, Chris Skidmore’s review has some really clear easy wins. As he suggests, setting targets for new onshore wind and solar capacity would certainly increase investor confidence, as well as ensuring we can decarbonise our electricity system by 2035.” He also praised Skidmore for promoting the use of “a wide range of renewables to strengthen Britain’s energy security, including innovative technologies like floating wind and tidal stream”. He said that he would have liked the review to have told the government to take a “war room” approach to tackling grid connectivity, “with the prime minister bringing all relevant bodies together to address this urgently”. Hewett said: “We very much hope that Whitehall will embrace his call to establish a joint taskforce with the solar industry to work on a roadmap for reaching 70GW of solar [capacity] by 2035 – about four-and-a-half times what we have now. “The number-one priority of this group will have to be unblocking access to the grid – which is pushing back the completion of many large projects well into the next decade.” Polly Billington, chief executive of the UK100 group of local government leaders, said the review showed that local authorities must play a leading role in implementing policy. “This independent review confirms what UK100 has been saying for years: local authorities are the key to achieving the UK’s net zero goals,” she said. “[We particularly welcome] the recommendation to end the disjointed mess of short-term, competitive local authority funding pots. This move would help communities maximise the economic and social benefits of net zero while making the most cost-effective use of resources.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: “Another day, another Conservative MP calling out the total failure of this government over many years to act with the urgency and consistency that the climate crisis demands. Chris Skidmore is right about the fact that 13 years of delay, dither and a refusal to go all-in on a green energy sprint under the Conservatives, is depriving our country of the economic opportunities climate action offers. “The tragedy is that Rishi Sunak is making things even worse. He is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age who has never understood what this report reaffirms – that going green is pro-business, pro-worker and is a vital part of growing our economy.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has been approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/08/qatar-gas-output-increase-catastrophic-global-heating-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T06:00:48Z","webTitle":"Qatar’s gas output increase could cause catastrophic global heating, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/08/qatar-gas-output-increase-catastrophic-global-heating-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/08/qatar-gas-output-increase-catastrophic-global-heating-report","fields":{"headline":"Qatar’s gas output increase could cause catastrophic global heating, report says","bodyText":"Qatar’s longest-lasting legacy following the World Cup won’t be football or even its human rights record – it will be the climate crisis, according to a new report warning that its huge expansion of gas extraction could push the planet into catastrophic global heating. Should Qatar exploit all of its oil and gas reserves it will eventually add an enormous 50bn metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere once burned, which is more than the entire annual emissions of the whole world, the new research, shared with the Guardian, has found. This vast output of emissions will in itself push the world beyond the internationally agreed limit of 1.5C of global heating beyond industrial times, beyond which scientists warn there will be increasingly disastrous impacts from heatwaves, droughts, floods and biodiversity die-offs. QatarEnergy, the state-owned petroleum operation that is overseeing a huge escalation in the country’s oil and gas output, is a sponsor of the World Cup currently under way in Qatar. Fifa, which has been accused of falsely claiming the World Cup will be carbon neutral, has featured QatarEnergy in sponsorship slots in stadiums and online even as the global football body launched a campaign called #SavethePlanet in which it warned the climate crisis “threatens the essential ingredients of good health” and causes “increasing destructiveness of extreme weather events”. Qatar’s vast oil and gas resources have greatly enriched the small Middle Eastern country, which this year became the world’s largest exporter of liquified natural gas (or LNG), superseding the US and Australia. It is now looking to further cement its position by ramping up production from a vast offshore gas deposit called the north field, which will account for 70% of the emissions growth according to the new report by BankTrack, an NGO that used data from BP to ascertain the extent of Qatar’s “carbon bomb” projects. The emissions from Qatar’s oil and gas resources will cause $20tn in damages and 11m deaths around the world, BankTrack said, citing calculations based upon recent research looking at the economic and mortal cost of fossil fuels. QatarEnergy has signed recent partnership deals with western oil giants including Shell, Total, ConocoPhilips, Exxon and Eni in order to boost output of the north field by 60% over the next five years. Separate deals have been struck in the past month with Germany and China to provide the countries with gas amid concerns over supplies disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, Qatar’s energy minister and chief executive of QatarEnergy, said last month Qatar will “provide reliable and credible LNG supply solutions to customers across the globe”. No new fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid breaching the 1.5C limit, the International Energy Agency has warned, but despite this there has been plenty of financial support for Qatar’s gas expansion. JPMorgan Chase, Citi, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, MUFG, Credit Suisse and Bank of America have all backed planned projects in the north field, providing nearly $12bn in bond underwriting services to QatarEnergy. “There’s a massive amount of emissions about to come from oil and gas taken from Qatar, although there hasn’t been much attention to it until now,” said Henrieke Butijn, climate campaigner and researcher at BankTrack. “What’s happening in Qatar is awful in terms of these projects and also worker conditions, but there is a level of hypocrisy here because Qatar isn’t acting alone. “Fifa selected Qatar for the World Cup and chose QatarEnergy as one of the main sponsors, even while they push their own climate campaign. And banks which have made net zero emissions commitments all know what they are doing when they are underwriting QatarEnergy. These banks need to cut off any finance that isn’t aligned with the 1.5C goal.” At the recent UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt, the world’s governments again committed to keeping below 1.5C, although emissions reduction pledges currently fall drastically short of meeting this target. While wind and solar energy deployment is growing rapidly – clean energy is set to overtake coal as an energy source globally by 2025 – the world is still teeing up vast quantities of fossil fuels that would push societies into climate meltdown should they be burned. A huge 3.5tn tons of greenhouse gas emissions will be emitted if governments allow identified reserves of coal, oil and gas to be extracted and used, a recent released in September found. Qatar’s 50bn tons of emissions will occur if it allows all of its deposits to be burned. While this may not happen if other countries move decisively away from fossil fuels as an energy source, there is currently no commitment from Qatar that it won’t completely exhaust its reserves. In previous years there have been claims Qatar’s gas reserves could last more than 130 years. QatarEnergy was contacted for comment on the research. On its website, the state-owned body states that the climate crisis is “one of the most critical issues of our times and requires prompt and dedicated action at a global scale”. “Fossil fuels are weapons of mass destruction, carbon bombs ticking against the time we have left to avert the very worst of the climate crisis,” said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International. “Fossil fuel companies, the banks that fund them and the governments that support them are complicit in the suffering of millions. It is time to strip them off their social and economic licenses and make them pay up for climate damages.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T09:31:06Z","webTitle":"Wife of Malaysia’s jailed ex-PM handed 10 years in prison for bribery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","fields":{"headline":"Wife of Malaysia’s jailed ex-PM handed 10 years in prison for bribery","bodyText":"The wife of the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for soliciting and receiving bribes in exchange for government contracts, one week after her husband was sent to prison for corruption linked to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal. Rosmah Mansor, 70, had pleaded not guilty to three charges of soliciting bribes and receiving 6.5m ringgit (£1.3m) in exchange for helping a company secure a contract to provide solar power to schools. The high court judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan said prosecutors proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. The judge added that her defence was “bare denial and unsubstantiated”. Rosmah also faces a fine of 970m ringgit. She can seek bail while she appeals against the judgment. The verdict on Thursday comes just over a week since Najib began a 12-year sentence for breach of trust, abuse of power, and money laundering in a conviction linked to the 1MDB scandal, one of the world’s biggest financial frauds. Najib and Rosmah have faced various charges since he lost an election in 2018 amid public anger over huge corruption during his administration. In the aftermath of their election defeat, the couple sought to leave the country by private jet, according to a flight manifesto leaked at the time. They were banned from travelling by the country’s then leader, Mahathir Mohamad. Police raids on several properties linked to Najib revealed further details of their opulent lifestyles. Police seized hundreds of designer handbags, including 272 Hermès bags estimated to be worth nearly $13m, as well as 1,400 necklaces, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras. Rosmah’s corruption case is not related to the 1MDB scandal. Prosecutors had argued Rosmah exerted influence over government spending, despite having no official position, and helped a company secure a 1.25bn ringgit contract to provide solar energy panels to schools on Borneo. They accused Rosmah of seeking a bribe of 187.5m ringgit and receiving 6.5m ringgit from an official of the company that won the project in 2016 and 2017. Her former aide, who was jointly charged with Rosmah but later testified for the prosecution, portrayed her as an influential figure who was often lobbied by businesspeople seeking government contracts. The aide testified Rosmah was feared by civil servants and requests from her staff were often carried out quickly. Witnesses said a special department, called First Lady of Malaysia, was set up to handle Rosmah’s affairs. The court heard she spent 100,000 ringgit a month to hire online propagandists to deflect criticism of her lavish lifestyle, the Associated Press reported. Rosmah has said she was framed by her former aide as well as government and company officials involved in the project. Najib is being held at the country’s largest prison in Kajang, which holds up to 5,000 prisoners. The prisons department has denied claims that VIP inmates were granted more comfortable living arrangements, such as air conditioning and access to TV and internet. His daughter, Nooryana Najwa, was mocked on social media this week after she reportedly lamented that her father would be missing his usual Starbucks order. She said on Instagram that she could not face ordering from the chain because she knew her father, stuck in prison, would be missing his caramel macchiato. Some responded online by announcing they would make sure to buy the drink the next day. Najib faces four other corruption cases. Rosmah also faces 17 charges of money laundering and tax evasion for illegally receiving 7.1m ringgit between 2013 and 2017 in a separate case linked to 1MDB, though her trial has not yet begun. The 1MDB scandal has led to corruption investigations around the world, including the US, Singapore, and Switzerland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/oct/09/beam-me-down-can-solar-power-from-space-help-solve-our-energy-needs","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T11:00:55Z","webTitle":"Beam me down: can solar power from space help solve our energy needs?

","bodyText":"In late November, a top-level meeting of European science ministers will convene in Paris. Their job is to decide the next priorities for the European Space Agency (Esa), of which the UK is still a member, and one of the items on their list to consider is a proposal for testing the feasibility of building commercial power stations in orbit. These huge satellites would bask in the sunlight, converting it to power and beaming it down to Earth to be fed into the power grid. The proposed project, known as Solaris, would determine whether the idea can contribute to Europe’s future energy security – or if it is all still pie in the sky. If the study gets the go-ahead, it will be like coming home for the space industry, which has always been at the forefront of solar power development. A year after the Russians launched the battery-powered Sputnik 1 in 1957, the Americans launched Vanguard 1. This was the fourth satellite in orbit and the first to generate its power using solar energy. Since that time, solar panels have become the primary way of powering spacecraft, which has helped to drive research. Vanguard 1’s solar cells converted just 9% of the captured sunlight into electricity. Today, the efficiency has more than doubled, and continues to increase, while the cost of fabrication has been falling. It’s a winning formula. “The cost of solar has been decreasing rapidly over the past 20 years, and faster than most players in the industry expected,” says Jochen Latz, a partner at management consultant McKinsey &amp; Company. So much so, that in the Middle East and Australia, solar power is now the cheapest way to generate electricity. According to Latz, as the technology continues to develop, this will become true in the mid-latitude countries too. “In 2050, we expect more than 40% of the energy in the EU to come from solar power – if the countries achieve their committed targets,” says Latz. That would make solar power the single largest contributing energy source to the EU. However, there are obvious problems that need solutions if we are to fully utilise solar panels on Earth. For one thing, what do we do at night? In May, Ned Ekins-Daukes, associate professor at the school of photovoltaic and renewable energy engineering at the University of New South Wales, Australia, and his team of researchers demonstrated a solar cell that could generate electricity from the emission of infrared rather than from the absorption of sunlight. This works perfectly at night because the Earth stores energy from the sun in the form of heat, which it then radiates back into space as infrared radiation. The prototype device is based on the same kind of technology used in night-vision goggles and at present it can only generate a few milliwatts of power, but Ekins-Daukes sees the potential. “This is the beginning – it’s the world’s first demonstration of thermal radiative power,” he says, indicating that the team is aiming for a finished product that is “10,000 times more powerful”. At those levels, it is possible that a rooftop installation of such devices, probably fabricated in some way as an additional layer to conventional solar panels, would capture enough energy to power the house overnight – that is, keeping the fridge, wifi router and so on running. While that is a modest saving for each household, multiplied across a country’s population, it becomes significant. Another obvious issue with solar power is that some days will be cloudy. To alleviate this, excess electricity generated on sunny days needs to be stored in batteries but storage capacity is currently woeful. “The EU will need about 200 gigawatts [GW] of battery storage by 2030, but as of 2021 there was only 2.4GW of storage in place, so a massive increase will be needed,” says Aidan McClean, chief executive of UFODrive, an all-electric car rental company. To help with this shortfall, McClean champions a scheme called vehicle-to-grid – V2G – which uses the battery in an electric vehicle (EV) to store excess energy generated by a home’s rooftop solar panels and then transfer it back into the house when needed in the evening, or even sell it on to National Grid at other periods of high demand. “If V2G becomes widely adopted, the expected storage capacity of all the EVs will vastly exceed any expected storage requirements the grid will require going into the future,” says McClean. A recent V2G trial in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, showed that participants saved money and cut their carbon footprint by using an “intelligent” charging system that topped up the batteries when renewables were generating electricity. Another approach is to use solar power not to generate electricity but to produce sustainable vehicle fuels. Virgil Andrei of the department of chemistry at Cambridge University and his colleagues have developed a thin “artificial leaf” that draws its inspiration from photosynthesis. In plants, photosynthesis takes in sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2) and converts them into oxygen and sugars. In the artificial leaves, the output is syngas, or synthetic gas. This mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used to produce a number of fuels via various industrial processes. It is even possible to produce petrol and kerosene. “We envisioned using CO2 from the atmosphere or other industrial processes and pouring that into these types of systems to create green fuel. Instead of releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere, we just have a circular carbon economy,” says Andrei. In effect they would piggyback off carbon-capture plants, which are currently being deployed to harness CO2 from industrial processes, and “recycle” it into sustainable fuels. The team first made an artificial leaf in 2019 but it was a bulky construction of glass and metal that sat on a bench top. This year, however, the team announced the results of a smaller, actual leaf-like structure that the researchers floated on the River Cam. The leaf was sealed inside a transparent plastic bag with the precursor gas and water and then left on the river for a number of days. The team then opened the bag and tested what gases had been produced by photosynthesis. The artificial leaves themselves are composed of materials called perovskites. The archetypal perovskite is a naturally occurring mineral of calcium titanium oxide – also known as calcium titanate – which was discovered in 1839 in the Ural mountains of Russia by German mineralogist Gustav Rose and named after his Russian counterpart Lev Perovski. Modern perovskites can have different chemical constituents and some have shown that they can function as solar cells. “These materials are very new and very exciting,” says Andrei. Laboratory tests show that they can be more efficient than the silicon used in conventional solar panels. Perovskites could even replace silicon in the solar panels of the future as they can be fabricated more easily and in thin, flexible layers. Another bonus is that these materials produce higher currents and voltages than their silicon counterparts, which allows more energetic processes such as the reactions that were used in the artificial leaves study. *** As promising as all this sounds, though, there is one insurmountable problem when generating solar power from the surface of the Earth: the atmosphere. The molecules in our atmosphere scatter about half the sunlight out of the direct beam. This scattered light bouncing around is what creates the blue sky we are so familiar with. In space, there is no atmosphere, so the sun’s light is undiluted. And as the aerospace engineers at the beginning of the space race found, put a solar panel in orbit and it will automatically generate about twice as much power as the equivalent panel on Earth. Unsurprisingly then, engineers and visionaries have been dreaming of putting solar power-producing satellites into orbit for decades. The basic principle is simple. A fleet of spacecraft with giant solar panels collects sunlight, before converting it into power and then beaming that energy back to Earth. How do you wirelessly beam energy across space? It turns out we’ve been doing it for decades. Every telecommunications satellite since the 1960s has used a solar panel to generate electricity, which is then converted into a microwave signal and sent to Earth. On the ground, antennas convert the microwaves back into electrical energy and read the signals. “The physics involved in that whole chain is exactly the same for space-based solar power, but the scale of it is completely different,” says Sanjay Vijendran of Esa, who is coordinating the proposed Solaris programme to study the feasibility of space-based solar power. Every few decades since the beginning of the space race, the idea of space solar power has been investigated. On every occasion, the story has been the same: the cost of launching such large satellites is prohibitive. But now, things are different. “In 2015, a miracle happens. The Falcon 9 reusable rocket flies for the first time,” says John Mankins, a former Nasa physicist who is now president of Artemis Innovation Management Solutions. Mankins is an expert on solar-power satellites, having worked on many of the feasibility studies over the decades. With the advent of a truly reusable rocket, the cost of sending equipment into orbit is tumbling. Instead of costing about $1,000 to launch every kilogram into space, Mankins now expects the price to come down to closer to $300 a kilogram. “That’s the holy grail for space solar power. It is not just possible some day – it’s inevitable in the next five or seven years,” he says. Others are similarly optimistic. In September 2021, the Frazer-Nash Consultancy published a report for the UK government that concluded: “Space solar power is technically feasible, affordable, and could both bring substantial economic benefits for the UK, and could support net zero pathways.” In late August, Esa released its own studies on space-based solar energy, which arrived at a similar conclusion for the whole of Europe. As a result, the agency will request in November that its member states fund a three-year feasibility study into solar-power satellites to examine in detail whether such a system might become commercially viable. “Solaris is a bridge to check that this is really doable and that it would really help before we ask for billions of euros,” says Vijendran. Whether or not such satellites go into orbit, there can be no doubt that solar power is set to dominate the energy landscape of the future. And as the current Ukraine crisis shows, that could lead to better energy security as well as reducing our carbon output."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/15/agl-energy-board-directors-mike-cannon-brookes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T02:44:30Z","webTitle":"Mike Cannon-Brookes succeeds in shaking up AGL board ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/15/agl-energy-board-directors-mike-cannon-brookes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/15/agl-energy-board-directors-mike-cannon-brookes","fields":{"headline":"Mike Cannon-Brookes succeeds in shaking up AGL board ","bodyText":"Billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes has succeeded in shaking up the board of Australia’s biggest electricity producer, with all four of his proposed directors winning support from shareholders at AGL Energy’s annual general meeting. The company, though, won backing for its decarbonisation plans, which were less ambitious than those proposed by Cannon-Brookes, AGL’s biggest single shareholder. AGL is the country’s largest carbon emitter. Patricia McKenzie, AGL’s chair, told the meeting in Melbourne that the company’s climate transition action plan – which would see it shut its final coal-fired power plant by 2035 – had support from shareholders. The vote was about two-thirds in favour. McKenzie said that based on proxy votes ahead of the meeting, the five-member board would be expanded to include all four of Cannon-Brooke’s proposed new directors: Mark Twidell, Dr Kerry Schott, Christine Holman and John Pollaers. AGL’s board had only supported Twidell, a solar energy veteran, ahead of the vote. It remains to be seen whether the expanded board, which also includes the recently appointed wind energy expert, Miles George, will opt to accelerate AGL’s plans. A spokesperson for Grok Ventures, a family company owned by Cannon-Brookes, welcomed the new board additions. “This represents another majority vote by AGL shareholders pointing to their desire for change, fresh thinking and more execution capacity to realise the potential of this great company,” the spokesperson said. “The AGL Board has Grok Ventures’ full support to deliver on the monumental task ahead, of rebuilding the company to lead Australia’s green energy transition, for the benefit of all stakeholders,” he said. AGL’s chair McKenzie also welcomed the new directors, saying the board “will work constructively with them in the best of interests of shareholders”. “It’s great to have diversity on the board,” McKenzie said in answer to questions, adding that Grok “does not control AGL”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Cannon-Brookes had raised concerns about McKenzie’s ongoing role as chair since she had backed AGL’s demerger. That plan was ditched in May because of Grok’s activism. In September, AGL announced it would bring forward the closure date of its Loy Yang A brown coal-fired power station in Victoria by a decade, to 2035, while leaving its black-coal burning Bayswater power station in NSW running until between 2030 and 2033. AGL’s Liddell plant, also in NSW, shuts next April. McKenzie said AGL had the “ambition to add up to 12 gigawatts of new renewable and firming capacity by 2036, which will require a total investment of up to $20bn”.  This plan included an interim target to have up to 5GW of new renewables and firming in place by 2030, she said, adding AGL now has a 3.2GW pipeline of high-quality energy projects and access to a 3.5GW high quality renewables development pipeline via its investment in Tilt Renewables. McKenzie said each of the new directors had issued statements of independence, saying “they are not representing any particular shareholder”. In recorded comments, Schott said AGL needed cut carbon emissions “as much as they can, as fast as they can”, that much of the company’s value was in its gas and electricity retailing arms. Schott said it was important that the directors worked collaboratively: “The last thing a board needs is to be balkanised.” Brynn O’Brien, executive director of The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, welcomed the shareholders’ action. “History has been made today,” O’Brien said. “The board of an Australian listed company has been transformed by shareholders over its handling of climate risks. “This is both a victory for shareholders and a scathing indictment on those who spent years destroying shareholder value by delaying the inevitable in the face of an escalating energy transition. “It is vital that lessons are learned from AGL’s colossal waste of time and shareholder funds. “The boards of other high-emitting companies should be taking note of today’s outcome: climate risk management is an ever-increasing pressure and those who remain flat-footed in the face of rapidly shifting market dynamics will be held to account.” Tim Buckley, energy finance analyst and director of independent thinktank Climate Energy Finance, said AGL had been “a global laggard in accepting and acting on the climate science” but was now at “a turning point”. “This board renewal is critical for AGL investors given the opportunity to start to reverse the $10bn of shareholder wealth destruction in the last six years, but also for the wider context given AGL is a key Australian energy sector incumbent, with financial resources and staffing that can be leveraged constructively, with the right leadership,” Buckley said. AGL would put its transition plan up for shareholders to vote on every three years, McKenzie said. About 30% of shareholders voted against the remuneration plan for executives, delivering a so-called “first strike” that could place extra pressure on management in the future. Geoff Wilson, an AGL shareholder and chair of Wilson Asset Management, said Tuesday’s outcome was “a positive step forward for shareholder democracy”. “It is important that all Australian company boards understand that they only serve at the wishes of their shareholders,” he said. AGL shares gave up early gains to trade about 1.4% lower close to close of trade. The benchmark ASX200 index was flat for the day."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/22/climate-spending-republican-states-clean-energy-funding","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T09:00:20Z","webTitle":"Republicans in the US ‘battery belt’ embrace Biden’s climate spending ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/22/climate-spending-republican-states-clean-energy-funding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/22/climate-spending-republican-states-clean-energy-funding","fields":{"headline":"Republicans in the US ‘battery belt’ embrace Biden’s climate spending ","bodyText":"Georgia, a state once known for its peaches and peanuts, is rapidly becoming a crucible of clean energy technology in the US, leading a pack of Republican-led states enjoying a boom in renewables investment that has been accelerated by Joe Biden’s climate agenda. Since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August, billions of dollars of new clean energy investment has been announced for solar, electric vehicle and battery manufacturing in Georgia, pushing it to the forefront of a swathe of southern states that are becoming a so-called “battery belt” in the economic transition away from fossil fuels. “It seems like all roads are currently leading to Georgia, it’s really benefiting disproportionately from the Inflation Reduction Act right now,” said Aaron Brickman, senior principal at energy research nonprofit RMI. Brickman said the $370bn in clean energy incentives and tax credits in the bill are a “complete game changer. We’ve just frankly never had that before in this country. The IRA has transformed the landscape in a staggering way.” Georgia is part of a pattern where Republican-headed states have claimed the lion’s share of new renewable energy and electric vehicle activity since the legislation, with Republican-held congressional districts hosting more than 80% of all utility-scale wind or solar farms and battery projects currently in advanced development, according to an analysis by American Clean Power. States blessed with plentiful wind and sunshine, along with significant rural and industrial communities, such as those across the Great Plains and the south, appear best positioned to capitalize on the climate bill. Texas, already a bastion of wind power, could see $131bn in IRA-linked investment this decade, Florida may see $62bn and Georgia $16bn, according to an RMI analysis. The irony of this bonanza, which is coming despite no Republican voting for the climate spending, was alluded to by Biden in his recent state of the union address. “My Republican friends who voted against it – I still get asked to fund the projects in those districts as well,” the US president said, to jeers from some members of Congress. “But don’t worry, I promised I’d be a president for all Americans. We’ll fund these projects and I’ll see you at the groundbreaking.” A mixed political groundbreaking did take place in Georgia in October, when Brian Kemp, the Republican governor, was served champagne by a robotic dog before ceremonially shoveling dirt alongside Democratic senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to kick off Hyundai’s first dedicated electric vehicle plant in the US. The $5.5bn facility in Bryan county, which will create around 8,000 jobs when it opens in 2025, came about because “we heard the clarion call of this administration to hasten the adoption of new electric vehicles and reduce carbon emissions”, according to José Muñoz, Hyundai’s global president. Ossoff told the Guardian he has long held a vision that Georgia “should be the advanced energy innovation and manufacturing hub for the US” and credits a bill he wrote, the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act, which was then folded into the IRA, for helping convince Hanwha Qcells, another South Korean-owned company, to commit $2.5bn for two new solar panel factories in the state in January. “This targeted legislation was by no means a foregone conclusion but passing it has opened the floodgates in Georgia,” Ossoff said. Democrats have touted the bill for not only helping tackle the climate crisis but also as a way to wrest the initiative from China, which has dominated the manufacturing of parts for clean energy systems and electric cars until now. Georgia’s embrace of clean energy technology was under way before the IRA, with Atlanta, bolstered by leading renewables research at Georgia Tech, increasingly viewed as an innovative fulcrum. In 2022, Freyr, a Norwegian company, announced a $1.7bn battery plant for Coweta county, south of Atlanta, while SK Battery, yet another South Korean-owned firm, said last spring it will hire another 3,000 workers at its battery factory in Commerce, north-east of Georgia’s capital. Rivian, the electric car company, meanwhile is keen to build a sprawling $5bn facility east of Atlanta although it has faced opposition from some residents in the small town of Rutledge, who have sued to stop the development. But last year’s IRA, with its sweeping tax incentives for emissions-reducing technologies, has made the environment even more enticing. Scott Moskowitz, head of market strategy for Qcells said that Georgia has been a “great home” since 2019 but that the IRA is “some of the most ambitious clean energy policy passed anywhere in the world” and gave the Hanwha-owned company certainty to triple capacity at its site in Dalton, which already cranks out around 12,000 solar panels a day, as well as create a new complex in Cartersville that will manufacture ingots and wafers, the basic building blocks of solar panel components, made from polysilicon. “There’s a ton of opportunity and excitement in [the] clean energy sector right now,” Moskowitz said. “We’ve always had strong support from both sides of the aisle, even if there hasn’t always been agreement.” Barry Loudermilk, a Republican congressman whose House of Representatives district includes Cartersville, denied that the rush of investment is politically awkward for the GOP, accusing Biden of an “elementary school-level response” to the issue in his state of the union speech. “I’m not against this industry and I’m all about bringing in new technology, but it has to be market-driven,” Loudermilk told the Guardian. “When the government heavily subsidizes something it will crest and then fall down because the market hasn’t matured. “We aren’t ready for this (full EV and clean energy adoption). This is just subsidizing one industry over another and just throwing taxpayer dollars at something usually just leads to failure, and sets you back a decade.” Georgia is a draw for businesses due to its relatively low tax rate, transport links – including Atlanta’s busy airport and Savannah’s deep port – and a diverse and adept pool of workers, according to Loudermilk. “The days of the backwoods country bumpkin are in the past, we have educated, skilled workforce,” he said. It’s uncertain whether Loudermilk will be at the Cartersville groundbreaking, nor Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right extremist who represents the neighboring congressional district that includes Dalton. Greene has previously said the IRA is an “energy disaster” and erroneously said that global heating is “actually healthy for us”, although she has said she welcomes any new jobs to Georgia. Kemp, meanwhile, has offered state-level incentives for firms to set up in Georgia, while denouncing Democrats for “picking winners and losers” with the national climate bill. The governor recently pitched his state as a destination for clean tech investment at Davos and has denied any hypocrisy in his stance. “Georgia is a destination state for all manner of new jobs and opportunity despite the bad policies coming out of DC – not because of them,” said a spokesman for Kemp. “Companies are choosing Georgia over places like New York and California because they know they’ll find success here, not because of the IRA.” Even if the causes for the renewables investment are in dispute, the trajectory of the transition is becoming more undeniable. As the cost of renewables continues to plummet and more Americans turn to electric cars, thanks in part to the “unprecedented scale” of the IRA, partisan divides on the issue may soften, according to Ashna Aggarwal, an associate at RMI, the energy research nonprofit. “This is a bill that benefits everyone and it actually benefits the people who weren’t necessarily in favor of the bill the most,” Aggarwal said. “I think what’s really exciting about the clean energy economy is that party lines don’t really matter here. There’s more opportunity for Republican states and I hope that Republican policymakers see that and really think this is good for the people who are living in our states.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/nov/30/home-office-u-turn-on-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-30T14:48:29Z","webTitle":"Home Office U-turn on Sri Lankan scientist’s asylum claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/30/home-office-u-turn-on-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/nov/30/home-office-u-turn-on-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","fields":{"headline":"Home Office U-turn on Sri Lankan scientist’s asylum claim","bodyText":"The Home Office has U-turned on plans to deport a leading scientist carrying out groundbreaking research into affordable forms of solar energy and allowed him and his family to remain in the UK. Initially, the Home Office rejected the asylum claim lodged by Dr Nadarajah Muhunthan, 47, who has been living in the UK since 2018 with his wife, Sharmila, 42, and their three children, aged 13, nine and five. Muhunthan, who is working on thin-film photovoltaic devices used to generate solar energy, was given a prestigious Commonwealth Rutherford fellowship. The award allowed him to come to the UK for two years to research and develop the technology. He was based at the University of Bristol. His wife got a job caring for elderly people in a nursing home. The couple’s eldest daughter, Gihaniya, has received outstanding school reports in the UK with a 100% attendance rate and been particularly praised for her achievements in science. She hopes to study to be a doctor when she is older. The family are Tamils, a group that has experienced persecution in Sri Lanka. However, just weeks after the Guardian highlighted the case, the Home Office changed its mind and has now granted Muhunthan and his family refugee status. Muhunthan thanked the Home Office for their decision. “The Home Office has saved my life and my family’s lives. Now I will be able to continue my research without fear,” he said. After reading the previous Guardian article about the case, Prof David J Firmin, head of the electro-chemistry and solar team at the University of Bristol where Muhunthan was conducting research into ways to make solar energy panels more effective and affordable, wrote to the Home Office at the end of October expressing his “deepest concern”. He said Muhunthan’s work was making a significant contribution to efforts to decarbonise the energy generation sector. In November 2019, Muhunthan returned to his home country for a short visit to see his sick mother. While he was there, he was arrested and persecuted by the Sri Lankan government. He managed to escape and returned to the UK, where he claimed asylum on the basis of what he had experienced on his visit to Sri Lanka. After his scholarship expired in February 2020, neither he nor his wife were permitted to continue working. The family’s lawyer, Naga Kandiah of MTC solicitors, welcomed the Home Office’s change of heart. He said:“This is an important victory which recognises there is systematic torture of Tamils going on in Sri Lanka. This scientist and his family will all be assets to the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/may/27/oman-plans-to-build-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-27T08:51:07Z","webTitle":"Oman plans to build world’s largest green hydrogen plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/27/oman-plans-to-build-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/may/27/oman-plans-to-build-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-plant","fields":{"headline":"Oman plans to build world’s largest green hydrogen plant","bodyText":"Oman is planning to build one of the largest green hydrogen plants in the world in a move to make the oil-producing nation a leader in renewable energy technology. Construction is scheduled to start in 2028 in Al Wusta governorate on the Arabian Sea. It will be built in stages, with the aim to be at full capacity by 2038, powered by 25 gigawatts of wind and solar energy. The consortium of companies behind the $30bn (£21bn) project includes the state-owned oil and gas company OQ, the Hong Kong-based renewable hydrogen developer InterContinental Energy and the Kuwait-based energy investor Enertech. Once online, the plant will use renewable energy to split water in an electrolyser to produce green hydrogen, which is able to replace fossil fuels without producing carbon emissions. Most will be exported to Europe and Asia, said Alicia Eastman, the co-founder and president of InterContinental Energy, either as hydrogen or converted into green ammonia, which is easier to ship and store. The facility aims to produce 1.8m tonnes of green hydrogen and up to 10m tonnes of green ammonia a year. Oman currently relies heavily on fossil fuels, generating up to 85% of its GDP from oil and gas, but its fossil fuel reserves are dwindling and becoming increasingly costly to extract. In December 2020, the country published its Oman Vision 2040 strategy, a plan to diversify the economy away from fossil fuels and increase investment in renewables. Green hydrogen could play an important role, said Eastman, thanks to the Oman’s combination of plentiful daytime sun and strong winds at night. “Oman is one of the places in the world that I’ve called the ‘future renewable superpowers’,” said Michael Liebreich, the founder of BloombergNEF, “because what you really want [to produce green hydrogen] is very cheap solar and very cheap wind.” While electrification is the most efficient way of decarbonising most sectors, it’s limited when it comes to energy-intensive industries such as steel, chemicals, aviation and shipping. Green hydrogen will be vital to help fill these gaps, said the International Energy Agency in its report published this week, which called for an end to fossil fuel investments if governments are serious about climate commitments. A wave of net zero-emissions pledges has already led to a slew of hydrogen strategies, including from the European Commission in 2020, which predicted the share of hydrogen in the EU’s energy mix would rise from 2% to 14% by 2050. Yet green hydrogen currently makes up less than 1% of global hydrogen production. The majority is still produced using fossil fuels such as gas and coal, in a process that emits about 830m tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of the UK and Indonesia combined. “Blue hydrogen” is a cleaner version, as emissions are captured and stored, but it is still produced using gas – and is seen by some oil companies as a way to keep using fossil fuels. One of the stumbling blocks for green hydrogen has been cost, partly because of the huge amounts of energy required. But as renewables and electrolysers become cheaper, and fossil fuel prices rise, costs could fall by up to 64% by 2030, according to research from the consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “Most green hydrogen products will not be competitive for at least another decade,” said Falko Ueckerdt, a senior scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who sees the Oman project as “a sign that investors anticipate large future demands for hydrogen-based fuels after 2030”. Oman’s proposed plant is just one in a slate of green hydrogen mega projects planned globally. Eastman said InterContinental Energy has a number of other plants in the works, including a 26GW wind and solar green hydrogen plant in the Pilbara, Western Australia. If constructed, this $36bn (£25.5bn) plant would be the world’s biggest energy project. The first phase is expected to be online by 2028. In March, the renewables company Enegix Energy announced the construction of a green hydrogen plan in Ceará state, north-eastern Brazil. Once built, which the company estimates will take about four years, the plant would produce more than 600,000 tonnes of green hydrogen per year from 3.4GW of wind and solar power. “People are upping the gigawatts, and they should,” said Eastman, “there’s so much room in the market.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/feb/28/solar-panels-a-ray-of-hope-as-energy-prices-go-through-the-roof","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-28T07:30:35Z","webTitle":"Solar panels: a ray of hope as UK energy prices go through the roof","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/28/solar-panels-a-ray-of-hope-as-energy-prices-go-through-the-roof","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/feb/28/solar-panels-a-ray-of-hope-as-energy-prices-go-through-the-roof","fields":{"headline":"Solar panels: a ray of hope as UK energy prices go through the roof","bodyText":"With energy bills on their way up again from April, homeowners are looking skywards to try and ease the pressure on their budgets – by installing solar panels. The latest change to the regulator’s cap on default tariffs means, from spring, that the average annual dual-fuel bill will go up to £1,971, an increase of 54% on current levels. And with homeowners increasingly working from home, and therefore using more energy during the day, many are looking at installing panels to cut costs, and even earn from the energy they generate. Thomas Newby, chief executive of Leeds-based renewable energy company egg, says they received the same number of inquiries in the first nine days of this month as they did in the whole of November. “Many consumers are still on fixed deals but which will likely come to an end shortly, so I expect we may see a further increase in demand in the coming year,” he says. What it costs Solar panels convert energy from the sun into electricity. Stronger sunlight creates more electricity, which can then either be used in your home or exported to the national grid. But installing them comes at a cost. The average bill reaches almost £5,000 and rising labour bills and shortages of photovoltaic panels mean prices are going up. Domestic systems are generally made up of between 10 and 15 panels, each of which generate between 200W and 350W of energy, according to the Energy Saving Trust, a charity promoting energy efficiency. The more panels on the roof, the higher the installation cost but also the potential for more energy. The average price for an installation of a 3.5kW system is £4,800, including labour. This tends to be about 12 panels. “This is the average size for domestic systems in the UK,” says Brian Horne, senior insight and analytics consultant at the Energy Saving Trust. “The amount you pay for installation will be influenced by the size of the system, and will also be affected by any difficulty with access to your roof.” This price does not include the cost of a battery, which allows solar energy to be stored for use at a later time. They range between £1,200 and £6,000, according to GreenMatch, which compares green energy products. Although prices for solar systems have come down over the last decade, the increased cost of labour as well as the shortage in panels from China recently, has sent costs on the way back up, says Newby. “That’s as a result of some increase in material prices but, more generally, it is labour. That’s a big part of the job.” Planning and permissions The ideal roof for solar panels is south-facing. East- or west- facing roofs yield up to 20% less energy; north-facing ones are the least productive and deemed to be impractical in the UK. For a 3.5kW system you need room for 15 to 20 sq metres of panels. The best results will be achieved from a roof angled at 30 degrees. Most UK roofs are between 30 and 45 degrees, according to consumer group Which?. Solar panels are classed as permitted developments so in most cases will not require planning permission. However, if you live in a listed building or a conservation area, there may be restrictions. It is best to contact your local council to be absolutely clear. When solar panels are to be installed, the company which brings electricity to your home – the Distribution Network Operator (DNO) – must be informed. The Energy Networks Association has an online tool which, by entering your postcode, will tell you which company operates in your area. If a solar system is above a certain size, prior permission is needed from the DNO and can take up to three months to obtain, according to Newby. After the preparation for putting the system in place is complete, installing the panels can take one to two days. Making money back Under the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG), households can get paid for electricity that they do not use which is exported back to the grid. You can shop around to get the best price for the energy you are creating. The trade association Solar Energy UK lists the best rates for homes feeding back into the grid. Tesla’s Energy Plan tops its table, paying 12p per kWh, although it requires you to have one of its own Powerwall batteries installed. Octopus energy pays 7.5p per kWh. The savings on your bills, and how long it will take to recoup the money invested, vary depending on where a home is, whether electricity is sold back to the grid and how much energy you use. In London, a property where residents are at home all day and selling energy back to the grid can make savings of £385 a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. The same home where residents are out until after 6pm and don’t feed electricity into the grid would save £120. In Stirling, Scotland, a home occupied for the day and feeding back saves £340 while the same house empty and not feeding in saves £110. The Energy Saving Trust says there has been little research on how solar panels affect the value of a property, but says those with better energy performance sell for more. “It seems likely their impact on house prices will increase following recent energy price rises and the associated focus on ways to reduce energy requirements and switch to renewable energy,” says Horne. A report from Solar Energy UK found homes with solar panels can increase in value by £1,800, following an analysis of property sales. The Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) certifies products and installations used to produce electricity and heat from renewable sources, and should be used as a first stop to find accredited installers near you, says Horne. As costs vary, it is best to get three quotes before committing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2022/sep/12/chevron-newspaper-local-news-permian-proud-site","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T06:00:06Z","webTitle":" ‘Wildfire of disinformation’: how Chevron exploits a news desert","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/sep/12/chevron-newspaper-local-news-permian-proud-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2022/sep/12/chevron-newspaper-local-news-permian-proud-site","fields":{"headline":" ‘Wildfire of disinformation’: how Chevron exploits a news desert","bodyText":"The dire state of local journalism in the US has been well documented in recent years, as the closure of hundreds of local newspapers has created American “news deserts” where people struggle for information on local politics and happenings. It has also created openings for companies and political groups to swoop in, serving up a mixture of local news and propaganda, with the latest being Chevron, in Texas’ news starved – and oil-rich – Permian Basin. The launch of Chevron’s “Permian Proud” site, in August, was first reported by Gizmodo. The banner at the top of Permian Proud does state that the site is “sponsored by Chevron”. But at first glance, the sponsorship seems like a benevolent grant. On Wednesday Permian Proud’s front page included stories about an upcoming air show and a storytelling workshop – typical local newspaper fare. But interspersed with news of livestock sales and processions is a series of stories lauding Chevron’s achievements in the Permian Basin, a sprawling area covering parts of west Texas and east New Mexico, where the company operates numerous oil fields. “New solar energy field in Permian Basin to lower Chevron’s carbon intensity” is one. Another headline reads: “Independent analysis gives Chevron highest environmental rating in Permian Basin.” Gizmodo reported that content on the site has been written by Mike Aldax, who works for a San Francisco-based PR firm. Since 2014, according to Gizmodo, Aldax “has also written for a Chevron-funded newspaper in California called the Richmond Standard”. Chevron’s Texas offering has echoes of other dubious “local news” sites that have emerged in recent years. Locality Labs and Metric Media, both operated by the same ex-journalist, have opened hundreds of “news” sites, which purport to represent local communities, since 2019. The sites, which include the Great Lakes Wire and the Illinois Valley Times, masquerade as local news outlets, but in reality are funded by Republican and conservative groups. Last November an investigation by Popular Information found that rightwing operatives had used the sprawling network of fake news sites to target crucial state elections, including the Virginia governor’s race in 2021. As the Virginia election loomed, 28 sites, all run by Metric Media, published almost 5,000 articles about critical race theory in schools, a frequently misrepresented issue that has become a call to arms, and to the ballot box, among the right wing. The rise in fake sites coincides with a crisis for local journalism. Since 2005 the US has lost more than a quarter of its newspapers, according to Northwestern University’s Medill School, and is on track to lose more than a third by 2025. The closures have created “news deserts” – where people have either limited access, or no access at all, to reliable local reporting. “The local news desert situation is an absolute crisis, and it’s getting worse. It’s a crisis for communities and it’s a crisis for our democracy, I think, ultimately,” said Tim Franklin, the John M Mutz chair in local news at the Medill School. “And so, what’s happening now is you’re seeing opportunists, whether they be political parties or companies, in some cases, coming in to try to fill that void with their own messaging.” In an email Chevron told Gizmodo that Permian Proud is “aimed at providing regional communities with information that is important to them, specifically focused on highlighting the good work so many people are doing and showcasing why the Permian communities are a great place to live and work”. It is unclear, however, how many people reading the site will be able to tell the difference between local information and Chevron’s PR fluff. A message on Permian Proud reads: “Our focus will be on news and information that makes us all proud to live here. Permian Proud will highlight and uplift such efforts, not just for its community partners, but for anyone wanting to get the word out to the public on local events, fundraisers, initiatives and more.” It’s a message that overlooks the fact that some of Permian Proud’s news content has been pasted, unchanged, from Chevron press releases. “We’re already in a misinformation, disinformation wildfire in this country. What this is doing is fanning the flames of that wildfire of disinformation that is already infecting our civic debate,” Franklin said. He believes that as newspapers continue to close, more companies, or political groups, will move into the local news industry. “In a self-governed democracy, accurate news and information is the oxygen for citizens to be able to make good decisions at the ballot box, or good decisions about how to live their daily lives. “So I think the implications of this are very serious for our democracy and for the country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/aug/26/planet-earth-climate-crisis-geoengineering","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-26T10:22:45Z","webTitle":"What if it's too late to save our planet without geoengineering? | Moira Donegan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/26/planet-earth-climate-crisis-geoengineering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/26/planet-earth-climate-crisis-geoengineering","fields":{"headline":"What if it’s too late to save our planet without geoengineering?","bodyText":"The realities of climate change are front-page news every day. Temperature records are being smashed. Wildfires are raging. There is no sign of things going back to “normal”. If anything, they will only get worse. Last year, when the planet was convulsing with the arrival of a pandemic, we pinned our hopes on technology – in the form of an mRNA vaccine – getting us out of our crisis. The vaccine was a technological intervention, injected into the arms of billions of people. Could we (should we?) look to technological solutions to our climate crisis, too? This is the question posed by Holly Jean Buck in her 2019 book, After Geoengineering: Climate Tragedy, Repair, and Restoration. Zooming with me from Buffalo, New York, where she’s a professor of environment at the University of Buffalo, Buck is blunt in her assessment. The pace of climate change, and the insufficiency of humanity’s current response, have effectively already made the choice for us: mankind will have to engage in some kind of “geoengineering” – an umbrella term for various methods of intentional, planetary-scale climate intervention – whether we like it or not. Geoengineering refers to any number of ways that humans can change our climate through interventions. The two main types of geoengineering are carbon engineering, which aims to suck carbon out of the atmosphere, and solar engineering, which aims to reflect solar energy away from Earth. “We’re in a climate crisis,” she tells me. “Mitigation isn’t going fast enough. Adaptation needs far more support than it’s getting. It’s clear that we need to remove some amount of carbon from the atmosphere.” How much? “Hundreds of billions of tons,” Buck says. “We have emitted so much, and now we have so much legacy carbon. The challenge isn’t just cutting emissions.” The second challenge is “removing the carbon that’s up there. It’s this massive cleanup operation that we need to undertake this century.” The idea of deliberately altering the climate can be frightening and distasteful, including to many environmentalists. But Buck argues that climate engineering is coming whether we like it or not. “If people on the environmental left – people who care about climate change – just reject all of these approaches out of hand, then we lose the ability to shape them, which would be a grave mistake,” she says. The simplest form of geoengineering is the kind of carbon removal many of us learned about in school: planting trees. “Land-based solutions are really important, especially in the next decade or so, because they can be implemented quickly – and we know how to plant forests,” Buck says. She points to other kinds of land-based climate interventions that show promise. Changing agricultural practices can be used to store more carbon in the dirt. Other strategies include storing carbon in wetlands, ocean iron fertilization, or different approaches involving rock weathering. But land-based solutions, though a helpful beginning, probably won’t be enough, Buck says. To plant enough trees to soak up enough carbon to sufficiently cool our planet, we would have to fundamentally change the way we use land in ways that would make our economy and many of our lives unrecognizable. And there are other risks to relying too heavily on land-based techniques. “A lot of land-based approaches are vulnerable to climate change itself,” Buck explains. “You don’t want a wildfire to wipe out these removals that you’ve been banking on, right?” Massive reforestation efforts could go up in smoke. But land-based solutions are not the only option. Carbon removal can also be accomplished with industrial technologies. Buck points to a carbon mitigation strategy called geological carbon capture, which is already widely used to reduce the emissions of heavily polluting industries. “You could outfit, well, scrubbers basically, on a factory, and these collect carbon dioxide. Then you inject [the carbon] underground, into a cavern, and keep it there, under the rock, for a very long time. You keep monitoring it, to make sure it stays where you want it to be.” There are risks to injecting large amounts of carbon into rock; Buck laments the under-regulated “wild west atmosphere” of fracking, which caused earthquakes in some parts of the US. But scientists have learned from that experience, and technologies exist to keep underground carbon in place. And new techniques may make geological carbon capture safer. “There’s a lot of new research about how to get carbon dioxide to turn into rock quicker once you inject it” underground, Buck says. This is a carbon mitigation technique that has proved efficient in reducing emissions at an industrial scale, and it has been in use for decades, meaning that the safety and science of the technique are well understood. Buck’s hope is that this technology could advance and be used not just for mitigating carbon emissions, but for removing carbon. “It becomes carbon removal” – as opposed to mitigation – “if you’re removing the carbon just from the ambient air,” Buck says. There are now machines that can “scrub” carbon out of the air; the carbon can then be transported and stored underground. Without these machines, the technique can also be used to create bioenergy, which involves “producing biomass” – say, a very carbon-dense type of plant – “and combusting it at a power plant, and separating out the carbon and storing it underground again”. This strategy – using a spectrum of carbon-engineering techniques to inject carbon deep beneath rock - is the most effective and safest, Buck believes. But unless humanity gets its act together soon, we may forced to entertain much riskier climate mitigation strategies. “If we don’t remove carbon, and decarbonize, and reform how we use land, and rework our transportation systems, and change industrial systems fast enough,” Buck says, “then there’s the possibility that people will pitch the idea of solar geoengineering.” Solar geoengineering is a kind of climate mitigation – thus far theoretical – that involves “blocking a fraction of incoming sunlight and sending it back out into space, which has a cooling effect”. Most solar-engineering techniques involve using special planes to inject gas into the stratosphere. The gas particles would reflect sunlight away, changing both the quantity and the quality of sunlight that reaches earth. This kind of geoengineering would certainly cool the planet, at least for a while. But it would not solve the fundamental problem of too much carbon in the atmosphere. “It doesn’t get to the root,” says Buck. “It doesn’t remove emissions. It’s just a blanket of intentional pollution that cools things down.” And solar geoengineering might create other problems, Buck says. What would a different kind of sunlight do to humankind, or to other living creatures? What would it do to agriculture, and our food supply? We don’t know. Would there be food shortages? Would the sky still be blue? We don’t have those answers, and solar geoengineering remains a risky proposition until we do. How optimistic is Buck that humanity will attain a livable future without having to resort to solar geoengineering? More than I expected. The vision that she articulates is ambitious. It would require international cooperation and vast overhauls of infrastructure. It would also mean that the United States and other capitalist countries would have to reorient themselves to a more centrally planned economy, devoted less to maximizing growth than to minimizing carbon. It would mean overcoming vast political differences and competing incentives the world over in order to unite in global common cause. But Buck thinks that the incentives for cooperation in the existential climate intervention project are great enough to ensure at least some success. “I do think that if people share a common goal, they might disagree about how to reach that goal, but maybe just having the common goal is enough,” she says. The greatest cleanup operation of history – the cleanup of carbon in our atmosphere – may well happen within our lifetimes. And, if Buck is right, there is no better time to start it than right now. • This article was amended on 1 September 2021. When answering the question about how much carbon needed to be removed from the atmosphere, Buck meant to say hundreds of billions of tons, not hundreds of billions of gigatons as quoted in an earlier version.

Biden has lauded the $369bn of climate spending in the Inflation Reduction Act as the “largest investment ever in combatting the existential crisis of climate change” and predicted it will save people hundreds of dollars each year in energy costs. This claim is based upon a series of investments aimed at shifting buying habits away from a polluting status quo towards cleaner, electrified vehicles and appliances. A US household could save $1,800 on their energy costs each year, according to a recent estimate, although this would require the installation of electric heat pumps for hot water and air conditioning, replacing a gasoline-powered car with an electric vehicle and installing solar panels on the roof. But even without these modifications, the climate bill is expected to lower costs by funneling support to renewable energy projects, such as wind and solar, that will provide a less price volatile source of electricity than gas, coal and oil. “There are people who are really on the frontlines of the inflation crisis and how expensive fossil fuels are because of [Vladimir] Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and this bill will be delivering big energy savings for those people,” said Leah Stokes, a climate policy expert at the University of California. Electric cars The new legislation, once passed, will provide a tax rebate of up to $7,500 for a new electric vehicle, which can be transferred to the car dealer so it can act as an upfront payment. Electric cars have so far been the domain of the wealthy, accounting for less than 5% of total car sales in the US, and the bill tries to remedy this by also offering a $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles (EVs), in the hope that lower-income people will be able to take advantage. It’s uncertain how strong initial take-up will be, however. The tax credit applies to cars made with parts made in the US or from countries that have a free trade agreement with the US, meaning that the leading suppliers of key materials like cobalt and lithium – China and Russia – are excluded. Ongoing supply chain woes also mean that the demand for EVs is currently outstripping supply, with many carmakers having long waiting lists for models, while public charging infrastructure is still patchy in much of the country. Solar panels Anyone who wants to install solar panels on their property can now get a 30% tax credit, a program that runs until 2034. People who use home-based batteries for energy storage can also access the credit. Erecting solar panels isn’t cheap, costing an average of $20,000 according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, but this upfront cost is eventually recouped, and more, by the savings in energy bills. Rooftop panels are becoming more common in new buildings, too, with states such as California passing mandates that new developments must include them. People in apartments can have the option of leasing a rooftop solar system, or joining a community solar farm. Home appliances Some of the biggest changes initiated by the climate bill are likely to be found in the homes of Americans, with up to $14,000 in rebates available to low- and middle-income households to make their dwellings greener and more efficient. An $8,000 rebate will be available to help install heat pumps, which are efficient electrical devices that both heat and cool homes, with a further $1,750 for water heating. A slightly smaller tax break can be applied for purchases of clothes dryers or an electric cooker, such as a high-efficient induction stovetop. Tax credits that cover 30% of the cost of home improvements that reduce heat leakage, such as upgraded windows and doors, are also part of the bill, with a $1,600 rebate to insulate and seal a house, and a $2,500 tax break for improvements to electrical wiring. Household savings “will be reflected in lower monthly energy bills, reduced bill volatility and a lessening of disproportionately high energy burdens within disadvantaged communities”, said Jamal Lewis, director of policy partnerships at Rewiring America, a clean energy research organization."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","type":"article","sectionId":"mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future","sectionName":"Mitsubishi: Tech that drives a better future","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T00:18:40Z","webTitle":"A ‘battery on wheels’: why EVs can do more than just take you places","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","fields":{"headline":"A ‘battery on wheels’: why EVs can do more than just take you places","bodyText":"It’s interesting to think of the sun as a kind of vast, patient teacher, waiting for us to work out just how useful it can be, aside from giving us light and making everything on Earth grow. Last century, we got quite excited when we worked out that we could put a couple of panels on our roofs to heat our hot water. Today many houses use solar to provide their electricity and recently we’ve started plugging in our electric vehicles (EVs) to run on sunlight as well. The arrival of the latest generation of smart vehicles, such as Mitsubishi’s Outlander Plug-In Hybrid EV (PHEV) – which can switch between its petrol engine and battery-powered twin electric motors – provides the opportunity to power our lives with clean energy. Imagine a world in which you can charge up your car’s batteries using your solar panels, and then use that power not just for transport, but to run your house for several days – free and clean. Mitsubishi’s PHEVs are at the cutting edge of the latest car tech thanks to vehicle-to-load (V2L), vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, all of which have the potential to transform how we use energy and shine a light on the fact that EVs and PHEVs are, essentially, powerful battery packs on wheels. While V2L will let you charge or operate an appliance via your EV or PHEV’s battery – a blessing if you want to take a fridge, or even a TV, with you when camping – V2H is another thing entirely, allowing you to use the car’s battery to power your home. Laura Jones, a senior analyst at the Australian National University’s College of Engineering and Computer Science, working across its battery storage and grid integration program, believes people need to reframe how they view their vehicles. “If you look at how we use our cars, they tend to spend most of their time parked,” Jones says. “So using V2H is a way of making it so that the car can work for you, even when you’re not driving it.” Using a bi-directional charger that can put energy in your car and then take it back out again, you can power your home via V2H, or help stabilise the electricity grid during periods of high demand, via V2G. “With V2G, if you lose a generator or load somewhere in the energy system, the vehicles will start charging or discharging to counteract that disturbance,” she says. “It’s a pretty critical service for keeping the system stable, because electricity has to match generation and demand continuously in real time.” The concept of V2H and V2G becomes even more attractive when you use free, renewable solar energy, which can be harnessed to charge your EV or PHEV, which in turn powers your home, reducing your energy and fuel bills to zero. “You’ve just got to look at how much solar there is out there,” Jones says. “We’ve got 40% [of homes with] rooftop solar or more in Queensland and South Australia – on a world scale, that’s huge.” Mitsubishi has combined the benefits of V2H, V2G and solar power to create the future-focused Dendo Drive House concept, a home-energy ecosystem that comprises an EV/PHEV, a bi-directional charger, solar panels and a home battery. Tim Clarke, eMobility strategy manager at Mitsubishi Motors Australia, says the Dendo Drive House concept was created to showcase the capabilities of existing technology. “We have such abundant renewable-energy resources in this country, so it totally makes sense for us to use that,” he says. “A home energy system that allows you to capture and store renewable energy when it is abundant, and then use it when you need it in your home or in your car is a great fit for Australians. It will challenge us to think about our day-to-day lives and how energy can be integrated into that.” For those with range anxiety around EVs, Clarke points out that PHEVs, such as Mitsubishi’s Outlander, are a best-of-both-worlds solution, because they can run in pure EV mode, or engage their petrol-electric hybrid drive system for longer trips. “We feel that PHEVs are a really a good solution for Australia right now; the new Outlander Mitsubishi Plug-in Hybrid EV has a 20kWh battery that allows you to travel 84km in all-electric mode, which covers most users’ daily commuting requirements,” he says. “In Australia, we have some of the longest distances between populated areas in the world, and we don’t have charging infrastructure in a lot of those places. Because PHEV is an EV for daily commute, and a petrol-electric hybrid for long distances, current charging infrastructure inadequacies are not an issue. It really gives you the best of both worlds.” With the ability to provide energy to your home or even emergency power in a disaster-relief scenario (all by harnessing free solar, if you so choose), today’s EVs are not only helping consumers with rising energy costs, but also helping the planet. As the sun might say, it’s a bright idea.

Ben Goldsmith, the chair of the Conservative Environment Network, and a longtime green Tory who was a strong supporter of Boris Johnson, said of the UK’s new prime minister and her defeated rival: “Neither Truss nor Sunak has been known for their passion for nature. Neither has made a name for themselves as an environmental leader.” There is a danger of blackouts this winter, amid soaring energy prices and a potential supply crunch, but Truss has set her face firmly against any form of energy rationing and has so far refused to countenance the idea that consumers must change their behaviour to reduce energy waste. She has not yet set out plans for insulating homes, which experts have said must form the key part of any strategy to reduce energy bills, and is against new onshore wind and solar farms. Instead, Truss has talked of squeezing more production from the North Sea and licensing new oil and gas fields, though these would take years or decades to come on stream. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, told the Guardian: “[Truss] is facing an in-tray overflowing with immediate and existential threats: the energy crisis, the accelerating climate emergency, an emerging biodiversity crisis, and a war in Europe. “None of these can be solved by pandering to those in her party who are advocating environmental deregulation and new gas, oil and coal extraction. These will do little to tackle the energy crisis and will simply keep our economy locked into costly and polluting fossil fuels for decades to come.” He called for measures that would reduce energy waste and cut people’s energy bills in the short term, such as home insulation. “She must recognise that the health of the economy and people’s wellbeing are intrinsically linked to the health of the environment,” he said. “Among her first decisions must be a commitment to fund a nationwide street-by-street home insulation programme and to remove barriers holding back cheap onshore wind and solar energy. She must also rule out fracking, new coalmines and more North Sea oil and gas extraction.” Truss is likely to appoint Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is from the right of the Conservative party, has voiced climate scepticism in the past, favours fracking and is usually against government intervention in the markets, as the business secretary. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “That could be very difficult. It matters who is in the cabinet. Without strong proponents, the net zero agenda will be in danger.” During the campaign, Truss’s team heavily leaked plans to deregulate business, which are likely to include environmental regulations. Most of the UK’s existing green regulations come from EU law, and many of them were pushed through in Brussels with UK support while an EU member. Tom Burke, the co-founder of the thinktank E3G, warned that this dismantling was likely to be carried out by stealth. “They know that voters want high environmental standards, so they have to do it by stealth, and that’s what Truss is driving towards.” Food price rises will add to consumer woes, and Truss will face pressure to row back on changes to farm subsidies that would offer incentives to farmers to nurture soils and deliver environmental benefits alongside their food production. Goldsmith said it would be a mistake to reduce the incentives for farmers to protect wildlife and the countryside: “You can do both; you can produce food and take care of the landscape.” Many green campaigners remember Truss as secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs from 2014 to 2016. Privately, they say she made little impact, other than to agree to cuts to the department’s budget that further reduced enforcement of environmental regulation, including of sewage polluting the UK’s waterways. Pat Venditti, the interim executive director of Greenpeace UK, urged Truss to stick to the commitments that had been made in the last general election: “This Conservative government was elected on a manifesto that committed it to reaching net zero, ‘leading a new green industrial revolution’ and rolling out the ‘most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth’,” he said. “There’s no mandate and no public support to roll back on these commitments. Bolder climate action and stronger nature protection is the only way forward for a cleaner, fairer and more affordable society for everyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/14/demand-for-oil-threatens-african--economies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-14T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Increasing demand for oil and fuel threatens African nations’ economies, analysis finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/14/demand-for-oil-threatens-african--economies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/14/demand-for-oil-threatens-african--economies","fields":{"headline":"Increasing demand for oil and fuel threatens African nations’ economies, analysis finds","bodyText":"Expanding oil and gas exports would threaten the economic stability of many African countries, new analysis has found, despite soaring fossil fuel prices. Demand for fossil fuels is likely to fall sharply in the medium term, according to a report published on Monday by the Carbon Tracker thinktank. That makes relying on gas exports to fuel economic growth a short-term, risky strategy, while boosting solar power would prove a better long-term bet, the analysis found. Although gas prices are high now, and the top five oil and gas companies alone have made profits of more than $170bn so far this year, gas revenues would fall by half by 2040, and the gas market would see record low prices owing to shrinking demand, the report forecast. That would leave Africa with huge investments in gas infrastructure, but no export market, if countries pursued a “dash for gas” now, the analysis found. Kofi Mbuk, senior clean tech analyst at Carbon Tracker and lead author of the report, warned that companies investing in fossil fuels in Africa would be left with stranded assets. “The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is inevitable and irreversible,” he said. “The growth in energy demand globally and regionally is now being met by renewables and squeezing out fossil fuel demands. In Africa, and across emerging economies, solar and wind offer the best route for economic development.” The future of Africa’s vast gas reserves is a major topic at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt, now in its second week. Although not formally on the agenda for the UN talks, the conference is buzzing with talk of Africa’s potential as a gas exporter. Countries including Nigeria, Senegal, Mozambique, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea and Algeria have sizeable gas reserves, as does the Cop27 host country, Egypt. There are more than 600 fossil fuel executives and lobbyists at the talks, and a host of African heads of government who attended the leaders’ summit segment of the summit last week were keen to use the opportunity to strike gas deals. Macky Sall, president of Senegal, told the Guardian at the talks that it was wrong for developed countries to try to urge African leaders not to drill for gas when the west had grown rich on fossil fuels. “Why not Africa?” he asked. “Why should we not do the same?” Other leading figures have also voiced support for Africa to exploit its gas reserves. Tony Blair, former prime minister of the UK, told the Guardian: “They’ve got to be able to get gas. Gas for them is going to be a transitional fuel. Large numbers of people are burning wood for their fuel, which is bad for emissions but also bad for their health. For a transitional phase, they’re going to need to develop their gas resources.” This could save reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to some alternatives, he argued. “If you could swap, for example, heavy-duty diesel for gas, that would be highly beneficial for those countries. And in time you will have the potential for the development of hydrogen off the back of it [gas],” he said. Before the talks, the Sudanese-British billionaire Mo Ibrahim also called for Africa to exploit its resources. “We need a balanced and fair policy for everybody. Gas can be useful to our transition. [Developed countries who say otherwise] are hypocrites,” he told the Guardian. There are 600 million people in Africa without access to electricity. “How can we even think of development if people don’t have power?” he asked. “How can we have education, hospitals, business, companies, social life, TVs, tablets, computers, whatever?” Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of former world statespeople and business leaders, told the Guardian in June she supported the expansion of gas in Africa to provide access to modern energy for the 600 million people across the continent currently without it. Gas could provide clean cooking fuel as an alternative to biomass and paraffin, which currently kill thousands through indoor air pollution, especially women and children, she told the Guardian. “Africa is trying to get its voice out about its needs for just, equitable energy, and of course that implies some use of gas as a just transition,” she said. Egypt, host of the Cop27 summit, is understood to be eager to expand its gas industry, positing it as a help to European countries struggling with supplies to replace imports from Russia. However, many African climate experts and activists are speaking out against the expansion of gas on the continent. They argue that African’s poor are unlikely to see any benefit from the gas, which is likely to be exported abroad to the highest bidder by multinationals, with profits siphoned off to the countries’ elites. “The “dash for gas” in Africa is dangerous and shortsighted,” wrote a coalition of dozens of African climate groups in an open letter as part of a campaign called “Don’t Gas Africa”. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said Africa’s plentiful solar and wind resources offered a better route to energy than investing in gas. “For far too long, Africa has been controlled by outside interests – a resource pool for extraction and export, and a dumping ground for the practices and technologies no longer wanted elsewhere,” he said. In its report entitled African Sun: Why solar not gas offers the continent the best economic opportunity in the transition, published on Monday, Carbon Tracker argues that Africa could be an exporter of solar energy, rather than gas. “Electricity will be the backbone of Africa’s economic future, with solar leading the way,” the report predicted. “Even though prior to the Ukraine conflict, solar was competitive with coal and gas for power generation, the conflict means that the continent should, more than ever, build solar as a means to decrease its dependence on its global commodity market and achieve a secure and affordable source of domestic energy. Further acceleration of cost reduction will put Africa in a unique position as a beneficiary from one of the best abundance of solar potential on the planet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/16/zambia-debt-lenders-urged-to-cancel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-16T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"Lenders urged to cancel Zambia debt as country faces economic collapse ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/16/zambia-debt-lenders-urged-to-cancel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/16/zambia-debt-lenders-urged-to-cancel","fields":{"headline":"Lenders urged to cancel Zambia debt as country faces economic collapse ","bodyText":"More than 100 economists and academics have urged international lenders to crisis-stricken Zambia to write off a significant slice of their loans during financial restructuring talks this month. Zambia is seeking up to $8.4bn (£7.3bn) in debt relief from major lenders, including private funds run by the world’s largest investment manager, BlackRock, to help put its public finances back in order. In the run-up to what are understood to be tense negotiations involving the Chinese, French and British governments, the anti-poverty charity Debt Justice said that only a major debt write-off could save the Zambian economy from complete collapse. Led by the Columbia University economist, Jeffrey Sachs, and Jayati Ghosh, the chair of the Centre for Economic Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University, the 100-plus global group of economists and experts said in a letter to the creditors’ negotiating committee that Zambia should be given a waiver from debt interest payments due until 2023. Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a $1.3bn loan to the country, which defaulted on its $17.3bn of external debt after a collapse in its public finances during the pandemic. Funds run by BlackRock are among the largest private owners of Zambia’s bonds, holding $220m. Some are worth almost half the value they were sold at. Eurobonds worth $1bn that mature in 2024 plunged 6.3% in the last week to less than 56% of their face value. Debt Justice, formerly known as the Jubilee Debt Campaign, has estimated that BlackRock could make 110% profit for itself and its clients from Zambia if debt interest payments are paid in full. The country has three main private sector bonds that pay an average 8.1% in interest. The letter said: “Because of the high interest rates and the fact Zambia’s bonds have been trading at well below face value since 2018, many bondholders stand to make huge profits at the expense of both Zambian citizens and creditor countries if paid at face value. “It is therefore imperative that BlackRock and other bondholders agree to fully engage in a large-scale debt restructuring, including significant haircuts, in order to make Zambia’s debt sustainable.” Tim Jones, the charity’s policy head, said the IMF loan gave the country some breathing space, but the $8.4bn of interest payments due over the next couple of years should be “cancelled permanently, not rolled over to the 2030s to fuel another debt crisis next decade”. Chad and Ethiopia applied last year for debt relief under the G20’s common framework, but Jones said negotiations have yet to get off the starting blocks. Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have also asked for bailouts under IMF schemes to support countries devastated by the climate crisis. Zambia, which has cut health and social care spending by a fifth in the past two years to balance its budget, has seen its debts soar in recent years to fund infrastructure projects, many to help the country supplement drought-affected hydropower plants. Solar energy projects have made the country almost self-sufficient in electricity, but the high cost of borrowing, local corruption and the coronavirus crisis have crippled the country’s finances. Further loans from the IMF have been tied to commitments to end fuel subsidies to households and businesses, pushing the inflation rate above 20% last year before it eased to 9.8% in August. Of Zambia’s external debt, 46% is owed to private lenders, 22% to China, 8% to other governments and 18% to multilateral institutions. China is among the government lenders to agree a longer debt repayment schedule that private lenders, including banks, have so far resisted, Debt Justice said. A BlackRock spokesperson said it wanted “a sustainable long-term outcome for Zambia” but disputed the charity’s claim it would profit from a rescheduling of debt interest payments, saying it was likely to make losses when the bondholdings mature. It said: “We regard it as our obligation to play our part responsibly, alongside all other creditors, in ensuring there is a path towards a sustainable outcome for sovereign debt issuers in distress. “As an asset manager, we are a fiduciary to our clients, people from all walks of life. The money we invest on their behalf is not our own and we are obligated to act in our clients’ best financial interests at all times.” Jones said BlackRock had likely bought Zambian bonds at rock-bottom prices when it was clear the country was already in trouble. BlackRock added that with Zambian bonds trading below their sale value and interest payments suspended since September 2020, “our clients have already experienced losses with respect to their holdings of private sector sovereign debt of Zambia”. The Zambian Civil Society Debt Alliance, Global Justice Now, Action for Southern Africa (ACTSA), Christian Aid, Cafod and Jubilee Scotland are also campaigning for BlackRock and other private lenders to cancel the debt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/24/morning-mail-albanese-to-meet-with-macron-in-relationship-reset-us-overturns-handgun-law","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-23T21:18:52Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Albanese to meet with Macron in relationship ‘reset’, US overturns handgun law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/24/morning-mail-albanese-to-meet-with-macron-in-relationship-reset-us-overturns-handgun-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/24/morning-mail-albanese-to-meet-with-macron-in-relationship-reset-us-overturns-handgun-law","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Albanese to meet with Macron in relationship ‘reset’, US overturns handgun law","bodyText":"Good morning. Anthony Albanese will meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in a relationship “reset”. European leaders have opened the door to EU membership for Ukraine. And the US supreme court has overturned a strict New York handgun law. The US supreme court has made it easier for almost all law-abiding Americans to carry concealed and loaded handguns in public places after the conservative majority struck down a New York law that placed strict restrictions on firearms outside the home. The majority decision renders the New York law an unconstitutional violation of the second amendment right to bear arms. The law had required anyone wanting to carry a handgun in public to prove they had a “proper cause” to do so. Anthony Albanese has confirmed he will visit France to meet Emmanuel Macron and is considering travelling to Ukraine during next week’s trip to Europe for the Nato summit. Albanese said he was also looking forward to “having further dialogue” with the Chinese government, but admitted the relationship would remain “problematic” for some time.“I’ve been invited by president Macron to meet with him in France. I’ll be doing that in a week’s time. We do need to reset. We’ve already had very constructive discussions,” Albanese said. The National Farmers’ Federation has warned the Albanese government not to rush any plan to sign on to Joe Biden’s global methane pledge, declaring the consequences of such a decision taken on the fly “could be calamitous”. Australia’s resources minister, Madeleine King, revealed on Thursday the new government was considering signing the push to limit global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade – an initiative Scott Morrison declined to join. Meanwhile, the Albanese government has extended funding for Australia’s world-leading solar energy scientists. European leaders have granted Ukraine candidate status, in a historic decision that opens the door to EU membership for the war-torn country and deals a blow to Vladimir Putin. EU leaders meeting in Brussels approved Ukraine’s candidate status on Thursday night, nearly four months after the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, launched his country’s bid to join the bloc in the early days of the Russian invasion. Moldova was also given candidate status.

Led by renewables advisory business Energy Estate, the consortium says it plans to produce green hydrogen with wind and solar energy and use it as a feedstock for mining, transport and industrial users in the upper Hunter Valley, spruiking it as a potential replacement for the region’s coal industry. If successful, a second stage would pipe hydrogen to Newcastle, where it could be used to help run a clean energy industrial precinct. Vincent Dwyer, a principal at Energy Estate, said it could provide zero-emissions feedstock for chemical manufacturing and allow the development of green ammonia for export. Companies said to be looking at getting involved in the Hunter hydrogen network include AGL Energy, pipeline operator APA Group, Idemitsu (the Japanese owner of a Muswellbrook coalmine), commodities trader Trafigura and renewable energy developers RES Australia and Walcha Energy. “We’re not wanting to own all of these opportunities,” Dwyer said. “We’re wanting to enable them to occur by building the backbone infrastructure and then partner with people.” The proposal announcement follows the Morrison government’s budget commitment of $275m over five years to help develop five hydrogen “hubs” in regional areas. The government’s pledge is to support “clean” hydrogen, which could include “green” hydrogen made with renewable energy and “blue” hydrogen fossil fuels backed by carbon capture and storage. The government was expected to announce funding for the hubs next year, with potential sites including the Hunter Valley, Tasmania’s Bell Bay, the Pilbara region in Western Australia, Gladstone in Queensland, Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia and Darwin. Its goal is to help reduce the cost of producing hydrogen to $2 a kilogram. Dwyer said Energy Estate was yet to discuss its proposal with the government. He said it would not be looking for public backing “for the cost of the electrons”, but hoped to discuss “how to plan the infrastructure to allow the hydrogen to occur”. “The federal government is after good ideas and we’re hoping it would get behind it,” he said. Green hydrogen is created by using an electrolyser to run an electrical current through water, separating it into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can also be made using gas through a different process that releases carbon dioxide. Under the government’s proposal, it would need to be captured and either used or pumped underground. An analysis by BloombergNEF last year suggested green hydrogen could become the cheapest form of fuel much faster than expected, citing evidence of Chinese manufacturers already using electrolysers that cost about 80% less than estimates released by CSIRO in 2018. The Hunter Valley proposal would involve green hydrogen being produced on the site of a repurposed coalmine at Muswellbrook by 2024 and piped to near the Liddell coal plant, which is to close in 2023. Under the second stage, more electrolysers would be installed near Liddell between 2022 and 2026, and an additional hydrogen pipeline would run from there to Newcastle, allowing development of a clean energy precinct near the port. The operation would be powered by solar and wind farms backed by batteries in a renewable energy zone on the Walcha plateau. New electricity transmission lines would be needed to connect the zone with a substation at Liddell. Under a possible third stage, another hydrogen pipeline could be built to the central west and New England renewable energy zones, which are to be developed under legislation that passed the NSW parliament last year. Hannah McCaughey, an executive with APA, said the company was excited to be part of projects that could “support a lower carbon future and potentially unlock Australia’s unrivalled advantages in hydrogen”. There have been varying estimates of the role that hydrogen is likely to play in replacing fossil fuels. It is hoped it could become an affordable emissions-free alternative to fossil fuels in industries that operate at incredibly high temperatures and in some large-scale transport, in particular. The Australian government has named “clean” hydrogen one of five “low-emissions” technology priorities and estimated it could create more than 8,000 jobs and generate about $11bn a year in GDP by 2050."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-13T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is not the only option | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","fields":{"headline":"Letters: nuclear power is not the only option","bodyText":"I do not share your enthusiasm for the “good news” that Sizewell C is believed to be safe from Jeremy Hunt’s budgetary cuts (“Britain can’t afford to waver over nuclear power – soon it will be too late”, Editorial). “On a freezing cold, windless, winter’s evening”, Britain’s grid will indeed need an alternative power source to wind or solar, but why is it assumed that only nuclear can provide an alternative base load? And at the cost of how many billions? And how many decades of lead time? Geothermal could do the job faster, more safely and cheaply – for about a quarter of the cost. Geothermal power plants operate already in the United States, Italy and Iceland. And nothing is more certain and regular than the tide twice a day; sea turbines already operate in tidal flows off Orkney and Shetland and are another safe source of energy baseload. Let us not be blinkered by nuclear. Wendy Fowler Carnac-Rouffiac, France Your leader on Sizewell C ignores a couple of factors that are key to our local objections. First, the coastline on which Sizewell A and B are built and Sizewell C is proposed is disintegrating at an increasingly alarming rate – just two weeks’ ago a building at nearby Thorpeness had to be demolished due to collapse of the cliffs. Second, there is insufficient water in Suffolk to build and operate Sizewell C, which was one of the main reasons the government’s own planning inspectorate advised against it recently. Water is planned to be found through the construction of desalination plants – these require huge amounts of energy, but more importantly the waste salt and other minerals from the extraction process will be put back into the sea, poisoning the waters around for miles. There are other reasons why this is a disastrous location: it is a site of special scientific interest and an area of outstanding natural beauty and the prototype for this type of reactor has yet to be proved at Flamanville – still not operational, years over schedule and way over budget. Nuclear has moved on since the design of these reactors. The government should think again. Rosie Hoare Saxmundham, Suffolk No wonder we Irish are off “There’s not many left,” noted Peggy O’Donoghue, a long-time Irish resident in your highly revealing article (“Britain’s dwindling Irish community mourn the fading of a great migration”, Focus). But what your article didn’t ask is what is the attraction of the UK to young Irish people in 2022? England is no longer the land of opportunity it once was. Brexit and the negative media attitudes that painted a picture of a country that didn’t welcome foreigners only encouraged young people to emigrate to America, Australia, South Africa and Europe. Ireland has emerged from the shadow of a colonial power and the grip of the Catholic church and developed into a well-educated, diverse and globalised society. Like many others, I left Ireland in 1990 because of a lack of opportunities at home. Today, the opportunities on offer to school leavers in Ireland are much improved. Ireland is not without its problems, such as a lack of affordable housing and unequal income distribution, but at least we have a generation who have hope for their country. I don’t see that in England today. Stuart Finegan Lewes Get Brexit undone I do not agree with your correspondent Tanya Firth when she says that the Labour party did not support remain in the EU referendum (Letters). As an ordinary Labour party member, I canvassed, telephoned and door-knocked to stay in the EU following a six-point question list from national Labour. It was a deeply unpleasant experience and many of my colleagues stopped because of the nightly racist comments. One night it was against Poles, the next Romanians. When Boris Johnson announced the Turks were coming, they were the target. We can see the same today with the hatred being generated against asylum seekers. Steven Bowditch Stanwix, Carlisle I wholeheartedly agree with David Mitchell’s critical analysis of politics as the art of the possible when concluding that “reversing Brexit would be the most significant geopolitical choice that Britain could make in its own interests” and a goal that Labour should embrace (“Labour should reverse on not reversing Brexit”, New Review). Reversing the Brexiters’ winning election slogan and campaigning vigorously to “Get Brexit Undone” would be a powerful means. Mick Beeby Westbury on Trym, Bristol The way to net zero Keir Sarmer rightly points out the gap between rhetoric and reality that has characterised the UK’s response to the climate emergency over the last 12 years (“Rishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age”, Comment). It should not be the case that the biggest backers of our potentially “world-leading” renewable energy technologies have been ordinary investors putting their money where their mouth is via regulated crowdfunding platforms such as Abundance Investment. Labour should also be celebrating those local councils that have engaged their citizens directly, by issuing or pledging to issue Local Climate Bonds, including Labour’s newly won council of Westminster. These raise funds directly from residents, paying a fair return to fund council efforts to decarbonise their economy, ranging from solar energy to EV charging, biodiversity to waste recycling. They are democratic finance in action and can transform the political narrative of the transition to net zero. The chaos of the last few months has offered Labour a unique opportunity to bring a consistent and clear message to consumers, businesses and markets that the transition to net zero is not a cost to be borne, but an opportunity to seize.

The crisis poses fundamental questions for the economy; it affects public health and jobs, and its threats range from food security to national security. That is why it will be among the central concerns of my government and why I believe any responsible world leader must make it a priority. Climate change drives the droughts that affect the provision of water; destroys lives and livelihoods; cripples food production, and destroys our homes and infrastructure. Extreme temperatures affect migration patterns and exacerbate conflicts as hundreds of thousands flee to seek alternative livelihoods for survival. Our response to this crisis cuts across every issue, from the sources of our energy, to how we transport ourselves, from the jobs that will sustain us in the future, to the quality of the air we breathe, the food we eat and the water we drink. The climate emergency is here and now. Across Kenya, communities today are suffering the consequences. Millions of Kenyans and millions more from the Horn of Africa are on the brink of famine due to devastating drought. It is not too late to respond, but to tackle this threat we must act urgently to keep the increase in global heating to below 1.5C (2.7F), help those most in need, and end our addiction to fossil fuels. Africa is the continent most affected by climate change and yet the least responsible for it. Despite this, the continent has the opportunity to lead the world and show that we do not need to destroy the climate to prosper. We have immense potential for renewable energy, and this abundance of wind and solar energy can power the development of Africa. Rather than trudging in the fossil-fuel footsteps of those who went before, we can leapfrog this dirty energy and embrace the benefits of clean power. Kenya is home to the continent’s largest windfarm and our electricity supply is already 92% renewable, with 74% of our overall energy use powered by clean energy. I am reaffirming our commitment to move this to 100% clean energy by 2030. We call on all African states to join us in this journey. Plummeting costs make clean energy the most economical choice. A report by the International Energy Agency published last month showed that there are already more jobs globally in clean energy than fossil fuels, and its forecasts are for this gap to grow as more countries decarbonise. A transition to clean energy is a no-brainer. It will create jobs, protect local economies and accelerate the sustainable industrialisation of Africa. As Africans, we will call for a rapid and just transition – delivering on the commitment by heads of state to double Africa’s installed energy capacity through renewables by 2030. Together, we can deliver energy access to almost half of Africa’s people, who remain underserved by the dirty energy systems of yesterday, by transitioning rapidly to the clean energy systems of the future. As members of the international community, we will support a successful Cop27 international climate summit in Africa this November by demanding delivery of the finance and technology needed by Africa to adapt to climate impacts, support those in need, and manage the energy transition. At this meeting, we must move decisively from talk to on-the-ground action that benefits every African. Among the outcomes from this global gathering must be a financing framework that enables Africa’s planned and orderly transition from fossil fuels; supports our workers, communities and national economies; and advances our development. Finance and technology must be provided to our developing countries while enabling all African countries to accelerate our transition to clean energy. The global transition to clean energy is now more urgent than ever. The current energy crisis, partly caused by the war in Ukraine, underlines the need for less reliance on fossil fuels and much greater investment in renewables. As the German finance minister, Christian Lindner, said, renewables are “the energy of freedom”. The wind cannot be stockpiled to drive up its price; the sun’s rays cannot be switched off by a single person wishing to weaponise energy. Wind turbines and solar panels are quick to construct and can generate and deliver power far more quickly and easily than a new oil rig, and with much less harm to our fragile climate. Already renewables are the world’s cheapest form of new energy. The energy crisis is a wake-up call that fossil fuels are the opposite of freedom, yet the world has become shackled to them. We need to break free from those chains, to accept there is a better way to power the world’s economy. It is one that is fairer, cheaper and less destructive to ourselves and our communities, to our families’ future, and to the natural environment on which we all depend. This is a crossroads in history. Kenya is ready to rise to the challenge and help build a better world for Kenyans and all of humanity. • William Ruto is the president of Kenya • This article was amended on 7 October 2022.

In an interview with the Guardian, Kelly Wu-Chiao Hsieh also called on the UK to uphold the principles of rules-based international order and forge closer trade and investment relations with Taiwan. He welcomed the decision of the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to condemn the unprecedented Chinese military exercises in the wake of the visit of the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to the island, the most senior US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years. The UK, like most western countries, does not recognise Taiwan and has no formal defence ties with the country. Hsieh said the events in Hong Kong had changed the views of many in Taiwan about China. “There is a new generation of young Taiwanese voters who have been hugely affected by China’s treatment of Hong Kong and have come to realise the Chinese promise of ‘one country, two systems’ was simply a facade or a joke. Many of these young voters are politically active, and are determined not to suffer the same fate as Hong Kong’s civil society movements.” He said: “The scale of these drills were different to what has happened before, and could not have been prepared, and all those resources lined up, in a very short period of time. It was premeditated, preplanned. It was only a matter of choosing the timing, and they just chose Pelosi’s visit. It was a self-orchestrated crisis.” But he insisted the Chinese response would not intimidate Taiwan or stop its supporters from visiting the country. A UK foreign affairs select committee delegation is due to visit the capital, Taipei, before the end of the year. Hsieh said the Chinese had used the Pelosi visit as “a pretext to mount its military exercises” and that, although the drills did not themselves amount to a blockade, “it does not take much imagination to work out what the Chinese are thinking about. They are trying to create a new status quo”. A response asserting the principle of freedom of navigation – international laws protecting freedom of movement at sea – was needed in the next few weeks, Hsieh said, to protect the “median line” in the Taiwan Strait, a tacit maritime boundary between China and Taiwan that has existed since the 1950s. During the week of exercises China passed the median line, defined by Hsieh as the defining indicator of peace and stability in the Strait, by sea or air more than 100 times. Millions of cyber-attacks also hit the self-governed island, including the president’s office, the foreign ministry and the defence ministry, Hsieh said. “Even though China has announced the end of the formal drills, the reality for us is we experience these military drills still humming around us on a daily basis. So anytime in the future, maybe in the next few days, they might just resume again. The key [thing] to watch is if they continue to mess around with the median line,” he said. Asked if an invasion is now inevitable, he said: “Inevitable or not, we we have to make sure that it is credibly deterred. Taiwan will fortify its defence capabilities and continue to look for international solidarity.” He acknowledged that China has the ability to intimidate other countries in the region diplomatically, and said that until the G7 statement on the drills there had been “an eerie quietness”. The US National Security Council coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs, Kurt Campbell, has since summoned the Chinese ambassador to the US to deliver a warning over the military exercises, while Truss conveyed a similar message to the UK’s Chinese ambassador on Wednesday. Truss has landed herself in diplomatic hot water by urging the British government to do more to help Taiwan defend itself militarily. Neither the US or the UK have explicitly said how they would respond if China invaded Taiwan, but UK licences for arms exports to Taiwan have grown in the past two years. Hsieh also confirmed Taiwan and the UK were discussing ways to boost bilateral trade and investment focusing on solar energy, biosciences, hydrogen power, transport infrastructure and the resilience of the supply chain for semiconductors (computer chips), an industry Taiwan dominates. “We are currently in the middle of clarifying areas for the future,” he disclosed. China has condemned the trade contacts."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/05/australia-will-bid-for-2026-climate-summit-but-still-has-work-to-do-on-emissions-credentials-at-cop27","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T23:31:21Z","webTitle":"Australia will bid for 2026 climate summit, but will face pressure to do more this year at Cop27","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/05/australia-will-bid-for-2026-climate-summit-but-still-has-work-to-do-on-emissions-credentials-at-cop27","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/05/australia-will-bid-for-2026-climate-summit-but-still-has-work-to-do-on-emissions-credentials-at-cop27","fields":{"headline":"Australia will bid for 2026 climate summit, but will face pressure to do more this year at Cop27","bodyText":"The Australian government will use the UN climate conference in Egypt to launch a bid with Pacific nations to host the 2026 summit and pledge its support for some measures that the country’s previous government rejected a year ago in Glasgow. The Cop27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, a small resort city on the Sinai peninsula, is the first since the Labor government led by Anthony Albanese was elected in May. It arrives for the fortnight-long talks as one of few national governments to have followed through on a commitment made in Glasgow that all countries would re-examine their plans with a view to increasing their commitments this year. As promised before it was elected, it has lifted the country’s minimum 2030 emissions reduction target from 26% to 43% (compared with 2005 levels). It recently joined a global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, and is expected to announce that it has escalated its support for a global declaration that aims to end deforestation by 2030 by joining a “high ambition” group of countries driving the change. A major focus of the Australian delegation, led by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, will be its bid to host a UN climate conference for the first time. The government initially nominated the 2024 summit, but hosting duties are rotated between five country groups, and Australia’s group – western European and other states – is not due until 2026. Confirming the bid with a joint statement on Saturday, government ministers said they were “committed to working in partnership with Pacific countries to address the climate emergency”. Longtime observers say the push to bring up to 20,000 people to Australia for a global climate change summit underscores a dramatic shift of tone. Albanese, who attended climate summits as an observer while opposition environment spokesperson more than 15 years ago, has declared the world is facing a climate emergency and that Australia “could be a renewable energy superpower for the world if we just seize that opportunity”. Sign up for our free morning and afternoon email newsletters from Guardian Australia for your daily news roundup It is a sharp contrast with where the country stood a year ago. The previous Liberal prime minister, Scott Morrison, had no significant policies to cut emissions, rebuffed repeated calls from global leaders for Australia to raise its commitments for 2030, and was grouped with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Brazil (then under Jair Bolsonaro’s presidency) as nations standing in the way of stronger global action. Unlike Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak, Albanese is not attending Cop27, a decision that has drawn criticism from cross bench MPs including the Greens, and former Kiribati president Anote Tong. Albanese this week said the conference was focused on implementation of previous agreements, not major decisions, and cited other commitments – a sitting week of the Australian parliament followed by a G20 leaders’ meeting in Bali. Experts said Australia’s delegation was likely to receive praise in Egypt for being a significant improvement on what came before them, but that the applause would be qualified. Australia’s updated 2030 emissions commitment still trails many other developed countries – including the US, UK and the EU – and the government supports a continued expansion of fossil fuel exports, albeit with a reduction in public subsidies. Australia is the world’s biggest exporter of coal and a leading gas exporter. More than 100 potential fossil fuel projects are registered with the government. It is expected many will ultimately not prove financially viable as investors increasingly look for cleaner options, but Albanese has said they are free to go ahead if they have the necessary backing and can win approval under national environment laws. Richie Merzian, a former Australian government climate diplomat, now with progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the country’s representatives should expect questions about the government’s continuing support for fossil fuels and whether Australia could rejoin the green climate fund, which Morrison quit in 2018, as it lobbied to host a future summit. He said making that case would be “logistically tough”, but possible. “Morrison was extreme. In comparison, this is a middle of the road government – an Australia with less antagonism, more good faith,” he said. “It is a refreshing change in a number of ways, but still relatively modest in terms of policy.” At Cop27 Bowen is expected to stress the importance of doubling down on renewable energy as the cheapest path through the energy crisis and choppy economic times. The climate scientist Bill Hare, a longtime adviser to developing countries at climate negotiations, said Australia could offer a global leadership role on renewables, and make genuine claims to being a pioneer. Australia’s main electricity grid received nearly 44% of its electricity from renewable energy last week, roughly double the level of five years ago. Solar energy, in particular, is rising fast, with rooftop panels on more than 3m houses. “This is leading-edge rapid development and I know a lot of other countries are watching that,” Hare said. But Hare said Australia had made little progress in cutting emissions in nearly all other parts of the economy, including buildings, industry and transport. It has one of the lowest take-up rates of electric vehicles in the OECD, and a rapid expansion of liquified natural gas production for export over the past decade has cancelled out many of the emissions cuts in the power grid. Hare said Australia should expect pressure, including from the Biden administration, to raise its 2030 emissions reduction target, given it was still not enough for the country to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. He said the landmark US Inflation Reduction Act, which included nearly $370bn in climate measures, had set a new benchmark for what was possible. By comparison, a climate bill pushed through the Australian parliament shortly after Labor took power was relatively modest, including emissions reduction targets, but no new policies or funding. The government has promised measures to cut industrial emissions, drive the uptake of EVs, start an offshore wind energy industry and reach an 82% share of renewable electricity by the end of the decade, but all are still in development. “The truth is that Australia has gone from being a laggard to the middle of the road,” Hare said. “There is still a long way to go.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-30T14:00:30Z","webTitle":"Rather than an endlessly reheated nuclear debate, politicians should be powered by the evidence | Adam Morton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/30/rather-than-an-endlessly-reheated-nuclear-debate-politicians-should-be-powered-by-the-evidence","fields":{"headline":"Rather than an endlessly reheated nuclear debate, politicians should be powered by the evidence","bodyText":"We should be wary of simple declarations about the increasingly rapid transformation of the electricity grid. The government has been given a sharp reminder of this after leaning too heavily on pre-election modelling that suggested its policies to boost renewable energy could lead to a $275 cut in bills by 2025. You never know when a Vladimir Putin-shaped villain might disrupt international fossil fuel markets, wreck your assumptions and leave you accused of breaking an election pledge. Peter Dutton doesn’t have this excuse. The most generous thing that can be said about his foray into the debate over electricity last week is that he might want to get a broader range of advice. Giving his budget reply speech, the opposition leader said the Coalition wanted more renewable energy, but it just wasn’t possible yet, and it was a mistake for the government to allow ageing and expensive fossil fuel power to be phased out now. More specifically: “The technology doesn’t yet exist at the scale that is needed to store renewable energy for electricity to be reliable at night, or during peak periods. That is just the scientific reality.” To put it mildly, this is not the consensus opinion of experts in the field. David Osmond, a Canberra-based engineer with the global energy developer Windlab, is among those with a markedly different, evidence-based take. For more than a year, he has been posting weekly results from a live simulation tracking what would happen in Australia’s main electricity grid if it relied primarily on renewable energy. Using a live stream of electricity data from Opennem, he adjusted inputs to see what would happen if there was enough wind and solar energy to supply 60% and 45% of demand respectively. He added enough short-term storage, likely to be in the form of batteries, to supply average demand for five hours. The results are encouraging. They suggest close to 100% of demand – 98.9% over a 61-week period – could be delivered by solar and wind backed by existing hydro power and the five hours of storage. Nearly 90% of demand was met directly by renewable energy and 10% had to pass through storage. Achieving it would require a major expansion of transmission, as proposed by Labor under its Rewiring the Nation policy. The 1.1% shortfall mostly came when it was less sunny in late autumn and winter. Other technology would be needed to fill that hole. Osmond believes for now that would probably be fast-starting gas-fired power plants that are already connected to the grid, don’t run most of the time and can be called on quickly. There was nothing to suggest new ones were needed. It means a small amount of fossil fuel generation remaining in the grid, but less gas would be burned than now and, crucially, no coal power would be required. In the longer term, the backup could possibly come from cleaner sources – probably pumped hydro, maybe hydrogen or biofuels. None of these necessarily make economic sense the way solar and wind do – it is hard to justify a plant that would hardly ever be used – but could be needed in the context of the grid. An alternative would be to over-build solar and wind so there was always enough capacity online. By Osmond’s admission, this is a simplified model that assumes, for example, that electricity transmission links between regions can be delivered efficiently. No one should assume that the transition will be straightforward. The point is the technology already exists, and is comparatively cheap. From there it is a matter of design, engineering and, importantly, cost management. The last bit necessary to ensure the lights stay on is likely to make up a disproportionate amount of the overall cost. But the evidence says a renewable energy-dominated system is comfortably the cheapest form of generation if done right. Plenty of other studies have reached similar conclusions. The big one is the Australian Energy Market Operator’s integrated system plan, a roadmap for the optimal future grid that was released in June. It backed an accelerated build of available technology to reach 83% of renewable generation by 2030, 96% by 2040 and 98% by 2050 as the best, most likely option. Presented with this evidence, Dutton and the Coalition continue to opt for none of the above. They appear to have joined a small band, including many in the usual right-wing media echo chambers, convinced that the evidence presented is wrong. Dutton was mostly dismissive of batteries in his budget reply, and implied small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) – a commercially unproven technology that has been repeatedly delayed and more expensive than promised – could be the answer that ensures cheap energy. No evidence has been presented to suggest SMRs are needed to meet demand in Australia, given the country’s wealth of renewable options. Never mind that no independent evidence has been offered to suggest it could compete on price. If SMRs prove economically viable and safe elsewhere there is nothing to stop Australia considering their use, perhaps at remote off-grid industrial sites. It will be a good thing if they are viable, given not every country has ample alternatives to fossil fuels. But they are not designed to do the job needed here – to turn on occasionally and fill gaps in a system running on cheaper, renewable energy. Rather than an endlessly reheated debate about nuclear – the Coalition is holding another review, so expect plenty more of this – Australians would be better served if its politicians had a close look at a major report last week by the International Energy Agency. For the first time, the IEA forecast that fossil fuel use across the globe would peak in the next few years as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated a shift to clean fuels. It found existing policies would soon lead to coal use falling and demand for gas would plateau by the end of the decade. The declines will be much faster if, as expected, climate action continues to ramp up. Australia has one of the world’s largest fossil fuel export industries. It is supporting massive developments expected to last until late into the century as though nothing much is going to change. The significant climate impact of these developments is still routinely overlooked by the major parties on the grounds the gas and coal are burned overseas, and therefore somehow not Australia’s problem. But what about the economic and social impact of their potentially rapid decline? Now there’s an issue truly worthy of more parliamentary debate and action."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-24T21:00:14Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer unveils green growth plan to counter Liz Truss’s tax cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/24/keir-starmer-unveils-green-growth-plan-to-counter-liz-trusss-tax-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer unveils green growth plan to counter Liz Truss’s tax cuts","bodyText":"Keir Starmer will pledge to deliver a new era of economic growth and permanently lower energy bills by turning the UK into an independent green “superpower” before 2030, through a massive expansion of wind and solar energy. Announcing details of the plan exclusively to the Observer, the Labour leader says he will double the amount of onshore wind, triple solar and more than quadruple offshore wind power, “re-industrialising” the country to create a zero carbon, self-sufficient electricity system, by the end of this decade. Starmer says the move – far more ambitious than any green policy advanced by the Tories and the most far-reaching of his leadership so far – would release the British people from the mercy of “dictators” such as Russian president Vladimir Putin over energy bills. It would also, he says, cut hundreds of pounds off annual household energy bills “for good”, create up to half a million UK jobs, and make this country the first to have a zero-emission power system. Labour’s new approach is unveiled as the government’s blueprint to boost economic growth through a sweeping programme of tax cuts – announced by Kwasi Kwarteng, the new chancellor, on Friday – encounters mounting criticism. Yesterday thinktanks and leading economists said the Conservative plan would mainly help the richest and benefit the more prosperous south of England, rather than provide assistance to struggling households and parts of the country which are more deprived. It also spooked the financial markets. In the hours after Kwarteng addressed MPs in the Commons, the pound slumped more than 3% against the dollar to levels last seen 37 years ago and the cost of government borrowing suffered its biggest one-day rise since 1991. These initial reactions have fuelled fears of more carnage when markets reopen on Monday. Some economists believe the Bank of England could be forced to hold an emergency meeting to consider further interest rates rises to prevent a rout. Former Bank policymaker Martin Weale said markets were “frightened” by unfunded tax cuts being pumped into the economy at a time of high inflation. “It is hard to see this policy [of tax cuts] ending happily.” He added: “I expect sterling will continue falling next week, and if it does the Bank of England may need to step in with even higher interest rates.” Starmer made clear that his alternative approach to boosting growth involved tackling three crises jointly – the climate, the cost of living, and the wider economy. Party aides said history showed Labour was at its best and most successful when it captured a sense of “modernity and the future”, as in 1964 when Harold Wilson became prime minister with a vision to create a new Britain in the “white heat” of “scientific revolution”. Starmer said that while the Conservatives were indulging in “casino economics” and “gambling the mortgages and finances of every family in the country”, Labour was looking to create a secure future for everyone, both economically and in the face of climate change. “The British people are sick and tired of rocketing energy bills and our energy system being exposed to dictators,” Starmer said, before Labour’s annual conference which opens in Liverpool on Sunday. “They want long-term solutions to cut bills for good. A central mission of my government will be to turn the UK into a clean energy superpower. “This is a plan that will drive jobs, tackle the cost of living, and protect our homes for future generations by tackling the climate crisis.” Starmer, along with Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for climate change, has been working for months on what they call their green prosperity plan. The idea at its core is to build a self-sufficient power system run entirely by cheap, homegrown renewables and nuclear, by the end of the decade. This, they argue, would also allow the country to become a major energy exporter. In the interview, Starmer said the arrival of Liz Truss as prime minister had created a clearer ideological divide between the Conservatives and Labour that was evident in the way the two party leaders approached challenges over the cost of living and energy prices. There was, Starmer said, “a big divide on the economy and the question of who grows the economy”. While Labour wants to create growth by putting working people at the heart of a green economic revolution, he said Truss wanted her tax cuts to benefit “those at the top, therefore she wants trickle-down economics, to make the rich richer, give them tax cuts. So there is a huge ideological gap there.” The Labour leader added that his party could now fight the next election on issues outside its traditional “comfort zones” such as the NHS. It was now in a position to present a more credible argument to the electorate than the Tories on economic policy as a whole. Starmer said that following the new government’s mini-budget on Friday it was clear that “the roles are switched” and that Labour was now the party of “fiscal responsibility”. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer today, taken mainly before the chancellor’s tax-cutting announcements and the first since Truss entered No 10, shows no boost to the Conservatives from the change of leader and prime minister. It shows Labour leading by 5 points (up 1 point compared with three weeks ago) on 39% while the Tories are unchanged on 34%. Commenting on Labour’s energy plan, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics Rebecca Newsom said: “The only way out of this mess is a moonshot mission to roll out a renewables based energy system that can lower bills, cut emissions, create jobs and break our dependence on gas markets and fossil fuel autocrats. “Labour seems to have understood that, the Conservatives don’t.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/08/price-offshore-wind-power-falls-cheapest-ever-level-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-08T09:54:53Z","webTitle":"Price of offshore wind power falls to cheapest ever level in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/08/price-offshore-wind-power-falls-cheapest-ever-level-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/08/price-offshore-wind-power-falls-cheapest-ever-level-uk","fields":{"headline":"Price of offshore wind power falls to cheapest ever level in UK","bodyText":"The price of offshore wind power in the UK has fallen to an all-time low, which could ease the pressure on future household energy bills. Following the biggest ever UK renewables auction, the government said on Thursday the contract price for windfarms was nearly 6% lower than the previous auction, despite the rising cost of materials to build windfarms. A string of new contracts should add about 7 gigawatts of clean power capacity to Britain’s turbine fleet by 2026. The government hopes to have 50GW by 2030 and has embarked on a push to expand Britain’s renewables industry in the face of rocketing fossil fuel prices. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated an already volatile oil and gas market and left countries scrambling to shore up their energy supplies. UK ministers have been forced to ask coal-fired power plants to continue their operations through the winter for fear of blackouts caused by energy shortages. However, renewable energy including wind power is seen as central to Britain’s goal of hitting net zero carbon by 2050. Offshore windfarm operators will sell power for as little as £37.35 per megawatt hour, 5.8% below the lowest bid in the most recent auction in 2019. The “contracts for difference” guarantee wind-power companies fixed prices to sell electricity for the following 15 years. If the market price falls below the contract price, the government subsidises the difference. If the market is higher, the companies pay money back to the government. Since wholesale energy prices began to rocket last year, windfarms have begun paying back money to the government. The easing of an effective moratorium on new onshore windfarms – which was imposed in 2015 – meant onshore wind and solar energy were both included in an auction for the first time in seven years. Onshore wind is now about 45% of the price secured in the auction in 2015. Among the winners from the auction were the Danish power company Ørsted, Scottish Power and Sweden’s Vattenfall. Ørsted landed the contract for the world’s biggest offshore wind project, at Hornsea Three, 100 miles (160km) off the east Yorkshire coast. It is hoped the project will produce enough renewable electricity to power 3.2m UK homes. Scottish Power secured a contract for the East Anglia Three offshore wind project, five onshore wind projects and 10 solar sites. Vattenfall agreed terms for the Norfolk Boreas offshore windfarm, which it said would meet the needs of about 1.5m homes. It is hoped the projects will help to eventually bring down bills for consumers, which are expected to top £2,800 from October. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “Eye-watering gas prices are hitting consumers across Europe. The more cheap, clean power we generate within our own borders, the better protected we will be from volatile gas prices that are pushing up bills.” Separately on Thursday, the National Grid laid out the biggest investment plan in the UK’s electricity network since the 1960s. In the £54bn upgrade connections to the grid for offshore windfarms will be coordinated for the first time. National Grid’s electricity arm proposed 15 connection points to bring 18 offshore windfarms to land. Most offshore wind projects have their own connection to the grid. National Grid hopes to reduce costs and cut down disruption for coastal residents by reducing the number of cables and pylons needed. The Scottish Power chief executive, Keith Anderson, urged the government to speed up the task of approving renewables projects and connecting them to the grid. “There is massive public support for the goal to hit net zero. There is a need for speed. The planning system itself is OK but it’s about getting the process more quickly,” he said. Gareth Miller, the chief executive of consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: “As consumer bills rise to unprecedented levels, these results show the value that renewables can play in driving down the cost of power generation, decoupling electricity bills from gas prices, and all in an environment currently where high gas prices are setting the electricity price in the market. This week, the Queen’s property manager, the crown estate, identified five areas off the coasts of Cornwall and Pembrokeshire that could host floating windfarms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T09:00:25Z","webTitle":"‘We have not recovered’: Puerto Rico’s water supply remains vulnerable to hurricane fury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","fields":{"headline":"‘We have not recovered’: Puerto Rico’s water supply remains vulnerable to hurricane fury","bodyText":"Hurricane Fiona was the second time José Oyola Ríos served as an emergency drinking water provider, after gusting winds and heavy rains battered Puerto Rico on Sunday, causing mass flooding and power outages. Oyola Ríos serves as a community leader in rural, inland Caguas, in the central mountain range, where he maintains water tanks that store thousands of gallons, known in the area as the “community oasis”. When Hurricane María battered the island in 2017, hundreds of residents from surrounding towns would drive up the mountainous road to Caguas to get a few gallons of water. Almost exactly five years later, Oyola Ríos activated his plan once again to distribute potable water to communities left without running water after deadly Hurricane Fiona passed through as a Category 1 storm in the Atlantic hurricane season and swept on with its destructive path towards other Caribbean communities. “These atmospheric events demonstrate that we haven’t been able to recover,” Oyola Ríos told the Guardian, adding that Fiona “aggravated that reality”. Slow progress in modernizing Puerto Rico’s water infrastructure has left many residents reliving the trauma experienced when the Category 5 María devastated the 3 million-strong US territory. Several water filtration systems across the island were inoperable post-Fiona due to turbidity or electrical failures, leaving thousands with an interrupted service because of flooding and outages. More than 760,000 customers were still without water service on Tuesday morning, according to the government’s portal. More than half of the water authority’s dams and filtration plants were affected by the hurricane, the president of the Puerto Rico aqueduct and sewer authority, Doriel Pagán, said at a press conference. Water pumps across the island also depend on electricity to distribute water in elevated areas. Pagán said the water authority continues to place power generators across their systems. In preparation for the latest hurricane, many residents stocked up on water, canned food, medication and other essentials. It’s unclear how long customers now without utilities will remain without power or water, and whether supplies at home will last. “This is where a family’s judgment comes in,” said Adamaris Quiñones Rodríguez, president of Puerto Rico water &amp; environment association, a non-profit that focuses on promoting infrastructure rehabilitation. “You might sacrifice a cleaning task in order to have enough water to drink or bathe with.” Yeseida Garay Cotto, 36, lives in Caguas and depends on a well to obtain potable water because the official water service doesn’t reach her house. When the storm hit on Sunday, all she could hear for hours were rocks tumbling that came from several hillside collapses caused by the torrential downpour. One of the collapses damaged the well’s pipeline that she, her family and several others in the community depend on. “We don’t have much clean water, so we’re using the rainwater to wash the dishes and stuff like that,” Garay Cotto told the Guardian. “We have some water we can drink, which should last until we can fix the well.” In contrast, the island is also prone to severe droughts, further necessitating water infrastructure fit for purpose. Puerto Rico’s latest drought was as recent as this summer, when water sources and reservoirs in the north-eastern part of the island were particularly low. Some of the reservoirs leak, which the water authority proposed to fix, and water rationing was mandated. But community leaders like Oyola Ríos lamented that the system is still operating with a vulnerable electricity grid and flawed water system. The US government’s federal emergency management agency (Fema) assigned about $13.2bn for the recovery of the electrical grid after Hurricane María. Only $40m of those funds have been disbursed so far, Anne Bink, associate administrator of the Office of Response and Recovery at Fema, told a congressional hearing last Thursday. “While the start could have been faster, we’re starting to see that pivot toward more work, more shovels in the ground,” she said. Obtaining safe drinking water can be arduous after an atmospheric event of the scope of hurricane. People must disinfect their water supply by boiling it or using liquid chlorine bleach. Hurricane María exposed the threat of drinking contaminated water after 26 people died of leptospirosis – a potentially deadly bacterial disease largely spread by rats. Ironically, people who lived closer to a large canal had a higher risk of being infected, a study led by researchers at the Yale school of public health found. José Ríos Meléndez oversees a group of community aqueducts that provide potable water to areas with unstable water systems. He said he saw a spike in the construction of such fixtures, especially after Luma Energy, a Canadian-American private company, took over Puerto Rico’s energy transmission and distribution system in 2021. But frequent power outages in the last year have left communities which rely on electricity to operate the pumps without an efficient water system, as well as basics like lighting and refrigeration, where many store medication as well as food. Disruptions have been accompanied by repeated increases in electricity bills. Hundreds of protesters gathered last month to demand the cancellation of the contract of Luma Energy, leading to violent clashes with police. More than 240 community aqueducts, equipped with tanks that hold thousands of gallons of water, are scattered around the island and supply water to thousands of people, and more than 100 of these systems run on solar power. Many Puerto Ricans are switching to solar for residences and businesses. Oyola Ríos believes solar energy is an efficient choice, especially as storms become more frequent and fierce. “If I didn’t had solar panels, I wouldn’t have been able to operate,” Oyola Ríos said. “Even with a power generator, there’s a low supply of diesel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2022/may/28/elon-musk-welcomes-global-recession-its-been-raining-money-on-fools-for-too-long","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-28T12:00:31Z","webTitle":"Elon Musk welcomes global recession: ‘it’s been raining money on fools for too long’ | Andrew Lawrence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/28/elon-musk-welcomes-global-recession-its-been-raining-money-on-fools-for-too-long","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2022/may/28/elon-musk-welcomes-global-recession-its-been-raining-money-on-fools-for-too-long","fields":{"headline":"Elon Musk welcomes global recession: ‘it’s been raining money on fools for too long’","bodyText":"With the invasion of Ukraine and lockdowns in China putting added pressure on a supply chain that has yet to recover from the ongoing pandemic, many are predicting a global recession. Elon Musk says bring it on. “This is actually a good thing,” Musk said in response to a question from a Twitter user. “It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen. “Also,” he continued, “all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don’t actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!” It’s tough talk from a man said to be worth north of $218bn, more than anyone in the world. And it conveniently overlooks the considerable handouts Musk himself took in the process of growing his net worth after plunking down $6.5m for a majority stake in Tesla in 2004. How did Musk weather the economic storms and rude awakenings thereafter? In 2008, the company rolled out its only product – a Lotus Elise knockoff called the Roadster. At a starting price of around $80,000, the coupe wasn’t exactly priced to move; 2,450 global sales made Musk’s vision of mass-producing electric cars look like a pipe dream. But a year later, Tesla received a $465m loan as part of a federal stimulus package – money that essentially paid for the development and manufacture of the groundbreaking Model S. Musk, who’s quick to note that Tesla paid that loan back early, moves those cars with help from considerable tax breaks for electric vehicles. And he further takes advantage of his cars’ absence of tailpipe emissions by reselling his cache of carbon credits to high-carbon emitting rivals under pressure to clean up – at least $517m since 2015. There’s a reason why Bill Ackman and other short-sellers bet big on Tesla to fail. The company would probably be as dead as Nikola Tesla himself if it hadn’t been for the government “raining money on fools”. Musk also claimed on Twitter that a recession would be good because “companies that are inherently negative cash flow (ie value destroyers) need to die, so that they stop consuming resources”. From 2010 to 2018, Tesla raised $20bn in capital while producing a negative cash flow of $9bn; 2021 was the company’s first full year of profitability. It isn’t just Washington that has been generous. Tesla also benefits from state tax income tax breaks for green vehicles and routinely helps itself to corporate subsidies. Since last August the company has received roughly $64m in incentives to move to Austin, Texas, and build Giga Texas – the spanking new factory that’s expected to produce another gonzo Musk idea, the Tesla Cybertruck. Musk’s other companies have benefited from corporate welfare schemes too. In 2015, the LA Times reckoned Musk’s companies had benefited from almost $5bn in government support. That includes SpaceX, which just landed a $2.89bn contract with Nasa and a $653m air force contract, both in 2021; and SolarCity, which capitalised on $1.5bn in government aid and haemorrhaged cash too before the solar energy company was absorbed into Tesla –which itself accepted payroll benefits from Donald Trump’s $600bn pandemic stimulus package. Musk can scold work-from-homers all he wants. But when it comes to benefiting from handouts and loans, few have been rained on more than him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/apr/12/queensland-advances-green-hydrogen-and-ammonia-project-to-be-powered-by-renewables","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-12T03:57:20Z","webTitle":"Queensland advances green hydrogen and ammonia project to be powered by renewables","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/queensland-advances-green-hydrogen-and-ammonia-project-to-be-powered-by-renewables","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/queensland-advances-green-hydrogen-and-ammonia-project-to-be-powered-by-renewables","fields":{"headline":"Queensland advances green hydrogen and ammonia project to be powered by renewables","bodyText":"The Queensland government has granted coordinated project status to a $4.7bn proposal to build a green hydrogen and ammonia plant in Gladstone, where climate transition plans are being pitched as saviour projects. The central Queensland city has endured a significant economic downturn since the end of an LNG construction boom about five years ago. But the deputy premier, Steven Miles, says Gladstone is on the way to becoming a “clean energy powerhouse” on the back of investment in new economy and climate transition projects. Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest is already building the world’s largest electrolyser factory in Gladstone. On Tuesday the Queensland government announced a streamlined approval process, overseen by the coordinator general, for the H2-Hub Gladstone project, which will produce green hydrogen and green ammonia. The green ammonia would be sold to mining explosives manufacturer Orica, which is working with the project proponent, H2U, on plans for an ammonia export terminal in Gladstone. Miles said the project could create more than 550 jobs during a phased construction and about 140 ongoing operational jobs. The project includes plans to build up to 3 gigawatts of electrolysis and produce up to 5,000 tonnes of green ammonia a day. It would be powered by 100% renewable energy, from new-build solar and wind in Queensland. State minister for regional development and Gladstone MP, Glenn Butcher, said central Queensland was becoming a significant site for renewables projects. “These partnerships are highlighting the benefits of investing into Queensland’s regions and creating jobs for the future,” Butcher said. Green hydrogen is made by running an electric current through water using an electrolyser powered by renewable energy such as wind or solar. Energy analysts have previously suggested green hydrogen was likely to leapfrog hydrogen made with gas and coal as the most cost-effective form of the energy before the end of the decade, and by the time an industry could be developed at scale. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Hydrogen has become central to the Australian government’s current proposal to reach net zero emissions. The government has nominated “clean hydrogen” as a priority low-emissions technology that could eventually help replace fossil fuels in transport, electricity and industrial processes as the world moves to cut greenhouse gas emissions. H2U is expected to make a final investment decision by mid-2023, with operations expected to begin in 2025 and an expansion toward the end of the decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/nov/14/the-big-idea-we-need-to-reverse-climate-change-not-just-stop-it","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-14T12:30:38Z","webTitle":"The big idea: stopping climate change isn’t enough – we need to reverse it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/nov/14/the-big-idea-we-need-to-reverse-climate-change-not-just-stop-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/nov/14/the-big-idea-we-need-to-reverse-climate-change-not-just-stop-it","fields":{"headline":"The big idea: stopping climate change isn’t enough – we need to reverse it","bodyText":"The past year has seen an unending drumbeat of climate-driven disasters. And yet, the climate story of this past decade has been one of slow but steady progress. Global CO2 emissions have flattened, and countries representing 88% of global emissions have adopted or announced plans to get to net zero in the latter half of the 21st century. Another reason to be hopeful is that clean energy became cheaper much faster than expected. The cost of both solar energy and batteries fell tenfold in the last 10 years and the cost of wind energy by two-thirds. Solar is the cheapest form of new electricity to build in much of the world today, and electric vehicles now represent 13% of new vehicle sales globally. But this doesn’t mean we can rest on our laurels. Far from it. We are still nowhere near where we need to be to meet our climate goals. In the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, which I contributed to, we found that if we want to limit warming to 1.5C we can only emit 420bn more tons of CO2 – equal to around 10 years of current emissions. This means that even with the progress we’ve made, the increase in global temperatures is very likely to exceed 1.5C by the early 2030s. So where does that leave us? The short answer is: “It’s complicated.” To start with, it’s important to emphasise that climate change happens incrementally rather than in big jumps. There is no evidence that 1.5C represents a boundary between manageable and catastrophic impacts. But the further we push the climate beyond where it has been for the past few million years, the greater and more unpredictable the risks become. Large climate shifts in the Earth’s past, and potential future tipping points such as CO2 release from thawing permafrost, should give us pause: we can’t easily predict what might happen. Every tenth of a degree matters if we want to minimise the harm we inflict on ourselves and leave to future generations. But equally, just because we pass 1.5C does not mean that there is no way back. We know that if we can get emissions down to zero the world will effectively stop warming. And climate models show that if we remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than we are emitting it will actually cool the world back down. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere and oceans was highlighted in the recent IPCC report as an “essential element” of meeting our climate goals. Virtually all climate models suggest that we need to remove 6bn tons of CO2 per year by 2050 alongside rapid emissions reductions to bring temperatures back down to 1.5C by the end of the century. One form of carbon dioxide removal people are already familiar with comes in the form of trees and soil. The Earth’s living systems already sequester about a quarter of the CO2 we emit today (with another quarter absorbed by the oceans). There is real potential to enhance this “natural carbon sink” by protecting forests, planting more of them, and changing how we manage agricultural land and pasture to get more carbon into the soil. This is relatively low cost today, but it is also likely to prove temporary. Trees may be cut down, burn down, or die from beetle infestations, while soil may dry up due to drought or heat – and these risks will increase as a result of climate change. There are also limits to the land available to use. All in all, models suggest that trees and soil could provide only half of the carbon dioxide removal that we need. There are other more reliable ways to take carbon out of the atmosphere over the long term. Such approaches are still at an early stage, but are being rapidly developed by hundreds of companies around the world. They include direct air capture, which sucks CO2 directly from the atmosphere; taking agricultural waste or wood and storing carbon from it deep underground; spreading minerals like basalt that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere on to agricultural fields; removing CO2 directly from ocean water; making ocean water less acidic so it absorbs more CO2; and sinking kelp or other plants into the deep ocean where the carbon they have absorbed will stay for millennia to come. These approaches are less likely to be reversed and are less limited by available land. But they tend to be much more expensive, at least at the moment. It follows that we should be focusing on making them cheaper, the way we did with renewable energy. This is the goal of Frontier, a $925m advance market commitment that Stripe, where I am climate research lead, has launched alongside Alphabet, Shopify, Meta and McKinsey. The idea is simple: by guaranteeing money up front, we’re sending a signal to entrepreneurs and researchers that if they build and scale those early-stage technologies, we will buy them. This approach was piloted a decade ago to accelerate the development of the pneumococcal vaccines in low-income countries, and saved an estimated 700,000 lives. We have a saying in the climate science world – that CO2 is forever. It will take close to half a million years before a ton of CO2 emitted today from burning fossil fuels is completely removed from the atmosphere naturally. This means that when we try to neutralise or undo fossil fuel emissions – for example, with carbon offsets – those interventions should operate over a similar timeframe: a ton of emissions from cutting down trees can be neutralised by putting more carbon in trees or soils, but CO2 from fossil fuels needs to be balanced by more permanent carbon removal. This is the reason why the respected Science Based Targets initiative only allows measures that permanently remove carbon from the atmosphere to neutralise a company’s remaining fossil fuel emissions in their net-zero standard – and only alongside deep emissions reductions. We should not oversell the role of carbon removal. The vast majority of the time it is cheaper to reduce emissions than to remove CO2 from the atmosphere after the fact. Models that limit warming to 1.5C show that we need to reduce global CO2 emissions by around 90%, while only using carbon removal for around 10%. But 10% of the solution to a problem as big as climate change is still something we cannot afford to ignore. In 2021 the world spent a total of $755bn on reducing emissions. We should probably aim to spend about 1% of that money on carbon removal technologies. But we cannot simply sit back and assume that ways of removing billions of tons of CO2 per year will magically appear in the decades to come. By investing today, we can ensure that we are in a good position to make net-zero a reality, stop the world from continuing to heat up, and give ourselves the tools to ultimately reverse global warming in the future.

On Friday, authorities again issued high temperature warnings for about a dozen provinces across the central and northern provinces, after consecutive days in the high 30s. As people sought to escape the heat this week, state media reported, citing the State Grid Corp of China, that electricity demand was up 8.8% in north-west China compared with last year, and by 3.2% in northern China. Records for maximum electricity loads were broken in Shandong, Henan and Jiangsu. The premier, Li Keqiang, “urged tapping into advanced coal capacity, securing power supply and resolutely preventing power outages amid the peak summer season”, according to state media. The reports said Li also called for greater “efforts to ramp up efficient and clean coal power production”. Authorities are hoping to avoid repeats of an energy crisis last year in which there were widespread power cuts, but there are concerns that increased coal production will hamper China’s ability to meet its promises on emissions reductions. In 2020 the government announced a goal of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Last month China posted its third consecutive quarter of emission reductions, a feat that analysts said was achieved because of Covid restrictions, curbs on the property development market, and efforts to boost clean energy. China is a major investor in wind and solar, but its electricity system still relies overwhelmingly on coal-fired power, using more than 50% of the total national supply, according to a research paper published in Nature this month. “Although China already features the world’s largest installed power generation capacity for renewable energy, a profound transformation of the power system will still be required over the next 30 years to achieve carbon emission goals,” the paper said. Observers say China’s government has, in practice, renewed its focus on coal-fired electricity to ensure stability, despite the massive investment in wind and solar energy. A confluence of factors contributed to the 2021 crisis, including strict energy rationing designed to meet efficiency targets coming up against energy-intensive infrastructure projects designed to kickstart the pandemic-afflicted economy. The trend towards coal production and energy self-reliance is also being exacerbated by the market volatility resulting from the Ukraine war. The Netherlands, Germany and Austria have made similar moves in response to the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion. “It is fair to say that after the high note set by the carbon neutrality announcement in 2020, China’s climate momentum is waning,” said Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser for Greenpeace. “It will certainly serve as a delaying factor for China to achieve deep decarbonisation over the long term … Stronger political will is needed to weather China through the current down season of climate action.” Jiang Yi, a Tsinghua University academic and member of the Chinese Communist party’s most recent national climate change expert committee, said the increase in coal production was not inconsistent with the government’s carbon pledges. “Before a perfect new power system has been built and the flexibility and storage capacity of the power system have been completely solved, it is also necessary to rely on coal-fired thermal power to ensure supply,” Yi said. “On the one hand we are grasping supply assurance, and on the other hand we are also vigorously developing zero-carbon energy systems to achieve the replacement of coal. The two are not contradictory.” Sophie Geoghegan, a climate campaigner for the Environmental Investigations Agency, said increasingly common and severe heatwaves around the world were increasing the demand for cooling such air conditioning. “The way that AC is used, as soon as it gets warm, everyone turns theirs on … putting huge strain on the grid, which means that either there are power cuts or peak power is switched on, and peak power is run by coal plants,” she said. “It’s a catch-22: it gets warm, so you turn on your AC, which increases global temps even further. So China has increased coal production to address a rising demand for cooling, but it’s a short-term fix which has long-term implications.” Additional reporting by Xianqian Zhu, Chi Hui Lin and agencies"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/sep/01/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T10:27:06Z","webTitle":"Energy crisis: UK households worst hit in western Europe, finds IMF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/sep/01/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/sep/01/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf","fields":{"headline":"Energy crisis: UK households worst hit in western Europe, finds IMF","bodyText":"The energy crisis is hitting UK household budgets harder than any country in western Europe, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. The difference between the cost burden on poor and rich households is also far more unequal in the UK compared with other countries. The reason is the UK’s heavy reliance on gas to heat homes and produce electricity at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring. In addition, the UK has the least energy efficient homes in western Europe. There is widespread agreement from energy experts on the best solutions: a large-scale and rapid insulation programme and a faster rollout of wind and solar energy, which produce electricity that is currently about nine times cheaper than that from gas, as well as short-term financial support for bill-payers. The government has consistently failed over the past decade to deliver major insulation programmes and has effectively banned onshore wind. The IMF analysis assessed the impact of the energy crisis expected over the whole of 2022, based on forward fossil fuel prices in May, since when prices have risen. It found that the average UK household is expected to lose 8.3% of its total spending power in 2022, as a result of having to pay higher energy bills. The figure in Germany and Spain is 4%, while only Estonian and Czech households face higher impacts than the UK in the whole of Europe. Energy bill rises also push up the costs of other goods, as sellers pass on the price rises. These indirect effects will knock another 2% off the money UK households have to spend in 2022. The IMF analysis takes account of people reducing their energy use as prices rise. “The distributional impact is especially skewed [in the UK],” said Oya Celasun from the IMF. The poorest 10% of UK households are expected to spend 17.8% of their budget on energy in 2022, while the richest 10% will spend 6.1%, the analysis found. The difference of 11.7 percentage points is by far the greatest disparity among the 25 European countries assessed. In France, the difference is 3.9 percentage points and in the Netherlands, 2.5. Analysis by Deutsche Bank also shows UK bill-payers are being hit hard by the energy crisis. It found that consumer price inflation for gas and electricity in the UK in 2022 is forecast to be about 80%, compared with an average of 40% across the 19 countries that use the euro. “The UK has higher energy prices, comparative to other economies in Europe” said Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. “The fact of the matter is the UK is more highly dependent on gas.” The vast majority of homes in the UK – 85% – use gas to provide heat, a legacy of exploitation of North Sea gas fields, which are now in decline. In France and Germany, fewer than 50% of homes are heated with gas. The UK also relied on gas to produce more terawatt hours of electricity in 2021 than any of the 39 European countries analysed by the thinktank Ember, except Italy. Electricity from gas is the most expensive for power and sets the price for all electricity, due to the current UK market structure. In terms of the share of electricity generated by gas, the UK is at 40%, Germany at 15% and Denmark at 6%. “The UK energy crisis is a fossil gas crisis,” said Sarah Brown at Ember. “The UK’s reliance on fossil gas is punishing ordinary people.” “Another of the key differences is that houses in the UK are incredibly inefficient,” said Lisa Fischer at the thinktank E3G. The UK’s leaky homes are the least efficient in western Europe, according to one analysis: UK homes lose 3C in temperature in the same time that German homes lose just 1C. The people living in the two-thirds of UK homes that are energy inefficient, rated D or worse, will pay at least £1,000 more this winter. The solution to the UK’s energy crisis is much better insulation, replacing gas boilers with heat pumps and speeding up the deployment of renewable energy, said Raja. Short-term measures include reducing the flow temperature on condensing gas boilers and replacing home appliances with more energy-efficient models, said Fischer. Further financial support for UK households will also be necessary, but Celasun, at the IMF, said this should be targeted at vulnerable households: “For instance, it would be full compensation for the poor and support could be reduced gradually as incomes rise.” She said completely compensating price increases for everyone would remove a strong incentive to consume less energy, which cuts both costs and climate heating carbon emissions. Jess Ralston, at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “The government currently has no serious plan for cutting our gas dependency, so the new prime minister would need to rapidly ramp up existing energy efficiency programmes. With the gas price so high, the return on this investment would be extraordinarily quick.” Increasing the supply of gas from the North Sea would not result in sufficient amounts to reduce energy prices, which are set internationally, said Raja: “When it comes to the UK and energy, we are price-takers.” Fischer also dismissed the idea that fracking in the UK could alleviate the energy crisis, describing it as “nonsense”. “It’s really important to start planning action now, because we know that next winter is likely to be at least as difficult, if not more difficult than this winter,” Fischer said. “Germany is starting to line up things, especially on financing for building efficiency and switching to heat pumps. In the UK, there’s an absolute lack of trying to do those things that help you permanently insulate people from higher energy prices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/06/uk-more-oil-gas-drilling-north-sea-energy-security-strategy-kwasi-kwarteng-net-zero-targets","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"UK to defy net zero targets with more oil and gas drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/uk-more-oil-gas-drilling-north-sea-energy-security-strategy-kwasi-kwarteng-net-zero-targets","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/06/uk-more-oil-gas-drilling-north-sea-energy-security-strategy-kwasi-kwarteng-net-zero-targets","fields":{"headline":"UK to defy net zero targets with more oil and gas drilling","bodyText":"The UK government is set to order more drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea in defiance of its own net zero targets, while neglecting alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions instead of raising them. The energy security strategy to be unveiled on Thursday will acknowledge the need to move away from fossil fuels, the Guardian understands, but still allow for licences to explore new oil and gas fields to be expedited and more production from existing North Sea fields. Ministers are expected to say the UK needs more oil and gas in the short term, including new sources of fossil fuel imports, to replace the small proportion of UK oil and gas that comes from Russia, and ease pressure on prices. The government will present North Sea oil and gas as lower carbon than imported gas, according to a Whitehall source, to meet the UK’s needs while ramping up renewables and nuclear power. Yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change presented a “now or never” warning on Monday, showing that new fossil fuel exploration will put the Paris agreement target of limiting global heating to 1.5C beyond reach. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who will present the energy strategy, is strongly in favour of ramping up renewable energy over oil and gas, but under pressure from Tory rightwingers the government is set to offer a heavy emphasis on gas, with few measures on insulation or switching to heat pumps. The strategy will also set out: A review of the scientific advice on the safety of fracking. The Guardian understands that Kwarteng thinks fracking in the UK is unrealistic and uneconomic, but under pressure from the right will keep the option open. Doubling the target on the use of hydrogen, from 5GW to 10GW, of which half will come from “blue” hydrogen created from fossil fuels, despite evidence that it emits more carbon than coal. Ministers are expected to present blue hydrogen as a necessary bridge to future “green” hydrogen from renewable energy, but campaigners say it will lock in high emissions. A boost to offshore wind, with the expansion of existing coastal offshore windfarms and potential new floating platforms in deeper waters, but solar energy risks being missed. Investment in new nuclear reactors being made easier. Few new measures on ramping up heat pumps and no comprehensive national programme to insulate housing on the scale experts say is feasible and would make a real difference to the cost of living. Hopes for a major loosening of planning regulations in England that would allow more onshore wind will be dashed, owing to cabinet opposition. This is despite multiple opinion polls showing a large majority of people in favour of windfarms, including most Conservative voters and people in areas near actual and proposed turbines. Green campaigners said new North Sea fields licensed today would produce no gas for years or decades but result in continued higher emissions long into the future. Meanwhile, the bigger opportunity – of cutting energy waste – risks being missed. The government’s independent climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has expressed its strong disapproval of plans for more extraction in the North Sea, but said last month it was powerless to prevent it. Philip Evans, oil and gas campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Rushing to sign off new fossil fuel licences that’ll take decades to get going would be no help in standing up to Vladimir Putin, and would actively make the climate crisis worse. The quickest and smartest solution to the energy challenge and the cost of living crisis is a huge push to tackle energy waste. If your bathtub is leaking, you should fix the leak – not just turn up the taps.” Fixing the leaks seems to be low down on the government’s priority list, however. Successive attempts to insulate Britain have failed, for various reasons: poor administration, in last year’s disastrous green homes grant; complex rules and low incentives for its predecessor “green deal” scheme that was abandoned in 2015; and overall a half-hearted, short-term and piecemeal approach from the government. Experts say what is needed is a concerted nationwide push to roll out insulation, double glazing and heat pumps, concentrating first on households in or at risk of energy poverty. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the trade body Energy UK, said: “The benefits of making our homes energy efficient are so overwhelming that nobody seriously disagrees with its importance, but as a country our efforts so far have got nowhere near the scale required. Now is surely the time to press ahead with something that is proven to [reduce bills] by hundreds of pounds a year permanently.” There is little sense that the government is prepared to put in the large-scale effort required. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at E3G, warned: “There is technical potential to halve gas consumption in UK homes. But to realise that extraordinary potential means unleashing a new wave of public investment to help every household to make their home super energy efficient. This requires a wartime effort to build up an army of installers to insulate our homes and fit heat pumps and to ensure it is affordable for everyone.” If the UK wants to stop importing gas by next winter, that would be theoretically possible if every home were made energy efficient, according to calculations by Jan Rosenow, director of the Regulatory Assistance Project. He said: “We import about 150 terawatt-hours of gas for home heating every year. None of this would be needed if we insulated our homes and switched to heat pumps. “We could save more gas than we import for heating with existing technologies. What is needed is the government to step up its policies now to roll out insulation and deploy heat pumps as quickly as possible.” Behaviour change is also out of favour. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has urged people to turn down their thermostats by just 1C, from about 22C on average to 21C – which is still at the upper end of comfortable. But the government is reluctant to call on people to do anything that could be regarded as a sacrifice. Another area of concern is solar power. Offshore wind – Boris Johnson’s favourite form of renewable energy – will get a big boost in the strategy, but solar could lose out despite being the cheapest form of power in the UK and the fastest to get up and running, according to Chris Hewett, chief executive of the industry body Solar Energy UK. He said the UK could reach 54GW capacity for solar power by 2030 – about 17% of the UK’s electricity needs – with the right backing. Plans for some large solar farms have run into opposition, and solar panels are still expensive for most households, despite the removal of VAT on panels. Hewett said: “To unlock the full potential, we need to see the government setting an ambitious target and speeding up investment in the modernisation of our power networks. Supportive planning guidance and a formal recognition that land within a solar farm is frequently used for agriculture or to enhance biodiversity would also enable solar to play an important role in rural economies.” The Guardian understands there are no plans for the government to seek “wriggle room” on missing or delaying the UK’s carbon budgets or legally binding net zero target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/24/victoria-deserves-praise-for-promising-a-rapid-shift-from-coal-to-renewables-now-comes-the-hard-part","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-23T15:00:40Z","webTitle":"Victoria deserves praise for promising a rapid shift from coal to renewables.

Now comes the hard part","bodyText":"Transformations don’t come much bigger than that proposed in Victoria by Daniel Andrews last week. At the time of typing, about two-thirds of the electricity generated in Victoria comes from burning brown coal – basically mud – in old, sometimes failing, generators in the Latrobe Valley. It is the most polluting form of large-scale power generation. If the Andrews Labor government wins a third term at next month’s state election, which seems likely, it has promised to legislate a target that would mean shutting the remaining coal plants and replacing them with renewable energy and back-up generation by 2035 – and probably earlier. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup It would be one of the fastest transitions from a high-pollution power grid to a near zero-emissions system anywhere in the world. Just as significantly, the announcement by the Victorian premier and his climate and energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, accelerated the state’s emissions reduction plans with a promise of a 75-80% cut by 2035 (compared with 2005 levels). Victoria also has a new timeframe in which it is pledging to reach net zero emissions – 2045, rather than 2050. These commitments far outstrip what is promised nationally and could put the state within reach of what is required to play its part in attempting to limit global heating to 1.5C, as national leaders promised in Paris in 2015. There are important questions to be answered about how this will be achieved and what it will mean for households and businesses, but the goals should be acknowledged and applauded. This is the path governments are supposed to be setting. Part of the commitment is piggybacking on other announcements. The rise of cheap solar energy in the middle of the day has quickly been making ageing coal plants less viable, and the owners of two of Victoria’s remaining three generators – Yallourn and Loy Yang A – have already brought forward their closure dates to 2028 and 2035 respectively. It means the new bit in Andrews’ promise of 95% renewable energy by 2035 is really that the final plant, Loy Yang B, will shut by then, and not in 2047 as currently scheduled. This was apparently news to the owner, Alinta Energy, and its staff. But few people following the energy market believe it could have lasted as long as claimed anyway. The coal closures will do a big chunk of the heavy lifting in meeting Victoria’s more ambitious emissions reduction targets, but not all of it. The state will also need to do more in the next term to cut pollution in other areas – transport, industry, manufacturing and agriculture – than currently proposed. And it will also need to rapidly reduce homes and businesses’ reliance on gas for heating and cooking. Probably the least remarkable part of the Victorian promise is the section it chose to emphasise as the most important – the revival of the State Electricity Commission, which owned and ran the coal plants and poles and wires until then premier Jeff Kennett broke up and sold the system in the 1990s privatisation mania. Andrews and D’Ambrosio said this move would be “putting power back in the hands of Victorians”. One newspaper headline went further, saying the premier was “nationalising electricity”. The reality is noteworthy but a bit more anodyne, for a couple of reasons. What is proposed is a much smaller operation than the old SEC, and the government is not (at least at this stage) taking back control of the state’s existing power plants, poles and wires or retailers. The rebooted commission would instead be a new player in the market, effectively competing with private companies. The government would initially kick in $1bn as it starts the process of building 4.5GW of new renewable energy capacity. It expects further investment in SEC projects from “like-minded entities” such as industry super funds, but the government would retain a controlling stake. It is a significant commitment, but just a fraction of what the state will need to replace its coal plants. A major focus appears likely to be the establishment of an offshore wind energy industry in Gippsland. The government has set substantial targets for offshore wind generation, but turbines are more expensive when built kilometres off the coast than in a paddock, and are unlikely to be competitive initially without public support. Ignore the historic connotations of the SEC’s name and the Victorian commitment can be seen as just the latest in a wave of announcements, mostly by state governments, that have upended expert thinking of how the future electricity system would – or should – be rebuilt. The long-held idea that investment in the new clean grid would be driven by an overarching national policy, such as a carbon price, with governments otherwise mostly taking a hands-off approach seems increasingly quaint. It was killed off as the federal Coalition spent years blocking climate action, and isn’t coming back. Instead we have a messy, bottom-up approach in which governments working in the same general direction make their own commitments. Last month, the Queensland government said it would spend an extra $4bn on transforming the energy system, building at least 2,000 more wind turbines and 35m solar panels by 2030 to end its reliance on coal by about 2035. The New South Wales Coalition government is working on underwriting 12GW of new renewable energy and 2GW of energy storage and the treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, has said the state could be out of coal power by 2030. Everyone is choosing their own adventure. The difference since May is that the commonwealth and states are pulling in the same direction, with the Albanese government committing to accelerate the transition by committing billions in funding for new transmission connections, including the Marinus link between Tasmania and Victoria announced last week. It is a process that drives economists and energy market purists slightly mad, but a version of it was probably politically inevitable. Big change rarely comes smoothly, and premiers get votes for building things. Most people won’t care about these structural and ownership issues. The big questions the Victorian government and others will have to answer in the years ahead are more basic. Will the new system deliver the reliable, clean and affordable electricity promised? And will coal-reliant communities be supported through what will be a historically abrupt change? Reliability and emissions reduction goals will not be easy but are technically achievable. Cost is a separate question. New solar and wind are clearly the cheapest forms of energy available and a system that mostly runs on them should lower generation costs, but someone will have to pay for the vast amounts of new transmission being built. Expensive gas-fired power is likely to also push up prices for as long as it is used alongside an expanding storage network to fill gaps in supply. . The cost of a renewably powered electricity grid will be lower than a system that runs on coal or nuclear, but that does not mean it will necessarily be cheap – and consumers will not see that comparison. Governments should be careful what they promise."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-12T08:58:28Z","webTitle":"Breaking from China’s clean energy dominance ‘imperative’, US and Australia say after new climate tech deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","fields":{"headline":"Breaking from China’s clean energy dominance ‘imperative’, US and Australia say after new climate tech deal","bodyText":"The US and Australia have stressed the importance of breaking the near-complete reliance on China for zero emissions technology supplies while signing a new agreement that promises to accelerate the development of climate solutions. In a joint press conference in Sydney, the US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, and the Australian climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announced a “net zero technology acceleration partnership”, including an initial focus on long-duration energy storage and digitising power grids. They said the agreement was motivated in part by the need for a clean energy and critical mineral supply chain that did not depend as much on China, which is responsible for about 80% of solar energy technology manufacturing. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), it is expected to reach 95% by 2025. Granholm compared the risk of relying on China for clean technology to the west’s over-dependence on Russian fossil fuels – a mistake that sparked a global energy crisis after it invaded Ukraine. “I worry that China has big-footed a lot of the technology and supply chains that could make us vulnerable if we don’t develop our own supply chains,” she said. “From an energy security point of view, it is imperative that nations that share the same values develop our own supply chains, not just for the climate, but for our energy security. “We’ve seen what happens when we rely too much on one entity for our source of fuel, and we don’t want that to happen – so to diversify those energy sources and to link up with partners is part of our energy security.” Bowen agreed. “It’s good for our own economies and it’s good for our national security to have supply chains among ourselves, but also amongst friends and allies,” he said. The Australian minister said the partnership would “work to ensure critical minerals supply chains are secure and resilient”. That meant ramping up production, processing and manufacturing capacity, he said. “The partnership is a commitment to make climate change a centrepiece of our alliance with the US,” he said. Granholm said the switch to renewables could be “the greatest peace plan of all” as no country could be “held hostage” over its access to solar and wind resources. “They have not ever been weaponised, nor will they be,” she said. The Australia-US partnership included few details, but said the countries would also focus on supporting the integration of variable renewable energy and the development of hydrogen and carbon dioxide removal, including direct air capture technology. It was revealed on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum, co-hosted by the Australian government and the IEA. A common theme among speakers at the forum was the importance of focusing on renewable energy to address the crisis caused by Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, said the world was in the middle of “the first global energy crisis” due to its over-reliance on Russian oil, gas and coal. He said it might get worse as the northern hemisphere entered winter, but expressed hope it could lead to governments accelerating the shift towards renewable energy. Birol said about 40% of energy policies across the globe were introduced as a response to the oil crisis of the 1970s. He was “very hopeful” that the move to clean energy would be accelerated in a similar way now. He said solar power had grown dramatically across the globe because it was cheap, and that people who argued that renewable energy policy was in part to blame for the crisis were “absolutely wrong”. “Factually and, in my view, ethically, this is very wrong and misleading,” he said. The forum was opened by Anthony Albanese arguing Australia had rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partner”. The prime minister later told reporters it was time for Australia to “stop the nonsense”, “wake up” and work across the political divide to end the climate wars. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese said the latest round of catastrophic flooding made the case to get on with legislating a more ambitious policy. He said Labor would attempt to legislate its medium-term emissions target when parliament resumed, and if MPs or senators chose to vote against the legislation they would be “held accountable for it”. The prime minister said he was open to “sensible amendments” but not “game playing about figures plucked from the air”, and reiterated that Labor intended to stick with its target of a 43% emissions cut by 2030 compared with 2005 that it had modelled last year. The Greens and some independents have called for a higher target – ranging from 50% to 75% – based on advice from climate scientists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-15T10:28:41Z","webTitle":"Students’ solar-powered camper van turns heads on 1,800-mile road trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","fields":{"headline":"Students’ solar-powered camper van turns heads on 1,800-mile road trip","bodyText":"A team of students from the Netherlands are due to complete an 1,800-mile (3,000km) road trip across western Europe in a solar-powered camper van that they designed and built themselves. The Stella Vita is designed for two passengers and has a kitchen, sitting area, bed, shower and toilet. Using solar energy alone, the vehicle can cover up to 450 miles on a sunny day, reaching a top speed of 75mph, as well as powering all the inside amenities, a TV and a laptop. The vehicle has solar panels on the roof that can be expanded into a sun cover when parked. The van can also be charged through electric charging ports. “The technology is there, we just have to change the way we think,” said 20-year-old Tijn ter Horst, one of the Eindhoven University of Technology students onboard. “If 22 students can design and build a vehicle like this in one year, then I’m sure companies could as well.” The road trip, which started in Eindhoven on 19 September and was due to conclude in Tarifa, south-west Spain, on Friday, was part of the students’ self-set challenge to demonstrate the potential of solar energy. This is not the first solar-powered vehicle produced by the university, which first joined Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, a biennial Australian solar vehicle competition, in 2013. “This year there was no competition so the students set their own goals and challenges” said Dr Carlo van der Weijer, who has been the team’s coordinator. While previous Eindhoven teams won consecutive competitions with their five-seater designs, Van der Weijer believes there may be a bigger commercial appetite for the mobile home. Ecologically minded camping enthusiasts might be tempted by an electric van that is not reliant on charging points, which remain scarce in many places, he said. According to the students, the Stella Vita has been a hit on Spanish roads, attracting attention from other drivers, and Van der Weijer said the vehicle was also an option in less sun-exposed locations. “On a cloudy day the vehicle can still produce 60-70% of the energy,” he said. “And even if there is no sun at all, you still have an efficient, normal electric car that you can charge from a charging port.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/nov/21/hot-in-the-city-can-a-ban-on-dark-roofs-cool-sydney","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-20T19:00:35Z","webTitle":"Hot in the city: can a ban on dark roofs cool Sydney?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/21/hot-in-the-city-can-a-ban-on-dark-roofs-cool-sydney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/nov/21/hot-in-the-city-can-a-ban-on-dark-roofs-cool-sydney","fields":{"headline":"Hot in the city: can a ban on dark roofs cool Sydney?","bodyText":"The New South Wales government announced this week it would move to ban dark roofs as part of environmental planning rules to help the state achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The planning minister, Rob Stokes, said on Wednesday that ditching dark roofing “would have an enormous impact on the urban heat island effect”, citing University of NSW research suggesting ambient temperatures in Sydney could drop by up to 2.4C as a result. The announcement has been welcomed by experts. Prof Andy Pitman, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes at UNSW, said: “The recognition that this is a useful strategy for minimising vulnerability to climate change is terrific.” What are the effects of roofing on housing and city temperature? What is the urban heat island effect? “The urban heat island effect is a phenomenon that affects a lot of big cities around the world,” says Dr Gloria Pignatta of the UNSW’s City Futures Research Centre. The effect refers to urban centres being significantly warmer than rural areas – estimates vary between 1C and 13C on average. It occurs as a result of land modification; built-up areas have less green cover and more hard surfaces which absorb and radiate heat. The difference in temperature between cities and rural areas is often greater at night, and previous research has suggested the density and colour of building materials are significant contributors. Pitman says the effect doesn’t occur all year round, but depends on weather patterns. What colour of roof is best if you want a cooler house? In western Sydney, a light-coloured roof could reduce temperatures inside the home by 4C on average and up to 10C during a heatwave compared with darker roofing, according to research commissioned by the federal government. Materials that are able to reflect a high portion of incoming solar energy, rather than absorbing it, make for cooler roofs. This reflectance is a property known as albedo. Generally speaking, dark-coloured surfaces have a lower albedo, absorbing more solar radiation than brighter surfaces. “Every colour has a different behaviour in terms of reflection of light,” Pignatta says. Lighter shades within the same colour are preferable. “It is not coincidental that a lot of Mediterranean countries have white roofs,” Pitman says. But cooler roofing isn’t just a matter of black and white. “It doesn’t so much matter what the colour is – it matters what the reflectivity is,” Pitman says. There are “cool” roofing materials that don’t look visibly different from traditional options but result in significantly lower temperatures as a result of specific components incorporated into their surfaces. Pignatta cites terracotta tiles as an example. “You can have natural red clay tiles and ‘cool’ red clay tiles”, which appear to be the same hue. “Natural red clay tiles, for example, can reach up to 60 to 70C on a clear sunny day,” she says. The second option results in a temperature 10C or more cooler. “They don’t work in the visible spectrum … but they are able to reflect solar radiation in the infrared spectrum.” Cooler options exist for surfaces of most colours, Pignatta says, adding it is also useful for asphalt on roads, given the visual impracticality of driving on reflective white streets. Whether an area is built up is also a factor to consider. “If you have a mix of high-rise buildings and low-rise buildings and you have cool roofs on the low rises, you can create an impact on the buildings that are close to them because of the solar reflection,” Pignatta says. Does roofing material matter? When it comes to cooling, it’s not only how well the material reflects sunlight that matters, but also how well it radiates heat – a property known as thermal emissivity. “In summer, what you’re looking for is a surface that doesn’t absorb sunlight but radiates heat really well,” Pitman says. Metals have a low thermal emissivity, and hence do not readily release any heat they have absorbed. “They are not good materials to be used in the urban environment, especially if you consider large surfaces … even if they are white,” Pignatta says. Other materials such as clay tile, gravel or membrane roofing are preferable because they all have “generally quite high thermal emissivity”, she says. Green roofs are also an option to consider if light-coloured vegetation is chosen, as such plants have a higher albedo, Pignatta says. They can have an evaporative cooling effect if well watered, Pitman says. “Green roofs need to be sufficiently moist to cool themselves,” he says, warning this can be difficult to achieve during drought and extreme heat events. What effects do cool roofs have in winter? In the winter, solar energy absorbed by a roof can add warmth to a building. In some locations, houses with cool roofs may require more energy for heating – an effect known as the winter heating penalty. “In western Sydney, the balance has got to be [that] you don’t want to absorb the heat,” Pitman says. “But that’s not the case everywhere.” The effect is also complicated by how well a building is insulated. “Australian buildings are amongst the worst in the world,” Pitman says. “We are absolutely, unambiguously crap at building houses for optimal energy efficiency.” There are potential solutions in development, Pignatta says, such as thermochromic materials – those that change colour depending on temperature. “So in winter they become more dark, and they absorb more heat, and during summer they become more light.” What about black solar panels? Even though they are dark, one of the advantages of solar panels is that they are designed to convert solar energy into electricity, Pitman says. “The roof isn’t heating up, it’s using the energy to create electricity.” Excessively high temperatures can reduce the efficiency of solar panels, Pignatta says, and may be more efficient when installed on light roofs or those made of reflective materials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/20/heavy-industries-in-australias-regions-could-cut-emissions-by-80-and-create-a-jobs-bonanza-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-19T17:30:15Z","webTitle":"Heavy industries in Australia’s regions could cut emissions by 80% and create a jobs bonanza, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/heavy-industries-in-australias-regions-could-cut-emissions-by-80-and-create-a-jobs-bonanza-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/heavy-industries-in-australias-regions-could-cut-emissions-by-80-and-create-a-jobs-bonanza-report-says","fields":{"headline":"Heavy industries in Australia’s regions could cut emissions by 80% and create a jobs bonanza, report says","bodyText":"The regional powerhouses of Australia’s industrial economy could slash their greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% and become centres for multibillion-dollar investments in renewable energy, according to a report backed by some of the country’s biggest companies. Bringing down emissions from producing iron, steel, aluminium, chemicals and liquefied natural gas is seen as one of the most challenging parts of Australia’s efforts to reach net zero. But the report from the Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative (ETI), a partnership between heavy industry and experts working on decarbonisation, says the transition is possible using a range of known technologies, and would bring a jobs bonanza. By introducing a range of technologies along the supply chain, most of them proven and some already commercially available, the report says greenhouse gas emissions could be cut annually by 69.5m tonnes of CO2-equivalent – about 14% of Australia’s current total emissions. Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, an ETI partner, said the steps industries needed to take to get to net zero were “increasingly clear”. “While their costs and difficulties should not be underestimated, the current energy affordability crisis highlights the unsustainable cost of the status quo,” he said. Much of the effort to decarbonise would come from the supply of new renewable energy at a massive scale. Between 68.3 and 125.9 terawatt hours of additional renewable energy would be needed. In 2021, Australia generated 265 TWh of electricity, with a quarter of that coming from renewable sources. According to the report, building the renewable energy infrastructure, including energy storage, and creating a green hydrogen industry to serve the regions could generate between 178,000 and 372,000 jobs, with investment of between $50bn and $100bn. Industry leaders among the 18 partners in ETI said a high level of collaboration and coordination would be needed to achieve the emissions cuts in the Pilbara, Hunter, Illawarra and Gladstone regions. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of Climateworks, one of the conveners of ETI, said: “This will require an unprecedented transformation of the energy system.” Emissions in the regions accounted for 16% of Australia’s total carbon footprint, with the largest being the Pilbara in Western Australia – a centre of iron ore and LNG production. In the Pilbara, the report says much of the emissions come from the LNG industry. Managing methane leaks, recovering lost heat and electrifying the process of cooling gas down to liquid form could save about 13Mt of CO2e a year, but up to 7.6Mt would need to be captured and stored using carbon capture and storage technology – an approach which has struggled to be viable despite billions in investments. The second highest emitting region, Gladstone in Queensland, could also save emissions on its LNG export industry. Large emissions cuts could also be made by electrifying processes in the aluminium industry, where other technologies were also in development to save energy. This month, Rio Tinto put out a formal call for wind and solar energy projects before 2030 to power its aluminium operations in Queensland. In the New South Wales Hunter region, heavy industry includes ammonia production and aluminium smelting. Using renewable energy and hydrogen produced from renewables could save up to 9Mt a year there. Christopher Davis is chief financial officer at Orica, a major supplier of explosives, chemicals and services to the mining sector in the Hunter Valley, Gladstone and Pilbara. He said the company understood “the potential economic and environmental opportunities presented by regional decarbonisation”. The company had announced several decarbonisation projects, and he said “we must continue to work collectively to ensure our industry, and Australia, remains competitive in a low-carbon economy”. Other members of the ETI include Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals, BP Australia, BlueScope Steel and the government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The government’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency part-funded the report. The ETI, run by Climateworks and the consultancy Climate-KIC, worked on the report for two years with its industry partners, CSIRO, BloombergNEF and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Simon McKeon, the chair of ETI and chancellor of Monash University, said Australia could stay competitive in a global economy that was decarbonising. “But this will require coordinated efforts across industry, governments and communities and also the finance and energy sectors,” he said. “It will also need the alignment of policy, regulations and programs to create clear goals and investment confidence.” The Guardian has approached the energy minister, Chris Bowen, for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2022/apr/15/do-we-need-to-stop-flying-to-save-the-planet-we-ask-an-expert","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-15T14:00:32Z","webTitle":"Do we need to stop flying to save the planet?

We ask an expert","bodyText":"Aviation is the most climate-intensive form of transport, so for the sake of the planet, will we have to quit flying for ever? I asked Professor Pericles Pilidis from the Centre for Propulsion Engineering at Cranfield University whether the promise of hydrogen planes could keep our holiday hopes alive. Thanks for joining me on Zoom, Pericles. Is that a plane you have as your background? Yes! It’s a hydrogen aeroplane. Is that the one that had its successful maiden voyage in 2020, but then crashed in 2021? No, this one doesn’t exist yet but is based on detailed analysis. It looks just like a regular passenger plane. How do hydrogen planes work? They look the same but inside they’ll be very different. Currently, planes use hydrocarbon fuel. When it burns, carbon dioxide is produced, which increases global warming. But with hydrogen, you are only producing water. About 3% of the carbon humans produce comes from aviation. By humans, though, we’re really talking about people in the west. Yes, but there are global benefits to aviation. I’ve just come back from a holiday in Barbados where roughly half the economy is tourism. If people stop flying, it won’t affect Britons much, but it will have a horrific economic impact in Barbados. Don’t get me wrong, I love travelling! I think there’s a reason people say someone is “worldly” as a compliment – it’s wonderful to experience other cultures. So how long until hydrogen can give us guilt-free wings? I’d say 10 years. The problem is that hydrogen costs three to four times the price of conventional fuels. Plus, airports will have to change, because transporting hydrogen is not easy, and aircraft designs will change, too. We don’t have the rules around safety qualifications for these planes – that needs to be developed. It’ll all cost billions, and we need to do it all without using fossil fuels. There’s no point using oil to produce hydrogen. Yet all these things can be done. We’ve been making aircraft safe for 120 years: we can make hydrogen aircraft safe in 10. We just need a lot of money. Wow! I’m guessing these costs will be passed down to the consumer. I’d expect some to be, yes. But wouldn’t that be temporary? A century ago only the wealthiest could have cars. Now everyone does. New technology usually becomes cheaper If the political will is there, yes. This is somewhere national investments should come in. The UK government is spending £100bn on HS2. That’s the sort of money we need. It sounds like a lot but it’s not dissimilar to what the government’s already doing. I won’t hold my breath for such political will. They can’t even nationalise the trains even though it makes financial sense and would be popular. I’m not advocating nationalisation, but supporting private industry, like with wind and solar energy. Grants brought the cost of solar panels down, so it’s now a few per cent of what it used to be. But it’s still private companies making this happen. The difference with aerospace is that instead of buying from Germany or China like we do with solar panels, we can actually produce the engines. That’s British jobs being created. Sounds quite good, doesn’t it? It’s like having your cake and eating it, but before you can have your cake or eat it, you need to buy it first."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/02/australian-company-secures-700000-deal-for-carbon-capture-and-storage-machine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-01T20:00:29Z","webTitle":"Australian company secures $700,000 deal for carbon capture and storage machine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/02/australian-company-secures-700000-deal-for-carbon-capture-and-storage-machine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/02/australian-company-secures-700000-deal-for-carbon-capture-and-storage-machine","fields":{"headline":"Australian company secures $700,000 deal for carbon capture and storage machine","bodyText":"A solar-powered and tent-sized Australian prototype machine that can suck CO2 from the air has secured a $700,000 contract to capture and store carbon. The deal, part of a project backed by corporates including the owners of Google and Facebook, is thought to be the first time an Australian company has secured a deal to remove CO2 using direct air capture (DAC) technology. AspiraDAC will deploy about 180 of the machines, developed and made in Australia, to capture and store 500 tonnes of CO2 by 2027 at an agreed US$1,000 (AU$1,469) a tonne. In April several major corporates, including the owners of Facebook and Google, announced a new venture called Frontier that would commit US$925m (AU$1,359) to projects that pull CO2 from the air and then store it. In the first major purchase under the venture, technology company Stripe, one of the partners in Frontier, announced this week it was spending US$2.4m (AU$3.5m) on six direct air capture projects around the world, including AspiraDAC. The executive director of AspiraDAC, Julian Turecek, said up to 180 modules would be needed to fulfil the contract and these would cover an area of less than half a hectare. He said the company had not confirmed the location or the geological storage for the site, but confirmed depleted oil and gas reservoirs at Moomba, in South Australia, were being considered. “We really think this is a launch moment for direct air capture in Australia,” Turecek said. “This is the start of what could be a significant industry.” He said the carbon removal off-take agreement with Frontier was likely to be the first of several that AspiraDAC would deliver. Southern Green Gas has developed the machines in partnership with the University of Sydney, and will build and deliver them to AspiraDAC. The business development manager and co-founder at Southern Green Gas, Brett Cooper, believed the contract to deliver the emissions reductions using DAC was a first in Australia. Each module can capture two tonnes of CO2 a year. Cooper said: “This is a quintessential Australian solution because not everyone has the land area that also has the intensity of solar energy that we have.” The amount of CO2 reduction under the new contract is tiny, but Cooper said the deal is a major step for the industry which he believes has big growth potential in Australia. At the core of the Australian machine is a sponge-like material developed at the University of Sydney that holds on to CO2 molecules as air passes through it. Fans draw air into canisters containing the sponges, and then heat is used to extract the pure CO2 that can be pumped and stored underground. All power comes from the solar panels that cover the units like an A-frame tent. The Sydney team of scientists and student researchers won a $250,000 prize last year to support the development of the material from tech billionaire Elon Musk’s US$100m (AU$147m) X-Prize that is trying to establish large-scale carbon removal projects. Prof Deanna D’Alessandro, who supervises the Sydney team, said: “Carbon drawdown is going to be absolutely essential. This is directly addressing the problem and that is really powerful.” “The students are seeing the materials they’re making having a real-world impact on carbon drawdown.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Turecek said: “Nature has designed the perfect air capture machine and that’s a tree. But DAC is doing that mechanically and once we can do that at scale we can control that CO2 removal and make it permanent.” An International Energy Agency plan for the world’s economies to reach net zero emissions by 2050 says direct air capture technologies will need to deliver more than 85m tonnes of CO2 capture by 2030. Currently, the agency says the technology can deliver just 10,000 tonnes around the world. In May, the US government announced a US$3.5bn program to build four major hubs for direct air capture projects. The world’s biggest direct air capture plant is in Iceland and the company behind the plant, Climeworks, announced this week it was expanding capacity to 36,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. Dr Paul Feron, a scientist working on carbon capture technologies at CSIRO, said the agency was working on three different DAC technologies that he hoped would be commercialised within a decade. “We have got to the point in terms of the CO2 levels in the atmosphere that we need to have an ‘all of the above’ approach,” he said. “We need to be good at using as little energy as we can and we need to replace our fossil fuels with renewable energy as quickly as we can. But that most likely won’t be enough and we need to manage the carbon that is already delivering climate change. That’s why there is enormous interest in DAC. “We need to plant as many trees as we can, but it’s a reflection on the severity of the problem that we now have to look at [DAC] as well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/21/mike-cannon-brookes-dismisses-pms-suggestion-that-coal-plants-should-run-to-end-of-scheduled-life","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-21T07:02:12Z","webTitle":"Mike Cannon-Brookes dismisses PM’s suggestion that coal plants should run to end of scheduled life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/mike-cannon-brookes-dismisses-pms-suggestion-that-coal-plants-should-run-to-end-of-scheduled-life","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/21/mike-cannon-brookes-dismisses-pms-suggestion-that-coal-plants-should-run-to-end-of-scheduled-life","fields":{"headline":"Mike Cannon-Brookes dismisses PM’s suggestion that coal plants should run to end of scheduled life","bodyText":"Mike Cannon-Brookes has rejected a suggestion by Scott Morrison that a plan to shut AGL Energy’s coal power plants early would push up electricity bills, with the tech billionaire arguing fossil fuel generators are increasingly unreliable and new solar and wind lowers prices for consumers. Morrison on Monday responded to a proposed joint takeover of AGL by Cannon-Brookes and the Canadian asset management giant Brookfield. The prime minister said the government wanted coal plants to run until the end of their scheduled operating life and he was “very committed to sweating those assets” to ensure a reliable electricity supply at affordable prices. Two Liberal moderates, however, have warmly welcomed the bid for AGL, with backbencher Jason Falinksi stating “this is a real positive”. AGL rejected the initial bid by Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes’s Grok Ventures to buy the company for about $8bn, shut its coal plants by 2030, and build or contract for about eight gigawatts of new renewable energy and storage to replace it. But the consortium immediately pledged to continue to work on a takeover plan in shareholders’ interests. Asked about Morrison’s comments, Cannon-Brookes said the existing listed closure dates for Australia’s coal plants were not realistic, did not reflect “the economic life of those assets” and the consortium would spend up to $20bn on top of the sale price to replace AGL’s coal fleet “at a much lower price and a much higher reliability”. “Let’s face it – those coal plants aren’t exactly winning awards for reliability,” Cannon-Brookes, the co-creator of the software company Atlassian and one of Australia’s richest people, told Guardian Australia. “We’re trying to do this to provide lower power prices to the customers of AGL that increasingly want clean power as well because they have their own decarbonisation goals.” Cannon-Brookes said Australians were enjoying the lowest power prices in eight years, as the government had consistently pointed out, due to a significant increase of renewable energy into the power grid. He said his consortium was doing what the Morrison government had demanded when it called on the private market to replace coal plants before they closed so the commonwealth did not have to intervene further in the electricity market. “The private market is stepping up and providing that replacement capacity exactly as asked, and on an earlier schedule, which will result in lower power prices for all of those customers,” he said. “I assume he [Morrison] will be very happy with that.” Morrison’s dismissal of the proposal was backed more forcefully by the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who said “affordable, deliverable, 24/7, no-questions-asked power” was essential to making Australia “strong”. Joyce contended on Monday that wind and solar energy did not meet those criteria. Joyce said if there was a problem down the line associated with replacing coal-fired power generation with renewable generation, Cannon-Brookes would not have to deal with it. “Poor people will pay for that problem,” he said. Cannon-Brooks said the takeover plan could create 10,000 construction jobs and would eliminate all emissions from Australia’s biggest corporate polluter by 2035. AGL is responsible for more than 8% of the national carbon footprint. Asked what role he would play if the bid was successful, Cannon-Brookes said he was currently focused on “trying to explain to shareholders why we believe this is the best option” and to show to everyone involved there were “alternate paths to this transformation”. He said he “deeply believed” decarbonisation was Australia’s greatest economic opportunity. “I’m happy to help in any which way. Obviously, my wife [Annie] and I and my family office have put a significant amount of capital into this, and this is not a philanthropic exercise. We believe that the economics stack up here and we can use our capital, which we’re very fortunate to have, in a catalytic way to help trigger and create that change,” he said. Two Liberal moderates warmly welcomed the bid for AGL. Falinksi said on Monday: “I think this is the market working.” “The bid has been rejected so [the consortium] will have to revise their numbers. But what Mike Cannon-Brookes is saying makes sense. He can deliver electricity for lower prices using renewables than using legacy coal assets,” the Mackellar MP said. “As long as he can make the numbers stack up around dispatchable power and reliability, which – with the cost of battery power declining and with pumped hydro coming online – then he can probably do that. This makes sense and he’s probably getting the assets on the cheap, so well done.” Fellow New South Wales moderate Andrew Bragg said the bid suggested investors now had the right policy signals to drive the energy transition. “The energy transition is going to be very expensive and it will be heavily reliant on foreign capital, which is why sending the right signals to foreign capital is important,” the senator said. “I think [the proposal] is good. It is good to see foreign and domestic capital seeking to propel the transition”. AGL recently brought forward the nominated closure date for two of its coal plants, Bayswater in NSW and Loy Yang A in Victoria, to no later than 2033 and 2045 respectively. The closure of its Liddell coal generator, also in NSW, had already been accelerated to next year. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AGL said it had rejected the unsolicited preliminary offer of $7.50 a share, which offered a 4.7% premium on Friday’s closing price of $7.16. Including AGL’s debt, the offer was in the range of $8bn. AGL said it was not in the best interest of shareholders. The consortium partners argued it was as it would avoid a “potentially value destructive” demerger under which AGL proposes to break off its coal plants into a separate entity to be called Accel Energy. It said the offer represented about a 20% premium on the company’s three-month volume-weighted average price of $6.28 a share. The owners of Australia’s coal-fired generators are under increasing pressure, both economic due to the rise of cheap solar energy in the national grid, and from activist shareholders to act in line with the Paris climate agreement. On Thursday, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025 rather than 2032. AGL’s share price finished Monday up 10.6% to $7.92. It had earlier topped $8 for the first time since mid-July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-latest-ipcc-report-a-fast-track-to-climate-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-04T17:49:51Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on the latest IPCC report: a fast track to climate disaster | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-latest-ipcc-report-a-fast-track-to-climate-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/04/the-guardian-view-on-the-latest-ipcc-report-a-fast-track-to-climate-disaster","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on the latest IPCC report: a fast track to climate disaster","bodyText":"The continued heating of the planet means that this year will probably be one of this century’s coolest. As the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes clear, current climate pledges by governments would not keep global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels – the target promised in the 2015 Paris agreement. Instead greenhouse gas emissions are rising. During the past decade, on average annually they were at their highest levels in human history. The world is on a pathway to temperature increases of more than 3C in the coming decades. This would make large parts of the world too hot to work in. Severe harvest failures will become common. Disappearing ice caps would submerge major cities. Governments have hitherto been far too hesitant to take on vested interests and are all too ready to protect historic investments in fossil fuels. This cannot go on. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, was right to say that the world “was on a fast track to climate disaster”. Nations and corporations, he candidly said, are not just turning a blind eye to a planetary disaster but adding fuel to the flames. There is very little time left to implement policies that promote the needed greener lifestyle choices and cheaper renewable solutions that would generate jobs, energy security and price stability. To achieve 1.5C, the world must reduce annual CO2 emissions by about 50% by 2030, and reach net zero by 2050, while reducing methane emissions a third by 2030 and almost halving them by 2050. This will need deep cuts in fossil fuel use. The IPCC says the case is unanswerable for widespread electrification – especially crucial for enabling the decarbonisation of road transport, industry, mining and manufacturing – powered by renewable sources. The UN’s scientists argue that energy efficiency and conservation are central to achieving a greener, safer future. There are some success stories: at least 18 countries have sustained production-based greenhouse gas and consumption-based carbon dioxide emission reductions for longer than a decade. Much of the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere was released by rich countries that burned coal, oil and gas to industrialise more than a century ago. The UN panel said about 40% of emissions since then came from Europe and North America. Only about 12% can be attributed to east Asia, including China. It is in the wealthiest 10% of households, which contribute between a third and 45% of climate-changing fumes, where change will have to happen fastest. There are some quick policy wins. Better crop management has an immediate payback. Solar energy and wind energy improve faster and are adopted quicker than nuclear or carbon capture technologies. Diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy are associated with lower greenhouse gas emissions and are increasingly popular. It is likely that global temperatures will “overshoot” the 1.5C pledged by the Paris agreement. Even under one of the least bad scenarios, the IPCC says that temporarily exceeding this limit by a tiny 0.2C before dropping back down to about 1.4C by the century’s end could still unleash irreversible impacts such as dead coral reefs. The pandemic was an opportunity to make the rapid shift required away from fossil fuels and was missed by most governments. Russia’s immoral war in Ukraine offers another chance for nations concerned about overreliance on hydrocarbons to do the right thing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T15:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘No miracles needed’: Prof Mark Jacobson on how wind, sun and water can power the world","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/23/no-miracles-needed-prof-mark-jacobson-on-how-wind-sun-and-water-can-power-the-world","fields":{"headline":"‘No miracles needed’: Prof Mark Jacobson on how wind, sun and water can power the world","bodyText":"“Combustion is the problem – when you’re continuing to burn something, that’s not solving the problem,” says Prof Mark Jacobson. The Stanford University academic has a compelling pitch: the world can rapidly get 100% of its energy from renewable sources with, as the title of his new book says, “no miracles needed”. Wind, water and solar can provide plentiful and cheap power, he argues, ending the carbon emissions driving the climate crisis, slashing deadly air pollution and ensuring energy security. Carbon capture and storage, biofuels, new nuclear and other technologies are expensive wastes of time, he argues. “Bill Gates said we have to put a lot of money into miracle technologies,” Jacobson says. “But we don’t – we have the technologies that we need. We have wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, electric cars. We have batteries, heat pumps, energy efficiency. We have 95% of the technologies right now that we need to solve the problem.” The missing 5% is for long-distance aircraft and ships, he says, for which hydrogen-powered fuel cells can be developed. Jacobson’s claim is a big one. He is not just talking about a shift to 100% renewable electricity, but all energy – and fossil fuels still provide about 80% of that today. Jacobson has scores of academic papers to his name and his work has been influential in policies passed by cities, states and countries around the world targeting 100% green power. He is also controversial, not least for pursuing a $10m lawsuit against researchers who claimed his work was flawed, which he later dropped. The evidence that proves he is right is collected in the new book, Jacobson says. Not only is a 100% renewables-powered world possible, it also promises much lower energy bills, he says. The first reason for that is that electrified vehicles, heating and industrial processes are far more efficient than those powered by fossil fuels, where much of the energy is wasted as heat. Add in better-insulated buildings and ending the drilling and mining for the fossil fuels that consume about 11% of all energy, and you get 56% less energy use on average from 2035 to 2050, Jacobson says. Wind and solar energy are cheaper too, so average bills will fall 63%, he says. Jacobson divides approaches to the energy transition into two camps: “One says we should just try everything – they’re the ‘all-of-the-above camp’ – and keep investing huge amounts of money in technologies that may or may not be available to work in 10 years. But 10 years is too late.” Carbon emissions must fall by 45% by 2030, scientists agree, to keep on track for no more than 1.5C of global heating. His camp takes a different approach, Jacobson says: “Let’s focus on what we have and deploy as fast as possible. And we will improve those technologies just by deploying, bringing better solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and so on. Some people just don’t realise the speed that we need to solve these problems, especially air pollution – 7 million people die every year. We can’t wait.” However, there are major barriers to a rapid rollout of a 100% renewable energy system, he says: “The No 1 barrier is that most people are not aware that it’s possible. My job is trying to educate the public about it. If people are actually comfortable that it’s possible to do, then they might actually do it.” He adds: “The policy of all-of-the-above is also a big barrier to a transition. In the US, for example, in the recent [climate legislation], a lot of money was spent on carbon capture, small modular nuclear reactors, biofuels, blue hydrogen. These are all what I consider almost useless, or very low-use, technologies in terms of solving the problems. And yet, a lot of money is spent on them. Why? Because there are big lobby groups.” Another barrier is funding the upfront costs of renewable energy in poorer countries – rich countries need to help, he says. Jacobson believes progress towards a 100% renewable energy system can be fast: “The goal is 80% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. But, ideally, if we can get 80% by 2030, we should get 100% by 2035 to 2040.” Solving the stability problem A big concern about a world overwhelmingly reliant on electricity is maintaining the stability of grids powered by renewables. Where there are large amounts of hydropower from dams this is relatively easy – at least 10 countries already have 100% renewable grids. But in other places reliance on intermittent wind and solar is more challenging. The answer, says Jacobson, is energy storage, managing the demand, and connecting up renewables over wider areas to enable greater continuity of supply. Storage can be batteries, pumped hydro, flywheels, compressed air and lowering and raising heavy weights. Jacobson thinks batteries will win, but says others could contribute if they can compete on cost. New research indicates that electric vehicle batteries alone could provide the short-term storage needed by global grids as early as 2030. Jacobson also advocates heat storage for some buildings: “Storing heat in boreholes, aquifers or water pits is dirt cheap, excuse the pun. It’s less than $1 a kilowatt hour of storage.” Managing demand, by varying electricity prices with demand, is already growing fast, he says. When the renewables supply exceeds the demand, the electricity should be used to produce green hydrogen, he says, to power the fuel cells needed by energy-intensive users. “Managing the grid is just an optimisation problem, not a rocket science problem,” he says. “I don’t want to say there’s zero problems, but usually these challenges are ironed out over time just by experience.” Another criticism of a major renewables rollout is the mining required for the metals used. But Jacobson says such a rollout would in fact hugely reduce extraction from the earth by ending fossil fuel exploitation: “The total amount of mining that’s going to be needed for wind, water, solar, compared to [the] fossil fuel system, is much less than 1% in terms of the mass of materials.” Jacobson is scathing about many nascent technologies being promoted as climate solutions. “Carbon capture and storage is solely designed to keep the fossil fuel industry in business,” he says. Only some of the CO2 is captured and buried, he says, and deadly air pollution continues unabated. Blue hydrogen, produced from fossil gas with some CO2 then captured and buried, is far inferior to green hydrogen produced directly from renewable electricity, Jacobson says: “Blue hydrogen is just really convoluted.” New nuclear plants are too slow to build and too expensive compared with wind and solar, in Jacobson’s view: “You end up waiting 15 to 20 years longer, for a seven to eight times higher electricity price – it just makes no sense. Even if they improve [build times], say to 12 years, that’s still way too long. We have cheaper, faster, safer technologies. Why waste time?” Biofuels are also dismissed by Jacobson: “The biofuels push was really not helpful. They hold constant, or increase, air pollution and they use a huge amount of land.” He is a little more measured when it comes to direct air capture (DAC): technologies that can suck CO2 from the air for burial. It has no role today, he says, with spending on renewables far more cost effective in cutting emissions. But even when fossil fuel burning ends, many scientists have concluded that CO2 will have to be drawn from the air to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. At that point, Jacobson says, the costs of DAC should be compared with other ways to sequester carbon and limit global heating, such as reforestation and cutting emissions of other more powerful greenhouse gases, including methane from livestock and nitrous oxide from fertilisers. Supporters and critics Jacobson’s book has attracted support from some experts. Prof Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania, says the book “presents a comprehensive and detailed blueprint for the options we have right now to address the climate crisis”. Mann has said those insisting we lack the tools to decarbonise the economy today are wrong. Prof Claudia Kemfert, at the German Institute for Economic Research, who has advised the German government and European Commission, says: “[The book] shows impressively that numerous crises can be killed with one stone, without us having to wait for miracles.” But others are critical of a focus on only wind, water and solar. Prof Ken Caldeira, at the Carnegie Institution for Science in the US, says: “Having a broader set [of technologies] in the toolbox only makes it easier to solve problems. We will only use the tools that it makes sense to use in any particular circumstance, but maintaining and expanding our options is a good thing. “The key question is not what is physically possible in an ideal world, but what is practically possible in the world as we know it,” he says. Prof Rob Gross, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre, is somewhere in the middle of the debate: “I broadly agree that we can largely use existing technologies, but we will need to put those to new applications, such as using bulk stores of hydrogen in order to provide interseasonal storage.” “Moonshot efforts to invent entirely new things are almost certainly a distraction,” he adds. “Jacobson is right that the principal need is to deploy what we have. He is wrong to the extent he makes this sound easy.” Asked about the controversy around his work, Jacobson says: “Usually, the people against us don’t like the fact that we don’t include their technologies.” On the lawsuit over a critical paper, he says: “That was not a question of a scientific disagreement.” He claims it was an attempt to protect his reputation. He dropped the case in 2018. Jacobson remains optimistic: “There is a technical and economic solution to the climate, air pollution and energy security problems we face. But we do have major challenges in trying to implement that solution. The challenges are getting the political willpower to focus on a narrow set of solutions that we can implement quickly. The vested interests are very much a problem because they are pushing this ‘all of the above’ approach.” No Miracles Needed: How Today’s Technology Can Save Our Climate and Clean Our Air by Mark Z Jacobson is published by Cambridge University Press on 2 February 2023, £11.99."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/12/uk-replace-fossil-gas-blue-hydrogen-backfire-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-12T07:13:55Z","webTitle":"UK plan to replace fossil gas with blue hydrogen ‘may backfire’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/12/uk-replace-fossil-gas-blue-hydrogen-backfire-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/12/uk-replace-fossil-gas-blue-hydrogen-backfire-emissions","fields":{"headline":"UK plan to replace fossil gas with blue hydrogen ‘may backfire’","bodyText":"The government’s plan to replace fossil gas with “blue” hydrogen to help meet its climate targets could backfire after US academics found that it may lead to more emissions than using gas. In some cases blue hydrogen, which is made from fossil gas, could be up to 20% worse for the climate than using gas in homes and heavy industry, owing to the emissions that escape when gas is extracted from the ground and split to produce hydrogen. The process leaves a byproduct of carbon dioxide and methane, which fossil fuel companies plan to trap using carbon capture technology. However, even the most advanced schemes cannot capture all the emissions, leaving some to enter the atmosphere and contribute to global heating. Professors from Cornell and Stanford universities calculated that these “fugitive” emissions from producing hydrogen could eclipse those associated with extracting and burning gas when multiplied by the amount of gas required to make an equivalent amount of energy from hydrogen. Robert Howarth, a Cornell University professor and co-author of the study, said the research was the first to be published in a peer-reviewed journal to lay bare the “significant lifecycle emissions intensity of blue hydrogen”. The paper, which will be published in Energy Science and Engineering, warned that blue hydrogen may be “a distraction” or “something that may delay needed action to truly decarbonise the global energy economy”. The researchers recommended a focus on green hydrogen, which is made using renewable electricity to extract hydrogen from water, leaving only oxygen as a byproduct. “This is a warning signal to governments that the only ‘clean’ hydrogen they should invest public funds in is truly net zero, green hydrogen made from wind and solar energy,” Howarth said. A spokesperson for the UK government said hydrogen would be “essential for meeting our legally binding commitment to eliminating the UK’s contribution to climate change by 2050” and promised further details in the government’s forthcoming hydrogen strategy, which is expected next month. “Independent reports, including that from the Climate Change Committee, show that a combination of blue and green hydrogen is consistent with reaching net zero but alongside the strategy, we will consult on a new UK standard for low-carbon hydrogen production to ensure the technologies we support make a real contribution to our goals,” the spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jul/12/australia-sees-climate-crisis-as-a-national-security-issue-defence-minister-tells-us","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-12T04:58:30Z","webTitle":"Australia sees climate crisis as a national security issue, defence minister tells US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jul/12/australia-sees-climate-crisis-as-a-national-security-issue-defence-minister-tells-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jul/12/australia-sees-climate-crisis-as-a-national-security-issue-defence-minister-tells-us","fields":{"headline":"Australia sees climate crisis as a national security issue, defence minister tells US","bodyText":"Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, has warned of the use of “force or coercion” in the South China Sea and “intensification of major power competition”, references to China’s rising power in the Indo-Pacific. Marles made the comments in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies on his visit to the US, committing Australia to closer cooperation with the country, higher defence spending and to address the climate crisis in part as a national security issue. It coincided with a separate announcement that the Australian and US governments would work together to accelerate zero emissions technology, including long duration energy storage, integration of renewable energy into power grids and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen – who announced the partnership in Sydney on Tuesday with the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm – said it was a commitment “to make climate change a centrepiece” of the Australia-US alliance. Marles’s US visit comes as Australia is attempting to reset relations with China, after Labor’s election in May. After several years of diplomatic freeze, China has recommenced ministerial meetings with Australia. Marles met his Chinese counterpart in Singapore in June and the foreign minister, Penny Wong, met hers, Wang Yi, last week. That produced warnings from China to treat it as a partner, not a threat or opponent, to which the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded he would act in the national interest not according to Chinese demands. In Washington DC, Marles said the Australia-US alliance faced “a military buildup occurring at a rate unseen since world war two; the development and deployment of new weapons … expanding cyber and grey zone capabilities … and the intensification of major power competition”. These “compel an even greater Australian focus on the Indo-Pacific” to preserve “an inclusive regional order founded on rules agreed by all, not the coercive capabilities of a few”, he said. “In particular we worry about use of force or coercion to advance territorial claims, as is occurring in the South China Sea, and its implications for the any number of places in the Indo-Pacific where borders or sovereignty is disputed.” Marles argued the US alliance “affords Australia capability, technology, and intelligence advantages we could not acquire or develop on our own”. He praised the US president, Joe Biden, for rejecting Russia’s “brutal attempt to subjugate a sovereign state” in Ukraine and seeking to prevent a world “where only great powers are truly sovereign and where the choice of smaller states is to be either a vassal or an enemy”. “Only by ensuring such tactics fail can we deter their future employment, in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, or elsewhere,” Marles said. Avoiding direct references to China, Marles said the US-Australia alliance will need “to operate in a much more challenging strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific” and “to contribute to a more effective balance of military power aimed at avoiding a catastrophic failure of deterrence”. Marles promised Australia “will take greater responsibility for its own security” including investing to “increase the range and lethality of the Australian defence force so that it is able to hold potential adversary forces [at bay]”. In particular, the Aukus pact to acquire nuclear submarines would make Australia safer and “a more potent and capable partner”, he said. Marles said that “no one and no country is immune” from the threat of climate change, promising to make it a pillar of the US alliance because it is a “national security issue”. He cited the “intense vulnerability” felt by Australia’s Pacific neighbours, which have labelled it an “existential threat”. Since Solomon Islands announced a security pact with China, Australia has intensified outreach to Pacific nations, urging them to look to regional partners such as Australia for security solutions first. Marles said Australia would “not take our status for granted” because Pacific countries “have choices about their partners”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The Pacific has been clear in saying that geopolitical competition is of lesser concern to them than the threat of rising sea levels, economic insecurity, and transnational crime,” he said. “Australia respects and understands this position. And we are listening. “And while we will not ask our partners to pick a side, I am confident that an Australia which collaborates and invests in shared priorities with the Pacific is an Australia which will be the natural partner of choice for the Pacific.” Albanese told an international energy forum in Sydney on Tuesday that Australia had rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partner” on climate action. He then left to attend the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, where the climate crisis is a major focus. Bowen and Granholm used the forum, hosted by the Australian government and the International Energy Agency, to announce a “net zero technology acceleration partnership” between the countries. Both suggested it should ultimately make the two countries less reliant on Chinese clean energy supply chains. The Chinese are responsible for about 80% of the global manufacturing supply chain for solar energy. Granholm said the two countries would “work together to unlock critical advances in long-duration storage, grid integration, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and critical minerals and materials”. Bowen said the partnership was “a huge milestone in ramping up the US and Australia’s shared commitment to ambitious climate action and energy security”. “We will work to ensure critical minerals supply chains are secure and resilient– ramping up production, processing and manufacturing capacity,” he said. “These technologies and supply chains will be critical to the rollout of renewable energy in Australia and the United States.” The net zero partnership announcement included a memorandum of understanding between Australia’s CSIRO and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to work together develop clean energy technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/20/energy-wake-up-call-rural-power-hacks-keeping-the-farm-gates-open","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-19T17:30:13Z","webTitle":"Energy ‘wake-up call’: rural power hacks keeping the farm gates open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/energy-wake-up-call-rural-power-hacks-keeping-the-farm-gates-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/energy-wake-up-call-rural-power-hacks-keeping-the-farm-gates-open","fields":{"headline":"Energy ‘wake-up call’: rural power hacks keeping the farm gates open","bodyText":"When dairy farmer Paul Mumford milks his herd outside Yarram in Victoria’s South Gippsland early in the morning and late in the afternoon, he’s keenly aware it coincides with peak energy use for the rest of the population. “That doesn’t sit extremely well with the natural flow of the energy use from the grid, because those times are when children are going to school, households are waking up and using energy before and after work,” he says. The president of United Dairyfarmers of Victoria, Mumford says energy is one of the biggest costs for dairy farmers. It’s just not an option to milk 200 cows by hand, and milking the cows twice a day is imperative for his animals’ welfare. A year ago the property lost power for six days in two separate wind storms. “I survived OK because my farm has onsite power generation which connects to my tractor,” he told Guardian Australia. The turning spline on Mumford’s diesel tractor creates a power take-off that turns a generator and creates energy for his dairy shed. However, he says the power outage caught his neighbours out, two of whom had to bring their herds to Mumford’s dairy operation to be milked. He says there’s been an expectation that the electricity would always be there, but for his area the storms were a “big wake-up call”. “Because it’s mandatory to milk cows regularly twice a day, [the storms] left a whole lot of farmers vulnerable.” Mumford says farmers are generally looking at reducing the risk of power outages and shortages to their business, and on-farm power generation is a big part of that. ‘An expensive endeavour’ While energy costs are hitting agricultural industries hard, their vulnerability to energy supply has seen farmers develop unique hacks – and rediscover old ones – to keep the power going without the grid. Ash Salardini, the chief economist at the National Farmers’ Federation, says that dairy, intensive horticulture and irrigation are the industries most exposed to wholesale market prices, which have gone up anywhere between 100% to 140%. Salardini says while irrigation is better placed to manage their electricity use as they can pump water at different times, horticulture and dairy are more vulnerable because they need to regulate their produce at certain temperatures. “Imagine how much electricity your fridge uses. Now imagine you have to cool down 300,000 litres of milk. That’s an expensive endeavour,” Salardini says. He says for intensive horticulture’s climate-controlled greenhouses, “that’s the equivalent of running a reverse-cycle conditioner in an area that might be the size of 50 football fields.” According to Salardini, before the current energy crisis, a typical dairy farmer would have been paying $150,000 in electricity costs a year, but the annual cost would now be up to $250,000. Whether farmers feel the effects of the price spikes immediately depends on when their contract is due to be renewed. ‘A confluence of factors’ Kevin Coady, a wheat farmer outside Dubbo in the New South Wales Orana region, still has a petrol-driven generator he says was more common for farmers to have 20 years ago when blackouts were more frequent. “Nearly everyone on a farm had a back-up generator back then,” he says. However, he says the blackouts don’t occur as often anymore and generators are not as common as they used to be. Yet Salardini says regional areas have often been more liable to energy shortages and farmers can lose an entire day or week’s worth of work if they don’t have refrigeration. According to him, more farmers are turning to on-farm sources of renewable energy including solar, batteries and even biodigesters, which turn waste to energy. Moxey dairy farm at Gooloogong, west of Cowra in the NSW central west, moved to address rising electricity costs back in 2018 by using the gas from cow manure to generate 100% of its power needs. Salardini says farmers are some of the biggest users of photovoltaic energy. Justin Jarrett, the co-owner of See Saw Wines in the central tablelands’ Orange region powers his winery during the day using solar energy. He doesn’t currently have storage capacity for the energy, but tells Guardian Australia that battery storage is the operation’s next step. Salardini says that energy efficiency measures also need to be considered alongside power generation. Stuart Crossthwaite, a dairy farmer in the Kiewa Valley in north-east Victoria, conducted an energy audit, finding that 40% of his dairy’s energy use is to heat hot water for cleaning, 40% to cool the milk and 20% to run equipment. Crossthwaite realised that a heat exchanger method would allow him to use the heat from the milk to warm the water that cleans his dairy. As much as farmers try to keep electricity costs at bay, Salardini says the rising cost of energy is just one factor that is pushing farm gate prices up. Other cost pressures include fuel and freight price hikes and the impact of workforce and workforce shortages. “That’s why we are seeing food price inflation in the supermarkets,” he says. “It’s a confluence of factors, but electricity price is definitely one of them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jun/11/new-york-has-a-chance-to-generate-all-its-electricity-from-clean-energy-by-2030","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-11T10:25:16Z","webTitle":"New York has a chance to generate all its electricity from clean energy by 2030 | Ross Barkan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/11/new-york-has-a-chance-to-generate-all-its-electricity-from-clean-energy-by-2030","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/11/new-york-has-a-chance-to-generate-all-its-electricity-from-clean-energy-by-2030","fields":{"headline":"New York has a chance to generate all its electricity from clean energy by 2030","bodyText":"It has been, for progressives in New York, a trying year. Major pieces of legislation that were supposed to reshape the state to safeguard the working class have stalled out. A bill to create a statewide single-payer healthcare system is no closer to passage than it was several years ago. A push to guarantee new protections for tenants as rents soar in New York City could not find the votes. And ambitious legislation to combat climate that did have the votes to go through the state legislature was halted by the speaker of the state assembly. Unlike in Washington, Democrats in New York have no one to blame but themselves. The party holds supermajorities in both chambers, the state senate and state assembly. Progressives have grown their clout in each. A handful of socialists occupy seats as well. The trouble is that institutional forces – those aligned with the real estate and fossil fuel industries in particular – have plenty of clout, too. The left is stronger, in numbers, than it’s ever been, but the state’s power brokers are centrists or those most hesitant to challenge entrenched power structures. This is true in other Democrat-run states too, but it’s been sobering in New York where progressives have nurtured such high hopes for change. The left, of course, has gotten much further in New York in the last few years than it had in the previous decades. In 2019, Democrats took control of the state senate and immediately passed a large number of bills that had been bottled up for years. Legislation to help tenants, reduce the use of cash bail, and protect voting rights and women’s health all easily passed the body and were signed into law. In 2020, the pandemic hit and ambitious legislating was put on hold. The 2021 session was more of the same. This year offered hope. The Build Public Renewables Act, or BPRA, would mandate that the state’s public power provider, the New York Power Authority (NYPA), generate all of its electricity from clean energy by 2030 and establish a process through which it can build and own renewables while closing down polluting infrastructure. The state itself could build out wind and solar energy. With its high bond rating, the NYPA could easily finance projects. Passage of the bill would have profound national implications. New York would be a leader in the fight against the climate crisis and inspire other states with Democratic governors to follow their lead. With Republicans poised to retake Congress, state-level action is crucial. Independent power producers, who fiercely oppose the BPRA, currently build out new power generation infrastructure beyond NYPA. Solar industry trade associations fought the bill bitterly. They have made inroads in the legislature. In turn, a strange thing happened: the BPRA amassed the votes to pass the state assembly – it had already passed the senate – but was never brought up for a vote before the end of the legislative session in early June. The speaker, Carl Heastie, claimed the votes were not there because, apparently, the more than 80 lawmakers who backed the bill did not inform him personally they would vote that way. Advocates and supporters, however, were certain they had the votes. At first glance, it would appear Heastie had a point, since it is theoretically true the speaker cannot know who will vote for what if he has not been told about the intentions of each lawmaker. But that’s not how lawmaking really works in Albany, the state capital. There are hundreds of bills and the speaker cannot personally hear from all legislators before one is put on the floor for a vote. Rather, most Democrats vote reflexively with the speaker unless the bill has an organized constituency in their districts that opposed it. There is no popular, grassroots outcry against the BPRA. Most New Yorkers don’t know what it is. Why did Heastie claim the votes were not there? Some moderate Democrats are wary of passing any far-reaching bills in an election year. Organized labor had opposed earlier versions of the bill, but the New York AFL-CIO had agreed to stay neutral this time. Governor Kathy Hochul may not support the BPRA either, but she would be hard-pressed to not sign the bill if it reached her desk, especially if New York’s large environmental movement and progressive infrastructure mobilized for it. The good news is that the legislation may not be dead for 2022. Though lawmakers depart Albany in June and typically don’t reconvene until the new year to pass bills, Heastie requested the chairs of the assembly’s committees on energy, corporations and environmental conservation convene a hearing on 28 July. A hearing may mean a special session – a chance to get the BPRA to Hochul’s desk before 2023. If the Democrats in Albany act as they should, New Yorkers will begin to get the government they deserve. With climate cataclysms here, the political system can’t afford any more delays. Ross Barkan is a journalist based in New York City.

Victorian households will be able to access rebates for both solar panels and a solar hot water system under the widening of the program announced on Tuesday. Households can now only take part in the solar panels program or the hot water rebate, but not both. Meanwhile, an additional 50,000 businesses across the state will become eligible for solar panel rebates and an interest-free loan to slash up-front installation costs. When the household changes come into effect in mid-May, almost 190,000 Victorians who previously accessed a $1,400 rebate to install solar panels will be able to access an additional 50% rebate – of up to $1,000 – to have solar hot water or a high-efficiency electric heat pump system installed. When the 10-year scheme was announced, the government said the policy aimed to cut the state’s carbon emissions by almost 4m tonnes and would result in household solar generating 12.5% of the state’s 40% target for renewable energy by 2025. Alison Reeve, the deputy program director for energy and climate change at the Grattan Institute, said a large part of the state’s transition to a low-emissions future required a phasing out of its reliance on gas. “Switching people from gas water heating to solar heating is a positive step on that journey,” she told Guardian Australia. “In Victoria you’ve got a lot of houses with gas heaters installed and it takes time for that change to kick through.” The discovery of natural gas in the 1960s in Bass Strait has caused it to become the state’s dominant residential fuel source, particularly for heating homes in winter. The department of industry and science’s latest energy statistics, released last year, show Victoria’s gas use from the residential sector is 14.8% – almost double the nationwide figure of 7.9%. When the solar homes scheme launched in 2018, the Andrews government estimated a solar hot water system could save a household up to $400 each year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Clean Energy Council’s director of distributed energy, Darren Gladman, said the exact dollar figure of savings would depend on a household’s hot water consumption. Gladman said an advantage of using solar energy to both generate electricity and heat water was that it allowed you to store the benefits within the water system. “There are some [solar] hot water systems that allow you to keep water hot,” Gladman said. He said a well-insulated system would mean electricity would not be needed at night to heat the water “when energy is more expensive”. “You’re using the store of hot water to allow you to heat up the hot water when the electricity is cheap and use it later in the day or in the morning or evening.” Gladman stressed that rising gas prices meant relying on gas for hot water would become more financially inefficient in the future. The state’s energy and environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the expansion of the scheme would help more Victorians save money on their energy bills, support clean energy jobs and help the state reach its target of a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. “There’s eight out of 10 Victorian households that are now eligible to get both the solar panels rebate and the solar hot water rebate,” she said. “The difference now is that rather than just having the choice of one or the other, they can actually get both, meaning that they will actually now be saving more money.” But the Greens’ environment spokesperson, Ellen Sandell, said Victoria needed to do more to end its reliance on gas. “We very much welcome this announcement, but it also makes no sense that at the same time the Victorian Labor government still supports laws which force new home developments to connect to expensive gas,” she said. “We don’t need gas – what we need is a proper plan to stopping supporting multinational gas corporations, electrify our homes and power them with 100% renewable energy.” The government will also expand its $47.5m solar for business program from Friday to help employers cut their energy costs. Businesses with up to 50 employees will be able to access a rebate of up to $3,500 to install solar panels – an increase from the current threshold of 20 staff. Businesses will also become eligible for interest-free loans of between $1,000 and $5,000 to reduce upfront costs for solar installation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/04/thursday-briefing-how-parties-will-fare-in-the-local-elections-and-where-they-go-from-here","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-04T05:53:46Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: How parties will fare at the local elections – and where they go from here","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/04/thursday-briefing-how-parties-will-fare-in-the-local-elections-and-where-they-go-from-here","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/04/thursday-briefing-how-parties-will-fare-in-the-local-elections-and-where-they-go-from-here","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: How parties will fare at the local elections – and where they go from here","bodyText":"Good morning. It’s local election day in England. As well as potholes, sewage and council tax, this vote is a crucial measure of how the leading parties are doing ahead of the next general election – and, as sure as eggs is eggs, they’re all saying how terrible things look for them today so that they can celebrate incredible success tomorrow. In truth, the most likely result is a rough day for the Tories and some gains for Labour and the Lib Dems – but there is an awful lot to learn from just how big the swing turns out to be. Here’s a guide to the key results to look out for – and today’s newsletter is your one-stop shop to help make sense of it all. If there’s an election where you are, don’t forget to vote, and definitely don’t forget your ID. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Russia | Volodymyr Zelenskiy has denied Russian claims that Ukraine was involved in a drone attack on the Kremlin that was intended to kill the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Here’s what we know about the incident so far. Hours later, air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv for the fourth time in seven days, with explosions heard in the southern port city of Odesa. Slavery | Some of Britain’s most elite schools benefited from slavery through substantial donations and endowments worth the equivalent of tens of millions of pounds today, research has found. Eton College, Christ’s Hospital school and Liverpool’s Blue Coat grammar are among 29 schools with significant links. Serbia | A 14-year-old boy opened fire in a school in Belgrade, killing eight children and a school security guard and injuring a further six pupils as well as his teacher. Police said he used two of his father’s guns for the shooting and may have been plotting the attack for a month. Coronation | The Metropolitan police has been accused of using the coronation to stage the biggest live facial recognition operation in British history. The force said on Wednesday it intended to use the controversial technology, which scans faces and matches them against a list of people police want for alleged crimes and could identify convicted terrorists mingling in the crowds. Health | A new Alzheimer’s drug slowed cognitive decline by 35%, according to late-stage trial results, raising the prospect of a new effective treatment for the disease. The drug slowed progression of the condition by 35% to 36% compared with a placebo, with one expert saying “this could be the beginning of the end of Alzheimer’s disease.” In depth: Set the bar low – but go for a ‘knockout blow’ *** Reading the results | The most useful comparison is 2019 While there have been several rounds of local elections since, to make sense of this set of results you need to compare them to 2019, the last time the same set of councils were contested. That was “a ‘plague on both your houses’ cycle”, Rob Ford wrote in an Observer analysis on Sunday, where Labour and Tories each lost ground amid frustration at the Brexit impasse. But it was particularly ugly for Theresa May’s Tories, who lost 1,300 seats. Since Labour have recovered strongly in the polls since then while the Tories have regressed, that starting point should favour the opposition. An Opinium poll for the Observer at the weekend showed Labour’s lead over the Tories at 18 points, a four-point increase on a fortnight earlier. But national polling doesn’t necessarily translate to local results, and everyone would be surprised to see that sort of margin as the results come in. One benchmark to keep in mind: local elections experts Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher told Pippa Crerar and Peter Walker that a 6% swing from Tories to Labour would mean the Conservatives losing 1,000 seats, and Labour gaining 700. *** Expectations | Both parties are trying to set the bar low for success That 1,000 seat figure has been mentioned by Conservatives seeking to frame the results ahead of time. Thrasher told Sky News: “If they can keep those losses down to around 500 to 700, they will feel that Labour isn’t really hurting them a great deal … if they can keep losses down below 500, they will probably believe that they’ve had a reasonably good night.” Labour, meanwhile, suggests that a gain of 400 seats would represent good progress. On Monday, polling expert John Curtice told the BBC that Labour needed to gain about 500 seats to show that the party has a good chance of victory in the next general election. Meanwhile, Green co-leader Adrian Ramsay suggested at the party’s campaign launch that success would be winning 100 extra seats. It gained 200 in 2019. And Reform UK is contesting a lot of seats in leave-supporting areas. Success for them would be giving the Tories a serious worry on their right flank. Ford has an excellent guide to what a good or bad night would look like for each party. *** Conservatives | A measure of Sunak’s ability to turn things round Rishi Sunak has stopped the bleeding – but there are concerns among some Tories that the party has become too optimistic about his ability to reverse the decline. One Sunak supporter told Peter Walker and Jessica Elgot: “I think colleagues are very much still in the denial stage where they are so relieved that the days of Liz [Truss] are over that they are able to blank out how badly we are going to lose.” One measure of the Conservatives’ pessimism: when journalists sought to learn when Rishi Sunak would be launching his party’s campaign, they were told by Conservative headquarters that it had already happened – during a brief visit to the Black Country to which only local media was invited. Meanwhile, several letter writers to the Guardian have noted that Conservative candidates in their seats are not mentioning their party affiliations. In Milton Keynes, “none of their leaflets mention the party, and they’re on the nomination list as ‘Local Conservatives’”, writes Paul Norris. “This is a clear attempt at distancing themselves from the governing party.” While local issues are important, in most places it is national stories that are front of mind for most voters – and that will not help the party in government. Robyn Vinter’s dispatch from High Peak in Derbyshire, which has often switched between Labour and the Conservatives, emphasises that point. Asked how he will vote, Nigel Sowerbutt said: “Not Tory. Have you seen the state of the country?” *** Labour | Starmer needs a “knockout blow” Starmer (pictured above) knows that his party’s strong position is a trap when it comes to interpreting these results: it means that anything short of triumph might look like defeat. But it is fair to interpret their results through the prism of the mountain to climb to win the next election – with a bigger swing needed than Tony Blair managed in 1997. That means, Rob Ford wrote, that “nothing less than a knockout blow will do”. Whatever the message from the centre, local candidates are less guarded. In Plymouth, Jamie Grierson reported, Labour campaigners “sense that this election is theirs to lose”. Canvassers tell him they are optimistic they can win the 12 out of 19 seats in contention that they need to take control of the council: “Last year, people were chasing Labour from their doorsteps,” says Tudor Evans, the party’s local leader. “This year, they are chasing them but to catch up and ask them for a poster to put in their window.” *** Lib Dems | Hopes of picking off Tories in the “blue wall” Most of the areas where the third party hopes to pick up seats are traditional Conservative heartlands where even the disillusioned are wary of Labour. But they have real hopes of making the kind of showing that could leave big Conservative names like Michael Gove and Dominic Raab anxious about their prospects in the general election. Polly Toynbee went canvassing with the Liberal Democrats in Michael Gove’s Surrey Heath constituency, where the majority of Tory councillors are not standing again: “Running for the hills,” a Lib Dem tells her. “Before, there was no point in following the fortunes of forlorn opposition candidates trying to knock down impenetrable home-county blue walls,” she writes. “There is now.” *** Tactical voting | Denied by the centre, but happening organically Voters who hope that Labour, the Lib Dems and Greens will form the fabled “progressive alliance” might be cheered by places like Bracknell Forest, where, Michael Savage wrote in the Observer, only one of the three parties is standing in 12 of the 15 seats up for grabs. “To believe that this arrangement is the result of some bizarre coincidence stretches credulity,” Michael wrote. Local party figures are unwilling to acknowledge as much on the record, but one tells him that “It’s really a story about how to make the best of it in a borough which is heavily skewed [towards the Tories]. Focus your attention on where you’re going to win.” Labour and Lib Dem HQs fear that an explicit tactical alliance could be offputting for some of their target voters. But John Curtice told Polly Toynbee: “The last time I saw tactical voting on this scale was before the 1997 election when voters just wanted to get the Conservatives out.” Toynbee adds: “It needs no secret pacts, just each party reserving all energy for its own winnables.” *** Voter ID | People may stay away – but it’s impossible to know how many Today’s vote is also the first mass use of voter ID in the UK outside of Northern Ireland – and there are serious concerns about the impact. The number of voters without the necessary ID is thought to be about 2 million; by 23 April, only 50,000 had applied for a special voter certificate that would be acceptable in lieu of ID. Gaby Hinsliff notes: “Those at greatest risk of disenfranchisement are … disproportionately likely to be unemployed, disabled or lacking educational qualifications, and those who have never voted before.” The problem of voter impersonation is almost unknown in Britain. Official data released last month showed just seven allegations of “personation” at polling stations in 2022, with none leading to police action. While the government has promised to review the system to see how many are disenfranchised under the new rules, last week a minister refused to say whether the number of voters turned away because they lack ID will be recorded. That suggests that the true extent of the problem may be very hard to gauge.

It signals a major step towards moving utilities out of private hands to become publicly owned. The Build Public Renewables Act compels the state’s public power provider to generate all of its electricity from clean energy by 2030, as well as allowing the public utilities to build and own renewables while phasing out fossil fuels. This law is a result of years of grassroots campaigning by local climate and environmental organisers. It’s not only good for the environment and local residents, it also ensures the creation of union jobs for the renewable projects, guaranteeing pay-rate protection, offering retraining and making sure that new positions are filled with workers who have lost or would be losing employment in the non-renewable energy sector.

Ministers have decided to authorise contracts for about 12GW of new renewable energy generation, to start construction this year, with much of it likely to come on stream before next autumn. However, the renewable energy industry estimates that about 17.4GW of projects have cleared planning permission and are “shovel-ready”. The shortfall in what the government is prepared to allow, through an auctioning system, means many of these potential projects are likely not to be built this year, and consumers will be deprived of the energy savings on bills that come from renewable energy. Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels, which have soared in price during the Ukraine war. Onshore and offshore wind and solar power all command about £40 per megawatt hour on the market today, but gas-fired power generation costs about £140 per megawatt hour. Under the system of “contracts for difference”, renewable energy generators bid for contracts to produce power, but the government can set an overall limit on how much capacity it wants in the auctions, and can set limits on how much cash it is prepared to provide as incentives. On Friday, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy laid out plans for an auction, to take place on 5-6 July, allowing for 5GW of capacity to be competed for by onshore wind and solar, neither of which can take more than 3.5GW in total. The government was also expected to set a cap on offshore wind, of about 7GW of new capacity. Instead it set no cap but limited the incentive “pot” to £200m. Industry sources said that pot would amount to a de facto cap of about 7GW on new offshore wind capacity. At about 12GW, this is the biggest auction so far, but still falls far below what the industry says is possible: according to industry estimates, there are about 8.5GW of offshore windfarms that could come on stream, along with about 3.9GW of onshore wind and about 5GW of solar farms. Many groups, including unions, the CBI employers’ organisation, the National Farmers’ Union, and green and consumer groups, had called for the government to increase the amount of renewable energy generation. Research shows that renewable energy brings down energy bills for consumers: if the 12GW the government is planning had been available last winter, energy bills would have been about £100 lower for the average household. Labour said energy billpayers would suffer. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “Once again, families are paying higher energy bills as a direct result of Conservative failure. The government is intentionally blocking access to the quickest, cheapest, cleanest forms of new power, stopping enough onshore wind and solar energy to power 3m homes. These are shovel-ready projects, with planning permission, that could be generating energy for our country at a quarter of the price of gas by the end of next year.” He added: “This terrible decision, bowing to the concerns of a few Tory backbenchers, damages investment, forfeits good jobs across the country, keeps bills high, and continues our exposure to Putin’s gas.” Doug Parr, a policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “We have a global climate emergency which requires low carbon power, we have a cost of living crisis which requires cheap power, and we have a war in Ukraine that requires domestic power. By an amazing stroke of luck, renewables are low-carbon, cheap, domestic and can be deployed faster than the alternatives. Capacity limits on cheap renewables are outdated thinking.” The new contracts for difference auction follows a pattern of slowing growth in renewable energy in the UK, according to analysis conducted by the Liberal Democrats on government data. Total renewable capacity grew by 3.4% to 49.44GW in the year to December 2021, compared with an average annual rise of about 18% over the previous 11 years. Wera Hobhouse, the climate and energy spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “Under the Conservatives, the UK renewables industry has been neglected again and again. The country has been left overly reliant on gas, worsening the cost of living crisis which is hitting households hard. These projects would reduce energy bills but it needs the right political leadership from the Conservatives.” She added: “There is no question that the Conservative government must drastically increase renewable energy capacity and this starts with a much more ambitious round of auctions for clean energy projects. Recently [in the local elections], British people sent a message that the Conservatives have let them down. The lack of ambition in renewables is just another example that will leave millions vulnerable to ever-soaring energy bills.” A government spokesperson said: “The Covid pandemic and its aftermath understandably slowed infrastructure deployment across the country. That said, nearly 40% of our electricity now comes from renewable sources, and since 2010 we have delivered a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid. The contracts for difference scheme has been hugely successful in boosting UK energy supply and reducing our dependence on volatile fossil fuels, with competitive auctions reducing the price of offshore wind by around 65% since 2015.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/05/light-or-blight-anger-rises-at-plan-for-britains-biggest-solar-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-05T17:00:29Z","webTitle":"Light … or blight?

Anger rises at plan for Britain’s biggest solar farm","bodyText":"A proposed new £600m solar farm in eastern England – covering an area eight times bigger than Hyde Park in central London – faces opposition over claims it would be a “blight” on the countryside. The scheme, which would provide power for up to 100,000 homes, will cover nearly 2,800 acres near Newmarket, more than 10 times bigger than any scheme built to date in Britain. It is one of more than 900 solar farms in the planning pipeline to help provide green energy. Campaigners say the Sunnica energy farm, which will span several villages in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, will change the unique character of a vast area of countryside shaped by farming and horseracing. Suffolk county council said last week it would not support the scheme in its current form. Richard Rout, deputy council leader and cabinet member for finance and environment, said: “We recognise that renewable energy is a key part of delivering energy security but it can’t come at any cost or to the detriment of Suffolk or the environment.” John James, 74, who owns Brookside Stud, near Chippenham, Cambridgeshire, said: “The solar panels will blight several villages and take farmland out of production.” He was particularly concerned over the fire safety of the vast batteries that would be housed near his stud in containers up to six metres high. Finlay Colville, head of research at Solar Media, a business intelligence and digital media firm, said there are now about 910 possible solar farm projects in the pipeline in the UK, with numbers increasing by about a third in 2021. More than 300 have already submitted planning applications or have already been approved. Colville said some of the largest projects might not be delivered but there were also many smaller sites that were being approved. “Solar farms can be built quickly, and it’s a quick win for firms and public bodies which want to have more renewable energy,” he said. While many councils support renewable energy schemes, there are concerns about some large-scale projects, including the Cottam solar project on the Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire border, covering 2,800 acres; the Mallard Pass solar farm in Lincolnshire and Rutland, covering 2,175 acres; and the Gate Burton energy park, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, covering 1,690 acres. Sir Edward Leigh, the Conservative MP for Gainsborough, has raised concern about such large-scale schemes. He told parliament last month: “Is it not time we looked at how we can stop these companies bypassing local planning and secure proper community gain and the protection of agriculture, and ensure that there are buffer zones around villages?” Ministers say, where possible, large schemes should use previously developed land to help preserve farmland. Many smaller schemes arise from the demand for green energy in the public sector. Work started in November on a 30-acre scheme to help power the New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton, while the Ministry of Justice has proposed a two-acre installation next to Whatton prison, near Bingham in Nottinghamshire. Sunnica said its scheme would make a “significant contribution” to help the UK meet its net-zero targets by 2050. It said it would respond to any concerns raised over its scheme in the planning process, that it took the safety of its battery storage system very seriously and thta it had a package of proposed safety measures to mitigate the risk of a fire. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the need to preserve greenfield land while protecting the environment as we work to generate more cheap, clean power in the UK. Solar energy developments, including these ones, are subject to strict planning controls to protect local communities and the environment. This includes the requirement to conduct environmental impact assessments and public consultations on planning applications.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/11/blackrock-urged-to-delay-debt-repayments-from-crisis-torn-zambia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-11T18:04:06Z","webTitle":"BlackRock urged to delay debt repayments from crisis-torn Zambia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/blackrock-urged-to-delay-debt-repayments-from-crisis-torn-zambia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/11/blackrock-urged-to-delay-debt-repayments-from-crisis-torn-zambia","fields":{"headline":"BlackRock urged to delay debt repayments from crisis-torn Zambia","bodyText":"BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager, has come under pressure to delay demands for debt interest payments from Zambia to prevent the crisis-hit African country’s finances from spiralling out of control. Anti-poverty campaigners said BlackRock, which manages $10tn (£7.68tn) of assets, was among the private sector lenders that had refused to reduce the interest rate or delay payments on Zambian bonds, unlike governments and international agencies that hold the country’s debts. The charity Jubilee Debt Campaign said it estimated the asset manager, which holds $220m of Zambian sovereign bonds, could generate $180m for clients, mostly in its index-linked exchange-traded funds, if the debts were paid in full. “This would represent a 110% profit on what we estimate BlackRock paid for the debt,” the charity said. Zambia, which has cut health and social care spending by a fifth in the past two years to balance its budget, has seen its debts soar in recent years to fund infrastructure projects, many to help the country supplement drought-affected hydropower plants. Solar energy projects have made the country almost self-sufficient in electricity, but the high cost of borrowing and the Covid crisis has crippled the country’s finances. Further loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have been tied to commitments to end fuel subsidies to households and businesses, pushing the inflation rate above 20% last year. Of Zambia’s external debt, 46% is owed to private lenders, 22% to China, 8% to other governments and 18% to multilateral institutions. China is among the government lenders to agree a longer debt repayment schedule that private lenders, including banks, have so far resisted, the Jubilee Debt campaign said. The Zambian government has already defaulted on loans from commercial lenders and could default on further loans, risking it becoming a pariah on international debt markets. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, the charity estimates Zambia’s bonds have had an average face value of 59 cents on the dollar, and the average interest rate on its bonds is 8.1%. The southern African country applied for a new G20 debt relief scheme at the start of 2021 but has not yet had any debt cancelled. Tim Jones, the Jubilee Debt Campaign’s head of policy, said BlackRock had bought Zambian bonds at rock-bottom prices when it was clear the country was already in trouble. He said: “It is unfair for BlackRock and other lenders to make massive profits out of Zambia’s debt crisis. If BlackRock refuses to cancel Zambia’s debt, then the UK and other G20 countries should support Zambia to stay in default on BlackRock.” Isaac Mwaipopo, a member of the Zambia Civil Society Debt Alliance, said: “Zambia’s debt crisis is preventing people getting access to healthcare, education and other social services. “We urgently need all of Zambia’s lenders, including BlackRock, to agree to cancel debt so we can recover from the Covid pandemic and the economic crisis we face. Loans were given at high interest rates, and have been trading at low prices, so it is only fair lenders agree significant debt cancellation, rather than making mass profit out of the Zambian people.” Negotiations on the debt restructuring are due to take place later this month. G20 finance ministers are scheduled to meet on 20 April, during the IMF spring meetings, to discuss the progress of the debt relief scheme, known as the common framework. Zambia, Chad and Ethiopia applied last year for debt relief under the common framework, which the IMF said has yet to be agreed, partly because it requires private creditors to participate “on comparable terms to overcome collective action challenges and ensure fair burden sharing”. A BlackRock spokesperson disputed the charity’s estimates of potential gains, saying there had not been any significant increases in the firm’s holdings of Zambian debt since September 2020 “other than as required to ensure the funds remain near or at the benchmark”. They added: “The money invested in bonds by asset managers is predominantly the money of ordinary people saving for retirement. None of the money is the asset manager’s. Any decision on restructuring these bonds must therefore be balanced against the duty of the asset manager to protect the savings of the millions of people whose money was lent to these countries, while at the same time recognising the difficult circumstances they are facing from the challenges posed by Covid-19. The spokesperson said the firm had “no discretion” to sell bonds held in index funds, “so it is in our clients’ interests for these countries to thrive and succeed”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/27/melting-point-could-cloud-brightening-slow-the-thawing-of-the-arctic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T10:00:03Z","webTitle":"Melting point: could ‘cloud brightening’ slow the thawing of the Arctic?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/27/melting-point-could-cloud-brightening-slow-the-thawing-of-the-arctic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/27/melting-point-could-cloud-brightening-slow-the-thawing-of-the-arctic","fields":{"headline":"Melting point: could ‘cloud brightening’ slow the thawing of the Arctic?","bodyText":"Like the apocryphal frog that doesn’t notice the rising water temperature until it’s boiled alive, we as a global society are still struggling to recognise that anthropic global warming is hastening us towards irreversible environmental and ecological catastrophe. While there is consensus among climate scientists about the urgency of the situation, and widespread political acknowledgment that the use of carbon fuels must be reduced, targets have not been met and as the UK’s Cop26 president, Alok Sharma, said, the lack of progress at this month’s Cop27 demonstrates the 1.5C limit is on “life support” and there is growing evidence that we are further along the road to a tipping point than previously thought. So advanced is this process that some scientists are beginning to argue that merely cutting carbon is not enough and an emergency measure involving what is known as geoengineering is called for. There have been a number of plans suggested, some more outlandish than others. They range from building giant mirrors in space to reflect away sunlight to painting the roofs of buildings white to help counteract heatwaves in cities. One particular area of concern is the Arctic, which, according to the latest research by Norwegian scientists, is warming at four times the speed of the rest of the planet. The more it warms, the more ice cover it loses, which in turn leads to further heating, creating a so-called positive feedback loop (although, paradoxically, the effect is entirely negative). Two suggestions for geoengineering the poles’ climate have drawn serious attention and have been the subject of theoretical modelling. The most popular and perhaps advanced of these is what is known as stratospheric aerosol injection, in which sulphur dioxide would be released into the stratosphere to gather around the poles. The idea is that the aerosols will have a similar effect to the ash clouds from volcanoes, which reach a high altitude and reflect sunlight, bringing down temperatures on Earth. There are many critics of the proposal, who point out that sulphur dioxide, which is associated with acid rain, asthma and chronic bronchitis, is itself environmentally damaging and there is no guarantee that its effects would be limited to the poles or, indeed, what its long-term effects might be. There has been some very limited field work examining aerosol effects, but it has been too restricted to offer any definitive answers. As Ben Kravitz, atmospheric scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, says: “It’s difficult for me to say whether I’m for or against stratospheric aerosol injection because it’s hard for me to even understand what I’m giving an opinion on. The effects will vary depending on how much aerosol injection is done, where, when and what material is used. And then we need to translate effects (such as changes in temperature, precipitation, etc) into impacts (such as food and water security). And then all of that needs to be compared to what would happen under climate change without stratospheric aerosol injection. So it’s too hard for me to say whether geoengineering is a good or bad idea at this stage.” Aside from the inherent uncertainty in the proposal, there is also concern about the politics of geoengineering, particularly in relation to indigenous people in the Arctic region, with one group of scientists arguing that “solar geoengineering at planetary scale is not governable in a globally inclusive and just manner within the current international political system”. A recent study led by Wake Smith, a lecturer at Yale University on venture capital and private equity, looked at the financial and logistical implications of aerosol injection deployment. The cost was estimated to be $11bn a year – no small sum, but a tiny fraction of the costs of dealing with damage done by climate change. The study suggested that 175,000 flights a year would be needed to release a cloud of microscopic sulphur dioxide particles at an altitude of 43,000ft and latitude of 60 degrees in each hemisphere. Such a massive air mobilisation would in turn release millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but it would also lead, say the models, to a 2C drop in temperature at the polar regions. Smith acknowledges that it’s a temporary measure that treats the symptoms rather than the underlying disease. “It’s aspirin, not penicillin,” he’s said. “It’s not a substitute for decarbonisation.” In theory, the sulphur dioxide particles would settle over the poles, but in practice, no one can be sure. It’s one of the reasons that cloud brightening has been suggested as a less risky and more viable option. Sir David King is the founder of the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge (CCRC). A multidisciplinary team, it has three main objectives: to reduce CO2 emissions, remove excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and to refreeze damaged parts of the climate system. The CCRC is backing research into cloud brightening, which King insists is not geoengineering. “We reserve the phrase geoengineering for putting sulphates into the stratosphere,” he explains. While he is in favour of small-scale experiments with sulphates, he believes there should be a moratorium on “at scale” use of them in the stratosphere. Marine cloud brightening, by contrast, he says is not geoengineering but “biomimicry”, a means of imitating a natural process on a huge scale. The science is straightforward in theory. Clouds formed over oceans tend to build around salt crystals left after droplets of sea spray evaporate. Salt crystals vary in size and if they are at the smaller end of the spectrum, then clouds are formed of lots of small droplets. Clouds made from smaller droplets appear whiter than those composed of larger droplets and as a result reflect more sunlight, even if they carry the same amount of water. The idea is to whiten clouds by creating sea spray with a flotilla of boats armed with pumps and nozzles. “Once it’s all been proved operative and functional and there’s no deleterious effects,” says King, “we would need to have 500 to 1,000 ocean-going vessels placed around the Arctic Ocean.” “I think marine cloud brightening is promising,” says Kravitz, “but there’s still a lot of research that needs to be done. Interactions between aerosols and clouds are the single largest source of uncertainty in climate science right now.” The procedure, should it take place, would be restricted to the Arctic and not repeated in the Antarctic. “The North Pole is an ocean surrounded by land and the South Pole is land surrounded by ocean,” explains King. “So the melting ice of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which is looking pretty dangerous, is happening because of warm seawater coming between the land the ice is sitting on and the ice. The problem there is extraordinarily difficult to manage because what is happening in the Antarctic with this warming of oceans is directly related to what’s happening in the Arctic.” He refers to the “overturning current”, or the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, as it’s technically called, part of the system in which cold water is circulated and which is thought to have been weakened by climate change and may itself reach a tipping point. In any case, the weakening of the AMOC has led to warmer waters in the Antarctic. To make the necessary tests and experiments, get agreements from native peoples, which is part of the CCRC’s plan, then design, build or fit out the vessels and implement the process seems like a monumental undertaking. It would require a unity of vision, large-scale fundraising, some agreed system of international governance and oversight and no doubt much else besides. How long does King estimate it will take to become operational? He runs swiftly through the necessary hurdles to clear, chief of which is fundraising, which he says comes from individual philanthropists. He expects three to four years of experimentation, possibly with a vessel at sea, but it could also take place on land in Orkney. “I hate to say this,” he warns, “but overall, it may be seven years before we are operating at anything like scale.” Given that it seems to take about seven years to get planning permission for a loft conversion, this seems to me like an astonishingly optimistic timescale. “Remember what I said,” he interrupts, when I voice my surprise, “the Arctic Circle is now heating up at four times the rate of the rest of the planet.” He says his team is working very hard to get acceptability from potentially affected people, including the Inuit and Sami people. But it’s getting the starting money, which he estimates to be “a few billion pounds”, which will be most time-consuming. The vessels, he says, would be remotely controlled and, he hopes, will run on solar energy and the movement of seawater and wind. “To scale up to 500 or 1,000 vessels,” he says, “would be in the region of £30bn to £40bn. Once we’ve got a few vessels built, it will all get a lot cheaper. The running costs may be £10bn a year. But compare this with the loss and damage [of the Arctic continuing to warm at its current rate].” Without intervention, the melting of Greenland’s ice cap is irreversible, he says, which would eventually lead to an average global sea level rise of “seven metres”. And that’s not the only issue. There is a vast amount of methane stored in the permafrost on the landmass in the Arctic region, which King notes is beginning to be released by rising temperatures in Siberia. “If it was released over a 20-year period, global temperatures would rise by five to eight degrees centigrade,” he says. The CCRC is talking to a number of governments, most prominently the Netherlands, which, given its reclaimed land and low-lying territory, is particularly concerned about managing rising sea levels. As he points out, though, few countries with significant coastlines are immune to the risks, including the UK. Brightening clouds or suffusing the stratosphere with sulphur dioxide sound like science fiction answers to our carbon dependency. Neither addresses the underlying cause – they’re sticking plasters placed over gaping wounds, at best a breathing space, if you don’t mind breathing sulphur dioxide – to enable time to complete a transfer from fossil fuels. But given the urgency of the situation, and the lack of effective global leadership in dealing with it, it seems sensible at least to test the efficacy of these stop-gap measures. Climate repair is not a one-method process. It will require innovation as well as abstinence. If the mimicking of the cycle by which microscopic salt crystals pick up water vapour can slow Arctic warming, then it will truly have produced clouds with a silver lining."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/feb/20/mike-cannon-brookes-and-brookfield-in-bid-to-takeover-agl-and-shut-down-coal-plants-earlier","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-20T06:28:23Z","webTitle":"Mike Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield in bid to take over AGL and shut down coal plants earlier","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/20/mike-cannon-brookes-and-brookfield-in-bid-to-takeover-agl-and-shut-down-coal-plants-earlier","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/feb/20/mike-cannon-brookes-and-brookfield-in-bid-to-takeover-agl-and-shut-down-coal-plants-earlier","fields":{"headline":"Mike Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield in bid to take over AGL and shut down coal plants earlier","bodyText":"Tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Canadian asset management giant Brookfield have launched an extraordinary joint bid to take over AGL Energy, Australia’s most polluting company, with the goal to shut its coal power plants earlier than planned. The unsolicited multi-billion dollar offer, lodged on Saturday, would see Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures acquire AGL’s power generation and energy retail divisions, which include coal, gas and renewable energy generation assets. The AGL board was meeting to discuss the offer on Sunday. If successful, it is expected the new owners would aim to bring forward AGL’s exit from coal-fired power. It would also halt a planned demerger that would have broken off the company’s fossil fuel assets into a separate entity, to be called Accel Energy. The offer valued AGL only marginally above the company’s closing share price on Friday of $7.16. Including AGL’s debt, the bid is in the range of $8bn, a source said. The owners of Australia’s coal-fired generators are under increasing pressure, both economic due to the rise of cheap solar energy in the national grid, and from activist shareholders to act in line with the Paris climate agreement. Earlier this month, AGL brought forward the planned closure date of the Bayswater black coal plant in New South Wales to no later than 2033, and Loy Yang A in the Latrobe Valley to 2045. On Thursday, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025, rather than 2032. Cannon-Brookes, a renewable energy investor and vocal advocate for greater action on the climate crisis, has previously expressed an interest in backing clean energy assets to replace AGL’s ageing Liddell coal plant, which is due to shut next year. AGL’s coal-fired plants make it Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter. It is responsible for about 8% of the national total. Brookfield last November secured approval from the foreign investment review board for the $17.8bn takeover of transmission group AusNet Services. Given AGL’s role as a major energy generator and retailer – before the planned demerger – the new bid may attract attention from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. AGL’s demerger is being advised by Macquarie Bank, while the Brookfield-Grok duo is being advised by Citi. AGL, Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes declined to comment. After reports of the takeover bid broke on Sunday afternoon, Cannon-Brookes tweeted: “Might be an afternoon espresso kind of day.” Director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, Bruce Mountain, said if the AGL takeover went ahead Brookfield “would essentially be an investor, not a manager” and Cannon-Brookes would provide the strategy for the business. Mountain said AGL’s biggest asset was its energy retail business. Of its coal plants, Liddell is due to start shutting down its units later this year ahead of its scheduled closure by April 2023 and Bayswater, while profitable now, would be “a much less attractive asset” after its current low-price black coal subsidy ran out in 2024, he said. He said the fact the opening offer from Brookfield and Grok Ventures had apparently offered little premium above the share price was telling about AGL’s prospects as it struggled to engineer a new vision for the business while dealing with the legacy of old coal plants. The NSW Treasurer and energy minister, Matt Kean, said AGL’s future was a commercial decision. “The NSW government will continue to work with energy companies to maintain system reliability and lower power prices,” he said. Victoria’s energy and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said businesses were ramping up their investments in renewable energy “because it’s where the smart money is going”. “It’s what the people want and it will further stimulate skills development and new local jobs,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-17T15:12:29Z","webTitle":"UK green economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show","fields":{"headline":"UK green economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data","bodyText":"The UK’s low-carbon and renewable energy economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data showing a fall in the number of green jobs. In a blow to the government’s pledge to boost net-zero employment opportunities, the Office for National Statistics said its latest figures, covering 2020, showed “no significant change” in turnover and job numbers in the sector compared with six years earlier. Employment in the low-carbon and renewable energy economy – which includes manufacturing, energy supply and construction – fell by about 28,000 across the UK over the period, to just 207,800. Among the steepest declines were in factories producing energy-efficient products, onshore wind, and solar energy. Trade unions raised questions over the government’s plan to boost Britain’s low-carbon economy after years of limited progress. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the UK had an opportunity to be a pioneer on the path to net zero. “But we will miss out on these opportunities if ministers do not step up public investment and action. And we could see existing jobs lost to other countries who modernise their industry faster,” she added. Although the latest snapshot includes the first year of the coronavirus pandemic – when the British economy plunged into the deepest recession for 100 years – the figures show that in 2019, before the health emergency struck, green business turnover also fell compared with a year earlier. According to the latest data, the sector with the largest growth in jobs was in low-emission vehicles and infrastructure, where employment more than doubled to 19,100. However, this was not enough to offset bigger falls elsewhere, including a decline of more than a quarter, or 32,000, in the number of jobs in energy-efficient product manufacturing. The number of green businesses operating in the UK fell by 13% over the six-year period, while the combined turnover for the low-carbon economy fell by almost 6% to £41.2bn. The ONS said the fall in turnover was largely driven by the energy-efficient products and low-emissions vehicles sectors. The majority of businesses in the low-carbon and renewable energy sectors are in manufacturing and construction, both of which suffered a downturn in 2020. However, it said employment should have been less affected than turnover because the figures included staff on furlough. While green sectors including offshore wind have recorded substantial growth in recent years, with a sharp rise in renewable energy production, critics argue that much of the activity has been driven by foreign companies, with a reliance on the UK importing turbine blades and components manufactured abroad. Boris Johnson announced an ambition in late 2020 to create 250,000 green jobs across the country through a 10-point plan, as part of a wider government drive to hit net zero and embed a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Ministers are seeking to encourage the growth of green jobs in sectors such as offshore wind, including through the creation of freeports in an attempt to boost investment and jobs in the low-carbon economy. However, experts and campaigners have warned the government’s net zero plans lack the required ambition and are not backed up with adequate funding from the Treasury, instead relying on the private sector. A UK government spokesperson said: “Over the last three decades, the UK has achieved record clean growth. Our economy has grown by 77%, while our emissions have decreased by 44% - faster than any other G7 nation. “Against the backdrop of the worst economic recession in a lifetime and an unprecedented pandemic, the low carbon economy has continued to support 430,000 jobs across the UK. We’ve already seen 56,000 jobs created and supported in green sectors last year, including in offshore wind and electric vehicle manufacturing. “As we recover from the pandemic, we are unlocking £90bn of private investment to continue to support the creation of new jobs in new British industries, such as Gigafactories, offshore wind, and nuclear power generation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/mar/19/david-cameron-green-crap-energy-prices","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-19T15:04:35Z","webTitle":"Cameron’s decision to cut ‘green crap’ now costs each household in England £150 a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/19/david-cameron-green-crap-energy-prices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/mar/19/david-cameron-green-crap-energy-prices","fields":{"headline":"Cameron’s decision to cut ‘green crap’ now costs each household in England £150 a year","bodyText":"The decision by David Cameron’s government to ditch what he denounced as “green crap” policies will cost every household as much as £150 a year by the autumn, new analysis has shown. With energy prices already soaring and bills set to rise even further this year, it suggests Cameron’s decisions to effectively end onshore wind projects in England, cut solar subsidies and slash energy-efficiency schemes played a large part in rising bills. It comes with the government preparing to announce its much anticipated energy strategy this week, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further drives up energy prices. It is expected to push measures such as solar and onshore wind power generation, as well as North Sea oil projects. However, there are concerns that the Treasury is holding back more radical action. Many of this week’s measures could reverse action taken by the coalition government. Analysis by Carbon Brief looked at the cumulative effect of ending onshore wind subsidies, cutting energy efficiency funding and scrapping a programme to make all new homes carbon neutral. It also factored in cuts to solar energy subsidies. With the energy price cap already at £1,277 a year and rising to £1,971 in less than a fortnight and an expected £3,000 in October, the analysis found that maintaining the green policies would have reduced energy costs by £8.3bn a year for the economy overall, part of which would equate to £150 a year per household. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: “The government said they were ‘cutting the green crap’ but it was a disaster - with bills for working families much higher as a result. This demonstrates once again that going green is the right way to have energy security, cut bills, and tackle the climate crisis. “However often this government tries to relaunch their failed energy policy, they cannot be the solution to the crisis they created because they continue to face both ways on crucial issues like fracking and refuse to invest at scale at the solutions we need, including energy efficiency.” Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief, who conducted the analysis, said: “Cutting the so-called ‘green crap’ has left UK households highly exposed to soaring global gas prices and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy efficiency and cheap renewables are the fastest and most effective ways to cut gas imports – and household bills.” Cameron won the Tory leadership by forging an eco-friendly reputation, pictured with huskies on an early trip to the Arctic in 2006 and later installing a wind turbine on his house but reports emerged that he had told aides to “get rid of the green crap” in 2013. At the time that the remarks emerged, Cameron’s team said they did not recognise the phrase, but did not offer an outright denial. Then, a series of policies designed to push energy efficiency and renewable energy was scaled back. The number of homes having their lofts or cavity walls insulated each year dropped by 92% and 74% in 2013 respectively and has never recovered. Subsidies ended for onshore wind turbines, and planning reforms made them harder to build. Meanwhile, solar power was excluded from government support in 2015. Ministers have been battling for weeks to find ways of taking the pressure off energy and fuel costs. Boris Johnson travelled to Saudi Arabia this week to call for cheaper oil prices, while ministers have made clear that onshore wind and solar power generation will be prioritised in their plans. However, chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected more radical plans such as cutting VAT on fuel bills or delaying a planned national insurance increase to help with household costs. Government officials said that a package worth billions had already been designed, including a £150 council tax rebate for many households in England from April and a £200 energy bill loan in Great Britain in October. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: “We have consistently backed renewable energy sources including both onshore and offshore wind, delivering a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid since 2010. “We are also accelerating our progress in upgrading the energy efficiency of England’s homes, investing over £6.6bn to decarbonise homes and buildings and bringing in higher minimum performance standards to ensure all homes meet EPC Band C by 2035. We are also insulating millions of consumers from high gas prices through the energy price cap.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/15/electricity-trading-suspended-as-energy-supply-crisis-deepens-across-australias-east-coast","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-15T08:54:14Z","webTitle":"National electricity market suspended as NSW residents told to conserve power to reduce blackout risk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/15/electricity-trading-suspended-as-energy-supply-crisis-deepens-across-australias-east-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/15/electricity-trading-suspended-as-energy-supply-crisis-deepens-across-australias-east-coast","fields":{"headline":"National electricity market suspended as NSW residents told to conserve power to reduce blackout risk","bodyText":"Australia’s main wholesale electricity market has been suspended by regulators in the latest sign that the crisis threatening the stability of energy supplies is deepening. The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) took the drastic step of suspending the entire national electricity market for the first time in its history on Wednesday. “Aemo has determined that it is necessary to suspend the spot market in all regions [of the NEM] because it has become impossible to operate” the market within the rules, the regulator said. The NEM covers all of Australia except for the Northern Territory and Western Australia. In the hours prior to the suspension, Aemo had issued a flurry of lack of reserve alerts at the level 3 warning for all the mainland states within the market. “Prior to suspending the market today, Aemo had issued over 5,000MW of directions and that is roughly 20% of demand,” Aemo’s chief executive, Daniel Westerman, said in Adelaide. On Wednesday evening, the NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, told Sydney residents to reduce usage between 5.30pm and 8pm to reduce the risk of blackouts. The latest Aemo forecasts for potential shortfalls in supply cited 8.30pm as a period of concern and flagged a possible intervention to order more generation as late as an hour earlier. “If there is an opportunity to reduce their energy usage like not using their dishwasher until they go to bed, that would help,” Kean told NSW consumers. A number of coal-fired power stations that were expected to be working on Wednesday night had not come online, he said. The Vivid Sydney event, with light shows around the city’s harbour region, would still proceed. The market scheme to pay big energy users to cut their power use had also been activated in NSW on Wednesday, Aemo said. Significant shortfalls in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia were avoided on Wednesday but more were forecast for Thursday. Victoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the market suspension was “to protect energy users and put certainty back into the market”. “It is disappointing that energy generators were potentially gaming the system and not utilising the options available to them – this behaviour is unacceptable and will be investigated,” D’Ambrosio said. The market suspension came as Aemo and other members of the Energy Security Board – the energy market commission and the energy regulator – were scheduled to have an urgent meeting on Wednesday afternoon with generators to discuss supply. Aemo, as the meeting’s host, cancelled the gathering once it decided to suspend the spot market. Both the commission and the regulator had in the past day reiterated the importance of generators providing supply to the tight market, even with price caps of $300/MWh now imposed on all five states. Generators have denied gaming the market by withdrawing supply, saying the price caps had affected the profitability of some bids but they would follow orders if instructed to generate power to avoid blackouts. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, has previously warned power generators that anyone using the current crisis to engage in market manipulation will face action from regulators wielding the “full force of their powers”. Bowen has previously blamed former Coalition governments for a “decade of denial and delay” and almost 24 energy policies that they failed to implement. In the absence of a national scheme, the states have increasingly pursued their own policies, particularly to encourage the uptake of renewable energy to cut carbon emissions but also to replace ageing coal plants that were mostly nearing the end of their designed operational lives. In a statement, Westerman noted that about 3,000MW of coal-fired power plant capacity was offline through unplanned outages alone, while others were having scheduled maintenance breaks. The early onset of winter had also increased demand for electricity and gas, while wind and solar energy output had been down at times. “In the current situation suspending the market is the best way to ensure a reliable supply of electricity for Australian homes and businesses,” Westerman said. “The situation in recent days has posed challenges to the entire energy industry, and suspending the market would simplify operations during the significant outages across the energy supply chain.” The market suspension was temporary, but it is unclear when it will resume under normal rules. “We are seeing very challenging times … the market is not able to deal with all the factors thrown at it,” Westerman said. “Frankly those factors are quite extreme.” The imposition of price caps across the market starting from last Sunday in Queensland – as required under the rules once spot prices exceeded a set threshold – was a key reason the market broke down, said Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of Melbourne. “If not for those price caps, we wouldn’t be here now,” McConnell said. The cap set at $300MWh to protect consumers was less than the cost of generation for some plants. As a result, there was a “runaway” process of ever more suppliers pulling out of the market only to then be instructed to provide power by the regulators, he said. “That feedback loop really escalated in the past 48 hours.” Paul McArdle, an analyst with Global-Roam and author of the WattClarity website, said the market suspension was “certainly on the cards” the way it had been operating in the past few days. “The question is, does it make it work better given the underlying physical problems,” McArdle said. The spate of shortfalls warnings did not imply blackouts were close given the ability of regulators to demand supply. “You shouldn’t scare the troops,” he said. McArdle said the suspension was needed because under the existing rules the price threshold could have lasted weeks if not longer. The price limits are imposed when spot prices reach almost $1.4m over 2016 five-minute intervals over a rolling seven-day period. When the market was suspended, prices in Queensland had topped $9m, NSW about $8m, Victoria $4.5m and South Australia $3.9m, he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The managing director of consultancy Energy Edge, Joshua Stabler, said the way the Australian Energy Markets Commission compensated generators forced to supply electricity at a price lower than their costs had fed “distrust” among suppliers. “It’s that lack of trust in terms of how they are getting paid that causes the issue,” Stabler said prior to the market’s suspension. On the one hand, companies forced to use high-cost gas would be losing money by using it to generate electricity. At $40 a gigajoule, the cost of producing a MWh of power would be about $440 but the price cap was only $300. Stabler said the public messaging needed to be sorted out, not least because the market strains could last through winter. “The response to the threat makes it look like we’re in a blackout state when we’re not,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/05/we-urgently-need-to-cut-emissions-the-good-news-is-we-can-do-it-quickly-and-relatively-cheaply","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-04T17:30:43Z","webTitle":"We urgently need to cut emissions – the good news is we can do it quickly and relatively cheaply | Frank Jotzo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/we-urgently-need-to-cut-emissions-the-good-news-is-we-can-do-it-quickly-and-relatively-cheaply","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/we-urgently-need-to-cut-emissions-the-good-news-is-we-can-do-it-quickly-and-relatively-cheaply","fields":{"headline":"We urgently need to cut emissions – the good news is we can do it quickly and relatively cheaply","bodyText":"Enormous opportunities to cut emissions deeply are there, the time to act is now, and it can be done at affordable cost. That would be the shortest possible summary of the thousands of pages of careful assessment in the world’s definitive stocktake of how to limit future climate change. The assessment report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change implies that while limiting global warming to 1.5C is practically out of reach, staying below 2C is possible in practice. And it is no longer just a theoretical possibility as it used to be not too long ago. The IPCC finds that the world’s emissions could be cut in half by 2030 at affordable costs if action is taken right across the board. Of this, 50% could be achieved at relatively low costs of less than US$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, or even with net economic gains. And that is before taking into account the massive benefits from reducing future climate change, and benefits such as cleaner air and better energy supply security. The dramatic reductions in the costs of clean energy technologies over recent years are a gamechanger; for example, the cost of solar energy has reduced sixfold over just a decade. Positive experiences in the implementation of policies to cut emissions are another reason for optimism. So while the urgency to take action has risen, the opportunities to really make a difference are also much greater. The energy and land sectors are the largest opportunities globally. In energy, the story is about solar and wind power displacing fossil fuels, alongside many other ways of cutting emissions. On the land, it is about reforestation and avoided deforestation, better land management, and a shift to low-emissions agriculture. Industry, transport and buildings are also crucial parts of the puzzle. The IPCC also shows that shifts in consumption habits, including changing diets, are also important. Australia is in pole position on all of these. Ours is a high-emissions economy, which means that it is relatively easy to make big cuts. Add to that Australia’s advantage of a practically unlimited low-cost supply of renewable energy and huge opportunities for better carbon management on the land. But the transition will, of course, also bring its challenges, including for Australia. Fossil fuel use declines dramatically in scenarios of strong global climate action. Coal in particular will be on the way out, with the IPCC projecting reductions of 65% to 95% in global coal use by 2050 in 2C scenarios. The numbers for reductions in gas vary greatly between scenarios, and depend heavily on how far below 2C the world may get. How to get there in practice? For implementation of climate policy, this IPCC report assesses practical experience, not theory or modelling. The picture that emerges is a very positive one: the world over, climate laws and policies are on the ascendancy, and most measures that governments have taken are effective. Experience has helped refine policies so they also meet other goals. For example, carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes are routinely designed so that low-income groups are protected from adverse financial impacts, by channelling some of the revenue to them. The IPCC finds that packages of policies are the best way to achieve emissions outcomes. Economic instruments like pricing policies then link up with more specific regulatory policies, and are complemented by support for research and development, regional transition and so forth. While the IPCC does not provide country-specific assessments, the implication for Australia is clear: we need to overcome the current situation where there is merely a patchwork of mostly half-hearted policies, and absence of any policy for many aspects of the economy. What we need is a comprehensive set of policies that guides and incentivises the shift to a net zero economy right across the board. This is what will make the needed investment flow. And climate policy should not be the domain of governments and business alone. The IPCC report finds that to achieve the shift that is needed, climate action must involve civil society. Whether it is unions, NGOs, grassroots organisations, the research sector or business associations, all need to be on board and pull in the same general direction. At this point in the electoral cycle, a question often asked is: what are the implications of the election outcome for climate policy? In the picture that arises from the IPCC report, this should not be a question that needs asking. In a world where addressing climate change is done properly, climate policy is not a question of politics. Rather, it would be a shared fundamental objective – just like national security, decent infrastructure or a well-functioning health and education system. Perhaps by the time of the seventh IPCC assessment report, due in seven years or so, we may be closer to it. Frank Jotzo is a professor at the Australian National University. He is a lead author of the sixth assessment report of Working Group III of the IPCC, and co-author of its summary for policymakers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/2021/jun/01/bp-re-enters-us-market-buying-up-string-of-solar-farms-for-155m","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-01T17:11:27Z","webTitle":"BP buys string of US solar farms for £155m in clean energy drive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/01/bp-re-enters-us-market-buying-up-string-of-solar-farms-for-155m","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jun/01/bp-re-enters-us-market-buying-up-string-of-solar-farms-for-155m","fields":{"headline":"BP buys string of US solar farms for £155m in clean energy drive","bodyText":"BP has bought a pipeline of US solar farms, capable of powering more than 1.7m homes, for more than $220m (£155m) as part of its plan to distance itself from the fossil fuel industry. The oil company has agreed to snap up a string of development projects, totalling 9GW, from the independent US solar developer 7X Energy in a “significant step” towards its goal of securing 20GW by 2025. The projects will be developed by the UK solar company Lightsource BP across 12 states in the US, which is one of the world’s fastest growing solar energy markets and is expected to double in the next five years and quadruple over the next decade. Lightsource BP, the British solar startup which formed a 50:50 joint venture with BP in 2017, broke into its second new market in a week on Tuesday after snapping up 40% of the capacity awarded in a Greek government renewables auction alongside the Greek energy firm Kiefer TEK. The award emerged days after it entered the Portugese solar energy market for the first time. Dev Sanyal, BP’s head of gas and low-carbon energy, said the US deal was “a significant step as we continue to deliver on our net zero ambition” by growing the renewable energy business “in a deliberate and disciplined way”. BP aims to establish a pipeline of renewable energy projects totalling 20GW by 2025 and 50GW by the end of the decade, while slowly reducing its production of fossil fuels to transform from an oil company into a clean energy business. The group also used the US market for its first significant step into the offshore wind market after agreeing last year to pay $1.1bn (£850m) for a stake in two US offshore wind projects being developed by the Norwegian state oil company, Equinor. Only a few months later BP and its partner, the Germany utility EnBW, struck a deal to pay the crown estate a record-breaking £462m-a-year to lease the seabed for two offshore windfarms in the Irish Sea capable of powering more than 3.4m UK households. “This is an integrated energy company in action,” Sanyal said. “This will bring together the best of BP to create value and provide customers with what they want – clean, affordable, energy.” The company has faced criticism from some investors who believe the company is paying too much to accelerate its move into clean energy. BP’s plans, under the chief executive, Bernard Looney, are some of the most ambitious put forward by a big oil company, and even won cautious praise from green groups including Greenpeace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2023/mar/20/scarred-for-life-the-himalayan-towns-sinking-into-oblivion","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-20T07:00:03Z","webTitle":"Scarred for life: the Himalayan towns sinking into oblivion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/mar/20/scarred-for-life-the-himalayan-towns-sinking-into-oblivion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2023/mar/20/scarred-for-life-the-himalayan-towns-sinking-into-oblivion","fields":{"headline":"Scarred for life: the Himalayan towns sinking into oblivion","bodyText":"Beneath the dark, jagged peaks of the Himalayas, Ashish Joshyal surveys a crater where his house once stood.

But, like hundreds of others in Joshimath, a sacred town in the Indian state of Uttarakhand high up in the Himalayas, his problems began one night in early January. Cracks appeared in his roof, then crept down the walls. They got wider and wider until they were gaping chasms. Finally, at the beginning of February, the front porch and the floors began to sink and the whole house gave way. “You can’t imagine how it felt, it is a tragedy for us,” says Joshyal, 30, amid the ruins. He lived here with seven family members, including his wife and children. Now they are living in a temporary camp in a nearby school. “Not only my house but my fields have gone,” he says, pointing to a grassy patch below, now jagged with fissures. “How will we ever get so much back in one lifetime?” In the neighbouring fields, Bishweshwari Devi, 57, hitches up her yellow sari as she crosses the land she once used to grow vegetables and grains. It has now slid deep into the mountain and lays ruptured and ruined. “It has fallen five feet in the past two weeks,” says Devi, who has also been forced to leave her home due to cracks. “Joshimath is in turmoil. The fields have been ruined, the houses are falling apart and the people here are devastated. My own house was like heaven for me. We put all our savings into building it. Now it is not even safe for our cows.” Joshimath is sinking and, according to locals, it is sinking fast. All across this town, which clings to the steep side of the mountain, more than 900 houses are marked with an ominous red X, meaning they too have been ruined by subsidence and cracks, or in some cases crumbled entirely as the ground swallows them up. Roads look as if they have been uprooted by an earthquake, and more homes, some newly built, crack and sink by the day. Two multistorey hotels have been bulldozed to prevent disaster, and many more homes are set to be flattened. More than 200 families are living in temporary shelters, often five or more to a room. Many still go back to their sinking homes every day to cook and sit together, unable to bear abandoning them completely. For the older residents, the disaster has been particularly painful. Padmanabh, 79, stands next to his traditional stone hut, also an important local shrine, where he has lived and worshipped his entire life. The cracks in the foundations are evident but he is still living there, tending to his cows. “We are frightened,” he says softly. “My god is here, people have cleansed their sins here. Where will I go?” The question of why Joshimath is sinking remains contentious. What is certain is that the town, already built on the fragile geological foundations of ancient landslide debris, has been under immense and growing pressure for years – and its future is now in peril. Joshimath sits 6,000ft up in the Indian high Himalayas, a mountain range steeped in spiritual meaning for Hindus who believe it is the abode of the gods. Nanda Devi, a peak visible from a point above the town, is said to be a manifestation of the Hindu goddess Parvati. The town is close to one of the most sacred Hindu shrines of the Himalayas, Badrinath temple, where millions of salvation-seeking pilgrims travel every year. As far back as 1976, scientists cautioned that any heavy construction, tunnelling or disturbance of the Joshimath slope could have serious consequences. The warnings were ignored, and an unregulated sprawl of homes, multistorey hotels, shops and restaurants was allowed to spring up along the mountainside. Trees, which stabilised the ground, were cut down and drainage was neglected. To worsen the danger, an army base was moved into the town, building barracks, schools and a hospital, and the population of this small mountain community soared. An initial report into the subsidence in September last year by the Uttarakhand state government blamed a combination of unstable terrain, over-construction, climate change and river erosion. But locals, and some experts, allege that this is not the full story. Instead, they say the disaster engulfing Joshimath is part of a wider pattern emerging across Uttarakhand as the fragile mountain terrain of the state, which is full of vulnerable fault lines, is now being blasted, chiselled and penetrated by development projects. More than 100 hydropower projects in varying degrees of construction stand almost bumper to bumper along its holy rivers, and a vast network of highways and railways is under construction. Resistance by environmentalists has been fierce. In 2018, GD Agrawal, a professor and activist, died after going on hunger strike in protest at the hydropower projects planned along the holy Ganges river. Joshimath has been caught up in this development spree. Since 2006, construction has been ongoing on the Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower project, about 10 miles from the town, on the Dhauliganga river. Then, in September, blasting and drilling began for a road at the base of Joshimath’s slope, part of a flagship 900km project across Uttarakhand launched by prime minister Narendra Modi in 2016. The road has faced multiple legal challenges from environmentalists and been linked to cracks and subsidence in other towns. This stretch below Joshimath was red-flagged by experts as too risky, but the supreme court allowed it to go ahead. India is not alone in exploiting the Himalayas’ resources. China has been on a decades-long development push in the Tibetan Himalayas, a source of concern to India, which has been rushing to catch up. In Nepal and Pakistan too, vast dams are being built on important glacial rivers. “Himalaya is a unique ecosystem that sustains billions of lives,” says the historian John Keay, who recently authored Himalaya: Exploring the Roof of the World. “But it is being bruised, reshaped and exploited with really no overall plan for it, no internationally agreed standards of exploitation and no safeguards against the impacts of roads and dams across regions.” India is said to have the fifth-largest hydropower capacity in the world, and more than 70% of that capacity is in the Himalayas. As successive governments have sought ways to secure India’s growing need for electricity, hydropower dams – considered to be green energy despite displacing communities and submerging forests – have been touted as an essential part of India’s progress and development. Yet experts have increasingly questioned the wisdom of building huge dams in an area at very high risk of earthquakes and disproportionately affected by climate change-inflicted disasters, particularly as glaciers melt at alarming rates. The high risk also makes hydropower much more expensive, and it now costs almost three times as much as solar energy to produce in India. *** For some in the state, the consequences of the hydro boom have already proved devastating. Years before Joshimath started sinking, 150 miles away in the village of Pipola Khas, cracks, subsidence and lopsided walls had become a way of life. The village sits on a slope overlooking the Tehri dam reservoir, one of the largest hydropower projects in India, which involved the submersion of more than 100 villages as well as forests and fields. It began operating in 2005. Five years later, the cracks began to show in village homes. A government report in 2011 acknowledged the dam reservoir was causing subsidence and slope erosion, but locals say the authorities have done nothing for them, even as it continues to get worse. Dozens of families have now abandoned their homes, some of which have been split wide open. Others with nowhere to go are forced to live with the deep cracks and chasms. Tears fill the eyes of Ashrafi Devi, 60, as she points to the crevasse in the middle of her kitchen and the cracks that ruined the rest of her home. She has sent her children away to safety but will not leave the home she has known all her life. Nor can she afford to. “We spent every penny to build this house. My heart cries when I see this. It’s happening to all of us but no one has come to help.” It’s a similar story across the state; where development projects have come, cracks have followed. The small village of Siwai, in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, has not stopped shaking for weeks as the mountains beneath are blasted for a new railway tunnel. Homes less than a year old now have cracks creeping up the walls, a devastating blow for this poverty-stricken community. “They told us they wouldn’t do any blasting but now our houses shake violently every morning and every night, and they are going deeper and deeper beneath our homes,” says Sanjay Kumar, 29, whose house is now covered in cracks. His fear, echoed throughout the village, is that: “We are at the brink of becoming Joshimath.” Lining the road on the way up to Joshimath are signs erected by the electricity department hailing ‘Hydro ki Laher Taraqqi ki Sahar (wave of hydro, a morning of progress).” But hydropower is now a dirty word in this town. The Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower plant is being built by the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC), a government public sector company, and has received multiple warnings since construction began in 2006. In 2014, a report commissioned by India’s supreme court explicitly recommended that no hydropower projects should go ahead in the high Himalayas as they risked further destabilising this young and unstable mountain range. “Despite those clear-cut recommendations, the government made no change in its planning,” said Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute in Uttarakhand, who headed the expert panel commissioned by the supreme court. As disaster after disaster hit the NTPC hydropower project, concerns grew over the impact of the dam on the surrounding landscape, including nearby Joshimath. Construction involved blasting, drilling and boring deep into a known fault zone to excavate a 12km tunnel that would pass less than a mile from Joshimath, and residents reported regularly hearing the blasts. It then emerged that rocks inside the tunnel were cracking unpredictably. In 2009, the construction machinery pierced a rock, and more than 700 litres per second of water gushed into the tunnel. Water continued to pour out for years after, and to this day the tunnel boring machine is stuck inside. In 2011, a report by Austrian scientists called into question the accuracy of the ground surveys NTPC had done before embarking on the project and in a second report in 2015 they found the excavations were causing large-scale cracks and disruptions to water flows in the rock stretching far beyond the tunnel walls. Then, in February 2021, a glacial lake burst high in the Himalayas, bringing a destructive and deadly torrent down the valley on to the Tapovan Vishnugad project, partially destroying it and filling the half-complete tunnel deep in the mountain with water, mud and debris. More than 200 people were killed in the disaster, and the tunnel is still filled with debris; several of the bodies of labourers who had been inside have still not been retrieved. According to locals, just six month later, in October 2021, the first cracks began appearing in Joshimath, and subsidence – most often caused by the movement or removal of water beneath the ground – continued to accelerate. The allegation now being investigated by independent geologists is that the cracks caused by boring and blasting the tunnel have spread deep into the mountain. As a result, the water that gushed into the tunnel after the 2021 disaster, and other disrupted water flows caused by construction, is now seeping through these cracks and destabilising the slope where Joshimath stands. Suspicions were worsened when, on the night of 2 January this year, a new spring of muddied water erupted at the base of the Joshimath slope, with more than 500 litres of water per minute gushing out. The next day, the worst of the subsidence began in the town, triggering panic and eventual mass evacuations. District officials blamed bad drainage. “We knew years ago that an invasive project like this can harm the town’s structure, harm water resources, harm agriculture, everything,” says Atul Sati, the convenor of the Joshimath Bachao Sangharsh Samiti (JBSS), the campaign group fighting for the town. “We raised the alarm as far back as 2000. In 2021, our worst fears were realised. Navin Juyal, an independent geologist who is investigating the subsidence and has studied the area for 20 years, emphasises that all evidence against the hydropower project is currently circumstantial, but agrees that it poses a danger to Joshimath. “While it is not possible right now to scientifically confirm the tunnel was responsible for what has happened in Joshimath, in the past the tunnel has led to cracks in the rocks and bursts of water they had not predicted,” he says. NTPC is vehement in its denials, saying there is no correlation between its tunnel and the subsidence, pointing out that it is more than 1km from the town and that there has been no recent blasting. In the government’s own report into Joshimath’s subsidence in September, there was no mention of either government project – the NTPC dam or the Char Dham road construction – as a factor. An expert panel set up by the government says it is now looking into all causes. Himanshu Khurana, a district magistrate of Chamoli district, denies that there was any attempt to cover up the role of any development projects in Joshimath. “Experts from the government of India and scientific institutions are on the ground, and they’re monitoring the situation and collecting research samples. We will have to wait for their opinion on this,” he says. But Sati and others are sceptical that the truth will come out. “Big dams mean big money for the government – that’s why they support them,” says Sati. Many fear the worst is yet to come. On 27 April, Badrinath temple will reopen to the public for the season, bringing with it up to 15,000 visitors a day. The road to the temple from Joshimath is already filled with holes from subsidence, which the administration has been rushing to fill in with gravel. Residents are also dreading the notoriously relentless monsoon rains, fearful that their already unstable houses will simply wash away. Experts say there is no way back from the subsidence, and people in the vulnerable areas will have to be removed, probably for many years. The government, however, has yet to give affected people definitive answers about their future, to the anger of many in the town who have been staging daily protests for more than 50 days, accusing the administration of obstructing the truth and failing to provide them with proper shelter and security. Of the thousands of temporary homes that were promised, so far only 15 have been constructed. “The government is trying to mislead the people by not telling the truth,” says Poonam Bisht, 40. “The whole country hails Narendra Modi, but we are heartbroken and homeless. He does not care or support us in this tragedy. He is silent.” Peena Ben, sitting beside her, chips in. “The government put our lives at risk so they can continue with their big development projects, but what benefits are we seeing? They will only bother about us when we die.” Additional reporting by Hridayesh Joshi"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-24T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"The west stood back and watched in Syria – it must not do the same in Ukraine | Hamish de Bretton-Gordon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-west-syria-ukraine-us-allies-vladimir-putin","fields":{"headline":"The west stood back and watched in Syria – it must not do the same in Ukraine","bodyText":"The Syria crisis continues unnoticed. It holds key lessons for the west about Putin yet it has gone virtually unnoticed by the rest of the world. War crimes and crimes against humanity continue in the Russian-sponsored dictatorship, even as some misguided leaders want to usher Bashar al-Assad, the architect of these crimes, back into acceptable society. We can rest assured that the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, unlike Assad, is not welcoming Putin with open arms. But in responding to the Ukraine emergency, there are lessons the west can and should learn from the situation in Syria. Since the UN removed Syria’s declared chemical weapons stockpile in 2014, Assad has continued to bomb hospitals and schools, and burn villages to the ground in a macabre, medieval-style scorched-earth policy. Mercifully, we have not seen chemical weapons used since April 2019, but Syria today is a Russian state in all but name, and Assad a puppet dictator with strings very clearly tugged from Moscow. Idlib, a province in northwest Syria, is the only region still free of the tyranny, but with millions of malnourished souls trapped there, and Assad throwing in incendiary devices to smoke them out as you would vermin, it still resembles hell on earth. Even the UN has turned its back on Idlib, giving aid to Assad and his wife to distribute as they see fit. Syria now represents a major Russian and Iranian presence on the edge of Europe; and if Ukraine also falls, the balance of power will very much shift eastwards. With too many European countries reliant on Russian gas, the current global instability began in Damascus. An emboldened Russia buoyed up by high oil prices seems much more willing to face off with Nato than it did a few years ago, when its antiquated military was no match for western tanks. While the rest of us have cut our militaries to the bone, relying on electronics and space to fight the next war, Russia has modernised its armoured might, now on show around Ukraine – there is a unique quality in mass and heavy armour, which no cyberwarrior is going to vaporise. Syria shows what happens when you turn a blind eye and are too heavily influenced by peaceniks. Those of us involved in interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 30 years have our issues with overstepping the mark in those places, but we look at Syria and know we should have done better. That knowledge should inform our response to Putin’s aggression now. It is clear when discussing Syria with Syrians from Idlib and regime-held areas that everybody has suffered. At least those in Idlib are getting support through Turkey, and there are some innovative projects being funded by European countries. Many hospitals and clinics in Idlib now have solar power to run their generators and surgical theatres, as there is no fuel and the power network was destroyed years ago. There is an electric car, also powered by solar energy, distributing medicines and Covid vaccines – when they are occasionally available – around Idlib. In a remarkable twist that would only happen in war, some of these Syrian medics who have developed a viable medical system under the most trying and demanding circumstances are now offering to help in Afghanistan. The Syrian people have shown resilience and innovation beyond compare, even as they have been let down again and again. First, the west did not intervene when the regime started attacking its own people. Then, in response to chemical weapon use, illegal under every rule of war, the US declared a red line on their use – but failed to act when that line was crossed. And finally, we stood by as Russia and Iran muscled their way across Syria to create a forward operation base on our doorstep. Our leaders will do well to remember this and be strong and resilient to protect Ukraine. I cannot think that a few sanctions on a few banks and billionaires is going to perturb Putin. He only understands strength and power – it’s time to show our steel.

The impact of coronavirus lockdowns on the energy industry led carbon emissions to plummet by 6% on the year before, the sharpest decline since 1945, according to BP’s annual review of the energy sector. But the report says the impact of Covid on carbon emissions needs to be replicated every year for the next three decades if governments hope to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “Yes, they were the biggest falls seen for 75 years,” said Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist. “But they occurred against the backdrop of a global pandemic and the largest economic recession in postwar history. The challenge is to reduce emissions without causing massive disruption and damage to everyday lives and livelihoods.” The warning echoes a report from the International Energy Agency last month which predicted that the world’s demand for oil would bounce back by 5.4m barrels a day this year, one of the fastest climbs on record, and rebound to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. BP’s annual energy review, published every year since 1952, is considered influential in the energy industry and helps to inform the company’s strategic decisions. Last year BP set out a plan to cut its oil production and increase its renewable energy generation within the next decade, en route to becoming a net zero energy company by 2050. Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, said: “Yes, the world needs more low-carbon companies. But maybe more than anything it also needs existing energy companies to decarbonise, and in so doing use their scale and expertise to help bring about the deep and complex rewiring and replumbing of the global energy system that the world wants and needs to see over the next 30 years.” BP’s latest energy review found that the world’s total energy consumption fell by 4.5% in 2020, driven mainly by a 9.7% slump in demand for crude, used to make transport fuels, or just over 9m barrels of oil a day. Dale said the collapse in demand was “far bigger than anything seen in history and far bigger than the falls” in other energy sources. Meanwhile the “relentless expansion of renewable energy” meant electricity generated by wind, solar and hydroelectricity plants was “relatively unscathed”, Dale said. The report found that global wind and solar power capacity grew by 238GW in 2020, more than five times greater than the UK’s total renewable energy capacity. The increase was mainly driven by China, which accounted for roughly half of the global increase in wind and solar energy production capacity, but even controlling for that 2020 was a record year for building wind and solar farms. Dale said the trend away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy last year was “exactly what the world needs to see as it transitions to net zero”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/sep/08/rural-virginia-pivots-from-coal-solar-green-jobs","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T10:00:15Z","webTitle":"‘This is the future’: rural Virginia pivots from coal to green jobs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/08/rural-virginia-pivots-from-coal-solar-green-jobs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/sep/08/rural-virginia-pivots-from-coal-solar-green-jobs","fields":{"headline":"‘This is the future’: rural Virginia pivots from coal to green jobs","bodyText":"When Mason Taylor enrolled at the local vocational school with dreams of becoming an electrician like his dad, it was assumed that the ninth-grader would eventually end up moving away from Wise county, Virginia, to find a decent job. Now 19, Taylor just bought a truck after a summer apprenticing with a crew of electricians installing rooftop solar systems at public schools in the county. He was among a dozen or so rookies paid $17 an hour, plus tools and a travel stipend, as part of the state’s first solar energy youth apprenticeship scheme. “Around here it’s always been coal, coal, coal, we didn’t hear much about green energy,” said Taylor, who comes from a long line of miners. “This is a great opportunity to learn, great pay, and maybe I’ll be able to stay here in the mountains with my family if solar takes off.” In the past decade or so, unemployment and poverty have forced many to leave south-west Virginia as the coal industry’s decline ricocheted across central Appalachia. It’s torn many families apart and any talk of renewable energy was considered anti-coal, but attitudes are starting to change. “We have to get away from fossil fuels that are killing our planet. Technology has come a long way and will keep getting better. This is the future,” said chief electrician Jimmy Rogers, 49, whose family worked on the coal trains in Tennessee. The region’s long-awaited energy and economic transition will be substantially boosted by America’s first climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It’s far from a panacea, but Joe Biden’s legislation provides $369bn for the transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy – a historic investment that scientists estimate will reduce greenhouse gases by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and create an estimated 1.5m new jobs. Decent well-paid jobs are desperately needed. In Virginia, coal production has declined by 70% since its peak in 1990, and much of what’s left is semi-automated. Those old jobs are largely gone and are not coming back. The IRA provides ring-fenced money for training, innovation and manufacturing, as well as an array of tax breaks and other financial incentives to help consumers and businesses transition away from fossil fuels. And Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat senator from West Virginia played a pivotal role in watering down – and then reviving – the legislation, directing billions of dollars to the economic revival of depressed coal towns. “It’s a game changer for rural and coal communities,” said Autumn Long, a project manager for solar financing and manufacturing workforce development at the non-profit Appalachian Voices. “Renewables are a way to honour the region’s energy-producing legacy and be part of the 21st-century global energy transition. The IRA is a turning point.” ••• Wise county is a picturesque Appalachian community bordering eastern Kentucky where for decades coal dominated the economy – and almost every aspect of life. It’s home to the self-proclaimed cleanest coal plant in America, a sprawling polluting and economically unviable mountain ridge plant currently scheduled to keep operating until 2045. The population has declined by 12% since 2010 to just over 35,000. Fancy houses built with coal wealth are scattered across the mountain ridges, but the poverty rate stands at about 21%, more than 50% higher than the national average, and the county’s schools qualify for universal free school meals. Over the past five years or so Appalachian Voices has been among a consortium of non-profits working with communities, unions, businesses and local governments to help the region transition to a more environmentally and economically sustainable renewable energy economy. It’s taken time to help change local and state laws, but even longer to shift attitudes and the deep connection people feel to coal. “The politics around clean energy are not as simplistic as Democrat or Republican,” said Chelsea Barnes, the group’s legal director. “It’s been difficult even proving that solar jobs can be good union jobs, like coal.” But the work has paid off, and central Appalachia is in a good place to take advantage of the IRA provisions and historic investments. The youth apprenticeship scheme is the brainchild of entrepreneurs at Secure Futures and Got Electric – Virginia-based companies installing distributed solar systems for government agencies, hospitals, schools and commercial properties. Solar is relatively new here as it was only in 2020 that the state allowed public entities and non-profits to access power purchase agreements (PPA) – a third-party financing system which essentially means the solar company pays for upfront costs. Offset schemes like net metering can also lead to substantial savings as excess electricity goes back into the grid and is banked like rollover minutes. So far in Wise county, seven schools have signed 20-year contracts with Secure Futures for rooftop solar. “The IRA is going to help push this further, it’s so exciting,” said Matt McFadden, the company’s business development lead and a Wise county local. “Until two years ago solar was a dirty word around here, not any more. I feel optimistic about the region for the first time in a long time.” The IRA doesn’t solve the hotchpotch access to PPA and net metering, which still depends on state laws and utility regulations, but it does expand access to tax credits which will make installation 30% cheaper for most, apart from the lowest-income households. Compared with industrial solar farms – which create lots of work during the construction phase but few long-term jobs, the distributed rooftop model is more sustainable: environmentally – because it does not require new land, and economically – because it creates long-term jobs as the systems are owned, operated and maintained by the same companies. But the workforce simply doesn’t exist yet – which is what prompted McFadden to partner with vocational schools and community colleges, that have for years been pivoting away from coal jobs. “We have to reinvent ourselves in south-west Virginia, and if we want to attract new industries we have to provide a skilled workforce. We’re trying to train our young people to stay and be taxpayers. We’ve lost too many,” said William Austin, the principal of Wise County career technical center, which also offers ninth, 10th and 11th graders vocational training in welding, plumbing, cybersecurity and nursing. In these parts, almost every family is connected to the coal industry in some way, and most have relatives who have left for work, and others struggling with health problems like opioid addiction. Austin is a former miner, his son an attorney representing black lung patients, and his wife is a respiratory therapist. It’s not uncommon in the county to see black lung patients walking gingerly with an oxygen tank. The attitude shift is not just economics, the climate crisis has also hit this region. Some students travel to the school from Jenkins, Kentucky, where devastating floods in July left roads and bridges unpassable. “The climate crisis is real, we have to do something about it,” said Anthony Hamilton, 18, another solar apprentice. Hamilton and Taylor will continue as apprentices while moving on to Mountain Empire community college, situated about 20 miles south-west. The remit of the higher ed college is to prepare students for jobs in the region, and recent state and federal legislation has kicked the renewables job market wide open, according to the college president, Kris Westover. “Before it was like sending students to dead-end careers, but now we’re ready and chomping at the bit to ramp up our courses to supply the alternative energy industry,” said Westover. ••• The coal region is in many ways ideally suited to become America’s renewable manufacturing hub, with existing plants and rail access that can be directed towards the transition. It will take time for the US to wrestle solar panel and lithium battery production from China, but the IRA includes a range of measures to incentivise innovation and manufacturing. In Bluefield, Virginia, family-run manufacturers have been getting help with market research and technical assistance to transition from serving the coal industry to making parts for electric vehicle charging stations and battery storage containers. “Coal got us to where we are … but it’s always been a boom-and-bust rollercoaster and it’s not going to take us to the next level,” said Melanie Protti-Lawrence, 42, president of Lawrence Brothers – a company started by her grandfather in 1974 to make steel containers to house batteries operated underground. A “friends of coal” sign hangs on the plant’s external wall, and several of the employees are former miners. But the coal industry accounted for less than 5% of their business in 2021, compared with 60% in 2018 and 98% in 2008. The company is just starting to dip its toe into the alternative energy sector, making prototype containers for next generation (Nexus) lithium-ion hybrid batteries, which currently accounts for less than 7% of their business. Coal mining continues for now, but with financial help on the horizon through the IRA, Protti-Lawrence is dedicating half her time to developing renewable energy opportunities in hopes that it will represent 25% of revenue in three to five years. “Central Appalachia has the manufacturing capacity, knowledge, experience and work ethic to serve the energy needs of the country and the world, it doesn’t have to be coal.

It was shortly after lunchtime on 6 January 2020, when the president of Toyota, Akio Toyoda, took to the Las Vegas stage of the world’s most influential tech event. “Virtually every industry is trying to predict the future,” said the energetic leader of the Japanese car giant. Arms open, he wore a wide, diagonally striped tie and a precisely tailored, single-button, charcoal suit. “From my perspective, no one wants a crystal ball as much as the automobile industry. Everyone wants to know … when will cars truly drive themselves? When will they know what I’m thinking? When will they fly?” Toyota’s free-roaming e-Palette is a fully automated, battery electric vehicle. Toyoda wasn’t actually striding the CES 2020 stage to unveil a flying car. In some ways, however, his announcement was far more profound. The world’s biggest car company, Toyoda said, would build its own prototype city of the future – creating an entire community from the ground up, and building an infrastructure that would be connected, digital and sustainable. Toyota’s dream is to create a place where people can live, work, play and participate in a real-world living laboratory. Up to 2,000 people will reside there, including Toyota employees and their families. It will enable researchers, engineers and scientists from around the world to come together to test and develop new technologies, such as mobility as a service, robotics, connected smart homes and artificial intelligence. Dubbed Woven City, Toyota’s project has been designed by famed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels and is being constructed on a 71-hectare site (a former car factory) at the foot of Mount Fuji. Toyoda referred to Woven City as “a test track for a mobility company”, ensuring safety for the vehicles, the roads on which they’re being driven, and the people. “We didn’t think that safe autonomous driving is achievable unless you make a human-centered city and test it there,” he said. “That was the number one motivation behind deciding to build this Woven City.” Now well on the way to becoming a reality, Woven City is also a key part of Toyota’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. In December 2021, Toyoda said the global company would expand options for carbon-neutral vehicles by offering a full line-up of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs). “Our goal is not only to reduce CO2 emissions and other negative impacts to zero,” he said. “Our goal goes beyond those.” Building on Toyota’s expertise with hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology, plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and fuel-cell vehicles, Woven City will show how this might work day-to-day. It will be sustainably powered – largely by rooftop solar and the company’s groundbreaking hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) technology – and function as a sort of living lab. It will be a place where Toyota – in collaboration with other business partners – will test how a greener future will work for the people who live there. “With people, buildings and vehicles all connected and communicating with each other through data and sensors, we will be able to test connected AI technology in both the virtual and the physical realms,” Toyoda said. The city’s development will be intriguing. But its fundamentals are already a working blueprint for tomorrow, showing how everyday life will evolve. Toyota is merging battery power with autonomous vehicles, serving Woven City citizens with swarms of Toyota’s self-driving e-Palette BEVs. Revealed by Toyoda at CES 2018, Toyota’s free-roaming e-Palette is a “fully automated, next-generation battery-electric vehicle designed to be scalable and customisable”, the company says. Think of a transparent cube on wheels, of various sizes according to purpose, that zooms about, performing multiple “mobile retail” services: as a taxi; as mobile, come-to-you, dermatologist’s rooms; as a literal Thai chef-in-a-box who whips up your gaeng keow gai on the move; as a try-it-on shoe store on wheels. “Just think how good e-Palette would be at Burning Man,” Toyoda quipped at the time. That combination of electric and autonomous tech is well advanced – and has widespread buy-in. Even in 2018, Toyota had agreements to collaborate on its e-Palettes with delivery giants from Amazon to Uber to Pizza Hut. In the future, car ownership for personal transport will be unnecessary for some people, a change Toyota is staying ahead of. And one that will mean many public roadways can be repurposed – with fewer, high-speed, dedicated commuter autobahns, and more green and pedestrian space. Like the cars, our cities will have to embrace green power, probably in a more decentralised way. So vehicle-to-grid, or V2G, technology will be commonplace, supplanting any need to buy an independent battery for your home to stockpile solar energy for evening use. Instead, you’ll use the battery in your BEV to store power, charged throughout the day by rooftop panels. Even current BEVs will typically contain enough capacity to power an average home for a couple of days. (V2G capability has been mandated in Japan for years for BEVs and PHEVs; the technology is expected in Australia this year.) Woven City has been designed by famed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels and features wooden buildings and photovoltaic solar panels. Those houses will change, too, in composition, function and connectivity. To minimise their carbon footprint, Ingles – the architect behind 2 World Trade Centre, Denmark’s Lego House, and Google’s 97,000 sq metre campus in Sunnydale, California – sees future buildings, like those in Woven City, championing wooden construction. Rooftops will obviously be festooned in photovoltaic solar panels, but new materials mean that even transparent glass could transform the way buildings generate solar power. The inside of buildings at Woven City will be “equipped with the latest in human support technologies, such as in-home robotics to assist with daily living”, Toyota says. “Homes will use sensor-based AI to check occupants’ health, take care of basic needs and enhance daily life, creating an opportunity to deploy connected technology with integrity and trust, securely and positively.” To help that overall goal, and to give its pioneering work in sustainable propulsion the best chance to cut through, Toyota has also engaged in a royalty-free arrangement to share 24,000 electrification patents. It’s a remarkable piece of transparency that embodies Toyota’s ambitious attitude to change. Toyoda’s CES 2018 address wasn’t just about the e-Palette. Two years before his Woven City announcement, the company president and CEO, and great-grandson of its founder, also announced Toyota’s “once-in-a-century” plans to evolve from the world’s biggest automaker to something more progressive. One with a detailed global zero-emissions 2050 target, and a six-point outline to embrace overall sustainability in line with what will be required of all of us to reach climate targets. “It’s my goal to transition Toyota from an automobile company to a mobility company,” Toyoda said. “And the possibilities of what we can build, in my mind, are endless.” Decarbonised living, intuitive mobility, and houses that alert the hospital when you’re ill. If the machines must rise, that’s a transformation we may be grateful for.

And few in the physical world can match the experiences of Alex Honnold, the American rock climber who has distinguished himself with ropeless ascents up some of the world’s most fearsome cliffs. No one had ever completed a “free-solo” climb of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park before Honnold famously did so in 2017, a feat that was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary. Now comes another film about Honnold, one that takes viewers as close they will probably ever get to the hair-raising exploits that have made him a rock star. The new virtual reality series, Alex Honnold: The Soloist VR, invites you to tag along as he embarks on free-solo climbs in the Italian and French Alps. Strap on a headset, and you’re immersed in a panorama of sky, snow and rock. Crane your head upward to watch as Honnold navigates his way to the summit. Peer over your shoulder, and you’re met with a sweeping view of wilderness. Look down, and – well, maybe don’t look down. The two-part series, which was released last week, offers up plenty of mind-blowing scenery. But it could be difficult viewing for some, and not just because it’s only available on Meta’s line of Quest VR headsets. “I think for some people it might be one of the most intense things they’ve ever watched,” Honnold tells the Guardian. “Even when I’m watching I’m like, ‘This is a lot.’ I did the actual climbs and it still feels pretty intense.” Honnold said even his family of climbers has only been able to consume the two half-hour episodes in “small doses.” “They’re really struggling to watch the whole film because it really puts them there,” he says. “I don’t know, it’s almost too much for them.” The Soloist was directed by Jonathan Griffith, a filmmaker who specializes in shooting mountain sports. An alpinist himself, Griffith says virtual reality is the “most powerful way to bring people into my world of climbing.” “I really fell in love with VR because the whole thing that motivates me in my work is to bring people into my world of the high mountains – the Himalayas, the Alps or wherever,” Griffith says. “You’re putting humans in these alien looking worlds, and it’s completely crazy. I love taking photos of that and sharing them with the world.” Griffith wisely eschewed music in the production, allowing viewers to take in all the raw, ambient sounds of Honnold’s climbs. At the end of the first episode, with Honnold on a free solo climb in the Dolomites, he pauses to tie his shoe. And suddenly, it’s just you and him on the precipice, both sharing a sublime view of the Italian Alps amid the unmatched stillness of nature. If you can avoid any bouts of vertigo – and you have access to the necessary hardware – the series is worth checking out for moments like that. “The thing that I love about soloing is being in these incredible places and having these powerful experiences,” Honnold says. “In the VR film, the scenes are long enough so the viewer can look around a little bit and get a taste of what I love about those places.” Honnold, 36, is still feeling the aftereffects of his triumph at El Capitan. The historic, ropeless climb of Yosemite’s famous monolith of granite was chronicled in Free Solo, which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2019 and brought Honnold even more fame. In January, he joined a long line of celebrities to make cameos on the Showtime series Billions. Honnold says he gets recognized in public more since the release of the documentary, which has also generated more commercial opportunities and increased exposure to his solar energy foundation. “Basically everything has been turned up quite a bit,” he says. “But at the heart of it, [the fame] hasn’t really changed the things that matter the most. I’m still climbing five days a week. I’m still spending my time on projects that are exciting to me.” Free Solo served as a window into what makes Honnold tick, and what it’s like to be in his orbit. Audiences saw his singularity of focus in his push to conquer El Cap, as well as the anxiety the pursuit brought to his friends. Throughout the film, Honnold wrestles with his personal life, openly wondering if a budding romance will compromise his climbing goals. In one scene, he and his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, discuss whether a family might cause him to recalibrate his capacity for risk. Since then, Honnold and McCandless have gotten married. Last month, they welcomed the birth of their first child. “I was always expecting to go through the full range of adulthood at some point,” Honnold says. “I always wanted to have a family eventually. I always wanted a stable relationship. It’s all according to plan.” Speaking by phone as he holds his newborn daughter, June, Honnold says that his expanded family hasn’t caused him to rein in his ambitions, noting that he completed the free-solo climbs for the VR series during his wife’s pregnancy. He didn’t climb for a week following the birth, as June remained in the hospital to receive treatment for now-resolved medical complications. “Now that I’m coming out of that, I’ve actually been feeling heroically strong,” Honnold says. “I wonder if that’s just a byproduct of fatherhood.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/30/space-billionaires-cosmic-earth-elon-musk-jeff-bezos","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-30T07:00:50Z","webTitle":"Could space-going billionaires be the vanguard of a cosmic revolution? | Martin Rees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/30/space-billionaires-cosmic-earth-elon-musk-jeff-bezos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/30/space-billionaires-cosmic-earth-elon-musk-jeff-bezos","fields":{"headline":"Could space-going billionaires be the vanguard of a cosmic revolution?","bodyText":"I’m old enough to have watched the grainy TV images of the first moon landings by Apollo 11 in 1969. I can never look at the moon without recalling this heroic exploit. It was achieved only 12 years after the first object, Sputnik-1, was launched into orbit. Had that momentum been maintained, there would surely have been footprints on Mars a decade or two later. That’s what many of our generation expected. However, this was the era of the space race between the United States and the USSR, when Nasa absorbed up to 4% of the US federal budget. Once that race was won, there was no motivation for continuing this huge expenditure. To young people today, these exploits are ancient history. Yet space technology has burgeoned. We depend on satellites every day, for communication, weather forecasting, surveillance and satnav. Robotic probes to other planets have beamed back pictures of varied and distinctive worlds; several have landed on Mars. And telescopes in space have revolutionised our knowledge of the cosmos. What’s more, humanity, or rather a narrow sliver of us, may be on the verge of an era of space exploration that makes the moon landings seem parochial by comparison. The last visitors to the moon – Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan, on Apollo 17 – returned in 1972. During the subsequent 50 years, human spaceflight has seemingly regressed: hundreds have ventured into space but, anticlimactically, none has done more than circle the Earth in low orbit, mainly in the International Space Station (ISS). The scientific and technical payoff from the ISS isn’t trivial, but it has been less cost-effective than robotic missions. Nor are these voyages inspiring in the way that the pioneering Soviet and US adventures were. The space shuttle was, until its decommissioning, the main vehicle for transporting people to and from the ISS. It failed twice in 135 launches. Astronauts or test pilots would willingly accept this level of risk – less than 2%. But the shuttle had, unwisely, been promoted as a safe vehicle for civilians (a female schoolteacher, Christa McAuliffe was one of the casualties of the Challenger disaster in 1986). Each failure caused a national trauma in the US and was followed by a hiatus while costly efforts were made, with very limited effect, to reduce risks still further. During this century, our whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturised probes. These technologies are far more advanced than Nasa’s wonderful Cassini probe, which was launched nearly 25 years ago on a seven-year journey, and spent 13 years exploring Saturn and its moons. In coming years, robotic fabricators may assemble vast lightweight structures in space: huge, gossamer-thin mirrors, for telescopes or solar energy collectors, perhaps using raw materials mined from the moon or asteroids. Such robots could repair spacecraft even in high orbits. Advances in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) are eroding the need for humans in space. The fact that the Apollo 17 astronaut Schmitt was a geologist enabled him to gather especially interesting samples of lunar rocks and soil. But future probes to Mars will be able to make such choices themselves. If you can get a robot to do it, why send a human at all? Nonetheless, I hope people do follow the robots – as adventurers, rather than for practical goals. Private-enterprise ventures such as SpaceX and Blue Origin have brought a Silicon Valley culture into a domain long dominated by Nasa and a few aerospace conglomerates. They have managed to improve rocketry and cut costs. Moreover, they can be less risk-averse than Nasa, and still find volunteers willing to tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly funded civilian astronauts. So it’s these cut-price ventures – with private sponsorship, rather than public money – that should be at the forefront of human space travel. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing that such ventures are routine and low-risk. And if that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle were. These exploits must be “promoted” as dangerous sports or intrepid exploration. Later this century, courageous thrill-seekers – in the mould of, say, Ranulph Fiennes or the early polar explorers – may well establish “bases” independent of the Earth. Elon Musk, the richest man on the planet, himself says he wants to die on Mars – but not on impact. But what is the longer-range goal? Musk and my late colleague Stephen Hawking envisaged that the first “settlers” on Mars would be followed by literally millions of others. But this is a dangerous delusion. Coping with the climate crisis is a doddle compared to terraforming Mars. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the top of Everest. There will be no “planet B” for most of us. But I still want to cheer on those pioneer “Martians” because they will have a pivotal role in shaping what happens in the 22nd century and beyond. This is because the pioneer settlers – ill-adapted to their new habitats – will have a more compelling incentive than those of us on Earth to literally redesign themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed in coming decades. These techniques will be, one hopes, heavily regulated on Earth – but those on Mars will be far beyond the clutches of the regulators. We should wish them luck in modifying their progeny to adapt to alien environments. This might be the first step towards divergence into a new species. It’s these space-faring adventurers, not those of us contentedly adapted to life on Earth, who will spearhead the post-human era. It’s perhaps in deep space – not on Earth, or even on Mars – that non-biological “brains” may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine. The sun will survive six billion more years before its fuel runs out. And the expanding universe will continue far longer – perhaps for ever. So even if intelligent life had originated only on the Earth, it need not remain a trivial feature of the cosmos: it could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever more complex intelligence spreads through the whole galaxy. Interstellar – or even intergalactic – voyages would hold no terrors for near-immortals. Even though we are not the terminal branch of an evolutionary tree, we humans could claim truly cosmic significance for jump-starting the transition to electronic entities, spreading our influence far beyond the Earth. But this raises a further question: will our remote progeny be the first intelligences to spread through the galaxy? Or will they encounter something already out there, whose origins lie on a planet around an older star where evolution had a head start over us?

","bodyText":"In her back pocket, Ana Diaz carries a smooth grey pebble she calls her “knock-knocker”. She uses it to get a loud rap on the front doors of the South Phoenix neighborhood where she is canvassing for the Democrats ahead of November’s crucial midterm elections. It’s 110F (43C) in the early afternoon sun, and Diaz is aiming to knock on 80 doors in this largely Latino neighborhood and speak to at least 20 people, encouraging them to vote. Diaz, a Los Angeles-based bartender and Unite Here union member, is a familiar face to many in this working-class area. In her T-shirt that reads “Worker power” she has been knocking on these doors since 2018. Voters are all talking about the economy. Diaz, too, worries about inflation: her grocery bill is so high she thinks she may have to stop buying beef. But for her, the Democrats and good union jobs are the answer. “When we get together, we can make them change,” she says. “Donald Trump called us ‘the crazies’. Well, we kicked him out,” she says as we walk the block, chugging water and looking for shade. Not many people were in. Diaz and her colleagues will be back. “We’re not going to stop.” Joe Biden narrowly won Arizona in the 2020 election, beating Trump with 49.4% of the vote to Trump’s 49.1%. As in neighboring Nevada, campaigners like Diaz who got out the Latino vote were crucial to that victory. It’s going to take every vote this time too for the Democrats to hold the state – where a crucial Senate seat is up for grabs and with it control of Congress. But Democrats enter election season with two major handicaps: the incumbent party historically loses seats in the midterms and the economy – the top issue for voters – is a mess. For the first time since 1980, when Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in a landslide, inflation is a major electoral issue. For decades the specter of inflation had seemed vanquished – hovering around 2% in the US. Now the shadow of soaring prices hangs over everything. In Phoenix, the inflation rate hit an annual rate of 13% in August, a record for any US city in data going back 20 years. The national average is 8.3%. History tells us that the economy is usually the deciding factor in US elections. But whose economy? If there is one word economists are using to describe the current state of the US economy, it is “weird”. Inflation is at a 40-year high and yet unemployment is at a 50-year low. There were more than 10m job openings in July in the US, over one and half jobs for every person currently looking for work. Interest rates are rising sharply, the once white-hot housing market looks like it could fall, loan rates are rising, and yet consumers are still spending. Phoenix maps all the contradictory signals the economy is sending. The city’s long economic boom continues. About 200 new residents have moved there every day in recent years, attracted by a lower cost of living and by businesses moving for less regulation and lower taxes. It’s not enough. The construction industry alone needs to add 265,000 qualified workers. Healthcare, financial services, all are struggling to fill vacancies. This pressure-cooker environment has led to soaring rents in the city – up 46% over the year – but still lower than many other US cities. The situation is particularly hard for lower-wage workers and long-term residents now competing with more moneyed migrants from nearby California and elsewhere. For many, wages are failing to keep up with the cost of living crisis as inflation pushes up the price of everything from gas and food to construction costs. “As cross-currents buffet the Arizona economy, it looks different depending on the lens used to view it,” University of Arizona professor George Hammond wrote in his latest report on the state of the state. Hammond is expecting slower growth in 2022 and 2023, which could help with costs but also cost people their jobs. Over the long term, he expects Arizona’s economy will still outpace the rest of the country. Diaz believes the Democrats are best placed to navigate these strange seas. “People are like, ‘I really don’t care who gets in.’ But you should. Your streets need cleaning, you have no lights, your alleys are full of trash, we have a problem with homelessness. If we don’t choose the right people to make these changes, it’s not going to happen,” she says. In Scottsdale, Phoenix’s affluent neighbor that is rapidly being absorbed by Phoenix’s sprawl, others have different views. “Biden is a nut,” says Jim Baumann, 60, shopping in Whole Foods in his orange Harley Davidson T-shirt. “He screwed this up.” His grocery bill now averages $300 to $350 a month he says, up from $200 before inflation bit. “I didn’t like Trump’s mouth, but he was better than Biden.” Like so many other issues in the US, views on the economy are fractured, filtered by political and personal views and not always in line with today’s party doctrine. Immigration is a major issue for Republicans, and one that has big economic consequences in the area. Kari Lake, the Trump-backed candidate for governor, has said the Central American migrants now entering the US “could be terrorists, they could be murderers and they are most likely hardcore criminals”. Blake Masters, running for Senate, has accused Democrats of being pro-immigration to “change the demographics of our country”. Privately, some local, Republican-leaning business leaders are embarrassed by the rhetoric and see immigration reform as essential to solving their worker shortages. At the same time Latino voters are not a monolithic bloc and shifted slightly right in 2020, a factor that could decide the race this time. Then there is abortion. Few decisions have greater economic consequences than the decision to have a child. In recent elections Republicans have paid the price for the supreme court’s decision to end the constitutional protection of abortion even in deep red states like Kansas. Last month an Arizona judge revived a highly restrictive law, that dates back to 1864, banning almost all abortions. Polls show the majority of Arizonans (Republicans and independents included) are in favor of keeping abortion legal in the state in most cases. All this complexity is exacerbated by the weirding of the economy. “Strange would be an understatement,” says Greg Ayres, president of Corbins and chief operating officer of Nox Group, construction companies that specialise in water and waste management, data centers and work for the semiconductor industry. Prices have soared for the construction industry, talent is in short supply, wages are rising and pandemic-related supply chain issues are still rippling through and causing delays. “Everything is so volatile,” he says. “Almost every project is over budget.” And yet business is good. His biggest immediate issue is finding enough people for all the projects he has on the go. The company employs 750 people at present, up from 650 before the pandemic. He would like to be at 1,000 within the year. “But it’s really competitive.” To attract workers, Corbin has upped its training programs, benefits and wages. Across the street from his office is a cavernous gym, recreation and health center with a full-time trainer on staff, added to attract and retain talent. Salaries are rising too. With overtime, Ayres says, a mid-20s journeyman, could make over $104,000 a year. The company will train up as many competent workers as it can get its hands on, he says. It’s the same story across the Valley of the Sun, says Todd Sanders, president of business lobby group the Greater Phoenix Chamber in 2009. “It’s almost like we are defying the laws of physics.” The area is suffering from high inflation like the rest of the county but companies are still moving there in large numbers, he says. “By and large we are seeing an economy that is still very strong. It’s an interesting time.” For some low-wage workers buffeted by these economic riptides “interesting” doesn’t even begin to describe it. People know Jarvis Johnson in Phoenix. He went viral for his high-octane audition on reality show So You Think You Can Dance, and again for his dedication to Black Friday bargain shopping. His friends describe him as a “ball of energy” and an “eternal optimist”. But when I catch up with him between jobs he seems tired. It’s not surprising. Johnson, 32, has been working three jobs to support his wife and his three young children. His day starts at 3.30am at a Covid testing center, and at 11am he starts his shift at a senior living center. Often he isn’t home before 8pm. He also puts in shifts at a local gas station, and is hoping to increase his hours there now that the Covid work is tapering off. All of the jobs pay better than Arizona’s minimum wage of $12.80 an hour. The testing job paid $25 an hour during the worst of the pandemic, and at one point Johnson was working there 40 hours a week. But even then, his wages were barely keeping up with the cost of living. Two years ago, when he moved into his apartment, he was paying $960 a month in rent. Now it’s close to $1,500. Gas prices have fallen in Arizona, as they have across the US, but are still about $4.90 a gallon, up from just over $3 a year ago. The couple have two cars and it costs $160 to fill them. Food is more expensive. His wife could go to work but daycare costs would wipe out her wages. “It’s crazy. Everything has got more expensive,” he says. “It’s hard. It’s hard right now. I’m just trying to keep my head up and not let my kids see I’m struggling. I have to work my butt off to make it. I’m getting by, but it’s still not enough.” Biden has promised a fairer, more equitable, economy. His administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which will increase taxes on the US’s largest companies and cut prescription drug prices. He’s also pouring money into solar energy and silicon chip production – both of which will benefit Arizonans. But will it be enough to persuade voters he really has a plan to steer them through this strange economic landscape?

The rate of the rise is even more striking, the fastest for 66m years, with scientists saying we are in “uncharted territory”. The causes (I): fossil fuel burning Billions of tonnes of CO2 are sent into the atmosphere every year from coal, oil and gas burning. The slight reduction in 2020 due to coronavirus lockdowns was no more than a “tiny blip” in the continuing buildup of greenhouse gases, according to the World Meteorological Organization. The causes (II): forest destruction The felling of forests for timber, cattle, soy and palm oil is a big contributor to carbon emissions. It is also a major cause of the annihilation of wildlife on Earth. The causes (III): farming Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and emissions are increasing faster now than at any time in 40 years of observations. Farming, especially cattle, as well as fossil fuel extraction and landfill sites are responsible. The consequences: global temperature rise The planet’s average temperature started to climb steadily two centuries ago, but has rocketed since the second world war as consumption and population has risen. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense. The consequences: rising sea levels Sea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand. Sea levels are slow to respond to global heating, so even if the temperature rise is restricted to 2C, one in five people in the world will eventually see their cities submerged, from New York to London to Shanghai. The consequences: shrinking Arctic sea ice As heating melts the sea ice, the darker water revealed absorbs more of the sun’s heat, causing more heating – one example of the vicious circles in the climate system. Scientists think the changes in the Arctic may be responsible for worsened heatwaves and floods in Eurasia and North America. The upside (I): wind and solar energy is soaring Huge cost drops have helped renewable energy become the cheapest energy in many places and the rollout is projected to continue. Analysts also expect coal use to fall. But much government action is still required to reach the scale needed, and tackle difficult sectors such as aviation and farming. The upside (II): electric vehicles The global fleet of electric cars and vans is still small compared with those running on fossil fuels. But sales are growing very fast. Electric cars are cheaper to run, suggesting they will become mainstream. The upside (III): battery costs Renewable energy is intermittent, depending on when the sun shines or wind blows. So storage is vital and the cost of batteries is plummeting. But other technologies, such as generating green hydrogen, will also be needed.

In 2019, Merton council declared a climate emergency and said the borough would become net zero by 2050. But that hasn’t stopped council officials ordering Syd Reid, who lives in Wimbledon, remove his panels because his property is in a conservation area. A year ago he put up photovoltaic panels on his south-facing roof at the front of his home in an effort to reduce the property’s carbon footprint without realising he needed planning permission to do so. He had been assured, wrongly, by the installer that he didn’t. “I did a cursory investigation but somehow missed the conservation area rules,” he said. “The main reason I thought I would be fine was that our immediate neighbour has had almost identical south-facing solar panels on their roof for more than 10 years. “What’s happened since has been something out of the dark ages. Someone has complained and the council has ordered them to be taken down. It’s as if the climate crisis isn’t happening.” In 2008, the government removed the need for most people to get planning permission to install photovoltaic solar energy systems but the requirement for permission was retained in conservation areas and for all listed buildings. After Reid received an order from Merton’s planning department instructing him to take the panels down, he submitted an application for retrospective planning, only for this to be rejected. He said he appealed against that decision but this, too, has been turned down. He said the decision is all the more baffling given that the road that he lives on features a mixture of house styles and roof types. Not even the road’s greatest fan would describe it in any way as architecturally extraordinary, or important. “While the panels have been up I have reduced my carbon emissions by over 400kg,” he said. “The whole thing is madness – a combination of nimbyism and inconsistent, out-of-date planning bureaucracy that is failing to recognise the state [in which] we are leaving the planet. This has to be changed. “Our neighbour’s panels have been producing electricity for 10 years without upsetting anyone but mine have to come down. If I wish to maintain my level of carbon emissions reduction I have been advised that the only course of action left is to take my case to the high court.” A spokesperson for Merton council told Guardian Money that while installing solar panels is “generally to be applauded”, the council also has a duty to protect the “character” of the local area. “The standards of design that have to be met will always be higher in conservation areas,” he said. He said two other houses in the road have approved solar panels but on north-facing roofs, rather missing the point that they will produce significantly less power than they would on a south-facing roof. “We don’t want to put residents off installing carbon saving measures,” the spokesperson said. “Our planning officers are here to work with them to achieve developments that are compliant with our planning policy. There are other options which might have less of a visual impact, such as low-profile PVs or the use of solar tiles.” Meanwhile, it now looks likely that Reid’s neighbour could be forced to remove their panels, too. “We have not looked into this yet as no formal complaint was raised. However, our officers will now look to inspect and regularise those solar panels,” the Merton spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/feb/24/supreme-court-case-biden-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-24T10:00:19Z","webTitle":"Supreme court case could restrict Biden’s effort to tackle climate crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/supreme-court-case-biden-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/feb/24/supreme-court-case-biden-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Supreme court case could restrict Biden’s effort to tackle climate crisis","bodyText":"Joe Biden’s faltering effort to tackle the climate crisis faces a further, potentially devastating, blow on Monday in a supreme court case that experts warn could severely restrict any future US government attempt to limit planet-heating emissions. The court has agreed to hear a case brought by West Virginia, supported by 18 other Republican-led states, that takes aim at the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) ability to issue strict regulations to curb pollution from fossil fuel-fired power stations. The decision by the conservative-leaning court to even consider an argument about a hypothetical regulation that hasn’t been proposed by the EPA has surprised onlookers. It is also an ominous sign for the authority of a Biden administration already frustrated over major clean energy legislation that has stalled in Congress due to opposition from Republicans and centrist Democrats such as West Virginia senator Joe Manchin. “This is a vitally important case that will define future federal action on climate change issues,” said Judith Enck, former EPA regional administrator and president of Beyond Plastics. “Congress seems unwilling or unable to address the climate crisis. Federal agencies need to be able to take action.” Even if Biden and his allies in Congress are able to pass the climate elements of the Build Back Better Act, which includes hundreds of billions of dollars in support for wind and solar energy and electric cars, most analysts say executive action to slash pollution from power plants, cars and trucks will still be needed if the US is to meet its emissions reduction goals and avert disastrous climate change. West Virginia’a lawsuit, filed last year and supported by various fossil fuel firms and rightwing groups, argues that the EPA shouldn’t be able to issue rules that “are capable of reshaping the nation’s electricity grids and unilaterally decarbonizing virtually any sector of the economy” and claims that Congress alone should decide on regulation of this scope. “This case is much more than about climate change, it gets down to who makes the decisions, should it be an unelected body of bureaucrats or should Congress provide the clear signal,” said Patrick Morrissey, attorney general of West Virginia, a state that’s a traditional epicenter of the now ailing coal industry. The Biden administration has pointed out there is no current EPA climate regulation on coal plants, meaning that there is no case to argue at all. “Petitioners lack standing to invoke this court’s jurisdiction because they are not injured,” the administration has argued in its brief. It’s unusual for the supreme court to hear a case where there is no active rule to challenge, according to Richard Revesz, a leading expert in environmental law at the New York University School of Law. “It surprised me they took this case, this would be an excellent candidate for dismissal,” he said. “In normal times, when the court wasn’t so skeptical of regulation, this case would’ve been dismissed. It would have a pernicious consequences if it were allowed because it could severely restrict agencies’ ability to regulate and these power stations are such big emitters.” The case has a tangled history that highlights America’s jarring absence of any climate regulations on the US electricity sector, which is responsible for a quarter of the country’s emissions, even as it has set emissions standards for the pollution spewed out by cars and trucks. In 2015, Barack Obama’s administration sought to remedy this via the Clean Power Plan, which aimed to restrict emissions from coal-fired power plants, only to be immediately challenged by Republican-led states and, in a highly unusual move, blocked by the supreme court before it took effect. Donald Trump’s administration then crafted a far weaker replacement for this rule that was itself struck down by the courts, with Biden so far declining to resurrect the original Clean Power Plan, or any more stringent alternative, in its place. West Virginia and its allies hope to curtail any future attempt by the EPA to become far more assertive in its interpretation of the landmark Clean Air Act, which requires power plants to use the “best system of emission reduction.” Environmental groups, which have lined up to oppose West Virginia’s claims, worry that the case is a further example of a rightwing judicial system intervening to toss out rules it does not like with the justification that they are too large, with damaging consequences for the climate crisis. Earlier this month, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Louisiana blocked the Biden administration from accounting for the real-world costs of climate change. “Even though there is no rule in place, the case is important because coal companies and their allies are attempting to get the supreme court to establish a broad precedent that meaningful protections for public health and the environment should be scrutinized and discredited on judicial review,” said Sean Donahue, counsel for Environmental Defense Fund. “Petitioners’ damaging legal theory would threaten our nation’s ability to protect clean air, clean water, and safe food for all people.” To some onlookers, the case is an unwanted further complication to a challenge that already has little time to waste. “There is no more time to delay curbing greenhouse gas emissions and finding solutions for a more equitable and just clean energy future,” said Carol Browner, former administrator of the EPA and now chair of the League of Conservation Voters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-10T05:38:10Z","webTitle":"Central Melbourne could generate three-quarters of its power from solar panels, study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","fields":{"headline":"Central Melbourne could generate three-quarters of its power from solar panels, study suggests","bodyText":"Central Melbourne has the potential to generate three-quarters of its electricity needs from solar power, according to new modelling. By integrating more solar panels into roofs, walls and windows, the City of Melbourne could generate 2,354 gigawatt hours of energy a year – equivalent to 74% of its current electricity consumption, the Monash University research suggests. Prof Jacek Jasieniak, a co-author of the study, said the capacity of solar panels currently installed in central Melbourne was only a fraction of what was possible. “There’s a massive opportunity to build photovoltaics into a city, and Melbourne CBD … could be, as a collective, a distributed energy powerhouse,” he said. The modelling focused on the City of Melbourne, a 37.4 sq km municipal area that includes the central business district, mid-rise developments in the inner-city suburbs of Carlton and South Yarra, and the industrial area of Port Melbourne. Rooftop panels accounted for the vast majority – 88% – of the potential solar energy the area could generate. Generating 2,354 gigawatt hours annually was “an ambitious target,” Jasieniak said. “That’s assuming that you’re getting pretty high-efficiency devices and you’re covering about 80% of the rooftops that are available.” To produce that amount of energy, Jasieniak estimated several million solar panels would need to be installed in central Melbourne. The researchers used 3D models that simulated how much sunlight would illuminate buildings during the day. The modelling took into account seasonal variations in the direction of the sun, the shadows cast by buildings, and building properties such as rooftop space and window-to-wall ratios. Jasieniak said the challenge was that many buildings have multiple tenants “and it’s not clear whose responsibility is it to ensure that there are maximised photovoltaics on those buildings”. The study made calculations based on the efficiency of PERC photovoltaic cells, an existing rooftop solar technology developed by University of New South Wales researcher Martin Green. It also assumed that solar panels would be integrated into building facades and windows, generating 8% and 4% of the calculated energy respectively. “True building-integrated photovoltaics replaces the wall,” Jasieniak said. While the technology to do that exists, he said, “it hasn’t been done at scale” on buildings in Australia yet. Solar windows – photovoltaic cells that generate energy but are transparent like glass – have been less commercially viable to date, because of their low efficiency of only 2% to 3%, Jasieniak said. “We’re working on technologies that increase efficiency by a factor of four or five.” His research group Exciton Science is collaborating with the CSIRO to develop solar windows made of a crystal material known as perovskite. Producing solar electricity close to where it is used minimises energy losses during transmission. “It needs to be a distributed network,” Jasieniak said, meaning it is spread across the city. He said there needs to be photovoltaics in fields to support areas where high density or solar integration was not possible. “You also want it to be in cities and in buildings.” Future building design could take sunlight and shadowing into account to maximise the potential of solar power, Jasieniak said. “In Melbourne, you could imagine that you could have slightly higher buildings towards the southern part of the city, so they can capture as much of that northerly sun as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/dec/01/uk-green-homes-scheme-was-slam-dunk-fail-says-public-accounts-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-01T06:00:54Z","webTitle":"England green homes scheme was ‘slam dunk fail’, says public accounts committee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/01/uk-green-homes-scheme-was-slam-dunk-fail-says-public-accounts-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/dec/01/uk-green-homes-scheme-was-slam-dunk-fail-says-public-accounts-committee","fields":{"headline":"England green homes scheme was ‘slam dunk fail’, says public accounts committee","bodyText":"The government’s green homes grant scheme underperformed badly and risks damaging future efforts to deliver net zero, the public accounts committee (PAC) said. Hailed by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a key plank in his green industrial revolution, the grants only upgraded about 47,500 homes out of the 600,000 originally planned. They also delivered a small fraction of the expected jobs. The grants were intended to support the public in England to make their homes more energy efficient and move away from fossil fuel heating by installing heat pumps and solar energy. But the PAC said the scheme unveiled in 2020 by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), was poorly designed and had a troubled implementation. The Guardian previously revealed the grants were administered by ICF, an American corporation based in Fairfax, Virginia. Renewable energy businesses said the administration of the grants was chaotic, inefficient, confused and created long delays for the public and those installing the systems. MPs on the public accounts committee said more than £1,000 per home upgraded was spent on administration; a total of £50m or 16% of the total spend of £314m. This was a fraction of the £1.5bn budget promised to upgrade 600,000 homes. The scheme began operation in September 2020 and was scrapped abruptly in March this year after just six months operating. Cutting carbon emissions from homes – which emit 20% of the UK’s CO2 – is seen as crucial if the country is to reach net zero by 2050. Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “It cost the taxpayer £50m just to administer the pointlessly rushed through Green Homes Grant scheme, which delivered a small fraction of its objectives, either in environmental benefits or the promised new jobs. “We heard it can take 48 months – four years – to train the specialists required to implement key parts of a scheme that was dreamed up to be rolled out in 12 weeks. It was never going to work at this time, in this way, and that should have been blindingly obvious to the department. That it was not is a serious worry, I am afraid there is no escaping the conclusion that this scheme was a slam dunk fail.” The MPs said they were not convinced that BEIS had fully acknowledged the scale of its failures with this scheme. Hillier said it was vital to have a massive step-change in the way homes and public buildings are heated. “But the way this was devised and run was just a terrible waste of money and opportunity at a time when we can least afford it.” The report said the failure of the scheme had damaged confidence in government efforts to improve energy efficiency in private domestic homes. The way government was tackling the issue of domestic heating was “fragmented, stop-go activity” which had hindered stable long-term progress towards its energy efficiency ambitions. The government awarded the administration of the grants to ICF, who had promised to deliver it in six weeks – other companies said fully implementing such a system would take at least 15 weeks – but ICF was not challenged by the department to explain how it could deliver, the report found. In the end, the department launched the complex scheme without an IT platform that had been fully developed and tested to run it. ICF struggled to implement the digital voucher application system, leading to greater amounts of manual processing being needed for applications, contributing to the delays in processing vouchers. The report found the scheme promised to create jobs but its design and duration limited its impact on employment and its abrupt closure may have led to redundancies. • The headline of this article was amended on 1 December 2021.

","bodyText":"Amid the triple crisis of the war in Ukraine, the still-raging pandemic and escalating inflation, climate scientists have just pulled off a truly impressive achievement. They have stood firm and persuaded the world’s governments to agree to a common guide to solving the climate emergency. Despite the despair of mounting global problems, the release of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows some grounds for hope. After the recent reports on the causes and effects of climate change, this one covers solutions – with a summary signed off by the world’s governments. The summary is blunt and clear, and in many places acknowledges realities that scientists and campaigners have known for years but governments often avoided directly admitting. First, it is clearly acknowledged that North America and Europe have made the greatest contribution to the crisis we are living through, by producing by far the most carbon dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution. The report shows that today the average North American emits 16 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year from fossil fuel use, compared to just 2 tonnes for the average African. Consumption by the top 10% of households comprises over a third of global of greenhouse gases, compared to 15% of these gases for the bottom 50% of households. Every government now agrees that the climate crisis is driven by how the world’s wealthy – which includes much of the UK’s population – currently live, consume and invest. This is a major leap forward compared to previous reports. The last IPCC summary on solutions in 2014 labelled population growth as one of “the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion”. Such dangerous misunderstandings are no longer present in the summary report. Seven years on, these old “blame the poor” arguments increasingly seem like a relic of a previous age. The new report is also admirably clear on how far governments are from meeting their commitments signed under the Paris agreement in 2015 and reaffirmed in Glasgow late last year. For all the UK government’s talk of “keeping 1.5 alive” in Glasgow, current climate policies and pledges will not limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, or keep it “well below” 2C, the dual Paris targets. Despite the the complexities of climate science, our course is terrifyingly simple to see: we are currently on track for catastrophic 3C heating. In a world where half of the its population is highly vulnerable to the climate crisis, that spells disaster. Extreme heatwaves, floods and droughts far outside the normal tolerances of cities and towns will destroy lives and livelihoods globally. The knock-on effects of crop failures, migration and economic disruption could then overload political institutions and our abilities to respond to unfolding events. If that feels depressing, there is cause for hope. Governments own this report. They have endorsed it, and they have signed it off. Their citizens can now hold them to account for the failures it details. The most heartening section of the report is on alternatives to fossil fuel use. The overarching solution to our energy needs is to electrify everything we can, from heating buildings to transport, and power everything using clean renewables and storage. We are getting a huge helping hand from great leaps forward in clean technology. Between 2010 and 2019, the report says that the cost of solar energy plummeted by 85%, wind energy by 55% and lithium-ion batteries by 85%. These are staggering figures that point to a radically reshaped energy future. With the tsunami of suffering that is about to engulf UK households from soaring energy costs set by skyrocketing gas prices, everyone in government needs to see this message. There is a cheaper, cleaner way. But the emissions problem is deeper than just failures to invest in low-carbon alternatives. The world already has enough existing and planned high-carbon infrastructure to blast past 1.5C. Retiring big emitters, such as coal-fired power stations, is needed. Plus, planned new oil fields and airports that lock in high emissions need cancelling. This report is essentially a manifesto for ending the fossil fuel age. It will help the growing mass of people fighting against the fossil fuel industry on many fronts – but especially those taking official channels, such as MPs lobbying government not to open new oil fields, lawyers and citizens taking countries or companies to court, or those justifying direct action to stop high-carbon infrastructure being built. The licence for climate action has never been stronger. There are also elements in the report that will be used by the fossil fuel industry to further delay climate action. Central to this is the discussion of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those who bank on business-as-usual will argue that later this century we will be able to suck carbon out of the air, so why bother cutting emissions as sharply as possible today? The answer, in the report, is that carbon removal “currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and sociocultural barriers”. The report rightly says that some carbon removal is needed, but it should never be an alternative to cutting emissions now. It makes clear how unrealistic very high carbon removal pathways are, in stronger terms than ever before. For those who have been working for a better climate, the full 3,000-page report contains an astonishingly frank assessment of the organised efforts used to thwart climate action, noting: “opposition to climate action by carbon-connected industries is broad-based, highly organized, and matched with extensive lobbying”. It may seem ironic that this doesn’t make it into the much more widely read summary, but it is perhaps not surprising. The intertwined relationship between fossil fuels and governments goes deep: last week, for example, we learned that the former UK boss of BP is to be appointed by the government to champion the UK’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Each year that passes adds further reasons to stop using fossil fuels. Last year, it became clear that gas prices would rise sharply, affecting millions. This year, we can add that fossil fuels fund the Russian military and its atrocities. Add these to ending urban air pollution and avoiding hundreds of millions of people suffering heatwaves, drought and floods. And the price? Investing a few per cent of GDP and some new legislation. Climate change can feel complex, but the IPCC has worked hard to make it simple for us. A path still exists to halve emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050, which will probably meet the 1.5C goal. It is a hopeful message. The task now is to make it real. • This article was amended on 18 May 2022 to clarify that population is not discussed in the 2022 summary report, but is discussed in the main report.

The study by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) published on Wednesday also estimates that only about 5% of this land, 408,000 acres, has been enrolled in sustainable farming programs announced by Tyson in 2018. The UCS findings are based on calculations of the amount of corn and soybeans Tyson required to feed the approximately 6 million head of cattle, 22 million hogs and nearly 2 billion chickens it processed in the US in 2020, drawing on data reported by Tyson. Most consumers do not appreciate how much land is needed exclusively to support industrial animal farming and the wider environmental impacts of that, said Marcia DeLonge, a senior scientist in the food and environment program at the UCS and co-author of the report. “We are using this land in a way that creates a lot of pollution and a lot of problems that contribute to climate change,” DeLonge said. Tyson Foods did not respond to requests to comment on the UCS research and questions about its crop feed footprint. Gidon Eshel, research professor of Environmental Physics at Bard College, said the scale of farming needed to produce animal feed contributes to many of the environmental problems of large-scale agriculture. These issues include changes to soil and the natural flow of water, the way solar energy relates to the earth, and disruption of plants and animals. Pollution from fertilizers and pesticides are another big concern, and the risks of contaminating drinking water and harming ecosystems. In 2020, 174m acres were used exclusively to plant corn and soybeans in the US – an area larger than Texas, which accounts for 56% of the US’s 310m total cropland acres – according to the UCS report. Some of these crops are used for biofuel and processed foods but, according to the US Department of Agriculture, most is used for feed crops. “Because [this land] could otherwise be used to grow foods eaten by people, feed crop production ultimately affects everyone,” the report said. There is a significant opportunity cost in growing feed crops, Eshel said. “If you produce 100lbs of corn and feed it to beef, you get 3lbs of edible beef. Because of this, using land to grow feed crops instead of food [for humans] is incredibly questionable – it’s wasteful,” he said. While Tyson itself does not own feed crop farms, its influence over the thousands of farmers in its supply chain is huge. The company, which produces about 20% of the pork, beef and chicken consumed in the US, is one of the nation’s largest buyers of feed. In 2018, the company announced a commitment to “support improved environmental practices” on 2m acres of corn it uses for feed crops by the end of 2020. Tyson said the pledge would “encourage grain farmers to adopt more efficient fertilizer practices, and take additional measures to reduce water runoff and soil loss”. Tom Hayes, the company’s then CEO, said in a statement at the time: “The world needs a more sustainable food system, and we believe it’s up to big companies like ours to set the pace with bold goals.” Today, however, only 408,000 acres have been enrolled into pilot sustainability programs and the company has pushed its deadline to meet the 2m mark to 2025, mainly citing Covid-related delays. Tyson’s dominant position means the company could be a leader in sustainable food practices but its current efforts fall short, said DeLonge. “Two million acres is an important step, but not only did they delay that goal, they’ve also only come through on 408,000 acres.” Even if Tyson achieves its 2m acre pledge, this land is only a fraction of the company’s overall impact. According to UCS’s estimates, Tyson’s total feed crop footprint is more than five times larger and close to 23 times the size of its current progress. DeLonge also questioned the lack of detail in Tyson’s pledge. “Enrolling those acres into sustainability pilot programs is a good first step, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that those acres are being managed in a way that is truly sustainable,” she said. Tyson Foods recently set a goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Sustainable feed crop farming means growing crops without damaging the environment, degrading resources or exploiting people, said DeLonge. “Achieving this would mean building and maintaining healthy soils, managing water wisely, minimizing pollution, promoting biodiversity and treating workers with dignity and respect,” she said. Last August the Guardian and UCS published a joint investigation which showed how Tyson’s near monopoly in its home state of Arkansas gives it huge power, at a cost to farmers and the environment. Tyson Food at the time defended its record as an employer and pointed to the economic activity the meat industry created. The new UCS report said that the environmental impact of croplands management can become worse in the face of farmland consolidation, explaining that for decades, the land used to grow crops has been merged into fewer and larger farms, undermining rural economies and communities across the US. “When a single company, like Tyson, has so much leverage over so much farmland, their actions can have substantial consequences,” said DeLonge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/31/as-cop26-begins-its-time-to-face-inconvenient-truths","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-31T17:57:03Z","webTitle":"As Cop26 begins, it’s time to face inconvenient truths | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/31/as-cop26-begins-its-time-to-face-inconvenient-truths","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/31/as-cop26-begins-its-time-to-face-inconvenient-truths","fields":{"headline":"As Cop26 begins, it’s time to face inconvenient truths","bodyText":"The budget represents a huge squandered opportunity for the UK to lead from the front as Cop26 begins. Particularly disappointing is the miserly support for low carbon energy. Energy companies have made some impressive investments in wind-powered and solar energy in Britain, but businesses will invest only where the risks are relatively low and the likelihood of profits relatively high. That leaves a whole range of actions that must be taken to decarbonise the economy, but where the private sector will not venture. Only the government has the economic power to take the risks that business shies away from, but Rishi Sunak has failed to pledge government support for decarbonisation to industry. David Humphreys Professor of environmental policy, Open University • In this week’s Cop26, countries will be urged to follow the UK’s “lead” in setting the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal is impossible for any advanced economy based on mass consumption. The majority of British manufacturing has shifted abroad, where labour is cheap and items are mostly produced with electricity supplied by coal and other fossil fuels. For a real figure for Britain’s emissions, the consumption of goods produced overseas must be included. It is a dangerous nonsense for rich countries, therefore, to pretend they are cutting carbon emissions. A British child during their lifetime may produce at least 200 times more carbon than a child born in Africa. For a meaningful response to climate change, reality must take precedence over PR. We may pull the wool over our own eyes, but nature cannot be cheated. Michael Stone Moretonhampstead, Devon • Your print headline, “A thundering wake-up call” (Report, 26 October), highlights a recent UN report that the world faces a disastrous temperature rise of at least 2.7C if countries fail to strengthen their climate pledges. With the Cop26 summit, hopes are high for pledges that will keep the planet from warming by no more than 1.5C, but expectations are low. We can expect the “blah blah blah” (to coin a phrase) to include planting more trees, replacing diesel and petrol cars with electric vehicles, more insulation of homes, more offshore wind farms and solar panels. Not now, but by 2050. The prime minister is looking for a pledge by developed countries for $100bn for less wealthy nations to help them adapt to climate change. Here is an alternative suggestion: let the rich nations pledge $100bn to a climate crisis project group consisting of the world’s top scientists. A bit like the Manhattan Project (but not trying to make an atomic bomb), these scientists will be charged with developing new tools in the fight to save the planet, such as technologies to scrub the atmosphere of greenhouse gases and store renewable energy. In the face of a crisis, human ingenuity knows no bounds. Dr Steve Hyer Wellington, Surrey • The sound of fiddles being tuned up and deckchairs scraping across decks are all we will hear at Cop26. It is left to us, citizens, parents and children, to fight for a future for the planet, and attempt to do all we can individually, as well as pressurising those who wield power, but are refusing to use it for the good of the children now being born into a bleak future.

Luckily, the UK’s stately homes, galleries, gardens, theatres, churches and steam trains have been planning ahead and are ready with art and music, fire and ice, and mince pies with Santa. Even the most resolute Scrooge should find something to enjoy. Sound and light Each year, more venues join the floodlit fun, and there are now hundreds of light shows around the country, often set to stirring seasonal music. New this year are Hatfield Park, Hertfordshire, where Elizabeth I grew up, and Leeds Castle in Kent. One of Europe’s biggest city parks, Roundhay Park in Leeds, is also launching a light trail, complete with a fairy-lit tunnel and a fire garden, that winds through the trees and past the lake (various dates in Dec). For the 10th anniversary of the fast-selling epic light trail at Kew Gardens in south-west London, there are new features, including the illusion of a watery abyss in the lake, as well as Instagrammable projections and lasers playing over the Palm House (until 8 Jan). There’s a lantern walk at Wakehurst, Kew’s wilder sister garden in West Sussex, along with immersive soundscapes and the UK’s tallest living Christmas tree, decorated with 1,800 fairy lights (until 1 Jan). There’s a new mile-long trail round the Shugborough Estate in Staffordshire this winter, where a festoon-hung walkway leads through the after-dark gardens, lighting up natural and architectural features (until 1 Jan). In nearby Lichfield, England’s only triple-spired medieval cathedral is offering a sound-and-light show called Sing, Choirs of Angels. Frederick Oakeley, who lived in Lichfield, translated the Latin carol Adeste Fideles into the English O Come All Ye Faithful. Projection artists Illuminos have based their installations on this popular carol and the story of the nativity (16-20 Dec). There’s a nativity-themed sound-and-light show in Sheffield too. The manger will be projected over the cathedral, inside and out, bathing the facade in sunset colours or spangling the columns with stars (29 Nov-4 Dec). The same team, Luxmuralis, are also creating a spectacular installation at Liverpool cathedral, called The Angels are Coming (2-9 Dec) and Winchester cathedral’s Star of Wonder, illuminating the high arches and vaulted ceiling (13-18 Dec). Sparkly castles Start with a bracing walk on the beach and a kipper stottie at the Lord Crewe in Bamburgh, Northumberland, then climb a sandy path through banks of ivy to the castle. Gold rings, partridges in pear trees, maids-a-milking … this year’s decorations in the grand hall and staterooms, with theatrical sets and lighting, are inspired by The Twelve Days of Christmas (until 8 Jan). At Windsor Castle, Berkshire, the lampposts are wreathed in evergreens, the grand staircase is garlanded, and a twinkling six-metre Christmas tree, harvested from the neighbouring Great Park, stands in St George’s Hall, where local choirs will be carolling on 8, 9 and 15 Dec. With a festive menu in the castle’s first cafe, opened in 2020 in the medieval undercroft, the show goes on at the new king’s official residence (until 2 Jan). The rooms inside chateau-style Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire, are decked and open to the public for the first winter season since 2019. The conservatory is full of ferns and marble statues, and the Red Drawing Room has a gold ceiling, candelabras and portraits by Gainsborough. Outside you’ll find a Christmas market and a light trail through the landscaped grounds (until 2 Jan). This year’s Kingdom of the Snow Queen at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire involves supersized snowflakes and silver-frosted forests shimmering through the procession of staterooms. Outside, there’ll be a lavish light trail (book online) and a Christmas market (until 2 Jan). The art of Christmas shopping Brighton and Hove Artists Open Houses are running a winter festival on weekends until 11 Dec. Alongside prints, paintings, ceramics, they will be selling jewellery, knitted hot-water-bottle covers, lambswool gloves and more. Cards and pictures are often inspired by local seascapes or Brighton’s starling murmurations, which swirl through the winter sunset over the pier. Cockpit Open Studios in London is holding weekend sales in Bloomsbury (24-27 Nov) and Deptford (2-4 Dec) and championing the idea of sustainable slow design. The Makers Guild in Wales has a Winter Show at Cardiff Bay, with handmade decorations and stocking fillers, as well as larger works of art in glass, leather, patchwork or carved wood (until 8 Jan). There’s a Made in East Yorkshire market in the minster town of Beverley (7-9 Dec) to kick off its Festival of Christmas (11 Dec), which will fill the town centre with more than 100 stalls, fairground rides and street entertainers. Illuminating in more ways than one, Tate Liverpool is displaying this year’s Turner prize contenders (until March 2023), and there are interesting gifts in its colourful shop. There’s also a free light trail circling the colonnades of the Royal Albert Dock, passing a giant yellow submarine and glowing jellyfish, with bars and cafes selling everything from fresh croissants to happy hour cocktails. Oh no, it isn’t! Excellence in panto is recognised at the Pantomime Awards, and Morgan Brind, who won best dame last year, is back at Derby Arena, this time as Widow Twankey in Aladdin (9-31 Dec). Winner of best costumes, Celia Perkins, is doing the designs again at Oldham Coliseum, (until 7 Jan), where it’s Robin Hood this year, and Jonny Bowles is directing Cinderella at the Belfast Grand Opera House, where he scooped the choreography prize with last year’s Goldilocks (3 Dec-15 Jan). The Lyric Hammersmith stages the coolest pantos in London and this year it will be Jack and the Beanstalk, complete with skateboarding, OTT outfits and Beyoncé numbers (until 7 Jan). There’s a new digital set, using LED screens for the first time alongside traditional elements, at the Swansea Grand for Beauty and the Beast, starring Strictly glitterball-winner Joe McFadden (14 Dec-15 Jan). Seasonal bars and cinemas Manchester, where the UK’s first Christmas market opened at the end of the last century, has some unbeatable venues. The city’s Piccadilly Gardens becomes Winter Gardens, and this year sees a huge new heated double-tipi bar with a fire pit. Nearby food stalls include plant-based Panc, whose colourful vegan bratwurst was given top marks last year in the Manchester Evening News. Escape to Freight Island, a bar and restaurant complex in an old depot near Piccadilly station, reinvents itself for the season as Winter Island with music and a rooftop ice rink (until 24 Dec). An abandoned Edwardian railway station above the site has become a new Backyard Cinema, opened in October, with giant beanbags for watching Home Alone, Love Actually and other festive films. The cinema itself is dressed movie-set-style, so visitors arrive through tree tunnels into an overgrown palace (until 2 Jan). The original Backyard Cinema in Wandsworth, south London, has an Arctic voyage theme this winter. Another venue in the cinema-as-experience trend, the Scotsman Picturehouse in Edinburgh, opened under the Scotsman hotel in 2019, has red leather armchairs, retro lamps and free popcorn. Pricey-but-fun festive packages mean customers can sip prosecco while watching It’s a Wonderful Life. For even fancier offerings, Blythswood Square in Glasgow is offering Baubles and Brunch: screenings of Elf and Home Alone can be followed by two courses including steak and chocolate sundae. The Luna Winter Cinema festival at Saint George’s Hall in Liverpool has a giant screen under the columns and barrel-vaulted ceiling (10-23 Dec). And Liverpool cathedral is one of 11 venues for the Snowman Tour, where a live orchestra accompanies a screening of The Snowman and Aardman’s The Flight Before Christmas for a feelgood festive show (various dates). Take to the ice The ornate domes and minarets of Brighton’s Royal Pavillion glow blue and purple while skaters circle the ice beside them on a seasonal rink powered entirely by renewable wind and solar energy (until 8 Jan). Scotland’s biggest seasonal rink is outside the fabulous Kelvingrove Museum in Glasgow with lights, music, a separate toddler rink and adults-only sessions after 9pm. There’s also a new 15-metre-high ferris wheel for a bird’s-eye view of the whirling skaters below (until 24 Dec). A short walk away, in the vaulted cloisters of Glasgow University, there’s a free carol concert on 13 Dec. Cardiff’s free-to-enter Winter Wonderland has a skating rink, the city’s only ice bar (tickets include iced shot and rented warm coat), and an ice walk through the castle, stretching 150 metres past the Norman keep (until Jan 8). The bar is kept at -10C, so it and the frozen seats don’t melt. Even the air-hockey table is made of ice and there are ice sculptures, this year on an undersea theme. Cardiff also has a light trail in Bute Park (until 1 Jan) and a Santa’s grotto in the changing rooms at the rugby stadium (Dec 2–24). Santa’s grotto with a twist Thousands of Father Christmases will be donning their red coats and white beards this winter, in shops, theme parks, zoos and castles. One imaginative idea is a reverse grotto at the National Trust’s Erddig Hall in Wrexham. You bring a donation for the local food bank, chat with Santa, see the 18th-century manor halls decked for Christmas, and follow a Rudolph-themed trail around the grounds. The Erddig estate’s 1,200 acres have waymarked woodland walks to the castle mound and a cathedral-style avenue of tall beeches and hornbeams. Windows on one side of the house become a giant advent calendar and the restaurant is open for cake and hot chocolate (weekends only, 3-18 Dec). There’s another reverse grotto at Chirk Castle, a medieval fortress near the Welsh-English border (various dates). Winter walks in the area include the castle’s oak woods, Chirk aqueduct and the Llangollen canal towpath. A reindeer trail through the grounds of Biddulph Grange in Staffordshire leads to Father Christmas in his cottage. Biddulph Gardens, a maze of spaces with topiary pyramids, a sphinx-flanked summerhouse, Chinese pagoda and Himalayan glen, are great for kids in any season, with bridges, tunnels and terraces to explore (various dates). Belfast’s Titanic Experience has a Christmas package involving a trip to see Father Christmas via a wishing tree in an enchanted forest, a workshop for handmade gifts and a post office for Christmas letters (until 23 Dec). The Historic Dockyard at Chatham, Kent closes as usual for December, but – for the first time this year – is running Mission Christmas, with a visit to Santa including a submarine adventure (until 24 Dec). Deck the halls Long Live the Christmas Tree! is the title of this year’s arty winter festival at Harewood House in West Yorkshire. Ten artists and makers have fashioned new versions of traditional trees from upcycled bottles, intricate paper mobiles, botanical sculptures using leaves from the gardens, and a carnivalesque celebration called One Love. There’s a pagan-style tree made with antlers in the Cinnamon Drawing Room, and a rotating, crystal-studded copper tree in the Music Room. People arriving car-free get half-price entry, and there are regular buses from Leeds and Harrogate. There is also 150 acres of grounds to explore, with illuminated walks, overwintering geese and bright holly berries before the drifts of lakeside snowdrops bloom again (until 2 Jan) At National Trust-owned The Argory, in County Armagh, the theme is Yesteryear, with the neoclassical house decked for a traditional festive season and open at weekends. The banisters are wreathed in greenery and baubles, and the grounds are home to robins, grey squirrels and a Christmas fair on 3-4 Dec. Visitors can make their own natural Christmas wreath, decorated with berries and leaves from the estate, at Downhill Demesne in County Derry. The workshop, with festive refreshments, takes place in thatched Hezlett House, one of Northern Ireland’s oldest domestic buildings (selected dates). Festive tram and train rides Illuminated heritage trams are running evening tours of Blackpool’s six miles of lights, which are shining for an extended season (until 2 Jan). Originally modelled in the 1960s, the trams are shaped like steam trains or open-topped boats. TV interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen has given Blackpool’s Golden Mile an art-deco-style makeover this year. The promenade between the resort’s two piers now has what Llewelyn-Bowen calls “dynamic corridors of scintillating coloured light”. This season’s display includes a drag-themed digital show and a seven-metre-high walk-through beach balls. Blackpool’s festive village, Christmas by the Sea, includes a new free skating rink and artificial snow (until 2 Jan). There’s a grotto inside a decorated train carriage on the harbour at Porthmadog, Snowdonia, where the Ffestiniog railway’s Winter Wanderer service sets off into the frosty hills. There are hot drinks and mince pies on sale at the station cafe to enjoy with the scenery (various dates). A Train of Lights chugs along Dartmouth steam railway in Devon, through the 450-metre Greenway tunnel to an enchanted forest. On the way back, the town’s glowing windows and street lamps will be reflected in the river Dart (until 30 Dec). Sculpture trails Channel 4 first screened Raymond Briggs’s The Snowman 40 years ago and has shown it every Christmas since. Individually painted to represent the 12 days of Christmas, giant sculptures based on the Snowman form a free trail around Hitchin in Hertfordshire (until 20 Jan). There’s also a craft fair in Hitchin’s Schools Museum (3-4 Dec) and local cafes to warm up in include Molly’s Tea Room, with its bay window full of teapots and teddy bears. There’s another trail of snowmen at Winkworth Arboretum in Surrey. Camellias, mahonia, witch hazel and early snowdrops flower in the winter garden and down the wooded slopes, and mist rises from the reed-fringed pond on cold days. For the festive season, there are free traditional games and a carousel. Afterwards, there are mince pies and marshmallow-topped hot chocolate in the cafe, with 25p off for those who bring a reusable cup (trail until 2 Jan). Birmingham has a walking trail of 15 emperor penguin sculptures, a huge Frankfurt Christmas market (until 23 Dec), plus a programme of ballets, concerts and pantomimes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/09/firms-will-go-bust-germany-prepares-for-a-future-without-russian-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-09T11:00:09Z","webTitle":"‘Firms will go bust’: Germany prepares for a future without Russian gas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/firms-will-go-bust-germany-prepares-for-a-future-without-russian-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/09/firms-will-go-bust-germany-prepares-for-a-future-without-russian-gas","fields":{"headline":"‘Firms will go bust’: Germany prepares for a future without Russian gas","bodyText":"In Germany, they call it “Day X”. Businesses up and down the land are making contingency plans for what is seen as a growing likelihood that Russian gas will stop flowing into Europe’s biggest economy. “It would be a disaster – one which would have seemed almost unthinkable just two months ago, but which right now feels like a very realistic prospect,” the owner of a hi-tech mechanical engineering company in western Germany said. The firm produces everything from battery cases for electric cars to train clutch systems. The speaker did not want to be named, or for his company to be identified, in part for fear, he said, of appearing to support Russia’s war by making the case that if the gas is turned off, his century-old business “will likely not survive”. But he says he is in a deep quandary and feeling very vulnerable, as he is not only heavily reliant on gas – the cost of which has already soared – but also on metals such as nickel and aluminium, much of which comes from Russia. Germany gets around 50bn cubic metres a year or 55% of its gas from Russia, the largest by volume of any EU country, and by extension, the biggest share of any large European economy. Two possible, not unlikely scenarios are being mooted: one envisages Moscow deciding to cut off or reduce supplies in retaliation for sanctions; the other sees Germany giving in to mounting pressure to support an EU energy embargo according to which the recipients would effectively call Putin’s bluff by cutting themselves off from Russian supplies. On Friday at the Brandenburg Gate, protesters in favour of an oil and gas embargo made their point for the moral argument, with 410 red lights commemorating the victims of Russian army killings in the town of Bucha, alongside slogans asking German chancellor Olaf Scholz: “If not now, when?” Their message is stark. As long as German industry keeps taking the energy – for which it pays Moscow €200m (£167m) every day – it is helping fund the atrocities. But industry bosses and political leaders have warned that the damage to Germany by turning off the taps would be far greater than any benefit it brings to Ukraine. “What use to anybody is a weakened Germany?” a source close to the government told the Guardian this week. Millions of private homes without heat is just one part of the picture. The other, arguably bigger concern, are the manufacturing giants, dependent on gas to operate, such as Thyssenkrupp, BASF and Bayer. And the hundreds of thousands of small and medium sized businesses with which they are interlinked. Industry representatives have warned that the effects would be felt in every product from construction material, synthetics, pesticides, disinfectant, packaging and semiconductors to the production of antibiotics, coronavirus vaccines and cancer drugs. The chain reaction is difficult to predict but likely to be considerable. Robert Habeck, the economics minister, has urged Germans to “turn down the thermostat” – saying that “every kilowatt hour that Germany saves harms Putin” – what some have cynically dubbed “freezing for Ukraine”. Industry too is being urged to scale back its use. Some have done so already, forced by the high energy costs. Others, such as the porcelain manufacturer KPM, founded in 1763, are working overtime to produce as many goods as possible before the taps are turned off. “Who knows for how long we will have gas?” its CEO, Martina Hacker, told Der Spiegel. “We can’t produce porcelain without it.” Other companies have reduced production to a minimum. But industries such as glass manufacturers say shutting down production facilities altogether is not an option as it would cause liquids to set and destroy the machines. The country’s 45 gas storage facilities are only about 26% full. The plan is to increase levels to 80% by the autumn, largely by saving energy now, in order to safeguard supplies for next winter. Habeck triggered the first part of a three-point emergency plan last week that anticipates a slow-down or halt of gas and decides where supplies would go. Hospitals, emergency services and medical manufacturers would be prioritised, followed by private households. Industries, which use a quarter of the gas delivered to Germany would be the first expected to shut down, according to the plan. Which is why businesses are being asked to put forward their arguments as to how “system relevant” they are. Law firms have been flooded with queries from companies wanting to know their legal standing, while industrial associations report being inundated with queries by members asking where they rank in the pecking order and how they should react to the uncertainty. One representative said: “We have glass manufacturers saying they are system relevant because they provide the medical industry with glass vials, paper manufacturers, arguing that their corrugated cardboard is vital for the safe transport of the vials. How do you possibly argue against them?” The Federal Network Agency, which ensures fair access to gas, electricity and other vital services, has sent a questionnaire to all German businesses, asking them to effectively set out their individual arguments for a right to gas. “The question of prioritisation is a very difficult decision, requiring consideration of a wide range of consequences,” said a spokesperson for the economics ministry. Some predict an ugly battle over who deserves the energy most. There are doomsday visions of supply chains – already under pressure due to the pandemic – collapsing altogether, businesses forced into bankruptcy, mass unemployment. Jörg Hoffmann, the head of IG Metall, a union that represents 1.2 million workers in the chemical, metal processing and food production, has warned of “a recession deeper than any of the recessions we have known until now.” BASF, the chemical giant, and one of Germany’s biggest single purchasers and consumers of energy, said the effect of its production downturn would soon be felt. “We would get very high unemployment, many firms would go bust,” the BASF chairman, Martin Brudermüller, has said. “It would lead to irreversible damage. To put it bluntly: it could lead Germany into its most serious crisis since the end of the second world war, and destroy our prosperity.” A race against time is on to find alternative gas source supplies from the Netherlands and Norway and increase liquid natural gas (LNG) supplies from Belgian terminals and the US. Habeck has been to Qatar to secure further shipments and has ordered the construction of LNG carriers to float in German ports rather than wait for the construction of proposed new LNG terminals, which will take too long. The abolition of coal-fired plants – seen as a central part of the climate emergency plan – may yet be delayed. The pressure is on to scale up and speed up renewable projects in wind and solar. Companies such as the pharmacy giant Merck are making their own plans to build wind turbines and solar energy panels to increase their independence – if only to be able to heat their offices. But it is a gargantuan effort that will probably take years and in the meantime Germany is left looking extremely vulnerable. Some companies are even contemplating moving their production facilities abroad, predicting that operating in Germany will become prohibitively expensive and triggering fears Europe’s economic motor is in danger of losing its competitive edge. While Habeck believes Germany is in a position to wean itself off Russian gas in around two years’ time, Brudermüller believes four to five years is more realistic. Some experts say by the end of the decade is more likely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2021/oct/18/home-office-criticised-over-handling-of-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-18T06:00:08Z","webTitle":"Home Office criticised over handling of Sri Lankan scientist’s asylum claim","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/18/home-office-criticised-over-handling-of-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2021/oct/18/home-office-criticised-over-handling-of-sri-lankan-scientists-asylum-claim","fields":{"headline":"Home Office criticised over handling of Sri Lankan scientist’s asylum claim","bodyText":"A scientist conducting groundbreaking research into renewable energy is facing deportation with his family to Sri Lanka, where he experienced torture, after receiving contradictory information about his case from the Home Office. Dr Nadarajah Muhunthan, 47, his wife Sharmila, 42, and their three children, aged 13, nine and five, came to the UK in 2018 after Muhunthan, who is working on thin-film photovoltaic devices used to generate solar energy, was given a prestigious Commonwealth Rutherford fellowship. The award allowed him to come to the UK for two years to research and develop the technology. His wife obtained a job caring for elderly people in a nursing home. The family are Tamils, a group that has experienced persecution in Sri Lanka. In November 2019, Muhunthan returned to his home country for a short visit to see his sick mother. While there he was arrested and persecuted by the Sri Lankan government. He managed to escape and returned to the UK, where he claimed asylum on the basis of what he had experienced on his visit to Sri Lanka. After his scholarship expired in February 2020, neither he nor his wife were permitted to continue working. A Home Office case worker sent an email on 20 September this year, saying the family’s asylum claim was “under active consideration”, and another email on 11 October saying the asylum claim had been refused on 23 August – 28 days before the family were told their case was still under consideration. The family had been renting accommodation in Bristol and all the children were settled at school there. The couple’s eldest daughter, Gihaniya, received outstanding school reports with a 100% attendance rate and was particularly praised for her achievements in science. She hopes to study to be a doctor when she is older. The Home Office moved the family from their rented accommodation in Bristol to a London hotel last month, uprooting all three children from school. The two younger children now have school places but Gihaniya does not and is confined to the hotel. “It is so boring here. It is like a prison,” she told the Guardian. “I just want to go to school. Sometimes I put on my school uniform and just go and stand in the street.” When Muhunthan’s scholarship visa first expired, the manager of the nursing home begged the Home Office to allow Sharmila to continue working. “We are in dire need of trained healthcare staff and we urge you to consider Mrs Sharmila Muhunthan’s right to work for us as a matter of urgency,” her manager wrote. The request was refused. A year after lodging his asylum claim, Muhunthan was given permission by the Home Office to work because his area of expertise was listed as a shortage occupation. However, although he applied for university research jobs, the fact that he did not have UK residency deterred prospective employers. Both John Penrose, the family’s Conservative MP in Weston-super-Mare, where they previously lived, and their lawyer, who has issued a legal challenge against the Home Office about its handling of the case, criticised the department’s treatment of the family. In a letter to the home secretary, Priti Patel, on 1 October, Penrose wrote: “This looks like a wholly avoidable situation which has been caused by UK visas and immigration working too slowly.” The family’s lawyer, Naga Kandiah of MTC solicitors, said: “There is growing concern over the state of human rights in Sri Lanka, with the UN high commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, noting that ‘surveillance, intimidation and judicial harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and families of the disappeared has not only continued, but has broadened to a wider spectrum of students, academics, medical professionals and religious leaders critical of government policies’.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “All asylum and human rights claims will be carefully considered on their individual merits in accordance with our international obligations.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/25/can-germany-function-without-vladimir-putins-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-25T09:07:15Z","webTitle":"Can Germany function without Vladimir Putin’s gas?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/can-germany-function-without-vladimir-putins-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/25/can-germany-function-without-vladimir-putins-gas","fields":{"headline":"Can Germany function without Vladimir Putin’s gas?","bodyText":"The Ukraine crisis has plunged Germany into an intense debate about how it will heat its homes and power its industry in future, summed up in the short question: can Europe’s largest economy function without Vladimir Putin’s gas? The Green federal economics minister, Robert Habeck, answered with a decisive “yes it can”, a day after the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, announced the suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was meant to deliver from Russia as much as 70% of Germany’s gas requirements. There are considerable doubts as to whether the $11bn project will ever now go ahead. But even before Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday morning, NS2 was just a small part of the wider discussion some say Germany has been far too slow to have. At stake is nothing less than the future of German – and by extension European – energy security. Germany announced its withdrawal from nuclear power after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and in 2019 said it would pull the plug on coal-fired plants, leaving observers wondering how the country was planning to make its energy policy workable and future-proof. Sceptics have questioned how it made sense for Germany to make itself so dependent on Russian gas when it should be distancing itself from Putin’s autocratic machinery. Until recently, the answer from the top of government was that this was an economic project, not a political one. The robotically repeated mantra now sounds at the best naive, and at the worst, given the current turn of events, a self-defeating decision which has helped fund Putin’s war. Habeck admitted “we face turbulent days ahead”, as he promised on Wednesday that the government would provide relief where necessary to compensate for the expected rise in gas prices. One of the government’s main predicaments is whether it can deliver on its promise to make a switch to renewable energy sources in order to reach its climate goal to become carbon neutral by 2045. Gas is seen as the vital bridge in that endeavour, which, while seen as ambitious by international standards, is viewed by many climate experts as barely adequate. Importing liquified natural gas (LNG) has been viewed as one option as part of a diversification strategy. However, this has been beset by numerous problems – not least the lack of a terminal in Germany necessary to handle LNG imports. Neither would available LNG supplies be able to fully replace Russian gas and it is also an expensive alternative. Gas already comes from Norway, but those supplies cannot be increased as it is already producing to capacity. Leonhard Birnbaum, the CEO of Germany’s biggest gas and electricity provider E.ON, said that while energy supplies for this winter were secure, next year could be more of a challenge. “If Russian gas imports were to break down completely, the immediate effect wouldn’t be so dramatic as we’re almost at the end of the heating season. But next winter it could be the case that we’re not able to meet the supply demands of all the industrial customers. Some of them may have to turn off the power. It is utopian to believe that Russian gas can be completely replaced from one day to the next by other sources,” he told Die Zeit. Other critics have said Germany only has itself to blame, having dillydallied on its much vaunted plans to switch from fossil fuels to renewables. A positive headline to emerge from the recent heavy storms which hit much of northern Europe, was the record amount of energy fed into the grid by its wind turbines on Sunday. But it also served to underline how slow the development of renewables has been. Beyond Germany’s borders the short-term answer is thought to be simple: why not reverse the decisions, or at least prolong the use of coal-fired power plants and temporarily restart the nuclear reactors? But these options are seen as politically suicidal in Berlin – in particular the reactivation of nuclear plants (as well as being highly impractical and disastrous from a legal point of view). Opposition to nuclear was the founding principal of the Green party – two of whose former leaders, Habeck and the foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, are now in government. Both have always opposed the pipeline. There is no evidence of ordinary Germans panicking, although heating installation companies say there has been a considerable increase in inquiries about heat pumps from people keen to find an alternative to the gas central heating. “In the short term it won’t be easy to move away from natural gas,” Hans-Martin Henning, the head of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, told Tagesspiegel. “But in the medium term this must be part of the concept of speeding up the energy source switch in the heat sector and wherever possible electrical heat pumps should be used as a way of becoming more independent from natural gas.” Andreas Löschel, an energy economist, told the same newspaper that even before the Ukraine crisis, Russia had destroyed its own narrative about being a reliable provider of cheap gas. “The trust is no longer there,” he said. “Russia has shot itself in the foot”. Just days ago at a press briefing with Scholz in Moscow, Putin heaped praise on Scholz’s fellow Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder, the former German chancellor turned lobbyist for Gazprom, saying he was responsible for brokering generous fuel rates. It was one of Schröder’s final acts in office in 2005 to sign the NS2 deal before he was appointed chairman of the company behind it. On Thursday calls were growing for the government to remove Schröder’s privileges as a former chancellor, including an office and staff, amid reports they cost the taxpayer more than €400,000 (£344,244) a year, on top of his considerable earnings from lobbying for companies including Rosneft and Gazprom. An online petition said a “former chancellor who is financed by autocrats, and makes himself dependent on them, in so doing ridiculing German interests, should no longer be financed by the German taxpayer”. Some politicians called for him to be added to the list of individuals facing sanctions. Writing on the LinkedIn platform, Schröder said although “many mistakes” had “been made on both sides” in the relationship between the west and Russia, Russia’s “security interests did not justify its intervention by military means”. He called on the Russian government to “end the suffering of the people in Ukraine as soon as possible”. He also warned against “cutting the remaining political, economic and societal connections” between Europe and Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/feb/22/why-is-a-tech-billionaire-trying-to-buy-australias-dirtiest-energy-company-agl","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-21T16:30:21Z","webTitle":"Why is a tech billionaire trying to buy Australia’s dirtiest energy company AGL?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/why-is-a-tech-billionaire-trying-to-buy-australias-dirtiest-energy-company-agl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/feb/22/why-is-a-tech-billionaire-trying-to-buy-australias-dirtiest-energy-company-agl","fields":{"headline":"Why is a tech billionaire trying to buy Australia’s dirtiest energy company AGL?","bodyText":"What exactly is being proposed? It is, by any measure, an extraordinary intervention in Australia’s rapidly evolving electricity market. A consortium worth hundreds of billions of dollars on Saturday lodged a formal offer to buy AGL Energy – the country’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter – for just short of 5% above the closing share price on Friday. The headline name behind the bid is Mike Cannon-Brookes, the 42-year-old co-founder of software company Atlassian, green solutions investor, climate action advocate and one of Australia’s richest people. But in reality, Cannon-Brookes’ company Grok Ventures is the smaller player in the consortium, which is led by Brookfield, a Canadian investment giant with $688bn worth of assets under management last year. Including AGL’s debt, the bid was just short of A$8bn. Why are they doing it? According to the main players, a significant part of the motivation is to close and replace the company’s coal-fired power plants and prevent a controversial demerger that would hive off those coal plants from AGL into a new entity called Accel Energy. The consortium says it has up to $20bn to spend on building and contracting at least 8 gigawatts of renewable energy and energy storage to replace about 7GW of existing power plants. AGL’s Bayswater and Loy Yang A coal plants, currently scheduled to shut by 2033 and 2045, would be gone by 2030. The company would reach net zero emissions by 2035 and suddenly be playing its part in limiting global heating to 1.5C, in line with scientific advice. The proposal is much bigger than just the coal power plants. It would involve Brookfield and Grok Ventures acquiring all of AGL’s generation assets and its retail business. Cannon-Brookes stresses it isn’t a philanthropic investment. He says he is confident backing renewable energy over ailing old coal power plants can keep electricity prices down, create 10,000 construction and 600 ongoing jobs and wipe out about 40m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – more than 8% of Australia’s annual emissions footprint – while turning a profit. Analysts and some within AGL see access to the company’s 4.5 million customers across the country as a key motivation for any would-be suitor. For Brookfield’s part, it is a shareholder in significant fossil fuel assets, but it is noteworthy that the bid includes the name of Mark Carney, the company’s head of transition investing since 2020. He made his name as first the governor of the Bank of Canada, then the Bank of England, and then the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance in the lead-up to last year’s Cop26 summit in Glasgow. A Brookfield renewable energy arm has about US$65bn assets under management. The bid is timed with at least one eye on the upcoming demerger, which AGL declared on Monday was on track to happen by 30 June. The consortium says the split risked leading to the separated entities trading at a lower share price, reducing value for shareholders. How did the company respond? There was a swift rejection after the board met on Sunday afternoon. It claimed the offer “materially undervalues the company”, as it offered only a 4.7% premium on Friday’s share price. The consortium rejected this rebuttal just as quickly. It says the offer represented about a 20% premium on the company’s three-month volume-weighted average share price of $6.28 and pointed to its expectation the value would fall after the split. Cannon-Brookes told Guardian Australia on Monday the consortium would continue to engage with AGL and he would focus on “trying to explain to shareholders why we believe this is the best option”. Within AGL, there was some excitement at the prospect that a billionaire entrepreneur with Cannon-Brookes’ success at creating a software firm was making a play for the company. It had lost up to 80% of its share value over the five years prior to the takeover offer although its stock had started to bounce back in the past 12 months. AGL shares gained more than 10% during Monday’s trade. Putting aside the business machinations, is this even doable? According to the experts, yes, though it would be challenging. Cannon-Brookes was quick to point to a draft blueprint for the future grid published by the Australian Energy Market Operator in December, known as the integrated system plan. That document suggested under a step-change scenario – now considered the most probable path – coal would exit the system at roughly three times the pace than proposed and there could be a ninefold increase in large-scale renewable energy such as wind and solar farms. It is not a report the Morrison government tends to emphasise. No one disputes that the rise of renewable energy is making coal plants unviable as the around-the-clock generators they were meant to be. They can’t compete with an influx of cheap solar energy in the middle of the day and were mostly not built to ramp down and then back up when needed. Department officials project renewable energy will increase from about 30% now to 69% by 2030. Labor says under its policies it would reach 82%. It is not only AGL that is under pressure. In the most recent announcement, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025 rather than 2032. The consortium says they can drive a rapid change at AGL in a way the current public ownership can’t because raising the vast amount of capital needed is difficult, but they already have it. Are there unanswered questions? Plenty, including whether the consortium would be open to paying more and the timing and specifics of the investment plan. The bid would have to be cleared by the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission – and possibly the Morrison government, should it choose to intervene. Buying AGL would involve taking on 3.2 million gas customers. Cannon-Brookes indicated the consortium would want to move them to renewable electricity, a significant undertaking in its own right. Cannon-Brookes acknowledges it is “on a global scale a massive decarbonisation effort” but says the plan makes sense. The consortium’s offer letter says it conducted detailed market modelling with consultants Marsden Jacob Associates and was confident its plan was achievable. “The economics stacks up, the science stacks up, what we require is just the gumption to go for it and actually make it happen, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Cannon-Brookes says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/feb/21/agl-rejects-takeover-bid-by-mike-cannon-brookes-and-canadian-fund-manager-brookfield","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-20T22:28:40Z","webTitle":"AGL rejects takeover bid by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian fund manager Brookfield ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/agl-rejects-takeover-bid-by-mike-cannon-brookes-and-canadian-fund-manager-brookfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/agl-rejects-takeover-bid-by-mike-cannon-brookes-and-canadian-fund-manager-brookfield","fields":{"headline":"AGL rejects takeover bid by Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian fund manager Brookfield ","bodyText":"AGL Energy has rejected a takeover bid by tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian asset management giant Brookfield, saying the preliminary offer “materially undervalues the company”. Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures made the extraordinary offer to take over Australia’s most polluting company on Saturday, with a goal to shut its coal power plants earlier than planned. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AGL said it had rejected the unsolicited preliminary offer of $7.50 a share, which offered a 4.7% premium on Friday’s closing price of $7.16. Including AGL’s debt, the offer was in the range of $8bn. The company said it was not in the best interest of shareholders. Speaking on Monday, Cannon-Brookes said the consortium would continue to work on the potential takeover, which would involve Brookfield and Grok Ventures acquiring AGL’s power generation and energy retail divisions, which include coal, gas and renewable energy generation assets. If successful, the new owners would aim to bring forward AGL’s exit from coal-fired power. It would also halt a planned demerger that would have broken off the company’s fossil fuel assets into a separate entity, to be called Accel Energy. AGL chairman Peter Botten said the bid did not offer an adequate premium for a change of control of the company. “Under the unsolicited proposal, the board believes AGL Energy shareholders would be forgoing the opportunity to realise potential future value via AGL Energy’s proposed demerger, as both proposed organisations pursue decisive action on decarbonisation.” Cannon-Brookes said the consortium was confident it could close and replace AGL’s coal plants – Bayswater in New South Wales and Loy Yang A in Victoria – by 2030, and take the company to net zero emissions by 2035. “We have $20bn to fund that transition,” he told the ABC’s RN Breakfast. He said it should lead to lower bills for consumers, create more jobs and substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. AGL is responsible for more than 8% of Australia’s annual emissions – more in its own right than Sweden, Ireland or New Zealand, he said. “On a global scale, this is a massive decarbonisation effort. The economics stacks up, the science stacks up. What we require is just the gumption to go it and actually make it happen, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Cannon-Brookes said. In a joint statement, Brookfield and Grok Ventures said it was disappointed with AGL’s response, and that its proposal was in the best interests of shareholders as it would avoid a “potentially value destructive” demerger and enable a “well-funded accelerated decarbonisation of Australia’s energy sources”. The consortium said its offer represented about a 20% premium on the three-month volume-weighted average price of $6.28 a share. It promised a transition plan consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5C that would require about $20bn of capital as about 7 gigawatts of fossil fuel capacity was replaced with at least 8GW of clean energy and storage. “It is intended AGL will be net zero by 2035,” the statement said. “The consortium is committed to working with all stakeholders and regulators to ensure the transition is achievable. Serving the company’s customers will remain the primary focus.” Brookfield managing partner Stewart Upson said the consortium had a “defined plan to significantly rationalise” AGL’s carbon-intensive coal plants once they were replaced through a “large-scale renewable build-out, supported by an identified project pipeline”. “To have a material impact on net zero transition, investors need to do more than simply avoid carbon-intensive businesses and we need to be willing to tackle emissions head on,” he said. The owners of Australia’s coal-fired generators are under increasing pressure, both economic due to the rise of cheap solar energy in the national grid, and from activist shareholders to act in line with the Paris climate agreement. Earlier this month, AGL brought forward the planned closure date of the Bayswater black coal plant in NSW to no later than 2033, and Loy Yang A in the Latrobe Valley to 2045. On Thursday, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025, rather than 2032. Asked about the bid during a visit to Tasmania on Monday, Scott Morrison declared the government did not want ageing coal plants to close early. “We need to ensure that our coal-fired generation of electricity runs to its life, because if it doesn’t, electricity prices go up,” the prime minister said. While cheaper renewable energy generation is one of the factors driving lower power prices, the prime minister said his government was “very committed to sweating those [coal] assets” to ensure reliable electricity supply at affordable prices. The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said energy companies were providers of an essential service and had a responsibility to put consumers first. He said driving out “dispatchable” capacity – meaning coal plants – was a significant risk to electricity consumers “both in terms of reliability of the grid and electricity price impacts”. AGL’s share price rose about 12% on Monday morning, topping $8 for the first time since mid-July 2021. The prospect of AGL’s coal plants closing as soon as 2035 is broadly in line with scenarios published by the Australian Energy Market Operator in a draft integrated system plan – a blueprint for the future – published in December. Under its “step change” scenario, brown-coal plants in Victoria would shut by the early 2030s and the final black coal plants by the early 2040s. Speaking alongside Morrison, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg dead-batted a question about whether the proposal could be blocked by the Foreign Investment Review Board. He noted the bid had not yet been approved by AGL shareholders. Brookfield last November secured approval from the foreign investment review board for the $17.8bn takeover of transmission group AusNet Services. Given AGL’s role as a major energy generator and retailer – before the planned demerger – an agreed takeover may also attract attention from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. AGL’s demerger is being advised by Macquarie Bank, while the Brookfield-Grok duo is being advised by Citi. Cannon-Brookes, a renewable energy investor and vocal advocate for greater action on the climate crisis, previously expressed an interest in backing clean energy assets to replace AGL’s ageing Liddell coal plant, which is due to shut next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/mar/12/outcry-at-australias-coal-plant-closures-misses-the-point-change-is-coming","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-11T16:30:00Z","webTitle":"Outcry at Australia's coal plant closures misses the point: change is coming | Adam Morton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/12/outcry-at-australias-coal-plant-closures-misses-the-point-change-is-coming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/mar/12/outcry-at-australias-coal-plant-closures-misses-the-point-change-is-coming","fields":{"headline":"Outcry at Australia's coal plant closures misses the point: change is coming","bodyText":"If ever there is a case where the headline doesn’t tell the full story it is the news that Victoria’s Yallourn power generator – one of Australia’s oldest and dirtiest coal plants – will shut earlier than planned. The basic facts are clear: the owner, EnergyAustralia, had previously said the Latrobe Valley generator would close in 2032, and now it will be gone by 2028. Despite the seven-year-notice period, much of the initial reaction to the announcement focused on fears of electricity price hikes and blackouts at a distant future date. It masked what had really happened. In reality, EnergyAustralia had made a deal with the Victorian government to keep the plant open longer than it almost certainly otherwise would have been. Analysts have long expected Yallourn to shut early partly because it keeps breaking down, and partly because it is too inflexible to compete with the extraordinary influx of cheap renewable energy into the grid. With so much solar energy being generated in the middle of the day, wholesale electricity prices in Victoria have dropped 70% over the past year. This has been good for consumers and the climate, but bad for coal plant owners, who are struggling to stay viable. Yallourn has been hit harder than most. Modelling for the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) that assumed a slower grid transformation than that now underway had previously suggested the plant could close by about 2026. Some workers at Yallourn expected it to shut even earlier, and were relieved on Wednesday to learn they might get seven years work before it goes. EnergyAustralia linked its closure announcement to the global push to address the climate crisis, noting investors were moving away from thermal coal, and stressed shutting Yallourn would immediately cut the company’s emissions by 60%. But the company was open to sweating the plant a little longer when it approached the Victorian government to make a deal on the closure. The government says it will not release details of the agreement, citing commercial confidentiality, but it doesn’t deny there may be public support to ensure it remains available until that date. Victorian taxpayers could reasonably ask what they are spending to keep a 50-year-old plant online, and why the Andrews government thinks it will be needed that long. The Morrison government’s response included raising concerns about what a closure in seven years would mean for grid reliability and energy affordability, urging the industry to build some form of replacement and leaving open the possibility it would step in if the private sector didn’t. It was a less aggressive echo of the Coalition’s response when AGL announced it would shut the Liddell coal plant in NSW by 2023. Then, the government pressured the owner to extend its life before warning the taxpayer-funded Snowy Hydro may build a gas-fired generator if energy companies were too slow to commit. The near repeat performance prompted some in the electricity industry to wonder: is this what substitutes for energy policy now? Based on estimates put forward by plant owners, eight coal plants are due to shut over the next 20 years. Most experts believe that will prove a conservative timeline given the pace at which solar energy is pushing coal out. A recent analysis found up to five plants including Yallourn could be unviable within the next four years. Dylan McConnell, from the University of Melbourne’s Climate and Energy College, has suggested we just bring the expected closure date of every coal plant forward by half a decade. Energy policy in Australia is rife with contradictions. State governments are increasingly backing renewable energy and, in NSW, long-duration energy storage through underwriting and price guarantees. It is starting to drive the sort of transformation in electricity, if not the rest of the economy, that climate scientists warn must happen more quickly across the globe. But few in power publicly acknowledge coal closures could come in a rush. Rather than introducing policy to accelerate the inevitable shift, the Morrison government criticises the state plans and rejects calls for a national policy framework that would guide private investment in the flexible energy needed to fill the gaps around a system that the energy security board says could be 60% solar and wind by the end of the decade. The Coalition, of course, abolished a national carbon price in 2014 and spent the years following fighting itself over a series of failed potential replacements, losing a prime minister along the way. Scott Morrison has gone to great lengths to avoid re-opening an internal battle over energy, including promising to pay for a feasibility study into a new coal plant in central Queensland to placate local MPs and Senators. It is the same split that has stopped the government from at least giving lip service to a target of reaching net zero emissions, a goal backed by more than 100 countries. The energy solution devised by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, is an ad hoc mix of policies that include promising, but so far failing, to change the Clean Energy Finance Corporation so he can direct it to underwrite “grid reliability” projects, such as new gas and pumped hydro plants. Federal and state governments are funding new grid connections between the states. And there has been an initial wave of announcements of privately backed grid-scale battery announcements. But there is no overarching plan to to ensure a smooth transition if there is a run of coal closures. Business leaders and the energy security board have warned the private sector is less likely to build the new back-up capacity needed when governments are interfering in the market. Amid all this, there is a model for what a transformed electricity system will need. Aemo last year released a blueprint for an optimal grid that found renewable energy could at times reach 90% within 15 years, and between six and 19 gigawatts of new flexible energy capacity should be in place by 2040 to support it. This could come from batteries, pumped hydro, demand management programs and gas, but Aemo suggests new gas power – favoured by the Morrison government, and the only fossil fuel on the list – is likely to be more expensive than other options. The market operator describes the blueprint as an “actionable roadmap” that prioritises the public. It might be worth dusting off and re-considering before anyone expresses concern about the next announcement of an early coal exit.

Speaking to Ray Hadley on Sydney’s 2GB, the federal energy minister said he did not find out about Origin Energy’s decision to shut Australia’s biggest electricity generator, the Eraring coal-fired power plant, seven years earlier than scheduled until the night before. “To find out last night with no warning … I’ve got to tell you, it’s very disappointing,” Taylor said. His New South Wales Liberal counterpart, Matt Kean, also expressed disappointment in Origin’s decision to close the Lake Macquarie plant from 2025, but not shock. He and the company’s chief executive, Frank Calabria, said dialogue between the state government and Origin started months ago. The first contact from the company was in July, and the company requested it be kept confidential. Which, among other things, meant the federal government wasn’t to be told. Origin says there is nothing in this – that the NSW government was the relevant jurisdiction for it to talk with – but it’s no secret that major energy industry players are frustrated with what many see as the federal government’s obstructive and scolding approach to dealing with the historic change under way in how electricity is generated and transmitted. It’s also no secret that Kean and Taylor don’t see eye-to-eye on the best way ahead on electricity. Where the NSW minister talks up the need to act on the climate crisis and promises the country’s biggest renewable energy expansion under legislation passed with cross-party support, Taylor says little about the damage from rising greenhouse gas emissions and mostly emphasises the risks of price spikes and reliability issues in moving away from fossil fuels. It’s important to note those risks are real. No one should assume the shift to a grid that runs overwhelmingly on renewable energy will be straightforward. But emphasis matters, and plenty of experts – from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) down – say the transformation is manageable. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Taylor’s admission he was kept out of the loop on one of biggest decision affecting the electricity grid in recent times suggests Origin learned from the experience of others, particularly AGL. Those lessons include that to be open with the federal government that you plan to shut a coal plant early is to invite pressure to keep it running. The Morrison government’s approach to energy remains piecemeal and inconsistent. It includes building publicly owned hydro and gas plants that discourage private investment while maintaining it is the industry’s responsibility to provide the generation needed. There is no national policy to guide when ageing coal plants should close, or to support coal communities that face inevitable disruption. Instead, some politicians continue to play out a strange pantomime, pretending the country’s official schedule of coal-plant closure dates – which would see many running well into the 2030s, and some the 2040s – remains a meaningful document. In reality, it is widely accepted that many could shut much earlier. Why? The rise of solar has rapidly made coal plants unviable as the around-the-clock generators they were meant to be. They can’t compete with an influx of free solar energy in the middle of the day, and were mostly not built to ramp down and then back up when needed. This was the point Calabria was making when he said “rapidly changing conditions in the national electricity market” are “increasingly not well suited to traditional baseload power stations”. Coal still provides about 60% of generation in the grid and is crucial for its operation, but renewables are coming fast: from about 20% three years ago to more than 31% last year, and 35% in the December quarter. That should reach 69% by the end of the decade, according to federal government projections. Labor, meanwhile, has a $20bn pledge to bring forward the construction of transmission infrastructure to connect new renewable energy zones. Modelling for the ALP suggests the country could hit 82% renewable energy by 2030 if it wins the upcoming election. How many coal plants does that leave room for? The role of supporting cheap variable solar and wind is expected to increasingly be played by things better suited to filling the gaps. They include batteries, pumped hydro schemes, stronger transmission connections, demand management programs and, at least for a while, gas-fired plants. Aemo laid this out in its draft integrated system plan – a blueprint for an optimal grid – in December, when it suggested the step change under way meant coal plants were likely to shut at almost triple the pace officially acknowledged, and estimated the new generation needed to meet future demand. It is not the only view of the future, but nothing in the weeks since has challenged its view that coal is rapidly headed for the door. Two energy giants – AGL last week, and now Origin – have brought forward coal plant official closure dates and renewables have pushed black coal generation to its lowest levels in 23 years. Eraring is particularly in the gun. As Dylan McConnell, a University of Melbourne energy analyst, points out, it is generally the most expensive coal generator in the grid and its output has fallen more rapidly than the rest of the fleet. It is the sort of decline that might grab a federal energy minister’s attention whether directly informed or not. There are two immediate questions that flow from the announcement of Eraring’s exit. The first is whether the NSW government’s response is up to the task. On support for the plant’s 400 workers and their community, it’s too early to say. Both the company and the state government have promised packages, with details to come. On electricity supply, Kean announced the creation of a “transmission acceleration facility” charged with hurrying up the investment being driven by the electricity infrastructure roadmap that passed state parliament in 2020. Its first mission is building a 700MW “Waratah super battery” with a proposed storage capacity of 1400 megawatt hours. Taylor told Hadley it was “delusional” to think a battery could replace a 2880MW coal plant, but Kean said that was not its role – that it would be designed to fix constraints in getting existing generation to Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong, not provide energy itself. There was also $84m to bring forward other infrastructure and nearly $50m for pumped hydro projects. Is it enough? It’s early days and some analysts have expressed concern, but Aemo was quick to make its position clear: the state would have access to enough electricity to ensure its energy security target – set to ensure the lights stay on even in disastrous circumstances – could still be met once Eraring is gone. Which is good news – and brings us to the second question. When should we expect the next announcement that a coal plant is closing early? It would be unwise to bet it will take long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/nov/01/narendra-modi-pledges-india-will-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2070","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-01T17:20:20Z","webTitle":"Narendra Modi pledges India will reach net zero emissions by 2070","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/01/narendra-modi-pledges-india-will-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2070","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/nov/01/narendra-modi-pledges-india-will-reach-net-zero-emissions-by-2070","fields":{"headline":"Narendra Modi pledges India will reach net zero emissions by 2070","bodyText":"India will meet a target of net zero emissions by 2070, the country’s prime minister has told the Cop26 global climate summit. Speaking at the world leaders’ summit at the UN conference in Glasgow, Narendra Modi made five key pledges for how India would decarbonise over the next few decades. India, a developing country of more than 1.3 billion people, is the world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide after the US and China. India was one of the last remaining major economies that had held out on a net zero commitment, despite months of pressure from the US, and Modi’s announcement marked one of the most significant moments of the summit’s opening day. Modi also made significant shorter-term commitments, promising to have 50% of India’s power generated by renewable energy by 2030, increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500GW by 2030 and reduce its projected carbon emissions by 1bn tonnes between now and 2030. By 2030, he also committed to a 45% reduction in the carbon intensity of the economy. While the 2070 net zero target falls behind the 2050 commitment made by the US and Europe and the 2060 commitment made by China and Saudi Arabia, it is in line with what many climate experts have modelled as the most feasible scenario for India to achieve net zero. A recent report released by the Delhi-based thinktank the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) put forward 2070 to 2080 as India’s most realistic roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality. “India has clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world,” said Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of CEEW. “This is real climate action.” Unlike countries in the west, and even China, India is decades away from its peak in terms of economic growth and energy consumption, and India’s energy demand is expected to grow faster than any other country over the next few years. Its population is also expected to overtake that of China to make it the largest in the world. Currently, 70% of all power in India is generated by coal, and while it is one of the cheapest producers of solar energy in the world, there is still not the technology available to integrate it into the energy grid on a large scale. Advancements in hydrogen technology and storage will also be needed to help India’s industrial sector wean itself off coal, which is unlikely to happen until around 2040, according to experts. India is already bearing the harsh consequences of climate breakdown. Millions across the country are exposed to severe heat, water shortages, extreme weather events such as flooding and coastal erosion, which have all been increasing in recent years. In the build-up to the conference, Indian officials had appeared to rebuff calls to commit to net zero, emphasising instead the need for climate funding and climate justice for developing countries, who historically have emitted far less greenhouses gas than countries such as the US but are now bearing the economic costs that come with net zero commitments. The commitments drew praise from the eminent climate ecologist Nicholas Stern, who said: “This was a very significant moment for the summit. [The action] might mean that India’s annual emissions of greenhouse gases could peak by 2030. This demonstrates real leadership from a country whose emissions per capita are about one-third of the global average. The rich world must respond [and] deliver a strong increase in international climate finance.” In his speech, Modi called out previous commitments of climate finance as “hollow” and demanded developed countries make $1tn available as climate finance to developing countries “as soon as possible today”. Modi told his fellow world leaders: “I am sure that the decisions taken in Glasgow will safeguard the future of generations to come and give them a safe and prosperous life.” He apologised for running over his allotted speech time but said he believed it was his “duty to raise my voice for developing countries”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2021/may/09/observer-letters-valiant-campaign-on-care-homes-but-pain-goes-on","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-09T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"A valiant campaign on care homes, but the pain goes on | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/may/09/observer-letters-valiant-campaign-on-care-homes-but-pain-goes-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/may/09/observer-letters-valiant-campaign-on-care-homes-but-pain-goes-on","fields":{"headline":"Letters: a valiant campaign on care homes, but the pain goes on","bodyText":"Nicci Gerrard, through her writings in this newspaper and lead role in John’s Campaign, has done more than just effect yet another government U-turn (“Why did the government take so long to back down on this care home cruelty?”, Comment). She highlighted the patchwork of care homes covering more than 450,000 residents and their loved ones and how they had become “jails of enforced loneliness”, where Covid was not the only killer. That jolted me into connecting with other patient carers to channel and help assuage the pain of suffering in isolation, hitherto without mutual support and always in dread of that final telephone call. I have great admiration for Nicci and her dogged determination to prove that “our campaign is not over” but her conclusion that “bereft families can finally open the door to step out together into the world” is tragically not the case for bereaved families like mine, who will have to live the pain of “unredeemable time” after receiving that call when I lost my darling wife in a prison of enforced loneliness. Ron Noon Allerton, Liverpool A once proud name I grew up the proud bearer of a singular, immediately recognised surname, origins obscure, within a family known for its professional service and solid reputation for quiet decency and hard work. There are no more male heirs left on our side, nor, I believe, within the older branch of the family. How sad, then, to see the legacy being left by the last male of the family as portrayed by the richly accurate pen of Chris Riddell (“The emperor’s new curtains”, Comment). My forebears would be turning in their graves. Wendy Jenrick Sheffield Shameful inaction on fraud In the face of more than 3m incidents of financial fraud a year worth at least £2.8bn, the government’s response to Martin Lewis that it is “really difficult” to regulate the likes of Facebook and Google is reprehensible (“There’s an epidemic of scams, but fraudsters are getting off scot-free, says Martin Lewis”, News). Furthermore, its preference to instead rely on Lewis’s £3m court victory, a minuscule blip on the revenues of the internet behemoths, did nothing to recompense victims. How much longer are we expected to accept government inaction and disregard for the rights of its citizens? Neil Macehiter Great Shelford, Cambridge Cakes and Port Vale Rachel Cooke’s dilemma of how to warm oatcakes is easily solved (“Let them eat oatcakes”, Notebook, Comment). Simply lay the oatcake on the grill pan, add thinly sliced or grated cheese (traditionally cheshire but cheddar will do) and grill until bubbling. Roll up and eat! Add extra fillings – brown sauce, bacon, sausage, mushroom if you must. Oatcakes are our traditional foodstuff – product of local agriculture and the traditional bottle kilns that fired the potbanks of Stoke-on-Trent. For those who don’t have a Neal’s Yard Dairy on their doorstep, you can always use mail order, visit Stoke on Trent’s oatcake shops, or make your own from ready-made packs available from Port Vale football club’s shop. That way, you would be savouring a local delicacy as well as backing a football club whose owners, supporters and foundation value loyalty above all else. Joan Walley Stoke-on-Trent Transgender fears I wanted to say how much I valued the interview with Dr David Bell (“What matters is the truth. I hate the fact that the fear of being seen to be transphobic now overrides everything”, the New Review). It is worrying that the Tavistock sought to suppress the (in my view) very reasonably questioning position of Dr Bell with respect to the potentially irreversible treatments being carried out on children and adolescents. The subsequent judgment of the high court in the case of Keira Bell v the Tavistock and now the recent decision of Sweden to halt the use of puberty blockers in children (except as part of research trials) bears this out. More and more clinicians are becoming extremely concerned at the practice of increasingly treating psychological distress about one’s body and gender with potentially irreversible medical and surgical treatments. Dr Ellen Wright London SE10 Not more solar energy Will Hutton writes about the potential impact of space-based technologies on our lives, including plans to beam solar energy from giant mirrors in space to the Earth’s surface (“Fifty years after Apollo, space is about to transform our life on Earth beyond recognition”, Comment). Climate change is happening because rising CO2 levels trap heat in the atmosphere instead of allowing it to radiate into space. Pouring yet more energy into the system will only result in yet more heating. We already receive plenty of solar energy from space; we just need to make better use of it. Chris Webster Gümligen, Switzerland Unfair payment after death Anna Tims’s report resonated with me following the sad death of my mother in November last year (“Grieving relatives tell of despair at months of waiting for probate”, Cash). As executor, I appointed a solicitor to manage probate of my mother’s estate. There is substantial inheritance tax (IHT), which I do not object to but cannot afford to pay so will need to liquidate assets from the estate once I have been granted probate. HMRC has agreed to wait for the IHT to be paid up to 28 days after the issue of the grant of probate. There appears to have been no progress made by the relevant probate registry since January. HMRC has confirmed that interest on the IHT will still accrue from 31 May, six months from the date of death. A “financial fine” for an inadequate government system seems ludicrous, stressful and an unfair burden on grieving beneficiaries. My mother would be horrified if she knew that her family were struggling to benefit from her carefully managed estate. John Tungatt Bromley, London Ted Hastings is right Kenan Malik writes of crony capitalism and the unregulated market being central to the Grenfell tragedy (“Grenfell is still giving up its secrets and they retain the power to shock”, Comment).

At least two ExxonMobil outposts – from Beaumont and Baytown, Texas – tweeted the message on Monday, using the hashtag #LouisianaStrong. It didn’t take long for Twitter users to call out the company for its tone-deaf response, noting that Exxon’s own internal research program predicted catastrophic climate change decades ago. Moreover, in the last 80 years, Louisiana has lost roughly 2,000 square miles of its coastal wetlands, according to the US Geological Survey. The major factors contributing to the decline of the natural storm barrier are offshore oil rigs, onshore wells and refineries operating on the shoreline. The death toll from Hurricane Ida is now nearing 50, after the storm tore a path through the south, mid-Atlantic and north-eastern US. This is not the first time the fossil fuel industry has been rebuked for sending “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of disasters exacerbated by climate change. For years, as the climate crisis has intensified, oil companies have extended social media messages of sympathy without addressing climate change and the role of fossil fuel emissions as the root of the problem. Chevron’s Houston account extended its “thoughts” in the midst of a deadly category 4 Hurricane Laura last August. In 2017 during Hurricane Harvey, Exxon encouraged Texas and Louisiana to “stay strong”. Scientists say that both disasters were intensified by the impacts of a changing climate. Ahead of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released earlier this month, and its dire warning that global heating will probably reach 1.5C within the next two decades, oil companies filled their feeds with renewable energy pledges, claims of green accomplishments and sustainability buzzwords. The average social media user perusing BP’s tweets on solar energy just days before the report’s release might have been surprised to learn that the “P” in the company’s name once stood for petroleum, and that even in a decade’s time its investments in renewable energy are expected to amount to less than half of its total capital investments today. Offering “thoughts and prayers” on social media in response to tragedy is now commonly associated with reactions to US gun violence – and is considered by some activists to be a pale substitute for concrete action. Exxon is currently facing lawsuits that allege “deceptive marketing” and “greenwashing” – the practice of marketing a company or a product as environmentally friendly to hide a true record of fossil fuel emissions and polluting. Fossil fuel facilities are in fact vulnerable to extreme weather. When millions of Texans were left freezing after a severe winter storm and power outage earlier this year, fossil fuel energy-generating stations were knocked offline and oil refineries, chemical manufacturers and other industrial plants in the state emitted about 3.5m pounds of excess pollutants into the air. Oil and gas regulators nevertheless rushed to defend the industry’s image of “reliability”, according to Texas Tribune, instead blaming wind power, which accounts for less than 24% of the state’s energy, and the progressive left for the power outages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/oct/05/running-homes-and-cars-on-electricity-alone-would-save-households-5443-a-year-report-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-04T16:30:26Z","webTitle":"Running homes and cars on electricity alone would save households $5,443 a year, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/05/running-homes-and-cars-on-electricity-alone-would-save-households-5443-a-year-report-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/oct/05/running-homes-and-cars-on-electricity-alone-would-save-households-5443-a-year-report-finds","fields":{"headline":"Running homes and cars on electricity alone would save households $5,443 a year, report finds","bodyText":"What would you do with an extra $5,443 a year? Converting all home appliances and cars to run on electricity could eliminate a third of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions while saving households $40bn a year by 2028, according to a new report. The report, Castles and Cars, by the new energy thinktank Rewiring Australia, found the average Australian household uses 102kWh of energy a day at a cost of $5,248 a year. Much of this cost comes from relying on petrol and gas to power cars, stoves, showers and heaters. The report said internal combustion engines in cars were only 30% efficient in converting petrol or diesel to power, while water heaters relying on natural gas used three times as much energy as those using a heat pump – the same technology that runs refrigerators and air conditions. In electricity generation, many coal plants reach an efficiency of only 30% while natural gas plants reach 45% efficiency. Replacing fossil fuel appliances and vehicles with electric models by 2030, and powering them with increasingly efficient cheap solar energy, could save households $5,443 a year and cut household emissions to zero, the report states. It said Australia was uniquely positioned to electrify households due to its population density, capacity for renewable energy generation and existing state and territory policies. Saul Griffith, an Australian who has advised the Biden administration on energy policy and the report’s author, said taking the best existing policies from each state and combining them with federal leadership would allow Australia to put together a comprehensive framework and “show the world how it’s done”. “Australia is a lot closer to doing this than the general country thinks,” Griffith said. “If we go first, we’ll be selling those technologies to California. If we don’t go first they’ll be selling them to us.” He said the first step would be a pilot program to retrofit every building in a suburb. It would become a template that could be refined before being rolled out elsewhere. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report, developed in partnership with the Australia Institute, will be launched on Tuesday by Victoria’s energy and climate change minister, Lily D’Ambrosio. Matt Kean, the New South Wales energy and environment minister, who is expected to soon become treasurer, was due to join the launch before Gladys Berejiklian resigned as NSW premier on Friday. Richie Merzian, from the Australia Institute, said the report was a good news story. “It reduces the solutions to climate change to a simple narrative: get to 100% clean energy, electrify everything and then turn your carbon sources into carbon sinks,” he said. Suggestions in the report included offering rebates and finance to help low-income households switch to electricity and ensure access to solar power and battery storage as a “national priority”. It would involve programs similar to the Victorian government’s solar homes program – which aims to electrify appliances in low-income households – being expanded nationally. D’Ambrosio said the Victorian government was developing a “gas substitution roadmap” that would “chart a long-term plan to decarbonise gas usage”. “Electrification offers incredible opportunities to help us reach Victoria’s target of halving emissions by 2030,” she said. Nicky Ison, energy transition manager with WWF Australia, was not involved with the report but said it was “incredibly compelling”. “One of the problems we have when we talk about climate change and the energy transition is a lot of the focus 15-years-ago was about personal sacrifice,” Ison said. “We’ve now moved from a climate narrative based on austerity to one based on abundance and opportunity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/04/oil-and-gas-industry-us-public-schools","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-04T09:00:03Z","webTitle":"How the oil and gas industry is trying to hold US public schools hostage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/oil-and-gas-industry-us-public-schools","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/04/oil-and-gas-industry-us-public-schools","fields":{"headline":"How the oil and gas industry is trying to hold US public schools hostage","bodyText":"The oil and gas industry wants to play a word-and-picture association game with you. Think of four images: a brightly colored backpack stuffed with pencils, a smiling teacher with a tablet tucked under her arm, a pair of glasses resting on a stack of pastel notebooks, and a gleaming school bus welcoming a young student onboard. “What do all of these have in common?” a 6 April Facebook post by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA), asked. “They are powered by oil and natural gas!” Here in New Mexico – the fastest-warming and most water-stressed state in the continental US, where wildfires have recently devoured over 120,000 acres and remain uncontained – the oil and gas industry is coming out in force to deepen the region’s dependence on fossil fuels. Their latest tactic: to position oil and gas as a patron saint of education. Powerful interest groups have deployed a months-long campaign to depict schools and children’s wellbeing as under threat if government officials infringe upon fossil fuel production. In a video spot exemplary of this strategy, Ashley Niman, a fourth-grade teacher at Enchanted Hills elementary school tells viewers that the industry is what enables her to do her job. “Without oil and gas, we would not have the resources to provide an exemplary education for our students,” she says. “The partnership we have with the oil and gas industry makes me a better teacher.” The video, from September last year, is part of a PR campaign by NMOGA called “Safer and Stronger”. It’s one of many similar strategies the Guardian tracked across social media, television and audio formats that employs a rhetorical strategy social scientists refer to as the “fossil fuel savior frame”. “What NMOGA and the oil and gas industry are saying is that we hold New Mexico’s public education system hostage to our profit-motivated interests,” said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center. “There’s an implied threat there.” Last year, New Mexico brought in $1.1bn from mineral leasing on federal lands – more than any other US state. But the tides may be turning for the fossil fuel industry as officials grapple with the need to halve greenhouse gas emissions this decade. Before mid-April, the Biden administration had paused all new oil and gas leasing and the number of drilling permits on public lands plummeted. In response, pro-industry groups are pushing out what some experts have called “sky is falling” messaging that generates the impression that without oil and gas revenue, the state’s education system is on a chopping block. NMOGA did not respond for comment. Since February, NMOGA has flooded its social media pages with school-related motifs like buses and books, but also with images of empty, abandoned classrooms accompanied by reminders about how the state’s schools “rely on oil and gas production on federal land for more than $700m in funding”. Elected officials have parroted this framing. “This is a matter of critical importance to all, but especially to New Mexico’s schoolchildren, who have suffered greatly during the pandemic,” state representative Yvette Herrell co-wrote in the Santa Fe New Mexican, in February. But tax, budget and public education funding experts say linking the federal leasing pause to a grave, immediate risk to public education is deceptive. “Any slight reductions stemming from pauses or other so-called ‘adverse’ actions would have zero immediate effect on school funding overall, much less whether students get the services they need to recover from the ill effects on their learning from the pandemic,” said Charles Goodmacher, former government and media relations director at the National Education Association (NEA), now a consultant. The sale of leases does not lead to immediate drilling, he said. Often, companies sit on leases for months or years before production occurs. And as it happens, New Mexico currently has a budget surplus from record production. *** Industry attempts to convince New Mexicans that the state’s public education system is wholly dependent on oil and gas are based on a tough truth: decades of steep tax cuts have indeed positioned fossil fuels as the thunder behind Democratic-led New Mexico’s economy. In 2021, 15% of the state’s general fund came from royalties, rents and other fees that the Department of the Interior collects from mineral extraction on federal lands. Oil and gas activity across federal, state and private lands contributes around a third of the state’s general fund of $7.2bn, as well as a third of its education budget. The commissioner of public lands, Stephanie Garcia Richard, herself a former classroom teacher, has been at the forefront of efforts to diversify the New Mexican economy since she was elected to manage the state’s 13m acres of public lands in 2018. “When I ran, in my first campaign, we talked a lot about how a school teacher really understands what every dime that this office makes means to a classroom.” Garcia Richard takes pride in being the first woman, Latina and teacher to have been elected to head the office, which oversees about $1bn in revenue generation each year. Since 2019, she’s launched a renewable energy office and outdoor recreation office to raise money from those activities, though Garcia Richard doesn’t believe that money will ever fully make up for oil and gas revenue. “I don’t want anybody ever to think that I have some notion that the revenue diversification strategies we’re pursuing right now somehow make a billion dollars.” New Mexico’s attorney general, Hector Balderas, a Democrat, is another top state official charged with managing the state’s energy and economic transition. Given the same geographic features that make New Mexico the “land of enchantment”, the state is positioned to become a national leader in solar energy, Balderas said. But four of the state’s major solar farms are severely behind schedule. Balderas, who has accepted $49,900 in campaign contributions from oil and gas over seven election cycles, said that a sudden disruption in new oil and gas leasing such as the blanket moratorium the Biden administration originally proposed in January last year, would have an outsized impact on New Mexico’s most vulnerable. “You would cut out nearly a third of the revenue that we rely on to fund our schools and our roads and our law enforcement community,” he said. “I don’t think environmental activists really think about that perspective: how progressives have cleaner air but then thrust original Americans like Native American pueblos into further economic poverty.” *** Some on the receiving end of oil and gas revenue stress that not all educators and students embrace fossil fuel industry money in public schools. Mary Bissell is an algebra teacher at Cleveland high school in Rio Rancho, who co-signed a letter in November, along with more than 200 educators, asking NMOGA to “stop using New Mexico’s teachers and kids as excuses for more oil and gas development”. Bissell says in spite of how cash-strapped schools may be, many of her colleagues don’t want oil and gas money. “I’m not going to teach my kids how to find slope based on fracking,” she said of her math courses. Bissell characterized NMOGA’s attempt to portray educators as a unified force beholden to oil and gas funding as “disgusting.” In some states, including Rhode Island and Massachusetts, state attorneys general have taken it upon themselves, as the leading law enforcement and consumer protection officials, to sue oil and gas companies for deceiving consumers and investors about climate change through their marketing. Balderas’s office said it was not actively pursuing that strategy. Seneca Johnson, 20, a student leader with Youth United for Climate Action (Yucca), is from the Muscogee Nation of Oklahoma. Johnson grew up in New Mexico, and knows first hand about the state’s underfunded schools. “I remember in elementary school we would have a list: bring three boxes of tissues, or colored pencils,” she said, speaking of Chaparral elementary school in Santa Fe. “As students and as teachers, [you’re] buying the supplies for the classroom.” Johnson remembers being told as a child that the schools she attended ranked second worst in the nation. If New Mexico’s education system is indeed that bad, she said, how can officials continue to think that accepting a funding structure that delivers such a consistently poor result is a good idea? “At the end of the day the system that we have now that is being paid for by oil and gas doesn’t work, and we know it doesn’t work,” Johnson said. “It’s the whole ‘Don’t bite the hand that feeds you’ kind of mentality,” she said, linking the industry’s patronizing messaging around its support for schools to a direct legacy of colonization. “I don’t want to have to rely on this outside entity. I don’t want to have to rely on this broken system. I want better for my kids and their kids and my whole community.” This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/jun/28/solar-farm-proposals-for-east-of-england-more-than-double","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-28T12:46:11Z","webTitle":"Farmers swap crops for energy as east of England solar farm proposals double","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/28/solar-farm-proposals-for-east-of-england-more-than-double","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/jun/28/solar-farm-proposals-for-east-of-england-more-than-double","fields":{"headline":"Farmers swap crops for energy as east of England solar farm proposals double","bodyText":"The number of new solar farms planned for the east of England has more than doubled in recent months as farmers decide to swap crops for clean energy. New solar farm applications for sites across Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Essex in the last five months have climbed to 840 megawatts, or the same as 2m household solar panels. The solar boom is expected to yield more than double the solar energy capacity that came forward for the east of England in the same months last year, and would be enough to power the equivalent of 400,000 homes with clean energy. Dr Nina Skorupska, the chief executive of the Association for Renewable Energy, said it was “crucial that this momentum is maintained” to help meet the UK’s climate targets and “also help stimulate much-needed new investment in the region”. Most of these new solar farms will be built on former agricultural land as landowners begin to swap growing crops for generating clean electricity, according to UK Power Networks, which manages the local electricity grid. The east of England is particularly popular with renewable energy developers because of its flat fields and sunny weather. However, more landowners are beginning to pursue solar power in the area after UK Power Networks scrapped the upfront cost to connect to the local energy grid. Under new rules put in place at the beginning of 2020, solar farm developers can connect to the grid cheaper and faster in exchange for allowing UK Power Networks to reduce their electricity output at times of low energy demand. The scheme led to a nine-year high in the number of solar farm applications to connect to the UK Power Networks grid last year despite the Covid-19 pandemic, and could help the UK to increase its renewable energy without overpowering the system when solar power outstrips local energy demand. UK Power Networks said the number of applications to connect batteries has also spiralled compared with last year. Nine new battery applications were accepted between January and May this year, with a power rating of 385MW, up from only three projects totalling 27.5MW in the same months last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/apr/23/revealed-uk-solar-projects-using-panels-from-firms-linked-to-xinjiang-forced-labour","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-25T16:00:18Z","webTitle":"Revealed: UK solar projects using panels from firms linked to Xinjiang forced labour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/23/revealed-uk-solar-projects-using-panels-from-firms-linked-to-xinjiang-forced-labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/apr/23/revealed-uk-solar-projects-using-panels-from-firms-linked-to-xinjiang-forced-labour","fields":{"headline":"Revealed: UK solar projects using panels from firms linked to Xinjiang forced labour","bodyText":"Solar projects commissioned by the Ministry of Defence, the government’s Coal Authority, United Utilities and some of the UK’s biggest renewable energy developers are using panels made by Chinese solar companies accused of exploiting forced labour camps in Xinjiang province, a Guardian investigation has found. Confidential industry data suggests that up to 40% of the UK’s solar farms were built using panels manufactured by China’s biggest solar panel companies, including Jinko Solar, JA Solar and Trina Solar. These firms have been named in a recent report on the internment of more than 1 million men and women from the Muslim Uyghur community, in what UK MPs on Thursday voted to describe as genocide. Companies with factories or major suppliers in Xinjiang produce about a third of the polysilicon material used to make the world’s solar panels, according to a detailed report by the US consultancy Horizon Advisory. China is the world leader in polysilicon production. The report found that Chinese solar companies had ties to indicators of forced labour in Xinjiang, where Uyghur are interned, via this polysilicon production. China’s repression of the Uyghurs is believed to have developed into systematic detention about 2016, with reports of forced labour emerging from the region in the years since. An industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Guardian that the industry was scrambling to distance itself from the use of forced labour, and that up to four in 10 of the UK’s existing solar farms were built using panels from the companies named in the report. While many were built before 2016, the Guardian has found a string of more recent deals that raise questions about how carefully UK businesses and government agencies are vetting their supply chains. Many manufacturers in China’s solar industry operate factories in countries across Asia but may still use the raw polysilicon materials produced in Xinjiang, making it difficult to determine whether a particular production line has been exposed to alleged labour exploitation. China limits access for outside observers and media to Xinjiang. The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) this month revealed plans to install the first of 80 solar farms on the army estate at Leconfield, east Yorkshire, using thousands of panels made by Trina Solar as part of a deal with the UK energy firm Centrica. The MoD did not answer questions about what checks it had made on the companies’ supply chains, or whether panels with potential links to forced labour had been used on other sites. An MoD spokesperson said: “We have robust procedures in place that allow us to vet and routinely monitor all aspects of our supply chain, which is kept under constant review.” The UK’s Coal Authority, a government agency sponsored by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, has included solar panels made by JA Solar in a third of the solar farms it has built across its estate of former mining sites since 2017. A government spokesperson said: “We are thoroughly investigating recent allegations of forced labour in solar panel supply chains. In January we announced a comprehensive package of measures to help ensure no UK organisations are complicit in the serious human rights violations being perpetrated against the Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang.” Some of the UK’s most prolific solar developers have used panels from the Xinjiang-linked companies. The Guardian has found that panels from the Chinese companies were used in projects built since 2016 by the FTSE 100 water company United Utilities, Scottish Water, and large solar developers including Bluefield Solar, Foresight Solar, and Solarcentury, owned by Norway’s Statkraft. As recently as January, Longi Solar, another panel maker, said it had shipped solar modules to an unnamed project near Rugby, Warwickshire. There has been a sharp slowdown in solar development in the UK since 2017, when the government cut subsidies. However, executives said the companies were deeply embedded in the UK industry before and after 2016. Foresight Solar Fund, a developer of some of the UK’s largest sites, said in its 2020 annual report that Trina had supplied 13% of its panels, while JA Solar provided 11%. Chris Hewett, chief executive of Solar Energy UK, a lobby group, said: “This is a matter that UK solar energy industry members are treating with the utmost seriousness.” He said making global supply chains “as transparent and sustainable as possible” brought a “significant degree of complexity”. Hewett said the UK solar industry was working with international trade bodies to develop a “traceability protocol” to safeguard the global supply chain from human rights abuses. Xinjiang’s polysilicon interests are allegedly controlled by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, an economic and paramilitary organisation that is facing US sanctions after accusations that the group has facilitated widespread human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims. Horizon, the consultancy, said the polysilicon companies “appear actively to participate in the resettlement” of ethnic Uyghurs, where they “enlist resettled labour at production facilities in Xinjiang” and contribute to the Uyghur “re-education” programmes. The report claims the reliance on Xinjiang effectively “implicates the entire solar supply chain in the human rights atrocities”. Many of the largest Chinese solar manufacturers are closely linked. Daqo Group, one of the world’s largest polysilicon suppliers, which has significant operations in Xinjiang, provides its high-purity silicon to Jinko Solar and Longi. Longi in turn supplies solar panel components to companies including JA Solar and Trina Solar, according to Horizon. None of the manufacturers responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment on the use of forced labour in the Xinjiang region. Jinko has previously said it condemns the use of forced labour and that the Horizon report does not “demonstrate forced labour in our facilities”. Centrica, which is responsible for developing the MoD’s solar projects, said: “We condemn the use of forced labour in the strongest possible terms.” A spokesperson said the company had worked “extensively” with Trina Solar over the past eight years. It had received anti-slavery statements from Trina throughout this time, and had also undertaken “quality assurance visits” to its main manufacturing site in China, the spokesperson added. United Utilities said all contracts for panels included clauses in relation to modern slavery, and said it would investigate any evidence of mistreatment of workers in its supply chain. Scottish Water said it would examine the Horizon report, and said it asked suppliers to confirm that they conform to expected standards. Foresight and Bluefield pointed to Solar Energy UK’s position on modern slavery. Solarcentury said tracing the supply chain was a “complex process”, but added: “Going forward, we will award new contracts where suppliers can demonstrate that the polysilicon for our projects has been sourced from a factory that respects human rights and which we can audit.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2021/oct/06/watch-the-2021-covering-climate-now-journalism-awards","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-06T19:50:32Z","webTitle":"The 2021 Covering Climate Now Journalism Awards – the list of winners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/oct/06/watch-the-2021-covering-climate-now-journalism-awards","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2021/oct/06/watch-the-2021-covering-climate-now-journalism-awards","fields":{"headline":"The 2021 Covering Climate Now Journalism Awards – the list of winners","bodyText":"The inaugural Covering Climate Now Journalism Awards honor extraordinary climate journalism produced by newsrooms large and small around the world.

Simon Dudson, the chief executive of the Little Green Energy Company, which serves London and south-east England, says: “It’s absolutely crazy times. It’s unprecedented. We have had a 400-500% increase in business.” The soaring price of electricity means a domestic solar panel system can now pay for itself in as little as seven years, and the way things are going, that could go down to five years. About a year ago, installers were saying the “payback” period was 15 years or more. Then there are the environmental benefits of solar panels. But don’t expect to have a system installed by your first-choice company this side of winter. The increase in demand, plus supply problems – about 90% of panels are made in China – mean some installers are warning customers of delays stretching out 10 months or more. Sussex Solar, like many installers across the UK, this week had a blunt message on its website. “We are very sorry but due to an unprecedented level of interest in solar panels and heat pumps, we are unable to accept any new inquiries for the time being. We will reopen our contact page towards the end of August …” Sussex Solar’s director, Amanda Baxter, adds: “It’s absolutely mad at the moment.” The Solar Shed, based near King’s Lynn in Norfolk, had a similar message: “Thanks for getting this far. We’re not taking any new inquiries at present. Sorry. The contact us page will open again when we clear the backlog.” Many reputable installers say they won’t start taking inquiries again until September – but could close again at any time. “The supply chain is the thing that is holding us all back,” Dudson says. “The main issue six months ago was the shortage of skilled labour. Now it’s the global shortage of stock. The panel manufacturers are telling us they shifted as much in the first quarter of this year as they did for the whole of last year.” So if you want to have any chance of getting panels on your roof, you will need to act soon. Keep a close eye on firms’ websites, and also be aware that the prices of panels and batteries are on the march upwards after many years of decline. How much will it cost? As little as £6,000 and up to £20,000 for a large house. It all depends on the size of the system (measured in kilowatts), the battery (optional, and can double the price), the diverter (to feed electricity to your immersion water heater), and whether you choose to install an electric vehicle charger at the same time. “Premium” panels and batteries (such as Tesla’s) cost more. Is it worth it? A 4kW system, suitable for the average home, should generate about 3,500kWh (kilowatt hours) of electricity a year across much of England. At the time of writing, the average 28p unit price of electricity a kWh means the 3,500 kWh produced is worth £980. So if you paid £7,000 for an installation, in theory it’s paying for itself in about seven years. In practice, the precise payback period will be different for every household and could be significantly more than the seven years if the home is unable to use much of the electricity produced. However, the 28p unit price is expected to leap to 45p or more this winter. That would mean the value of electricity produced by a 4kW system would rise to £1,575 or more – suggesting solar panels could in theory pay for themselves in as little as five years. But electricity unit prices could fall back, while the costs of the panels and installation are likely to rise, possibly steeply, so there are no guarantees. Will it supply all my electricity? And heat my water? The typical bungalow or detached home in the UK uses about 4,100 kWh a year, so panels producing 3,500 kWh a year will cover much of your usage. You will want to change your electricity usage habits to make the most use of your panels. That means running appliances such as the dishwasher during the day, not at night. A diverter can send any surplus energy generated by solar PV panels to an immersion heater. Installers say this is now a better option than having separate solar hot water panels. They cost about £500. Should I buy the battery? A battery will store the solar energy produced – but not used – during the day and let you use it at night. On a sunny day, many households will struggle to use half the electricity produced by the panels, so a battery sounds like a very good idea – except they are costly. Kevin Holland of the Solar Shed says: “You can almost double the cost of the installation by opting for a battery.” The batteries cost £5,000 upwards – if you can find one. Installers say they are the most difficult thing to source at the moment. Without a battery to store electricity, home consumption could be in the range of 25% to 30% of the electricity produced by the panels. Can I sell surplus electricity back to the National Grid? The “feed-in tariffs” that kickstarted the UK’s domestic solar industry have long gone. They were extremely lucrative, initially paying households 43.3p for every unit of electricity. But the rate was subsequently cut, then completely axed in 2019. There is a rather less lucrative replacement scheme called the Smart Export Guarantee. The big electricity companies set their own SEG rate – and most pay just a few pence. At the time of writing, the best-paying was Octopus Energy at 7.5p/kWh, with the next best at only 5p/kWh. Octopus also operates a tariff where what customers are paid varies every half-hour, according to day-ahead wholesale prices. Earlier this year customers in London were picking up £1.29 for every unit sent back to the grid. “We choose to give these best-in-market rates on our tariffs because we know that our future energy system will need to include lots of small generators and homes with their own energy sources, too,” an Octopus spokesperson says. Is my home right for solar panels? A south-facing roof, sloping at a 30-degree angle, is best. East- and west-facing panels will produce about 15% to 20% less electricity. The good news is that advances in solar technology mean you need less roof space than 10 years ago to produce the same amount of electricity. You will generally need at least 20 sq metres of usable roof space. Solar panels do not require planning permission but you will need listed building consent to put solar panels on a listed building. If you live in a conservation area, you will also need to contact your local council before going ahead. In a heatwave, do solar panels really pump out the electricity? Not really. What’s important is the intensity of light. Many experts say the panels actually work better at a temperature of 23C to 25C. Scorching weather is good for thermal water solar systems but not for maximising output from photovoltaic cells. “If you compare a 4kW system in Madrid with one in London, on a perfectly clear day you will get more electricity from the one in London,” Holland says. Can I get a grant? Not at the moment. In 2013, the government’s green deal offered loans to help households buy solar panels but it ended in 2015 and there is no funding available for solar panels now. One option is to apply to your bank for a home improvement loan. At HSBC, a £10,000 loan secured against your home would cost £183 a month over five years, with an APR of 3.9%. Will the panels last? The early adopters of solar panels report generally good news on this front, with the panels requiring little maintenance, and new ones expected to last up to 40 years. Their efficiency declines over time – but only slowly. Batteries decline faster and may have to be replaced after 10 years. Aren’t they all just double-glazing cowboys? “There are still a fair amount of cowboys in the industry,” Sussex Solar’s Baxter says. So how do you find a reputable installer? Word of mouth is your best bet. Ask around on your local street WhatsApp forums. Or try Which? Trusted Traders. Traditionally you would expect to obtain three different quotes before proceeding. But as Holland at The Solar Shed says: “I’m just too busy for [that].” The early adopter who now runs a solar business The former Guardian economics journalist Ashley Seager has been so inspired by the performance of his home solar panels – installed 15 years ago – that he now runs a solar business of his own. In 2007 Seager installed a 3kW peak system (about four metres by three metres) on the roof of his Victorian home in south London. It has produced about 2,700 kW hours (kWh) a year – enough for more than 80% of his annual electricity needs – and 15 years later it is still going strong. “The panels are supposed to degrade by about 0.5% a year but they have not. I’d estimate they have declined by no more than 0.25% a year,” he says. “The newer panels are now more efficient. A 3kW roof system now needs less roof space than we needed back in 2007. You can now get a 4kW system in the space needed for a 3kW system years ago.” Seager spent £8,500 on his panels, and they have more than repaid his investment. “Even before prices for electricity shot up we were getting a return of 10% to 15% per annum on the roof panels.” Seager benefited from the government’s “feed-in tariffs” paid to early adopters, which are no longer available. He now thinks the government was overly generous: “They set the tariff so high, there was a massive return on the investment.” However, the falling cost and higher efficiency of the panels since 2007, combined with today’s soaring electricity prices, mean that the financial equation for fitting solar panels still stacks up without any government subsidies. His company, Sun4net, focuses on installing panels on commercial rooftop spaces. But, like everyone else in the industry, he warns of the difficulty in obtaining supplies. “We are busier than ever but it continues a strong upward trend that we saw after Cop26 [the 2021 UN climate change conference]. The value of the projects has really gone through the roof, so to speak. But anyone in the domestic panels business who says they have much stock is not telling you the truth.” He estimates that about 95% of all panels come from China. Its government heavily subsidised its solar PV industry, which helped bring down prices but also drove manufacturers in Europe and North America to the wall. Now, as Europe wakes up to its overdependence on Russian gas, it is realising it has an even greater dependence on China to supply solar panels. ‘My aim is to be off-grid as much as possible in the summer’ Norfolk homeowner Stephen Beardmore says he has just spent £14,500 on a complete home solar system – including panels, battery, diverter and car charger. He made the move not only because of recent electricity price rises but because “for me, it was always the right thing to do”. Beardmore, who works for the Royal Air Force, says: “I’ve been thinking about it for the last two years. I have always been keen on technology and keen on renewables, long before Putin invaded Ukraine.” Like many solar buyers, the biggest initial hurdle was finding a reputable supplier. “As soon as you start doing research, you get bombarded with ads on Instagram and Facebook. It felt like I was walking into a dodgy car sales agency,” Beardmore says. Friends recommended the Solar Shed in nearby King’s Lynn. “My aim is to be off-grid as much as possible in the summer. I agreed a 16-panel, 405W-per-panel system, with an 11kW battery. And I put a car charger in at the same time, even though I don’t have an electric car yet. For me, it’s about a change in lifestyle and the way you use power.” As part of his research, he calculated his household’s overall electricity usage before the panels were installed, which added up to 4,300 kWh over 2021. “They have only been up for six weeks but I’m completely happy with them. We have a smart meter and I’m already down to 80p a day for electricity.” Most of the panels are on a directly south-facing roof, with the rest on a west-facing roof. Installation was done with limited disruption. “I only had to take one day off. After the scaffolder came in, the whole thing only took two days.” As for the aesthetics of the panels, he says: “I don’t even notice them up there.” The only hitch so far is that the battery is yet to arrive, although he expects it to come soon. Would he recommend it? “In the current situation, if people don’t get the message about renewables now, they never will.” This article was amended on 25 August 2022 to add further detail about the potential savings from solar panels, clarifying that the payback period will be different for every household, and that without a battery to store electricity, home consumption could only be 25 to 30% of the electricity produced. • This article was amended on 25 August 2022 to add further detail about the potential savings from solar panels, clarifying that the payback period will be different for every household, and that without a battery to store electricity, home consumption could only be 25% to 30% of the electricity produced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2021/apr/19/coal-financing-costs-surge-as-investors-opt-for-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-19T05:01:22Z","webTitle":"Coal financing costs surge as investors opt for renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/19/coal-financing-costs-surge-as-investors-opt-for-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/apr/19/coal-financing-costs-surge-as-investors-opt-for-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Coal financing costs surge as investors opt for renewable energy","bodyText":"Coal financing costs have surged over the last decade as investors demand returns four times as high as the payoff required from renewable energy projects to justify the risk of investing in fossil fuels, as the world moves towards cleaner energy sources. A University of Oxford study found that over the same period the cost of investing in renewable energy sources, such as windfarms and solar arrays, has tumbled as the clean energy technologies prove they can be cost-effective and lucrative investments. The research analysed the cost of financing energy projects by tracking the “loan spreads” offered by lenders which determine how high they expect their returns to be to cover the risk of investing. Investors typically require wind and solar energy projects to make returns of at least 10% to 11% to account for the low risk of the investment. But for investments in coal, returns need to rocket to 40% to justify the rising risk that a high-polluting project might be left stranded as governments ramp up their climate action ambitions. Dr Ben Caldecott, the director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme and a co-author of the report, said lower loan spreads for renewable energy projects means they could become “even cheaper for ratepayers and taxpayers”, which is a “good thing for rapidly decarbonising the energy sector”. The report collated financing costs for renewable energy over a five-year period from 2010 to 2014 compared with loan costs between 2015 and 2020. It found that the cost of financing solar farms has fallen by 20%, while the cost of financing onshore and offshore windfarms has fallen by 15% and 33%, respectively. While Europe led the way in falling costs for offshore windfarms, Australia took the lead in driving down financing costs for onshore wind, and solar financing costs fell fastest in North America. But investors are demanding higher returns from coal projects, which has caused their financing costs to climb. Loan spreads for power stations and coalmines have increased sharply, at 38% and 54%, respectively. Caldecott added that the steep hike in costs for coalmines and coal-fired power plants proves that the risk of investing in fossil fuels during the transition to cleaner energy sources, which are “sometimes viewed as distant, long-term risks”, was already “priced in today”. “The challenge is that this isn’t happening evenly and certainly isn’t occurring at the pace required to tackle climate change. In particular, financing costs will need to rise for oil and gas projects,” he said. The financial constraints which have tightened around the coal industry since the shift towards cleaner energy began have not materialised to the same extent for the oil and gas industry, according to the research. The report found that the cost of financing gas-fired power plants climbed 7% over the last decade, but for coal plants costs have surged by 38% over a similar period. While the financing costs linked to coal mining have climbed by 58%, the cost of financing oil and gas production has climbed by only 3% over the last decade. In the case of offshore oil production, costs have fallen by over 40%. Dr Xiaoyan Zhou, also from the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme and the lead author of the report, said that the trend toward climate-conscious investing could see the cost of capital for oil and gas “go the way of coal”, which could have “very significant implications for the economics of oil and gas projects around the world”. “This could result in stranded assets and introduce substantial refinancing risks,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jan/02/james-webb-space-telescope-thrilling-future-for-mankind","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-02T09:00:13Z","webTitle":"Nasa’s Webb telescope is a joy.

But it’s the private ventures that push at limits","bodyText":"After years of delay, and massive cost over-runs, the James Webb space telescope (the JWST) was launched on Christmas Day. It will need to perform complex automated operations now it’s in space. The first and most challenging is happening this week: unfurling a heat shield the size of a tennis court. After this, its 6.5-metre mirror must be assembled from 18 pieces packed within the launching rocket’s nose-cone. There’s much that can go wrong and astronomers will remain anxious for the several months that will elapse before all necessary manoevres and tests are completed. After the Hubble Space Telescope was launched more than 30 years ago, its mirror turned out to be poorly aligned. But astronauts undertook a “rescue” mission to make adjustments and later made further visits to upgrade the instruments. The stakes are higher for the JWST: it’s vastly more elaborate, but there is no prospect of a repair mission. The Hubble telescope was in a low (and accessible) orbit: in contrast, the JWST’s orbit will be several times further away than the moon – far beyond the reach of astronauts. Some might argue that we therefore need to instigate more ambitious plans for human spaceflight: to enable human assembly of large structures in deep space, to return to the moon, and eventually to reach Mars. But I don’t share this view. Indeed as robotics and miniaturisation improve, the practical and scientific case for human spaceflight weakens. Its prime motive now is simply as an adventure – an ultra-expensive sport that should be left to billionaires and private sponsorship. Space technology has burgeoned – for communication, environmental monitoring, satnav and so forth. We depend on it every day. Unmanned probes to other planets have beamed back pictures of varied and distinctive worlds. And telescopes in space have revolutionised our knowledge of the cosmos. During this century, the whole solar system will be explored by flotillas of miniaturised probes, far more advanced than, for instance, Nasa’s wonderful Cassini probe, which spent 13 years exploring Saturn and its moons. This was launched 20 years ago and based on 1990s technology. Think how much better we could do today. Robotic fabricators will assemble vast lightweight structures in space (huge, gossamer-thin mirrors or solar energy collectors, for instance), maybe using raw materials mined from the moon or asteroids. And they could repair spacecraft in orbit far beyond the moon. Robotic and AI techniques are evolving fast. For instance, the Curiosity vehicle sent to Mars a decade ago trundled slowly across a Martian crater; if it encountered a rock, it needed instructions from Earth about how to divert its path. In contrast, Perseverance, which landed on Mars last February, has sufficient intelligence to find its way around obstacles. In another decade, such a probe will have AI sufficient to identify and explore interesting sites and geological formations. Nasa’s programme for human spaceflight, ever since Apollo, has been impeded by public and political pressure into being exceedingly risk-averse. The space shuttle failed twice in 135 launches. Thrill-seekers would willingly accept this 2% level of risk. But the shuttle had, unwisely, been promoted as “safe”. So each failure caused a national trauma and was followed by a hiatus while costly efforts were made (with very limited effect) to reduce the risk. Because of this safety culture, Nasa will confront political obstacles in achieving any grand goal within a feasible budget. But private enterprise ventures – SpaceX, Blue Origin and the rest – bringing a Silicon Valley culture into a domain long dominated by Nasa and a few aerospace conglomerates, can cut costs and tolerate higher risks than a western government could impose on publicly funded civilian astronauts. So it’s these ventures, with private funds and sponsorship, which should front manned missions. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low risk. And if that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle. These exploits must be sold as dangerous sports or intrepid exploration. Don’t ever expect mass emigration from Earth. And here I disagree strongly with Elon Musk and with my late colleague Stephen Hawking. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from its problems. We’ve got to solve them here. Coping with climate change is a doddle compared to terraforming Mars. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest. There’s no “Planet B” for ordinary, risk-averse people. Nonetheless, this century courageous thrill-seekers may establish bases independent from the Earth. Musk himself says he wants to die on Mars – but not on impact. Although we may not want to join these space adventurers we should cheer them on. This is why. They’ll be ill-adapted to Martian conditions, so they’ll have a compelling incentive to redesign themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed. These techniques will, one hopes, be restrained on Earth, on prudential and ethical grounds, but settlers on Mars will be beyond the clutches of the regulators. We should wish them good luck in modifying their progeny to adapt to alien environments. This might be the first step towards divergence into a new species. So it’s these spacefaring adventurers, not those of us comfortably adapted to life on Earth, who will spearhead the post-human era, evolving within a few centuries into a new species. (This evolution, proceeding on the timescale of technological advance, is potentially thousands of times faster than Darwinian selection.) Moreover, if they make the transition from flesh and blood to fully inorganic intelligences, they won’t need an atmosphere. And they may prefer zero-g, especially for constructing massive artifacts. So it’s in deep space – not on Earth, nor even on Mars – that non-biological “brains” may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine. The sun will survive 6bn more years before its fuel runs out. And the expanding universe will continue far longer, perhaps for ever. So even if intelligent life had originated only on the Earth, it need not remain a trivial feature of the cosmos: it could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever more complex intelligence spreads through the whole galaxy, via self-reproducing machines, transmitting DNA, instructions for 3D printers or suchlike. Interstellar voyages would hold no terrors for near-immortals. There’s plenty of time ahead.

Asked on the ABC’s Radio National whether NSW could meet a UN call for wealthy countries to phase out coal by 2030, Matt Kean said it could, pointing to the state plan to build 12GW of renewable energy and 2GW of energy storage that was passed by parliament with multi-party support last year. He said the federally backed Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro project would also help. “We absolutely can meet the target,” he said. “We have the biggest renewable energy plan that has been legislated in the nation’s history right here in NSW and that means as our coal-fired power plants reach the end of their lives over the next decade they will be replaced with renewables.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NSW gets nearly 70% of its electricity from burning black coal. The state has five coal-fired plants, only two of which – Liddell and Vales Point – are officially scheduled to close this decade. Kean’s comment suggests he believes the other three – including the Mount Piper plant, which is not scheduled to close until 2043 – will stop operating much earlier than planned. It is consistent with analyses that have found coal plants across the country may shut early as they were increasingly being priced out of the market by cheap solar energy. Not for the first time, Kean’s position appears at odds with the federal energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, who has backed an Energy Security Board recommendation to introduce a “capacity market” to ensure there is enough “dispatchable” energy – power that can be called on when needed – available to support variable renewable energy sources. Taylor has said the capacity market would be “technology neutral”, but could help keep existing generators – coal – “from shutting down too early”. Kean said last month he was “carefully examining” the ESB advice to ensure its proposals worked alongside the state’s plans to substantially increase renewable generation and new sources of dispatchable generation, such as pumped hydro and batteries, and would not increase costs for consumers. Kean also told the ABC he and the board of the Environment Protection Authority had accepted a judgment by the state’s land and environment court last month that the agency had a duty to develop objectives, policies and guidelines to protect the environment from climate change. It was the first time a court found an Australian government agency was failing in its duty to address global heating and must take action to address greenhouse gas emissions. It followed a legal challenge by the group Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action. Kean said he wanted to use “all the levers within government” to do what the court found was necessary. “We’ll be doing everything necessary to give that full effect,” he said. Kean was asked about reports this week that the Australian government had pressed the UK to remove specific climate targets from a trade deal. He said pressure was mounting on Australia “from our trusted friends and allies” to do more on the climate crisis. “It is starting to impact on our ability to trade into international markets and grow our economy,” he said. “For too long, Australian politicians have been complaining about the cost of taking action on climate change, but now we’re seeing the very real prospect of very significant costs from not taking action on climate change because those countries that are taking strong action – like the UK, like [member countries of] the EU, like the United States – they all do not want their efforts on decarbonisation to be in vain.” The UN’s assistant secretary general for climate action and special adviser to the secretary general, Selwin Hart, warned in a speech on Monday that the climate crisis would “wreak havoc” across the Australian economy if coal was not rapidly phased out. Kean said Australia was experiencing climate change through worsening bushfires and more severe droughts, but there were more “enormous opportunities” in job creation if governments acted to address the issue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/jan/27/one-in-five-uk-councils-have-no-climate-action-plan-campaigners-say","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-27T09:00:26Z","webTitle":"One in five UK councils have no climate action plan, campaigners say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/one-in-five-uk-councils-have-no-climate-action-plan-campaigners-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/jan/27/one-in-five-uk-councils-have-no-climate-action-plan-campaigners-say","fields":{"headline":"One in five UK councils have no climate action plan, campaigners say","bodyText":"More than one in five of all councils in the UK have no climate action plan, research shows. In 2019, Theresa May’s government committed the UK to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Since then, hundreds of local authorities have published plans to show how they intend to become carbon neutral. But analysis by the not-for-profit campaigning organisation Climate Emergency UK, shared exclusively with the Guardian, found that of the 409 local authorities across the UK, 84 still did not have climate action plans, while 139 had not committed to reach net zero emissions by a specific date. Climate Emergency UK scored 325 plans according to 28 questions grouped into nine categories, including how well councils’ plans would mitigate the impact of climate change locally, whether climate and ecological emergency was integrated into existing policies, community engagement, climate education, scale of emissions targets and commitments to tackle the ecological emergency. This first year’s scoring was intended to establish a baseline of councils’ plans and scale of ambition. Next year’s will assess to what extent local authorities are on track to reach net zero emissions. Although most local authorities have published climate plans, 38 district councils, three county councils, and 43 other councils in Great Britain and Northern Ireland have none. They include Norfolk county council, Gloucester city council and the London borough of Hackney. Annie Pickering, a campaigns and policy officer at Climate Emergency UK, said: “It’s been three years since the first councils declared climate emergencies and our scorecards show that many councils are still not making action on the climate and ecological emergency a priority. Councils can have a real influence on creating low-carbon communities, and with the warmest new year on record in the UK, we need to see action fast.” Somerset West and Taunton district council topped the league with a score of 91% (see below). Other high-scoring councils included West Midlands Combined Authority (89%), Staffordshire Moorlands (87%) and Solihull (85%). The average score across all UK local authorities was 46%. The analysis revealed significant regional variations, with the average score for Scottish authorities 50%, compared with 46% for England and 45% for Wales. Scotland scored particularly well on measuring and setting emissions targets. Scotland’s public bodies have been legally required since 2011 to reduce emissions and, since 2019, to report on progress. Edinburgh was the highest rated Scottish council, on 83%, and the joint fifth highest-scoring UK local authority. The city’s £1.3bn redevelopment of Granton Waterfront will create a 11 hectare coastal park to protect biodiversity, create up to 3,500 new net zero carbon homes, use lower-emitting offsite construction methods and improve public transport links. Edinburgh has allocated £2.8bn over 10 years to build 10,000 new sustainable and affordable homes by 2027, and to retrofit its 20,000 council houses to make them more energy efficient. And from 2025, all new school and early years buildings will be built to Passivhaus standard. The council has also upgraded all street lighting across the city to energy-efficient LED lights. In contrast, only four of Northern Ireland’s 11 councils had a climate action plan at all, with all four scoring 31% or lower. In Wales, just under a quarter of local authorities have no plan. The highest-scoring authority in Wales was Cardiff (70%), while in Northern Ireland it was Ards and North Down council (31%). “Some councils are clearly taking a strong lead on climate action, but others have much more to do,” said Cara Jenkinson, the cities manager at the sustainable energy charity Ashden. She said cutting emissions and nature restoration must be a priority for every council department “if they are to be carbon neutral by 2050, let alone 2030.” Nottingham is arguably the furthest ahead. The city has reduced its overall CO2 emissions per capita by 52.3% since 2005 and is on track to be carbon neutral by 2028. It has planted nearly 22,000 trees and installed more than 130 public electric vehicle charging points. Just under a third of council vehicles and nearly half of Hackney carriage taxis are ultra low emission vehicles, and the city has one of the UK’s largest fleets of electric buses. A workplace parking levy on employers providing 11 or more parking spaces for staff generates about £8m a year, which is ringfenced for renewable transport schemes. In 2014, Telford and Wrekin council became only the second local authority in the UK to build a publicly owned solar farm. To date it has saved more than 13,000 tonnes of CO2 emissionsand generated £1.3m for the council. Since 2020 the council has cut its carbon emissions by more than 57%. But English planning laws can make it harder to ensure that new developments are zero carbon or carbon neutral. From 2006, authorities were able to insist that houses were built to the highest energy standards, but this regulation was scrapped in 2015. The government’s new future homes standard aims to ensure new homes built from 2025 will produce 75-80% less carbon emissions than those built under current regulations. But councils’ energy efficiency plans remain subject to viability assessments from developers. If a developer can provide a sound viability assessment that proves a policy would make a scheme unaffordable, there is little local authorities can do to counter that. David Renard, the leader of Swindon council and the Local Government Association’s environment and planning spokesperson, said: “Local government has a fundamental role to play in tackling climate change, but net zero can only be achieved if councils are empowered.” The LGA is calling for stronger powers and longterm funding to tackle the climate emergency. A government spokesperson said: “We welcome this research, which shows four in five councils are supporting our ambitions to deliver net zero by setting out climate action plans, with more expected to follow. Councils have an integral part to play and we will continue to work very closely with local partners to meet our climate change commitments.” How Somerset turned green Somerset West and Taunton was the only council to score above 90% and was one of only 21 to get top marks for its plans to improve biodiversity and combat the ecological emergency. It has declared its area a fracking-free zone, pledged to manage council services, buildings and land in a biodiversity-friendly manner, embed ecological initiatives alongside climate action in all work areas, and ensure that addressing both emergencies are strategic priorities for planning policies and design guides for new development. It has developed a climate-positive planning policy and is building zero-carbon council houses, as well as retrofitting existing housing stock. The council’s entire pool car fleet will be electric by the end of 2022. Dixie Darch, the executive member for climate change at Somerset West and Taunton council, said local authorities should lead by example. “We are committed to putting the climate emergency and environmental responsibility at the heart of what we do. The challenge has never been greater for local councils: it is essential we rise to that challenge,” she said. In addition to its own plan to make the district net zero by 2030, Somerset West has joined with the county council and three other district councils to create a climate emergency strategy for the whole county. This strategy includes developing wind and solar energy on councils’ land, improving public transport and electric vehicle use, and the creation of a nature partnership to improve biodiversity and restore nature. A campaign promoting recycling has led recycling rates to increase to more than 50%, among the highest in England. Meanwhile, at Somerset county council, the highest-scoring county, initiatives include a £1.5m climate emergency fund for community projects that help the county become more resilient to climate change."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-02T23:38:33Z","webTitle":"Australia puts fossil fuel company front and centre at Cop26","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/nov/03/australia-puts-fossil-fuel-company-front-and-centre-at-cop26","fields":{"headline":"Australia puts fossil fuel company front and centre at Cop26","bodyText":"The Australian government has been criticised for prominently hosting a fossil fuel company at its pavilion at the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The condemnation came as the Morrison government confirmed it would not join about 90 countries in backing the official launch of a global pledge to reduce emissions of methane – a potent greenhouse gas leaked during gas and coal extraction and released by livestock – by 30% by 2030. The Australian pavilion in the Scottish Event Campus exhibition centre has been a hub of activity during the first two days of the summit. With numbers in the main plenary hall limited, Australians gathered there to watch Scott Morrison’s address to the conference on Monday. Space in the pavilion has been dedicated to Australian businesses, including Andrew Forrest’s green-hydrogen focused Fortescue Future Industries, Sun Cable, which plans to send solar energy captured in the Northern Territory to Singapore and Mineral Carbonation International. Alongside them is the oil and gas giant Santos. At the front of the pavilion on Tuesday was a Santos demonstration of its Moomba carbon capture and storage project in outback South Australia. Santos confirmed on Monday that the A$220m development would go ahead after the government announced it could receive carbon credit revenue from taxpayers through the emissions reduction fund. Australia’s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, joined Santos’ chief executive, Kevin Gallagher, at the pavilion to trumpet the announcement. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is in Glasgow as the chair of the Fortescue Future Industries, said it was “a pity” Australia had not signed up to the pledge and “a joke” that Santos had been given prime placement. “Look at the Australian stand – you’ve got a gas company highlighted apparently at the insistence of the energy minister, who thinks that our energy policy should be all about burning gas,” Turnbull told reporters. “The whole object is to stop burning fossil fuels. “We’ve got to cut all greenhouse gas emissions, methane and CO2, particularly. We can’t keep on pretending that this is a problem we can push out on to the future. We are living with the reality of global warming now.” Taylor spoke at the pavilion alongside the Santos chief while launching the government’s latest low-emissions technology statement – an annual update of its technology-driven approach to climate change. CCS is one of six priority technologies chosen to get government support. The minister said Santos’ CCS development at Moomba, which if successful will capture 1.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year from 2024, was a “very elegant project” that would allow it to produce gas while reducing emissions. Taylor said there were many different types of CCS but it was initially likely to be used in gas production sites and in the development of “blue” hydrogen using gas. “We can do exactly the same at Moomba and other places in the production of hydrogen,” he said. “This is not new, it’s very, very important, it’s going to be particularly important for the gas industry.” Asked about the global methane pledge, he said Australia’s focus was “whole of economy, all gasses”. “We’re not setting sector-specific targets and we’re not setting gas-specific targets,” he said. Taylor last week claimed signing up to the pledge would mean cut agricultural herd numbers, and the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said the only way to meet it would be to “start shooting your cattle”. Bill Hare, the chief executive of research firm Climate Analytics, said this was not correct. The government’s 2050 net-zero emissions plan has been criticised for including no new policies and relying on new technology to make emissions cuts in the 2030s and 40s. Its support for CCS technology – both burying greenhouse gases from industrial sites kilometres underground and potentially using captured carbon dioxide to make products – includes $250m for a “CCS technologies and hubs” program. Australian governments have committed about $4bn in funding for CCS over time, but it is yet to prove commercially viable at scale. The country has one operating CCS plant, at Chevron’s Gorgon gas development in Western Australia. It has suffered repeated delays and captures only a portion of the emissions at the site. The Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, who is also in Glasgow, said the Morrison government was spending Cop26 “busy hanging out with fossil fuel executives and hosting PR stunts for the gas industry”. The Australian Conservation Foundation said Australia was acting “shamelessly”. “Make no mistake, the Morrison government’s preoccupation with CCS is about keeping coal and gas Australia’s energy system longer, and delaying the transition to renewable energy with storage,” said ACF’s climate program manager, Gavan McFadzean. Taylor said the government was backing renewable energy by adding “ultra low-cost solar” as a priority in the new technology statement, as flagged last week when the government released its plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Cutting the price of solar further would be key to producing hydrogen made with renewable energy at scale, he said. “We welcome all forms of clean hydrogen production – green, blue – they are important,” he said. “You will see green growing rapidly over time, we certainly hope.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/sep/06/what-is-this-if-not-magic-italian-man-living-hobbit","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-06T14:48:38Z","webTitle":"‘What is this if not magic?’ The Italian man living as a hobbit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/06/what-is-this-if-not-magic-italian-man-living-hobbit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/sep/06/what-is-this-if-not-magic-italian-man-living-hobbit","fields":{"headline":"‘What is this if not magic?’ The Italian man living as a hobbit","bodyText":"Nicolas Gentile, a 37-year-old Italian pastry chef, did not just want to pretend to be a hobbit – he wanted to live like one. First, he bought a piece of land in the countryside of Bucchianico, near the town of Chieti in Abruzzo, where he and his wife started building their personal Shire from JRR Tolkien’s fictional Middle-earth. Then, on 27 August, alongside a group of friends and Lord of the Rings fans dressed as an elf, a dwarf, a hobbit, a sorcerer and humans, he walked more than 120 miles (200km) from Chieti to Naples, crossing mountains and rivers, to throw the “One Ring”, a central plot element of The Lord of the Rings saga, into the volcano crater of Mount Vesuvius. “Some time ago, I realised that books and films were no longer enough for me to satisfy my passion for the fantasy genre and, in particular, for the Lord of the Rings saga,” Gentile said. “I was still reading about the lives of other people. I decided that I wanted to live my hobbit life to the fullest.” In the two hectares of land he bought, he has already built his first house, where he lives with his family, in hobbit clothes, and his doors are also open to visitors. Here, the pastry chef, who has a degree in geology, plans to build the caravan of the dwarves, the green dragon inn and a large version of Bilbo Baggins’ house. His goal is to transform this piece of Abruzzo into a hobbit village, with an adjoining farmhouse, where visitors will be able to live in a magical world, which, according to Gentile, is not too far from the way people live in Bucchianico. “Over time, I realised that my friends, my relatives and the farmers of Bucchianico have always lived as hobbits. They work like hobbits, carrying out jobs that are all in close contact with nature. They celebrate like hobbits, by organising festivals and dances and even dress up as hobbits.” In Bucchianico, the festival of the Banderesi is organised every year. It is one of the oldest festivals in Europe – celebrated for almost 500 years and in which people wear medieval clothes, sing songs, dance and prepare typical local dishes. “Those are hobbit clothes,” says Gentile. ‘‘I realised that I have always lived in the Shire. The only thing missing was to become aware of it and build a village. I wanted people to enter my mind, my fantasy. Many make fun of us. Some think I am trying to escape from reality. Far from it. I am living my dream, my adventure. By purchasing that piece of land, I have removed it from a reality that I don’t like and am shaping it the way I want.” He says his “county” will be called the Contea Gentile, because of a copyright issue. The houses will be built through crowdfunding and will be sustainable, using solar energy. Like a true hobbit, Gentile loves nature and his goal is to take care of it. He says his journey to Vesuvius to throw the ring into the crater was not just an extravagant walk by Lord of the Rings fans – he wanted to send a message. “The earth today is threatened by pollution and the climate emergency, which are enemies as fearsome as Sauron. We wanted to show that our land, like Tolkien’s Middle-earth, must be saved and protected. That’s why we went there to throw the ring. I’m too much of an environmentalist to throw a piece of iron into nature, so I symbolically threw a piece of solidified lava into the crater and gave the ring to a little boy we met. “We met a lot of people over the course of those hundreds of kilometres. And the affection they showed us was incredible. The people on the street opened the doors to their houses for us, gave us food, offered to host us in their houses and let us take a shower. What is this if not magic?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jul/13/plan-to-build-worlds-biggest-renewable-energy-hub-in-western-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-13T02:59:09Z","webTitle":"Plan to build world’s biggest renewable energy hub in Western Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/13/plan-to-build-worlds-biggest-renewable-energy-hub-in-western-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jul/13/plan-to-build-worlds-biggest-renewable-energy-hub-in-western-australia","fields":{"headline":"Plan to build world’s biggest renewable energy hub in Western Australia","bodyText":"An international consortium wants to build what would be the world’s biggest renewable energy hub in Australia’s south-west to convert wind and solar power into green fuels like hydrogen. The group of energy companies announced the proposal over a 15,000 sq km area that could have a 50 gigawatt capacity and cost $100bn. An area bigger than the size of greater Sydney has been identified in the south-east of Western Australia with “consistently high levels of wind and solar energy”. Guardian Australia understands the Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH) could cost about $100bn. The project’s 50GW capacity compares to the 54GW of generation capacity of all the coal, gas and renewables plants currently in the national energy market, which includes all states except WA and the Northern Territory. Australia’s biggest coal plant is just 2.9GW. InterContinental Energy, CWP Global and Mirning Green Energy Limited announced plans for the mega project on Tuesday, saying it wants to build the scheme in three phases to produce up to 3.5m tonnes of green hydrogen or 20m tonnes of green ammonia each year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Australia understands the consortium is looking to produce the first fuels from the project by 2030, and will look to construct an offshore facility to transfer fuels onto ships. The consortium – which includes an Indigenous-owned energy company – said it wanted to tap into a global market for green hydrogen it expects will be worth US$50tn by 2050. About 30GW of the hub would focus on wind, with the rest coming from solar power. Hydrogen and ammonia produced at the hub would be destined for use in power stations, shipping, heavy industry and aviation. The hub would be larger than a 45GW renewables project announced by German company Svevind Energy and planned for Kazakhstan, reported to be the world’s biggest renewables project proposed so far. Last month, Australia’s environment minister Sussan Ley rejected a plan for a 26GW hub in the north of WA for “clearly unacceptable” impacts on threatened migratory species and internationally recognised wetlands. In a statement, Trevor Naley, chairman of the Mirning Traditional Lands Aboriginal Corporation and a board member on the consortium, said: “As First Nations land owners, the Mirning people are excited to hold such an integral and defining stake in this historical partnership with WGEH. This partnership, through robust governance and a seat at the table for Mirning people, will provide opportunities never before available to Indigenous corporations.” Brendan Hammond, chairman of WGEH said the proposal was “historic on two fronts” for its scale and its partnership with traditional owners. “It is an honour and a privilege to be involved in this groundbreaking project,” he said. WA’s hydrogen minister Alannah MacTiernan told the West Australian the proposal was “truly massive” and said the state was positioned to be a major contributor to global decarbonisation. The newspaper said the consortium had secured a licence from WA’s McGowan government to complete site surveys and research to pursue a business case for the project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/aug/19/labour-recall-parliament-energy-crisis-cost-of-living-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T20:30:58Z","webTitle":"Tory leadership race: Truss takes on Sunak in Manchester – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/19/labour-recall-parliament-energy-crisis-cost-of-living-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/aug/19/labour-recall-parliament-energy-crisis-cost-of-living-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Tory leadership race: Truss takes on Sunak in Manchester – as it happened","bodyText":"Michael Gove has backed Rishi Sunak to be the next Conservative leader, accusing Liz Truss of taking a “holiday from reality”. He told The Times: “I do not expect to be in government again. But it was the privilege of my life to spend 11 years in the cabinet under three prime ministers. I know what the job requires. And Rishi has it.” Gove, who was sacked as the levelling up secretary by Boris Johnson, added: “And here I am deeply concerned that the framing of the leadership debate by many has been a holiday from reality. “The answer to the cost-of-living crisis cannot be simply to reject further ‘handouts’ and cut tax.” Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap. The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation topped 10% for the first time in 40 years. At the latest hustings in Manchester, Liz Truss sidestepped a question about a 2009 report which she co-authored emerging today which called for doctors pay to be cut by 10%. She said doctors and nurses “feel like they are being told what to do from Whitehall rather than understanding the situation in their local area and being able to respond to their patients’ needs”. The foreign secretary also called for more transparency about the police’s record on fighting crime and having league tables for forces. At the hustings, Rishi Sunak was asked how he will deal with trade unions and said: “We need to crack on and pass a piece of legislation,” he says, referring to the minimum service bill which means they will not be able to hold the country “to ransom”. On crime, Sunak said he wants a new unit in the National Crime Agency to deal with grooming gangs and says we need to record the ethnicity of perpetrators. A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised. Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall. Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss has been accused of showing “her true colours” in an 2009 paper promoting government spending cuts including slashing doctors’ pay. Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in a controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, TalkTV discovered. Railway changes will be imposed if workers do not agree to new deals, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said. The Conservative party has repeatedly targeted unions with criticism, in a move that the Trades Union Congress has argued is deliberately “picking a fight” for electoral purposes. The frontrunner to be the UK’s next prime minister has made her views on unions clear: she has approvingly tweeted a report that she intends to make striking more difficult. “New laws will make it harder to call strikes and also guarantee minimum levels of service are maintained on public transport”, according to a report by the Daily Express, a newspaper which is strongly pro-government and is supporting Truss in the Conservative leadership race. The under-fire rail operator Avanti West Coast has been “rewarded for failure”, Labour said, after the company was paid more than £17m in taxpayers’ money by ministers for performance and management fees in just two years, despite being the worst-performing operator on the rail network. The figures from 2019-20 and 2020-21 include almost £4m in bonuses to Avanti for “operational performance”, “customer experience” and “acting as a good and efficient operator”. The UK’s transport department has announced £130m of funding for England’s bus network to make up for shortfalls in revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cash would help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England’s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said. A green thinktank has criticised Rishi Sunak’s promise to protect farmland from solar farms, saying biofuels use 77 times the amount of arable land. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: “Solar energy isn’t standing in the way of food production in the UK. Instead, solar panels generate cheap, clean energy that doesn’t depend on Russia, and provide income to farmers too.” Rishi Sunak’s campaign has hit out at frontrunner Liz Truss after she declined to attend a hustings organised by the National Farmers’ Union. Farmers now expect Truss to take part in a hustings with the NFU in September, after she was initially accused of snubbing the organisation by deciding not to attend the event on Friday. Constituents of the Covid rule-breaking MP Margaret Ferrier are said to be “aghast” that she remains in post, as calls for her to resign gathered pace after she pleaded guilty on Thursday to “culpably and recklessly” exposing the public to the virus. The former Scottish National party politician, who now sits as an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, faced immediate calls to stand down. And that brings the hustings to an end. The remaining hustings are Birmingham on August 23, Norwich on August 25 and London on August 31. Truss was criticised by an audience member for “sounding like Labour” in wanting to “borrow £50 billion”. The foreign secretary did not address the criticism but said her fundamental view is that high taxes fail to bring money in to the Exchequer. Asked by an audience member whether she would build more houses to solve the housing crisis, Truss instead cites her plans to help people secure mortgages and criticised the planning system. Truss declares she does “support fracking in areas where there is local support”, adding that the local communities should stand to benefit. The foreign secretary also backs nuclear power and with drilling in the North Sea. Asked whether local objections from “Nimbys” should be overruled, Truss says local communities need to be shown the benefits and this involves “encouraging” rather than overruling. Sunak earlier spoke about wanting his football team Southampton to beat Manchester United this weekend, despite them in fact being scheduled to face Leicester City. He was asked at the Manchester hustings how as a Southampton FC fan how he would get back to winning ways. “I’m going to be unpopular for saying it here, starting by beating United this weekend,” he said. Southampton are not due to play Manchester United until August 27. Truss suggested that retired doctors could be asked to help clear the Covid backlog after many returned to work to help at the start of the pandemic. Truss said doctors and nurses “feel like they are being told what to do from Whitehall rather than understanding the situation in their local area and being able to respond to their patients’ needs”. Earlier today, a 2009 report Ms Truss co-authored came to light, which called for doctors pay to be cut by 10%. Truss also suggested senior police staff could be removed from their posts if their force performs poorly in her league table. It is now Truss’s turn for some questions. The foreign secretary calls for more transparency about the police’s record on fighting crime and having league tables for forces. “It does help the police be held to account,” she added. Sunak is asked about levelling up, weeks after video footage showed him telling Tory members of his work diverting public funds from ‘deprived urban areas’. He responds: “If we define levelling up as something that is only for the north we will pay a political price for it because it’s wrong. “I am proud of my record delivering for the north and I will continue delivering for the north.” On how he will help low and middle earning families, Sunak replies: “The best way to help those people is to make sure it’s only tough for one winter”. He added it will not help families to do things that might make us feel better for “five minutes” and if inflation persists “we are all stuffed”. On how he will deal with trade unions, Sunak says “We need to crack on and pass a piece of legislation,” he says, referring to the minimum service bill which means they will not be able to hold the country “to ransom”. He added that the government must not put “fuel on the fire” of inflation and repeat mistakes that were made in the 1970s. The Guardian’s Peter Walker gives his reaction to the questions posed by host Alastair Stewart. The former chancellor believes countries that the UK agrees trade deals with must agree to take back their “failed asylum-seekers”. Sunak is proposing a £10 fine for missed appointments and replicating the private health sector’s elective surgeries which he said allowed doctors to perform more operations. Sunak said there were 50 million missed appointments in the NHS in 2021 which “deprives people of the care they need” and he calls for the need to be “bold and radical” to reform the NHS and learn from private healthcare. Sunak adds he wants a new unit in the National Crime Agency to deal with grooming gangs. It is now the part where the candidates get the proverbial grilling. Sunak is asked about how he would keep Britain’s streets safe. He claims “we do not talk enough” about grooming gangs and says we need to record the ethnicity of perpetrators. Sunak added we should not let political correctness stand in the way and that we need to toughen up sentencing as people should be given a second or third chance “but not a nineteenth chance”. Truss says before she became an MP in 2010 she was a local councillor and sat on the planning committee. Repeating one of her favourite one-liners, she adds: “Those are hours of my life I will never get back.” Truss reiterates her plan to make the most of the post-Brexit opportunities and get all the EU laws off the statute books by the end of 2023. Truss pledges to build Northern Powerhouse Rail and wants to make the M62 the “super highway to success”. Liz Truss enters the arena after a fairly bland campaign video in comparison. Sunak insists he will not pursue policies that risk making inflation far worse, inadvertently criticising the economic plan of his rival Liz Truss for wanting to pass £50bn of debt to future generations, adding: “That is not right.” Sunak opens with that regularly repeated rhetoric in the hustings about Britain doing something “extraordinary” for his family by allowing them to make a life. He also vows to take on “lefty, woke culture” that seeks to cancel this country’s values and women. Sunak said: “I will never let political correctness stand in the way of keeping us safe.” Protesters gathered outside the Manchester Central Convention Complex chanting “Tories Out” with placards reading “no to Rwanda” referencing the government’s immigration policy. Rishi Sunak is first on stage after his campaign video where the narrator, who sounded similar to actor Ray Winstone, talking about “everyone loves an underdog”. Alastair Stewart, who hosted the first ever televised leaders’ debate between David Cameron, Nick Clegg, and Gordon Brown in 2010, will be hosting tonight’s hustings. The latest hustings is taking place in Manchester from 7pm. You can follow all the action here. Here’s a round up of the key developments of the day so far: Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap. The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation topped 10% for the first time in 40 years. A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised. Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall.

Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak face another hustings tonight in Manchester. The event is hosted by GB News presenter Alastair Stewart, who will interview both Tory leadership candidates separately from 7pm before they answer members’ questions. Regional bus services in England that were facing the axe have been given a reprieve after the government announced £130m of funding to keep them going for at least six months. Services in the north-east and South Yorkshire were at risk amid concern that many more routes could be cut back when Covid grants, which propped up routes during the pandemic, expire at the start of October. The Department for Transport said on Friday it would provide further support to ensure that services keep running until March 2023. The further £130m of support takes the total degree of pandemic funding to £2bn as bus companies wrestle with rising costs and continued low patronage of their services. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: At a time when people are worried about rising costs, it’s more important than ever we save these bus routes for the millions who rely on them for work, school and shopping. Covid grants for bus companies were introduced to help sustain routes that had lost passengers during the pandemic. They were extended in the spring for a further six months with £150m to stave off feared widespread cuts to services, but the government had previously warned that no further funding would be available.

Farmers now expect Truss to take part in a hustings with the NFU in September, after she was initially accused of snubbing the organisation by deciding not to attend the event on Friday. Sunak, her rival for the Tory leadership, did attend the event in Warwickshire, where he promised to lead the “most pro-farming and pro-countryside government this country has seen in decades”. Sunak’s team said Truss’s absence “raises questions about her willingness to listen to the needs of farmers and the wider food industry”. The NFU president, Minette Batters, told the Guardian on Thursday that it was a “shame” Truss did not want to attend the hustings. Farmers have been among the groups angered by some of the post-Brexit trade deals championed by the foreign secretary, which they see as undercutting their livelihoods. Truss was also expected to be quizzed about claims from the environment secretary, George Eustice, who supports Sunak, that she had been resistant to putting animal welfare standards in UK trade deals. On Friday, an NFU spokesperson said Truss would attend a hustings with the farming body on 1 September. If it goes ahead, it will be one of the final husting events of the leadership campaign. The Sunak campaign said the former chancellor had “announced that he will set a new food security target, aggressively champion local produce, ensure the sector has the labour it needs, and take time to negotiate trade deals in the best interests of British farmers”. A spokesperson added: He will support farmers to boost their productivity and profitability and protect our best farmland. Farmers are the lifeblood of our nation. A Rishi Sunak-led government will make sure there is a bright future ahead for British agriculture, and he will always engage positively with the industry. More than 53,510 UK-based students were scrambling for places on university courses on Friday, the day after receiving lower grades in their A-level results, with many missing out on their offers in the most competitive year for university places in a decade. This year’s number of applicants marked as “free to be placed in clearing” on the Ucas website is the highest in more than a decade, and compares with 39,230 in clearing at the same point last year. Some of these students missed their grades while others declined their offers, and some may decide not to go to university. By Friday, 6,640 UK school-leavers had found places through clearing, a 33% increase on last year. A third more students – 23,640 – accepted their insurance choices after missing the grades for their top choice. University admissions directors reported that they had seen unprecedented levels of demand in clearing, with phone lines busier than ever, including from students with top grades. The UK’s transport department has announced £130m of funding for England’s bus network to make up for shortfalls in revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cash would help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England’s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said. Bus companies – like other parts of the UK’s struggling public transport industry – have been fighting to attract customers back to their routes after passenger numbers slumped during the coronavirus lockdowns. The government gave bus providers their first bailout (worth £400m) in April 2020 to protect routes while passenger numbers were down. Since then the value of funding made available to 160 companies had reached £2bn, the government said on Friday. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary who has had a busy day, said: At a time when people are worried about rising costs, it’s more important than ever we save these bus routes for the millions who rely on them for work, school and shopping. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, a lobby group for the bus and coach industry, perhaps unsurprisingly welcomed the money. A spokesperson said: Today’s announcement will help bus operators and local authority partners to balance a network of reliable and affordable services in the short-term as bus networks adapt to new travel patterns. For the longer-term, we will continue to work closely with central government and local authorities to encourage existing and new passengers to get on board the country’s buses, ensuring they are provided the best possible services. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak face another hustings tonight, this time with Conservative members living in the north of England. The event is hosted by GB News presenter Alastair Stewart, who will interview both Tory leadership candidates separately from 7pm before they answer members’ questions. The frontrunner to be the UK’s next prime minister has made her views on unions clear: she has approvingly tweeted a report that she intends to make striking more difficult. “New laws will make it harder to call strikes and also guarantee minimum levels of service are maintained on public transport”, according to a report by the Daily Express, a newspaper which is strongly pro-government and is supporting Truss in the Conservative leadership race. The rule changes could include raising the threshold for strike action – already fairly stringent in the UK – and limit the number of strikes unions can carry out once they have received the backing of votes. She will push through changes “within a month of becoming prime minister”, the Express reported. The European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU) describes UK strike laws as “complex and multilayered with detailed regulations introduced by Conservative governments over years”. This already includes a requirement for 40% of the total workforce (including those who do not vote) to vote in favour of action. Follow our business liveblog here for more on the strikes: Constituents of the Covid rule-breaking MP Margaret Ferrier are said to be “aghast” that she remains in post, as calls for her to resign gathered pace after she pleaded guilty on Thursday to “culpably and recklessly” exposing the public to the virus. The former Scottish National party politician, who now sits as an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, faced immediate calls to stand down, including from the leader of her former party, Nicola Sturgeon, in October 2020 when it emerged she had visited a number of venues in her constituency and spoken in the Commons while awaiting the result of a Covid test. After Ferrier, 61, admitted she had failed to self-isolate and had “exposed people to risk of infection, illness and death” at a hearing prior to a planned trial at Glasgow sheriff court, those calls for her to resign have once more gained momentum. Martin Lennon, a Scottish Labour councillor for Rutherglen Central and North said: Most people here are aghast that this has gone on so long. The fact that she pleaded guilty is the cherry on top. If she plans to squat in the seat until the next election, she needs to do the decent thing. She had a really good reputation locally, but now has tarnished all that.” Read more here: Following the news that Vladimir Putin will be heading to the G20 meeting in Indonesia in November, Rishi Sunak has said he would lobby the summit to ban the Russian president while Liz Truss said previously she would use it as an opportunity to “call out” Putin. A spokesperson for Sunak said: Our G20 partners and allies have a collective responsibility to call Putin’s abhorrent behaviour out. Sitting round a table with him isn’t good enough when he is responsible for children being killed in their beds as they sleep. We need to send a strong message to Putin that he doesn’t have a seat at the table unless and until he stops his illegal war in Ukraine. Last month, Truss – who is currently the foreign secretary – said it would be important to confront Putin in front of allies like India and Indonesia. She said: I would go there, and I would call Putin out. Indonesia is head of the G20 this year and has faced pressure from the west to uninvite Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been invited to attend the summit in Bali. You can follow our Russia-Ukraine war liveblog here: Labour has accused the government of allowing water companies to “cut corners”, after new figures showed 1,076 years’ worth of raw sewage has been dumped into UK waterways since 2016. Here’s the report from PA Media: Figures obtained by the party from the Environment Agency through freedom of information requests indicate that, since 2016, raw sewage has been pumped into the natural environment for a total of 9,427,355 hours. Labour warned that the figures, which equate to 392,806 days’ worth of raw sewage discharge, probably do not cover the full scale of pollution. The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, attacked water companies and the government over the findings. He said: Families across Britain are trying to enjoy the summertime. Whilst water companies are paying billions in dividends, the Tories have allowed them to cut corners and pump filthy raw sewage on to our playing fields and into our waters. Labour will put a stop to this disgraceful practice by ensuring there can be enforcement of unlimited fines, holding water company bosses legally and financially accountable for their negligence, and by toughening up regulations that currently allow the system to be abused. The party said areas affected by raw sewage discharge include popular tourist and bathing spots, such as rivers and beaches. Labour also said the data shows there has been a 2,553% increase in the number of monitored discharge hours between 2016 and 2021, with the party arguing that the situation is “drastically worsening” under the Conservatives. In 2016, the Environment Agency recorded 100,533 hours’ worth of spills. By 2021, that figure had rocketed to 2,667,452. Earlier this month, a story in the Telegraph suggested that official plans to reduce the level of raw sewage discharged into waterways had been temporarily shelved. However, the government now appears to be sticking to the September deadline. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pointed to a statement released on its website on Thursday, which said the government is “taking action” on sewage discharges, with the current administration being the first to set an expectation on water companies to significantly reduce discharges from storm overflows. The water minister, Steve Double, said: We are the first government to take action to tackle sewage overflows. We have been clear that water companies’ reliance on overflows is unacceptable and they must significantly reduce how much sewage they discharge as a priority. This is on top of ambitious action we have already taken, including consulting on targets to improve water quality which will act as a powerful tool to deliver cleaner water, pushing all water companies to go further and faster to fix overflows. Work on tackling sewage overflows continues at pace and we will publish our plan in line with the 1 September statutory deadline. A green thinktank has criticised Rishi Sunak’s promise to protect farmland from solar farms, saying biofuels use 77 times the amount of arable land. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: Solar energy isn’t standing in the way of food production in the UK. Instead, solar panels generate cheap, clean energy that doesn’t depend on Russia, and provide income to farmers too. A much better way of feeding people would be to stop using food crops to fuel cars. Biofuels for cars are a zombie policy. It’s now cheaper to decarbonise transport by getting more electric vehicles on the roads and freeing up land we’ve used for biofuels for food production instead. Green Alliance said biofuel production covered 108,000 hectares of arable land, enough to grow food for 3.5 million people, while solar farms covered only 1,400 hectares. The thinktank added that land used for solar farms could be used to grow crops at the same time. Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss has been accused of showing “her true colours” in an 2009 paper promoting government spending cuts including slashing doctors’ pay. Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in a controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, TalkTV discovered. It came days after the Guardian revealed a leaked recording of Truss saying that British workers needed “more graft” and suggesting they lacked the “skill and application” of foreign rivals. Polls have consistently put Truss as clear favourite to win the race for No 10, with polling expert Sir John Curtice saying he would be “extraordinarily surprised” if she does not take office. Labour said Truss’s report from 13 years ago, entitled “Back to Black”, revealed that “the reality of her agenda is devastating cuts”. In the document, the seven authors, including Truss, recommended cutting £28bn in a year by introducing “user charges for GPs” and reducing the pay of registrars, consultants, GPs and managers by 10%. Read more here: The under-fire rail operator Avanti West Coast has been “rewarded for failure”, Labour said, after the company was paid more than £17m in taxpayers’ money by ministers for performance and management fees in just two years, despite being the worst-performing operator on the rail network. The figures from 2019-20 and 2020-21 include almost £4m in bonuses to Avanti for “operational performance”, “customer experience” and “acting as a good and efficient operator”. At the same time, the firm raised prices, with an open return from Manchester to London – barely a two-hour journey – costing £369.40. The performance-related fees, signed off by transport ministers, came despite Avanti being the worst-performing operator in the country with almost half of its services arriving late. In the last two years alone the firm received more than 50,000 complaints, the most of any operator and almost double that of the parallel east coast mainline operator, LNER. Avanti, co-owned by the Italian national railways, has come under renewed criticism for slashing services between major cities by up to two-thirds on the west coast mainline, and earlier this week passengers were forced to climb a fence at Oxenholme station in Cumbria after being locked in as their train arrived 100 minutes late. Avanti West Coast, whose contract is due for renewal in October, already has the lowest passenger satisfaction rating possible, a figure the transport minister Charlotte Vere said last month was “terrible”. Despite this, the Department for Transport (DfT) confirmed it would continue to hand over millions of pounds in management fees, after ruling out fining the operator for the failing service. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, has warned her counterpart, Grant Shapps, that the government “cannot continue to wash their hands of responsibility, nor reward failure” as the damage to the economy from the ongoing failure of the private operator mounts. Read more here: The Tory leadership candidates face a further hustings with voting party members in Manchester on Friday, as frontrunner Liz Truss was accused of showing “her true colours” in an unearthed 2009 paper promoting vast government spending cuts. Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in the controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, PA Media reports. Polls have consistently put Truss as clear favourite to win the race for No 10, with elections guru Sir John Curtice saying he would be “extraordinarily surprised” if she does not take office. He told the Times that the foreign secretary “would have to foul up in some spectacular fashion” for her rival Rishi Sunak to enter Downing Street. Labour said Truss’s report from 13 years ago, entitled “Back to Black”, revealed that “the reality of her agenda is devastating cuts”. In the document, the seven authors - including Truss - recommended cutting £28bn in a year by introducing “user charges for GPs” and reducing the pay of registrars, consultants, GPs and managers by 10%. The report also called for the abolition of universal child benefit, the removal of the winter fuel payment, and the axing of several major military procurement projects including the Royal Navy’s planned aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales – which were described as “inappropriate defence projects”. Truss’s campaign attempted to distance the Tory leadership candidate from the paper, with a campaign spokesperson saying: Co-authoring a document does not mean that someone supports every proposal put forward. Liz is focused on her bold economic plan to boost growth, cut taxes and put money back into hardworking people’s pockets. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: Liz Truss’s track record shows her true colours. She is out of touch and out of step with the public. The reality of her agenda is devastating cuts that risk national security, punishing patients already facing record waiting times and cutting the pay of frontline workers. Her desperate attempts to distance herself from her own views now will fool no one. Railway changes will be imposed if workers do not agree to new deals, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said. The Conservative party has repeatedly targeted unions with criticism, in a move that the Trades Union Congress has argued is deliberately “picking a fight” for electoral purposes. Shapps is likely to remain transport secretary until at least 5 September, when a new Conservative party leader – likely to be Liz Truss if recent polls are correct – will be in place. There is little sign there would be a change of attitude under a new leader. Asked on Friday by Sky News if compulsory redundancies were on the table for rail workers, Shapps said (PA Media reports): The deal that is on the table actually means largely no compulsory redundancies at all. If [the unions] are not prepared to put that deal to your membership we will never know whether members would accept it. What I do know and I can say for sure is if we can’t get this settled in the way that we are proposing, which is ‘please put the deal to your membership’ then we will have to move to what is called a section 188; it is a process of actually requiring these changes to go into place so it becomes mandated. That is the direction that this is moving in now. Shapps claimed that outdated work practices needed to be updated – a characterisation of the industry that is disputed by the unions, who argue that employers are trying to use modernisation as an excuse to reduce members’ real pay and conditions. Shapps said: “If we can’t get those modernisations in place we will have to impose those modernisations but we would much rather do it through these offers actually being put to their members.” Follow our business liveblog for more on the rail strikes: Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap. The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation topped 10% for the first time in 40 years. Ofgem will announce the new level at which energy bills will be capped next Friday, with forecasts predicting an increase to £3,582, or 82% above the current cap. Annual energy bills are expected to hit £4,500 a year from January, and £5,456 from April, with warnings that households across the country face serious hardship without government intervention. Labour this week unveiled a £29bn plan to freeze the cap at the current level of £1,971 for six months from October, which would save the average household £1,000, piling pressure on the next prime minister to follow suit. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, has now written to the prime minister, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, urging them to recall parliament two weeks early and to freeze the price cap before winter. Across Britain, people are having to make unthinkable choices about how to pay their bills, causing endless worry for households and businesses. In seven days, Ofgem will announce the rise of the energy price cap. Against the backdrop of a rise in inflation to 10.1%, this won’t just send households into a further spiral of worry, pushing them to cut back even further ahead of the winter. But it will create another shock for our economy. With businesses and households on the brink, we cannot wait to act. Families deserve a government that is on their side, and is ready to take the action needed now to meet the scale of this national emergency. Earlier this month, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey, called on the government to announce an emergency budget to deal with the cost of living crisis. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, has also urged the prime minister to bring back MPs before the end of the summer recess. Read more here: A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised. Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall. Butler is also calling for a “forensic examination” of the accounts of remaining suppliers to ensure they are still viable businesses. Ofgem is expected to announce next week a rise in the price cap, which is supposed to protect consumers. This could mean annual bills jumping from an average of £1,971 to £3,582. Butler, who was a senior policy adviser to Gordon Brown, echoed the former prime minister’s view that energy firms unable to offer lower bills should be re-nationalised. Writing for the Guardian, Butler said: As with the financial sector in 2008, if the private energy sector fails to meet the needs of the society it serves, its functions must and will be taken on by the government. The companies involved now must show they understand that they must use their skills and resources in the public interest. Butler’s comments come as the government assesses options to help households facing soaring energy bills this winter. His former employer BP has been accused of “unfettered profiteering” during the energy crisis, aided by a rise in wholesale oil and gas prices caused in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Read the full story here: Health sector leaders have warned the UK faces a “humanitarian crisis” of worsening health outcomes unless the government does more to help with rising energy costs. Families are looking ahead to a grim winter as experts predict the cap on energy bills will hit close to £3,600 a year from October, before rising again next year, PA Media reports. Surging prices mean people will have to choose between skipping meals to heat their homes or living in poor conditions, the NHS Confederation said in a letter to ministers. Matthew Taylor is chief executive of the body, which represents NHS leaders, and was quoted by the BBC and the Times as saying: The country is facing a humanitarian crisis. Many people could face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions. This in turn could lead to outbreaks of illness and sickness around the country and widen health inequalities, worsen children’s life chances and leave an indelible scar on local communities. The regulator is set to announce the new price cap, which will come into effect from October, next Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have suggested plans to freeze bills at the same level as now, while many of the biggest energy suppliers have backed a similar idea. But the government has made it clear it will not do anything substantial until a new prime minister is in office on 5 September. On Thursday, the trade body for energy companies called for more support on top of the £400 promised to households in May. Dhara Vyas, Energy UK’s director of advocacy, said: Time is running very short ahead of October and we know many customers are already struggling after the last price rise – so the predicted increases will simply be unaffordable for millions of households. Given the urgency, our industry believes the most practical way to help customers ahead of Christmas will be to increase the amount of support made through the existing bills support scheme. Labour is calling for the government to get a grip on the energy crisis and said the two Tory leadership candidates need to show they are “serious” about the problem and back a recall of parliament. Ofgem is expected to announce next week a rise in the price cap, which is supposed to protect consumers. This could mean annual bills jumping from an average of £1,971 to £3,582. The opposition party has written to Boris Johnson, as well as Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, to ask for MPs to return to Westminster on Monday in a bid to propose their plan to freeze the cap. Asked by Sky News what the purpose of a recall would be, shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said: It would be so that we can pass the legislation that would be necessary for us to override the price rise, the rise in the price cap that Ofgem will be announcing in seven days’ time. That could happen next week if we get back to parliament on Monday. That is up to the government to request of the Speaker, and they can do that. The prime minister is perfectly capable of opening his email which I sent him last night asking him to do just this. I have also asked both leadership candidates to back that call. If they are really serious about helping working people and struggling households and businesses through this cost-of-living crisis, they should back our call right now and we should be passing that legislation next week. The Labour frontbencher added: The time to act is now; the government has failed. They could have acted weeks ago, they could have acted months ago in fact when Labour first called for a windfall tax on oil and gas way back in January. Welcome to today’s politics liveblog.

Yet only about half of Australians say they always wear sunglasses when they’re outside, according to research conducted by Specsavers.Australia is hit by more solar energy than any other continent on earth. And while we’re raised on a diet of “Slip, Slop, Slap, Seek, Slide”, at least two-thirds of us will be diagnosed with skin cancer before we turn 70. Sun damage can also seriously affect our eyes. Yet only about half of Australians say they always wear sunglasses when they’re outside, according to research conducted by Specsavers. The science behind sun protection has come a long way since the early days of “no hat, no play”. Our defences against UV damage are always improving, and it’s time to make sure you’re doing the best you can to keep every part of your body safe in the sun. Sunscreen is only part of being sun smart Lathering on a thick layer of sunscreen at the beach feels more like sun protection than it really is, says Dr Linda Martin, a doctor with Melanoma Institute Australia. She says the more critical aspects are keeping out of the sun altogether or, if it’s unavoidable, putting as many barriers as possible between us and UV rays. “The most important parts of sun protection are behavioural: walking in the shade, not going out in the midday sun, and wearing appropriate clothes and hats,” Martin says. That means wearing a hat that protects our ears, face and neck, tops and pants that cover our skin, and well-fitted sunglasses. “Sun protection is wearing long-sleeved clothing and a hat, and sitting in the shade.” There are different types of sun damage Spending time in the sun without protection has short- and long-term risks. Sunburn exposes us to pigmentation changes, such as age spots and freckles, and signs of premature ageing, such as decreased elasticity, dryness and uneven skin texture. “But the long-term risks are getting cancer,” Martin says. “The common skin cancers are BCC (basal cell carcinoma), SCC (squamous cell carcinoma) and actinic keratosis. But, while rare, there are also more deadly skin cancers, like melanoma.” Our eyes can be affected in different ways, too. Simon Kelly, an optometrist at Specsavers, says we also need to be thinking about protecting the whole eye, not just the iris. “The skin on the eyelid is particularly thin and a very common place for eye cancers,” he says. “Other sun-related issues that can affect the quality of our vision are cataracts, pterygiums – a fatty growth that can spread to the cornea – and macular degeneration.” Your eyes need sun protection, too Choosing the right eye care is critical to getting the right level of protection. “There are different types of sun protection,” Kelly says. “Polarised is recommended by the Cancer Council for good reason – because the light that bounces off things and gets under our natural defence mechanisms, like the eyebrow, can get into our eyes and cause damage. Polarisation cuts out that bounce and glare.” Always think about sun protection for your eyes, no matter how long you’re planning to be outdoors or what the weather is like. Kelly says we should be choosing sunglasses that are big enough to cover the eyes and the skin around them, and that wrap around the side to try as much light as possible from getting in. He says we need to look for regulated products that are fit for purpose, not just fashion sunnies that look good but don’t offer any protection. “Sometimes people have got vision problems, and they might need prescription sunglasses. Some people don’t like to wear sunglasses because they can’t see as well, or because they’re looking through a darker lens, but it’s often because their eyes are out of focus. All they need to do is get prescription sunnies.” Prevention is the best defence Martin and Kelly both say we should always be thinking about sun protection for our eyes, no matter how long we’re planning to be outdoors or what the weather is like. “Sun protection should be considered on all occasions,” Martin says. “One thing to remember is that the visible light – the brightness of the day and heat – are separate from UV radiation. Just because it’s hot doesn’t mean there’s high UV and vice versa.” The World Health Organisation recommends that sun protection should be considered when the UV index is greater than 3. But Martin says the need for protection also depends on skin colour and the duration of exposure, and we should always err on the side of caution. The effects of UV damage might not show up until years later Starting good sun protection habits early can save lives. We have a significantly increased chance of developing melanoma if we were sunburnt as children and teenagers. We have a significantly increased chance of developing melanoma if we were sunburnt as children and teenagers. Teaching our children to cover up properly, apply and reapply sunscreen, wear the right sunglasses and avoid midday sun can protect them from deadly cancers and other sun-related conditions later in life. For the rest of us, choosing the best sun protection every day – even if we’re only outdoors for a moment – is the best way to minimise long-term damage and stay healthy. Specsavers optometrists are encouraging all Aussies to be sun smart as we head into warmer weather, and to visit an optometrist for a routine eye test or if they have any concerns about their eyes.

What are the key policies – and what’s missing? Ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 Not only will consumers be unable to buy petrol and diesel cars, the strategy also says that by 2035 all cars must be fully zero emissions capable. There’s new cash for the transition to electric vehicles – further funding of £620m for zero emission vehicle grants and electric charging infrastructure. That is likely to focus on residential streets – charging points that can be used by the average consumer. But there is little in the plan – beyond market forces – that directly helps people afford new electric cars. By 2035 the UK will be powered entirely by clean electricity This energy transition will involve at least one new large nuclear plant by 2024 and a new £120m fund will also develop technology for possible future reaction. Wylfa, in north Wales, is named as one such site. But renewables will be a key factor, with the aim of 40GW of offshore wind power by 2030 and the creation of more onshore wind and solar energy supplies. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and Ofgem are consulting on and introducing changes designed to boost investment in wind, but there are fears that it will come too late to meet the target without other interventions. Investment in hydrogen production The strategy aims to deliver 5GW of hydrogen production capacity by 2030, while halving emissions from oil and gas. It emphasises the need to “manage the transition in a way that protects jobs and investment, uses existing infrastructure, maintains security of supply, and minimises environmental impacts”. 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 One of the more eye-catching policies was an ambition for the UK to become “a world-leader in zero emission flight” and saying the UK aimed to kickstart the commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuel “so people can fly, and connect without guilt”. By 2030, however, the percentages are still small. The ambition is to ensure 10% of fuel used by airlines is sustainable, as well as £180m in funding for the development of sustainable aviation fuel plants. Cash to upgrade home heating systems from gas boilers to heat pumps There will be £5,000 grants to help 90,000 households install home heat pumps, and other low-carbon heating systems, over the next three years. Heat pumps cost much more than replacement gas boilers. The government hopes the grants should bring the costs to similar levels until prices rapidly decrease, a gamble that the market will take care of the millions more homes in Britain that are powered by gas boilers. Downing Street has declined to say whether the government will ban gas boilers in the future, after international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said “there will be a point” when the voluntary approach would no longer be sufficient. But Johnson wrote in the Sun newspaper that he was determined to protect consumer choice saying “the Greenshirts of the Boiler Police are not going to kick in your door with their sandal-clad feet and seize, at carrot-point, your trusty old combi”. Triple the rate of woodland creation in England The strategy includes many commitments to improving nature and commits to at least 30,000 hectares a year of new woodland. Farmers will be incentivised to implement a range of low-carbon farming practices, including guidance on the tax treatment of trees and woodlands, to provide greater clarity to landowners on how new and existing trees on their land affect tax liabilities. What’s missing? Ambitious plans for insulation There are 19m homes below EPC band C that need upgrading, in order to be energy efficient but there is little help for more than a tiny fraction of those homes. Gaps in commitments on fossil fuel The government has committed to phasing out coal power completely by 2024 to cut carbon emissions, but it is still used when it is better value than gas and was used only recently during the pricing chaos. There is no commitment to end new licences for oil and gas exploration, and to phase out production. Alternatives to car and air travel The government still invests £27bn in new roads and airport expansions have been given the go-ahead. The transport aspect of the strategy is very car-focused, though there is a commitment to increase the share of journeys taken by public transport, investing in cycling and walking and electrifying more railway lines. Meat and dairy farming A controversial topic that the government has shied away from completely is whether to make any recommendations around meat and dairy consumption. Last year, UK’s health experts called for a climate tax to be imposed on food with a heavy environmental impact by 2025. Future of fuel duty New forms of taxation are only hinted at in the strategy but the Treasury warns of a significant loss of revenue to the public purse as income from fuel duty drops when people switch to electric. Road pricing is seen as a fairer possible system to raise revenue than fuel duty and motoring taxes and the Treasury’s accompanying document says it will “consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue throughout the transition in order to deliver net zero sustainably”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2021/jun/17/california-texas-energy-temperatures-heat","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-17T15:28:54Z","webTitle":"Californians and Texans urged to conserve energy as temperatures soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/17/california-texas-energy-temperatures-heat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/jun/17/california-texas-energy-temperatures-heat","fields":{"headline":"Californians and Texans urged to conserve energy as temperatures soar","bodyText":"California and Texas urged residents to conserve energy to reduce stress on the grid and avoid outages as homes and businesses crank up air conditioners to escape a scorching heatwave blanketing the US south-west. High temperatures were expected to top 110F (43C) through the weekend in parts of several states including California, Arizona and Nevada. “The public’s help is essential when extreme weather or other factors beyond our control put undue stress on the electric grid,” said Elliot Mainzer, chief executive of the California ISO, which operates the grid in most of California. Summer-like heat arrived with spring still on the calendar as a dome of high pressure covered the west. Oppressive daytime highs have been followed by extremely warm nights. Palm Springs hit a record 120F on Tuesday, four degrees above the old 15 June record set in 1961. A coastal eddy swirling low clouds over southern California brought enough cooling Wednesday for forecasters to reduce some excessive-heat warnings to advisories around the Los Angeles region. But warnings were going into effect in the Central Valley, where some locations could see highs up to 113F. Over the past year, Texas and California have imposed rotating or controlled outages to prevent more widespread collapses of their power systems – California during a heatwave in August 2020 and Texas during a brutal freeze in February 2021. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), the state’s grid operator, expects Thursday’s demand to break the June record set on Monday. In February, Ercot imposed rotating outages as extreme cold froze natural gas pipes and wind turbines, leaving millions of customers without power – some for days. Ercot has been under fire for the design of its system, which is not connected to other US grids to avoid federal oversight, and because they do not operate a “capacity” market that keeps power generation on standby during extreme weather events. The California ISO said its flex alert, or call for conservation, “is critical because when temperatures hit triple digits across a wide geographic area, no state has enough energy to meet all the heightened demand”. It asks Californians to set thermostats to 78F or higher, turn off unnecessary lights and avoid use of major appliances from 5pm to 10pm on Thursday. The ISO said evening is the most difficult time of day because demand remains high but solar energy diminishes. So far this year, solar has provided 22% of the grid’s power. Mainzer, the California CEO, said the grid was stable and there was no expectation of rotating power outages, but that could change as temperatures spike in the coming days. “The current forecast for shortages are relatively modest in magnitude and we think there’s a good chance that we’ll be able to resolve them across the course of the day tomorrow,” he told reporters on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/26/amory-lovins-energy-efficiency-interview-cheapest-safest-cleanest-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-26T08:00:52Z","webTitle":"Energy efficiency guru Amory Lovins: ‘It’s the largest, cheapest, safest, cleanest way to address the crisis’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/26/amory-lovins-energy-efficiency-interview-cheapest-safest-cleanest-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/26/amory-lovins-energy-efficiency-interview-cheapest-safest-cleanest-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Energy efficiency guru Amory Lovins: ‘It’s the largest, cheapest, safest, cleanest way to address the crisis’","bodyText":"Temperatures dropped far below freezing this week in Snowmass, Colorado. But Amory Lovins, who lives high up in the mountains at 7,200ft above sea level, did not even turn on the heating. That’s because he has no heating to turn on. His home, a great adobe and glass mountainside eyrie that he designed in the 1980s, collects solar energy and is so well insulated that he grows and harvests bananas and many other tropical fruits there without burning gas, oil or wood. Nicknamed the “Einstein of energy efficiency”, Lovins, an adjunct professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, has been one of the world’s leading advocates and innovators of energy conservation for 50 years. He wrote his first paper on climate change while at Oxford in 1968, and in 1976 he offered Jimmy Carter’s government a blueprint for how to triple energy efficiency and get off oil and coal within 40 years. In the years since there is barely a major industry or government that he and his Rocky Mountain Institute have not advised. But for much of that time efficiency was seen as a bit of an ugly sister, rather dull compared with a massive transition to renewables and other new technologies. Now, he hopes, its time may have come. Lovins is arguing for the mass insulation of buildings alongside a vast acceleration of renewables. “We should crank [them] up with wartime urgency. There should be far more emphasis on efficiency,” he says. He sees Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine as an outrage, but possibly also a step towards solving the climate crisis and a way to save trillions of dollars. “He has managed to bring about all the outcomes that he most feared, but he may inadvertently have put the energy transition and climate solutions into a higher gear. Whether or not we end up in a recession because of the disruption, [Putin’s war] may prove to be a great thing for climate economics.” As it happens, Lovins has family connections to Ukraine: all four of his grandparents were early 20th-century immigrants from small villages between Kyiv and Odesa. He has one relative left there; the rest, as far as he knows, were murdered in the 1941 massacre of Tarashcha, when a Jewish population of nearly 14,000 was slaughtered by the Nazis, leaving just 11 people who happened to be off in the woods gathering mushrooms that day. “Solar and wind are now the cheapest bulk power sources in 91% of the world, and the UN’s International Energy Agency (IEA) expects renewables to generate 90% of all new power in the coming years. The energy revolution has happened. Sorry if you missed it,” he says. But just as with the 1970s oil shocks, the problem today is not where to find energy but how to use it better, he says. The answer is what he calls “integrative, or whole-system, design,” a way to employ orthodox engineering to achieve radically more energy-efficient results by changing the design logic. Take his house, he says. By designing it to collect energy and to need no heating, it saves 99% of the space- and water-heating energy, and 90% of the electricity. “And it’s cheaper to build and saves construction costs,” he adds. “It turns out that if you make [a] car out of carbon fibre, you also save two-thirds of the investment in water and half the energy space and time needed to put the car together. And it needs a lot fewer batteries because it’s holding less weight because the carbon fibre is light. You pay for the carbon fibre by needing fewer batteries and smaller propulsion system all round. “So if you do this across the whole economy, really designing whole systems in factories, equipment, buildings, vehicles, you’ll end up with severalfold larger energy savings than practically anyone now thinks is available. And the cost goes down.” So far, this integrative design approach has been mostly adopted by the private sector. Walmart, the world’s largest truck operator, improved its energy efficiency by nearly 40% by rethinking its operation. Other retail and auto firms such as Tesla and BMW have also seen enormous energy savings. Lovins’ most spectacular early success may have been his 1991 Hypercar concept, an all-electric, carbon-fibre-body vehicle that could do 300 miles to the gallon. It was dismissed at the time but all carmakers are now moving that way. The prize for governments wanting to be truly energy efficient is huge. Lovins and RMI have calculated that at least two-thirds – and probably as much as three-quarters – of all fossil fuel-generated energy could be profitably saved in most industrialised countries, and even more in developing countries because they tend to be less efficient to begin with and can more easily build things right than fix them later. Germany, Sweden, Denmark, he says, are leading the way for buildings, and Japan for industry. Lovins refers to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (Aceee), which says intelligent efficiency, smart buildings and smart manufacturing are all coming through. “For speed of improvement, though not absolute level since they started so low, China is the undisputed champion,” says Lovins. Lovins fears that design has been chopped into little bits and we are losing the bigger energy picture that the Victorians had. In a recent podcast with the UK energy adviser Micheal Liebreich, he explains how savings of 80% and more can be made in the least expected areas. As an example he shows that far less energy is needed to pump heat or cold through fat, straight pipes than skinny, long and crooked ones, because there is less friction. “In our house we save 97% of the pumping energy by properly laying out some pipes. Well, if everyone in the world did that to their pipes and ducts, you would save about a fifth of the world’s electricity, or half the coal-fired electricity. And you get your money back instantly in new-build or in under a year typically in retrofits in buildings and industry.” And yet, he says, this sort of energy efficiency is not taught, and it’s certainly not in any government study or climate model. Why not? “Because it’s not a technology. It’s a bloody design,” he says. The most energy-inefficient design of all, he says, may be nuclear power, which is heavily subsidised, costly and pushed by a politically powerful lobby. Using it to address shortages of electricity or to counter climate change, he argues, is like offering starving people rice and caviar when it’s far cheaper and easier to give just rice. “When you have a climate and energy emergency, like now, you need to invest judiciously, not indiscriminately, to buy the most efficient solution. Far better to deploy fast, inexpensive and sure technologies like wind or solar than one that is slow to build, speculative and very costly. Anything else makes climate change worse than it needs to be.” He demolishes the technology with statistics. “In 2020 the world added 0.4 gigawatts more nuclear capacity than it retired, whilst the world added 278 gigawatts of renewables – that’s a 782-fold greater capacity. Renewables swelled supply and displaced carbon as much every 38 hours as nuclear did all year. Where nuclear is cheap, renewables are cheaper still and efficiency is cheaper than that. There is no new type or size or fuel cycle of reactor that will change this. Do the maths. It is game over.” The future must be in the mass retrofitting of buildings with insulation and heat pumps and what he calls “outsolation”. “You can design out the pipes by putting a sort of tea cosy around houses, like the Dutch Energiesprong exterior retrofit. They can superinsulate your house to net zero standard in a single day whilst you’re at work, and meanwhile they’ve dropped in a very efficient heat pump core for mechanicals, and put on a super-insulated solar roof. And when you get back, you pay them rather than your energy companies.” Far better and more cost-effective in a historic emergency like this is for governments to invest in efficiency and to remove the many perverse subsidies and obstacles to people and businesses buying energy efficiency. It needs creative thinking, too. Why pay architects and engineers for what they spend, not what they save? Why reward energy companies for selling more energy, not cutting bills? Why not use the tax system to speed the uptake of renewables? Lovins, now the chair of RMI, teaches at Stanford while his colleagues help redesign the cement and forestry industries, as well as farming, retail and aviation sectors. He is hopeful that shorthaul and even medium-haul planes will soon be electrified and made energy-efficient by using new ultralight frames, structures, surfaces and fuel. Only half jokingly he urges a mass movement to knit millions of cheery yellow and blue woolly hats. That, and people turning down their thermostats by two or three degrees would save billions of cubic metres of gas. “Putin’s war is being financed by those who buy Russian fossil fuels. In the first two weeks the west has paid €8bn to Russia. We have a new energy crisis, and efficiency is the largest, cheapest, safest, cleanest and fastest way to address it,” he says. At 7,200ft up in Snowmass, Lovins is eating crop No 79 of his bananas, and crop No 80 is shaping up. “Lots of other tropical fruits too,” he adds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-17T12:00:28Z","webTitle":"‘We’re trying to turn the magnet towards optimism’: Cate Blanchett on her new climate crisis podcast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/apr/17/were-trying-to-turn-the-magnet-towards-optimism-cate-blanchett-on-her-new-climate-crisis-podcast","fields":{"headline":"‘We’re trying to turn the magnet towards optimism’: Cate Blanchett on her new climate crisis podcast","bodyText":"Cate Blanchett is Australian. I mention this fact because I’d forgotten it, somehow, so her manner of speaking – upbeat, front-footed, Aussie-accented – comes as a surprise. And I’ve spent quite some time hearing her talk over the past couple of days, as she has a new podcast, Climate of Change, which she hosts with her friend Danny Kennedy, another Australian. Kennedy is the CEO of an environmental non-profit, New Energy Nexus, and runs the California Clean Energy Fund. Their podcast, as you may have guessed from the title, is about the climate emergency. But before you come over all world-weary and what’s-the-point, before you get tetchy about preachy celebrities telling us stuff we already know, you might as well stop. Blanchett is already there. “You can recycle up the wazoo, Miranda,” she says (told you she’s Australian), “but it can just make you feel more cross and isolated and panicky… I get that. What we’re trying to do with the podcast is to turn the magnet towards optimism in these incredibly pessimistic times.” We’re talking via video link, but Blanchett has her camera turned off. Kennedy, who’s in his office in Oakland, California, hasn’t and he wanders around, showing us the view from the window (just some more offices, really). Blanchett’s location is a secret, due to heavy-handed PRs and her natural privacy, though I’d guess she’s in the UK (she lives in Sussex). Their location doesn’t really matter, of course, as they’re talking about a worldwide problem. The climate crisis is very real – we need to halve the world’s carbon emissions by 2030 – and becoming even more so for those living in Europe, with our reliance on Russian gas. If you think about it all too hard, you can panic. And Blanchett does, she says. In the first episode, she chats into the mic as she drives her electric car towards London and discusses how overwhelmed she can feel by the “tide of bad news”. She describes herself as a “mother of four” (the oldest is 20, the youngest seven) and an “optimistic pessimist”, and confesses to range anxiety as she forgot to plug in her car to charge last night. Her role in the show is to represent the listener, really, which is weird as she’s globally famous. But Blanchett’s everyday attitude is similar to many: she wonders aloud if making an effort, when it comes to the environment, is worth it. Why bother recycling, up the wazoo or no, if the tipping point to the end of the world is so close and the people in power are still locked into fossil fuels? She and Kennedy made Climate of Change earlier this year, mostly in a studio in east London. They have some strong guests: Adam McKay, the director of Don’t Look Up, makes an appearance, as does Prince William, to talk about his Earthshot prize. (He explains it very well, actually; it sounds much more interesting than I’d realised.) Still, at the start of the series, in common with many climate emergency podcasts, the discussion can feel rather broad, with smudgy chat about tech and innovation and the “disruptive decade”. At one point, someone says: “We are the stories we tell ourselves”, which might be true but doesn’t help that much with the gas bill. By episode two, however, the show is focusing on real-life solutions and these are undoubtedly encouraging. We meet a Filipino woman who’s designed a clean energy lamp that local fisherpeople can use; the Londoner who’s brought gardening to train stations; the designer of living sea walls that encourage plants and fish to thrive. One California company, OhmConnect, has such a good idea about reducing at-home use of electricity that I try to sign up. But it’s not yet available in the UK. What they’re trying to do with the podcast, says Kennedy, is appeal to people like me. To show us tired recyclers that the answers to environmental catastrophe are already out there. “I think the choir has heard the doom and gloom song for a long time,” he says, “and sung it from the song sheet, like a good choir would. What they haven’t been taught is the song about solutions and the fact we’ve got them.” “A lot of people are feeling fatigued,” says Blanchett. “I think we need a sense of, ‘No, don’t worry, these changes are happening.’ Because they are.” Blanchett and Kennedy met in Sydney in the early 1990s. They were part of the same social circle – Kennedy wrote a play with Andrew Upton, now Blanchett’s husband. Later, in 2008, Blanchett and Upton were appointed co-artistic directors of Sydney Theatre Company and decided to try to make the building, an old timber-and-glass warehouse, as ecologically sound as possible. They enlisted Kennedy to help. He brought in consultants – “one guy called Gavin Gilchrist: Cate, if you recall, the fellow who did the toilet flushes” – and helped redo the insulation to make the building “tighter and better, even though it was a pretty old, leaky, wooden construction”. The biggest proposal was the installation of solar energy panels, which proved difficult to get past heritage rules and the general cynicism of Sydney’s county council. “We were met by a lot of internal scepticism and external opposition,” remembers Blanchett. “You know: ‘What has this to do with a cultural institution, what does it have to do with making theatre, why are we bothering?’ So we thought: ‘OK, we’ll be at the theatre company for 10 years and we have a whole suite of ambitions. And the solar panels will probably be the last one we achieve, if we do.’ And it was the first one we achieved.” It took two years. There are now 1,906 solar panels powering lights, ventilation and air con across the building. Kennedy thinks that Blanchett and Upton’s theatre project was “a catalystic moment” that kickstarted a sense in Australia that solar power was viable and cost-effective; the country is now, he says, the biggest solar market in the developed world. Blanchett thinks of it as a “symbolic gesture” that, when added to an industry shift, “all adds up”. So she and Kennedy have known each other for ages (Blanchett recently found some old photos of his daughters when they were little) and then, last summer, Kennedy came to stay with Blanchett and her family in Cornwall. They took him to the Eden Project, which he loved, and the podcast project was started there. They visited “these old mines that are engaged in modern, clean-energy transition minerals and materials production – I’m a geek, I love that,” he says. For Blanchett, the show was “a much more primal urge. We sort of had to. I had so many questions.” I ask her about using celebrity to get attention on important issues. “Look,” she says, “if you have your two minutes in the sun, you can highlight solar technology or you can highlight an underwear line. But I’m genuine when I say that there were a lot of questions, embarrassingly ignorant questions, that I’ve been asking Danny over the decades. And I thought, ‘Well, I can’t be alone.’ When you ask a question, however ignorant or ill-informed it may be, you’re asking to open a door to a deeper understanding.” The public, with their simple questions (but why can’t we switch to wind or solar power?) often seem to be ahead of politicians when it comes to clean energy. People want environmentally friendly solutions, but the powers that be just say no. Kennedy agrees “100%” and describes a whole institutional mindset that needs to change. “For a long time, we’ve depended on these big, stodgy, 20th-century utilities where reliability was everything,” he says. “And now we’re jumping to these disruptive business models, where you’ve got distributed renewables and lots of different loads, and assets in the grid, and you need a flexible business model that’s a bit more marketplace… and the regulators can’t even contemplate it. They’re just like, ‘Oh, no. The way we do it, one big central station at a time, you’re never going to build enough wind and solar that way.’ And we’re like, ‘Yes, but that’s not how we want to build it. We want to build it on everything; every house, every roof, every garage becomes a storage system,’ and they’re like, ‘Oh, that’s all too complex.’” I can feel my gloom descending again. “Yes, but it’s just a challenge,” says Kennedy. “We live with institutions and cultural norms and bureaucracies that have trouble moving at the pace of change required, even though the technology and the consumer and the businesses are ready to deliver. That’s the tension. We could solve this.” Blanchett is keen to encourage, too. “The solution to the overwhelm is engagement,” she says. “There’s not going to be one magic bullet; it’s going to have to be governmental change, policy shifts, as well as consumer shifts and massive industry shifts. The way we do business with one another, the way we travel, it’s all of these things. At the heart of it is engagement. In the last two years, there’s been a real emotional and psychological reckoning that we’ve all been through, on top of the environmental crisis. But out of that comes a chance for renewal and we’d be crazy not to take it.” Perhaps Blanchett and Kennedy’s can-do attitude will rub off on listeners. Their articulacy and dynamism are certainly starting to make me feel a little better. Blanchett reminds me that, for every horrible environment-attacking corporate move, there has been a pro-conservation pushback. And, after all, says Kennedy, these strange, turbulent times might shake down into a more positive future. “What if we take this opportunity of this very volatile decade and we come out the other end of it better off?” he says. “Cheap, clean energy in the hands of people, not in the hands of despot lunatics that fund wars with this stuff? What about it? That’d be nice, right?” Right!

Kansas has about as much solar potential as Florida but lags far behind the state, powering only about 12,000 homes – or less than 2% of what is covered in Florida, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. That could be related to an ongoing debate in the states that is pitting utilities companies against solar energy. The Kansas utility Evergy has vastly expanded wind power in the state, but it is advocating for policies that would make customers less likely to install rooftop solar panels. That’s because if customers generate their own power, they won’t need to buy as much from Evergy. The fight has played out in state after state, from Arizona to California to Massachusetts – as power companies are threatened by the transition. In 2018, Evergy got permission from state regulators to collect fees from rooftop solar users, but Kansas’s highest court recently ruled that illegal. So, Evergy went back to regulators and asked them to approve different charges – a grid access charge and a minimum monthly bill. The regulators, at the Kansas Corporation Commission, rejected both proposals. They have told the company to work with solar advocates on a more holistic compromise. Andrew French, the chair of the commission, said in February that his state isn’t the only one in a standoff surrounding solar, particularly about how to rework a policy called net metering – where customers are compensated for power they send back to the grid. “This is not an issue unique to Kansas,” French said. “Others have implemented net metering 2.0 and beyond. I hope we will look at new models to try to figure out the appropriate way to value these resources.” Rick Gillam, a program director with the national solar advocacy group Vote Solar, said that Evergy is like most utilities in opposing customers reducing their usage of utility-supplied electricity. “Its general animosity has created uncertainty for solar developers and customers alike,” he said. Utilities have for years battled against net metering. Now, they are also turning to other billing strategies to try to recoup the money they fear they will lose when their customers aren’t as reliant on them. States around the country are reconsidering how they compensate customers who have their own rooftop solar. A lawyer for the trade group for investor-owned utilities, Emily Fisher of the Edison Electric Institute, said at a regulatory conference earlier this year that utilities in 2020 installed 12 gigawatts of solar power and in 2021 are on track for even more. But the pandemic left many customers unable to pay their bills, shifting costs on to others, she said. “We have to be really mindful of costs as we continue to drive toward clean,” Fisher said. ** Power companies have worried about a future like they see in California, which is far ahead of other states on rooftop solar and is considering overhauling electricity rules to try to boost adoption further. Environmental advocates say that amid the green energy revolution that the Biden administration is touting and climate scientists are calling for, utilities are standing in the way. “It’s the wave of the future. Customer tastes are becoming green, they are becoming organic in what they eat and what they wear,” said Ahmad Faruqui, an industry expert with the consulting firm The Brattle Group. “Why should electricity be any different?” The debate in Kansas specifically is not about whether climate change is happening and renewable power is necessary – but about how to shift the landscape to accommodate green energy despite pushback from powerful corporations. Climate change deniers are increasingly out of place in the state, which has seen a significant economic boost from wind power. Kansas’s governor, Laura Kelly, is a Democrat, although the state legislature is controlled by Republicans. Kelly supports renewable power, especially wind. One relatively new state senator, Mike Thompson, has attempted to propose anti-wind power legislation that one Kansas non-profit group has deemed among the “most restrictive”, in the US. Thompson – a former meteorologist who has received campaign donations from both the fossil-fuel invested Koch brothers and a Pac for Evergy – denies the science that shows humans are heating the planet at an unsustainable rate. In a sign of the times, his fellow Republicans shot down his proposal, and it is unlikely to move forward. Thompson and Evergy represent two sides of the opposition that stands to curb renewable power growth around the country. Thompson’s complaints are ideological. He falsely argues the public “has been subjected to a constant barrage of falsified, exaggerated and alarming claims”, about climate change. He and other conservatives around the country have sought to cast renewables as unreliable and expensive. Evergy, on the other hand, says it’s committed to reducing its climate pollution and has massively grown its wind power, displacing some coal-fired energy. Evergy’s power mix is 39% coal, 27% wind, 26% fossil gas, 7% nuclear and 1% solar and other renewable power. Evergy’s senior vice-president, Chuck Caisley, said environmental advocates are unfairly painting the company as anti-renewables and that he just wants rooftop solar generators to help pay for the grid they use. Utility companies argue that when customers opt out, they will be forced to charge the remaining pool of users more. “From an issue of fundamental fairness, we just don’t believe that because you put a solar array on your house, [your neighbor should] have to pay more,” he said. “It was never our intention to try and hurt the solar industry.” But utilities remain monopolies, meaning their customers typically don’t have other options. They are typically regulated by elected or appointed state officials, who determine how big of a profit they can make from running plants and power lines. Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Kansas-based Climate + Energy Project, said those profit motivations have stalled progress for years. “We could have worked together to find common ground and could have been so far ahead on solar,” Barnett said. “There were so many opportunities along the way that were missed because Kansas utilities were slow to recognize we are in a period of transition with our electric system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/apr/21/australia-news-live-renewables-superpower-clean-energy-summit-jim-chalmers-nsw-liberals-leadership-indigenous-voice-cost-of-living-interest-rates-drug-reform","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-21T09:01:24Z","webTitle":"Advice on voice a ‘cynical political tactic’ to confuse voters, Coalition claims – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/21/australia-news-live-renewables-superpower-clean-energy-summit-jim-chalmers-nsw-liberals-leadership-indigenous-voice-cost-of-living-interest-rates-drug-reform","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/apr/21/australia-news-live-renewables-superpower-clean-energy-summit-jim-chalmers-nsw-liberals-leadership-indigenous-voice-cost-of-living-interest-rates-drug-reform","fields":{"headline":"Advice on voice a ‘cynical political tactic’ to confuse voters, Coalition claims – as it happened","bodyText":"And with that, we are going to put this blog to bed. Thank you for spending part of your Friday with us. Before we go, let’s recap the big headlines: The federal government has released the solicitor general’s opinion on the Indigenous voice. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, says this puts to bed the Coalition’s “absolute nonsense”. But the Coalition has demanded the release of all legal advice from solicitor general. Lachlan Murdoch has dropped his defamation proceedings against Crikey. Mark Speakman has been elected the new leader of the NSW Liberals following the party’s recent election loss. He has vowed to win back women and young voters. Optus is being sued by “vulnerable” victims of the data breach. NSW records 29 Covid deaths and 1,139 people in hospital. Victoria records 40 Covid deaths and 298 people in hospital. The prime minister’s office has confirmed he will attend an upcoming Nato leaders’ summit. Australia has the potential to be a renewable superpower, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says. We will be back tomorrow morning to bring you all the day’s news. Until then, stay safe and enjoy your Friday night. We need governments to be bold. We need them to back our solutions. To get out of the politics that you play with our lives. We cannot lose another generation of our children. No more ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. The families and traditional owners of Mparntwe (Alice Springs) have written this powerful piece on the politicisation of their people and home. Read it in full here: Eric the marine dinosaur was a pescetarian, scientists discover A sea lion-sized marine dinosaur dubbed Eric who swam in Australian waters hundreds of millions of years ago was a pescetarian who enjoyed fish snacks, scientists say. Eric, a plesiosaur named after a Monty Python song, was found to contain 17 previously undescribed fish vertebrae, confirming the Jurassic beasts were mainly pescetarian. Australian National University scientists believe their study is the first of its kind in Australia to use X-rays to see inside the gut contents of a fossilised dinosaur. “Previous studies examined the exterior surface of Eric’s opalised skeleton to find clues,” the lead researcher, Joshua White, said. “But this approach can be difficult and limiting as fossilised stomach contents are rare to find and there can be more hidden beneath the surface that would be near impossible for palaeontologists to see without destroying the fossil.” The findings improve our understanding of how extinct organisms evolved and help predict how yet-to-be extinct marine life will adapt to climate change.

Full story here: We reported earlier about Macquarie Dictionary publicising its “words to watch” for April – now Matilda Boseley has this great video for you: Australia set to ease citizenship pathway for New Zealanders Labor and Labour governments on either side of the ditch are sending Trans-Tasman relations to new highs, with Australia poised to improve citizenship pathways for New Zealanders, AAP reports. The NZ prime minister, Chris Hipkins, says he’s hopeful of a “reasonably significant” announcement on the weekend when he travels to Brisbane to meet Anthony Albanese. Kiwis living in Australia are hopeful of getting a fairer deal that more closely resembles how Australians are treated in NZ. Hipkins says he hopes those Kiwis who want to call Australia home could also call themselves Australian citizens. They’ve made their lives in Australia and they are in this kind of state of suspended temporariness. They’re permanently temporary in Australia. That’s not something that Australians find when they come to New Zealand. This has been a challenging couple of decades where the free movement has been limited on one side, so I’m looking forward to us being able to make some progress. Home affairs officers lack understanding of LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, study finds Queer refugees fleeing persecution in their homelands are facing a tough task to prove their sexuality to Australian authorities, AAP reports. A study published in the peer-reviewed social science journal Sexualities found that Department of Home Affairs officers assessing refugee status claims did not understand the complexities of some LGBTQ+ asylum seekers. The Victoria University researcher Brandy Cochrane and independent scholar Lotte Wolff found that Australia’s refugee assessment system “perpetuates the forced categorisation (of) queer applicants into LGBTIQ+ labels”. Their research was based on interviews with several Australian legal representatives who were not named because they did not want to jeopardise the applications of their refugee clients. One lawyer said immigration department officers had ingrained stereotypes of how gay refugees were supposed to behave. “Definitely in terms of gay men, if you are someone that wants to sit at home and just meet people over dinner parties and you are not flamboyant and going out dating or on Grindr, a lot of department officers find that difficult to understand,” the lawyer said. Respondents said an expectation of these refugees “coming out” to prove they were legitimately gay did not take into account the sometimes dangerous countries they come from, where homosexuality is criminalised. AAP sought comment from the home affairs department regarding the study’s findings but did not receive a response. Trade minister Don Farrell to visit China Chinese commerce ministry has confirmed trade minister Don Farrell will visit soon. A spokesperson confirmed to Global Times that a delegation of 15 senior Australian company executives and local government officials will travel to China next week on 23 April. It will be the first industry delegation to visit the country in three years and HSBC Australia, Telstra, ANZ Banking Group and Rio Tinto are reportedly among the companies sending representatives on the six-day visit.

Traditional owners lose McArthur River mine challenge Traditional owners from the Northern Territory have lost their challenge against a decision to reduce the security bond of the McArthur River mine, AAP reports. Gudanji woman Josephine Davey Green, her husband Garawa elder Jack Green and the Environment Centre had asked the NT supreme court for judicial review of three decisions made by the territory’s mining minister regarding the lead and zinc mine. The Environmental Defender’s Office argued on their behalf that the minister erred when deciding to slash the environmental security bond of the mine by almost $120m. It also challenged the minister’s decision to approve an expansion of the Glencore-owned mine, about 60km south-west of Borroloola, without a long-term closure plan. Justice Judith Kelly disagreed on Friday. She said in her judgment: The plaintiffs have failed to establish that the decisions of the Minister which have been challenged in this proceeding have not been made in accordance with the mandatory requirements in the Act or that the decisions are unreasonable. Students at elite Sydney private school investigated over killing of goanna Senior students at an elite Sydney private school have allegedly killed a goanna while on a cadet camp. The King’s School released a statement confirming “a goanna was killed by students” on the camp at the end of the last school term. A spokesperson for the boys-only school said: The school does not condone the behaviour, which is inconsistent with the values and expectations of behaviour at King’s. Staff reported the matter to police who are investigating the incident which occurred on the afternoon of Wednesday 29 March. The police said in a statement that they were made aware of the incident on 5 April. Victoria coy on new age of criminal responsibility Raising the age of criminal responsibility in Victoria to 12 rather than 14 would make no sense and ignores best practice, human rights, children and Indigenous advocates say, AAP reports. Currently, children as young as 10 can be arrested, held on remand and jailed across the nation for committing crimes. Australian states and territories have agreed to develop a plan to raise the age to 12, but a draft report last year recommended raising the age to 14 without exception. The Victorian government could be poised to adopt the lower figure, with an announcement likely as early as next week. Attorneys general are scheduled to meet in Darwin on 28 April after premier Daniel Andrews earlier this year flagged Victoria would soon go it alone if a national consensus couldn’t be reached. The Northern Territory and ACT governments have committed to raising the age to 12 and 14, respectively, while Tasmania plans to raise the minimum age of detention to 14 but keep criminal responsibility at 10. The Victorian justice department has been working on proposals to raise the age to either 12 or 14. A spokesperson for Victorian attorney general Jaclyn Symes declined to confirm if proposals to raise the age would be put to state cabinet on Monday. She said: Victoria continues to work with other jurisdictions to consider the details involved in any increase to the age of criminal responsibility, but reserves the right to make further announcements in this space. Century-old temperature record eclipsed in Sydney Hunches sometimes result in a story, and this was one of them. For just over half a year, the mercury managed to creep to 20C or above every day in Sydney (taking the old Observatory Hill site, near the CBD). In fact, the stretch lasted 184 days, breaking a record of 180 such days that the Harbour City enjoyed (or endured if you like the cold) since just before the Great War. And if not for a 19.8C top on Thursday (I demand a recount), the record would likely have run for at least another week on current forecasts by the Bureau of Meteorology. Ben Domensino, a senior meteorologist at Weatherzone, was among those a bit surprised to see the record fall. He expected such a record to last until we had a drier spell. All that cloud and often rain tends to suppress daytime maximums, for instance. And recall that this run of 20C or warmer days began in mid-October, a month that delivered Sydney’s record wettest October (in the city’s wettest year, by a long shot). Anyway, temperatures have been trending higher over time because of, you guessed it, climate change. Juice up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, as we are doing, and don’t be surprised if warmth records continue to fall. There’s more on this record and what drove it, in this piece: SG advice shows voice is ‘safe and practical’ change: director of Yes 23 campaign Dean Parkin, director of the Yes 23 campaign, said the SG advice showed the voice was “not only legally safe but improves our system of government”. Or in other words, this is a safe and practical change that will be focused on the real issues affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities. The advice comprehensively confirms the tireless efforts of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over many years to get this point of putting the question of a voice to the Australian people in a referendum. Parkin and Davis have both been involved heavily in the government’s referendum working group process. Supporters of Indigenous voice back release of solicitor general advice Key supporters of the Indigenous voice have warmly backed the release of solicitor general legal advice backing the proposed constitutional amendment, saying it would address “scaremongering” about the referendum. Prof Megan Davis, co-chair of the Uluru Dialogue and a key architect of the voice, noted that “the weight of legal opinion clearly points to the proposed wording being legally sound”. The scaremongering about the scope of the voice and its legal impactions can now cease. Questions about allowing the voice to make representations to the executive government have been answered by some of the highest constitutional legal officers in the country and backed up by advice from the solicitor general. Davis noted that similar advice had been provided by a “who’s who of constitutional experts” including former high court justice Kenneth Hayne, Prof Anne Twomey, Bret Walker SC and Prof George Williams. The NSW Bar Association concur. Even constitutional conservatives like Greg Craven and Julian Leeser said they would vote yes at referendum under the current proposed wording. While we still need to wait for the committee report and the parliament to pass the proposed set of words, if they remain as currently drafted, Australians can be confident they will both deliver on the ask of the Uluru statement of the Heart and are constitutionally sound. The Coalition is still not satisfied with the release of the solicitor general advice on the Indigenous voice, with new shadow attorney general Michaelia Cash now issuing a new demand for Anthony Albanese to release all the legal advice they’ve received over the last few months. Cash claimed in a release: This is not the advice which the opposition has repeatedly called for the government to release but rather a cynical political tactic to confuse Australians. The failure to release all of the solicitor general’s advice in relation to this matter yet again highlights the lack of transparency of the Albanese government regarding their Canberra voice proposal. To remind readers, opposition leader Peter Dutton claimed the government had “rejected” the advice of the solicitor general on the voice. Today’s legal opinion from the solicitor general, released by attorney general Mark Dreyfus, finds that the nation’s top legal adviser believes the voice will not only NOT lead to clogging the courts and slowing down decision-making (as critics had alleged) but that it would actually “enhance” Australia’s system of government. The SG advice also rebuffs many key claims from the small number of conservative critics who alleged that the voice being able to speak to the executive government (including the public service) would slow down key decision-making. Cash, named this week as shadow AG after the departure of Julian Leeser (so he could campaign for the voice, remember) said that the opposition “will review this new advice” but also noted that the SG had provided other advice on 26 September last year and again 23 January this year. Cash said: If the prime minister and attorney general are going to be true to their word and be fair, open and transparent with the Australian people they should immediately release all of the solicitor general’s advice about the voice. Australians are entitled to see all of the solicitor general’s advice about the voice. Albanese earlier today had claimed that the opposition would continue raising new objections to the voice, even after the release of the SG advice. Channel 10 has more visuals of the deer and its escape from the Melbourne townhouse: Deer breaks into Melbourne home Alexander Hill switched on his phone after a work meeting to discover a slew of missed calls and a text message that read: There’s a stag in the house and blood is everywhere. The ABC is reporting the story of a deer, which had broken into the Melbourne family’s inner north-east townhouse and wreaked havoc. Hill told the national broadcaster his theory was this: [The deer] has seen his reflection in the window next to our door and then has taken that as another stag in his territory and gone at the window. He’s gone through the window, the curtain has fallen back behind him so he’s suddenly stuck in a white box. The family then waited two hours for a ranger with access to tranquillisers to arrive at the house. However, in the end tranquillisers were not necessary as the deer bolted into nearby parkland after the front door was opened. If you want to hear what the PM thinks are the key elements of the solicitor general’s opinion of the voice, Albanese has shared this video of the passages he read out at the press conference earlier: Financial hardship levels low but may not last Financial hardship may still be below pre-pandemic levels but the head of the Australian Banking Association warns borrowers could suddenly reach a breaking point. ABA chief executive officer Anna Bligh said rates of financial hardship, repossessions and defaults were still low compared to historical averages but banks had started recording a “slight uptick” in the 90-day default rate. She said there were also signs of stress across unsecured lending, such as credit cards and personal loans, with Australian borrowers typically prioritising their mortgage repayments over other types of debt. The last Australian Prudential Regulation Authority data on the 90-day default rate, which indicates three missed payments, fell slightly for both individuals and businesses in the December quarter. But based on what banks were telling her, she said they were expecting this rate to lift modestly in the first three months of 2023. Bligh likened the buildup of financial stress to a rubber band: Everybody can stretch, you know, they can stretch for the next payment they can stretch for the next interest rate rise. And then something happens to the car, you know, and the elastic band breaks. She said banks were “very aware” that they might start seeing this at a “slightly bigger scale”. – AAP Mark Speakman has vowed to modernise the New South Wales Liberal party and win back young, female and culturally diverse voters who care about the climate and integrity in politics as he takes on the role of opposition leader. Speakman addressed the media shortly after noon alongside the newly elected leader of the opposition in the upper house, Damien Tudehope, and his deputy and the party’s most senior woman, Natalie Ward. He explained the party would meet again in two weeks to attempt to change the rules to allow an upper house member run for the deputy party leader role and would support Ward in taking the spot if the vote was successful. He said: We certainly have to reach out to women, reach out to young people, reach out to culturally diverse people and if that’s modernising then we have to modernise. Our basic principles are sound … but we’ve got to make sure that they are adapted to a modern context where people who care about the environment, care about women’s empowerment, women’s safety, care about integrity in government – all those issues are compatible with Liberal philosophy. He said he would meet with Nationals leader, Paul Toole, in coming days to hammer out a new Coalition agreement before the shadow cabinet was announced. Speakman flagged a key focus for his leadership would be increasing the number of women in the party, including on the frontbench, but said he was less interested in quotas after the election that saw the proportion of women in the NSW Liberals increase. He would not comment on the party’s position on the voice, nor would he express his own opinion on the upcoming national vote. NSW Liberal leader Mark Speakman speaking in Sydney The new NSW Liberal leader says the party has suffered setbacks in the past 18 months but the Liberals “remain a party with timeless values … of opportunity, of aspiration and reward for initiative”. Our reporter Tamsin Rose is there: Investment in prevention of natural disasters ‘absolutely critical’ More investment in prevention and preparedness to deal with the expected increase in climate-driven natural disasters is critical, a Senate committee has been told. AAP reports: South Australian country fire service chief officer Brett Loughlin says a greater emphasis on prevention and preparing for major events would reduce the subsequent response requirements from emergency agencies. He says this would translate to fewer deployments by the Australian defence force and more sustainable state-led operations. In South Australia alone, we’ve had eight level 3 incidents, the most complex and damaging of fire events in the past 10 years. Four of those have been in the past three fire seasons. However, the paradigm remains firmly as one of response. We know the issues, we know what is coming so investment in prevention and preparedness is absolutely critical. Loughlin said the CFS strived to give equal weight to prevention, preparedness, response and recovery but the reality remained that its resources were limited and its work was “heavily weighted” towards response. Calls to broaden laws cracking down on TikTok New laws cracking down on social media apps due to security concerns need to extend beyond TikTok to stop a future “whack-a-mole” situation, a federal inquiry has heard. A parliamentary committee examining the risks to democracy from foreign interference through online platforms was told that while the Chinese-owned TikTok was an issue, other platforms in the future may also need to be addressed. Lindsay Gorman from the Alliance for Securing Democracy told the inquiry broader laws during the app’s infancy could have addressed foreign interference issues. I do not think a platform by platform approach is remotely effective, as we’re seeing with TikTok today. If we had this comprehensive framework that we recommended in place years ago, we would have addressed TikTok back in 2019 or 2020, and we will be ready for the next one because it’s absolutely a game of whack-a-mole if we’re taking it platform by platform. Gorman said similar concerns are emerging about a new app being launched by TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, and addressing issues with TikTok may not cover other platforms yet to emerge. The federal government has followed the lead of other western countries and banned TikTok from government devices, due to concerns regarding the links between ByteDance and the Chinese government, along with how data is being used. TikTok denies it is harvesting sensitive data or is a national security risk. – AAP Bargain basement private island in the Whitsundays sold for $1m According to the vendor, Poole Island is surrounded by coral and “the bluest water”, with two homes and a windmill powered swimming pool. It was meant to be sold in March, but the buyer went missing and it went back on the market. Now, according to The Australian, it has been snapped up by a South Australian real estate agent. Let’s hope the anonymous buyer enjoys it more than Natascha Mirosch did: Prime minister Anthony Albanese will attend the Nato leaders’ summit in July in Lithuania, his office has confirmed. It was reported last week that he might not attend, despite being one of only a few non-Nato countries to get a special invitation. But a statement from the PM’s spokesperson, shared just now, says Albanese will head to Europe on 11-12 July for the meeting. Statement below: Australia shares with Nato members a commitment to supporting democracy, peace, and security and upholding the rule of law. The prime minister’s attendance at this year’s Nato Leaders’ Summit will be an important opportunity to reinforce Australia’s support for these global norms, demonstrate solidarity in response to Russia’s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, and advocate for Australia’s economic, climate and trade agenda. Coalition wants to see ‘all of the advice’ released by solicitor general: Sussan Ley Ley is saying that the opinion released today appears to have been written in the last couple of days and that she would like to see “all of the advice, including the initial advice released”. Asked by a reporter if the opposition can say they are genuinely open to changing their mind based on this advice, Ley says: Legal advice is important and it forms part of the landscape around conversation on the voice. This advice was written it appears in the last couple of days. I would like to see all of the advice, including the initial advice released. I would like to understand all of the perspectives from all of the expert opinion. Because it varies, as it always does. But the most important thing Australians need to see is explanations from the Albanese government that answer the questions that we have been now patiently asking for months. How will this work in practice? How will local and regional voices have their issues heard? What difference can they expect in their lives and how soon? These are good questions, they are questions we all get asked, they are questions the prime minister still does not answer. Coalition will give ‘due diligence’ to solicitor general’s advice, Sussan Ley says The deputy leader of the opposition, Sussan Ley, is speaking in Caloundra in Queensland. Following Anthony Albanese releasing the solicitor general’s opinion, Ley says the PM knows the voice is important: But I know what is more important, is the start date of his promises to actually give Australians what they are crying out for. The budget isn’t two and a half weeks. We need to see a plan that tackles inflation. Only then can Australians have confidence this is a government that understands what is happening to them every day in their world. Asked if the opinion changes the Coalition’s position on the voice, Ley says: We will have a look at the advice. It is important we do that and give it due diligence. Rundown of NSW Liberal leadership team Most of the New South Wales Liberal leadership team has been settled, with Mark Speakman taking the top job as opposition leader and Damien Tudehope regaining his position as leader of the party in the upper house. The party’s most senior woman, Natalie Ward, was selected as deputy leader of the upper house after earlier indicating she had wanted to lead the party in the legislative council. Speaking after the vote, the new lower house whip Adam Crouch said Speakman had secured a “strong result” but would not confirm numbers. The Guardian understands Speakman received 22 votes against challenger Anthony Roberts’s 13. The party still lacks a deputy leader. Doubled rebate makes Queensland most generous state on EVs Queensland has doubled incentives for drivers to get behind the wheel of electric cars, making it the most generous state in Australia for switching to EVs, AAP reports. Drivers will now be eligible for a $6,000 subsidy under the Zero Emission Vehicle Rebate Scheme when they buy an electric vehicle worth up to $68,000. It’s double the $3,000 available when the scheme launched in July 2022. Energy minister Mick de Brenni said today: We’re seeing the prices of EVs fluctuate on the back of rising materials costs and inflation … so we’ve increased the eligible price cap to $68,000 and increased the rebate amount from $3,000 to $6,000 for eligible households. We want more zero-emission vehicles on Queensland roads. The minister said it could ease financial pressure on households by saving thousands in petrol costs. We also want to see fleets transition to further drive down emissions. That’s why Queensland businesses can apply for up to five rebates per financial year, providing an opportunity for local businesses to make the switch to electric fleets. What the solicitor general’s opinion on the voice means One point to clarify on the solicitor-general document that just dropped - it gives the solicitor-general’s opinion on the voice amendment (which is that the change is sound and won’t clog up the courts) but it isn’t exactly the same document that went to cabinet. That might sound like a minor distinction, and it is, but it could be a factor in how the Coalition opposition responds to this announcement. Some context - Peter Dutton has for some time been asking for the government to release the advice the SG provided to the referendum working group and the federal cabinet. Pointing to reporting in The Australian newspaper in recent months, Dutton has claimed on multiple occasions that PM Anthony Albanese had “rejected the advice otherwise of the Solicitor-General” on the question of whether the Voice should be able to make representations to the executive government. Dutton, of course, hasn’t seen the advice (the government doesn’t usually drop cabinet documents to the opposition leader). But in his press conference announcing the Liberals’ plan to oppose the voice, Dutton still claimed the PM had gone “against the advice of the Solicitor-General”. Now, the government has said for a while they won’t release the advice, because the advice is a cabinet document and the government doesn’t release cabinet documents. But they’ve now released this lengthy opinion from the SG. So what gives? Because today they’ve released a different document. This document today, dated as being written April 19 (two days ago, obviously well after the cabinet considered and approved the amendment) isn’t the advice that went to cabinet. It might be very similar, and it does show the actual opinion of the SG (which is that the voice is sound, it won’t clog up the courts and it won’t slow down decision making), but it’s technically not the same document. Albanese said just now: We don’t release nor do any government ever release advice to Cabinet. And that’s where we could see Peter Dutton go with his response - pointing out that because the government hasn’t done what he asked for, in releasing the advice (even though it’s likely to be functionally very similar and still the assessment of the SG), it may still not satisfy his concerns. We’ll bring you the opposition’s response when we get it. Outcome of inquiry allowing religious schools to hire based on faith pushed back by eight months The Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC) says it is “seriously concerned” about an eight-month delay on the outcome of an inquiry into legal exceptions allowing religious schools to discriminate against LGBTQ+ students and teachers. The Australian Law Reform Commission’s (ALRC) final report was due to be handed to attorney general Mark Dreyfus today, but was pushed back late yesterday to 31 December. PIAC director of policy and advocacy, Alastair Lawrie said any delay that left LGBTQ+ students and staff open to discrimination was troubling. The length of this extension is particularly concerning as it means vital protections will likely not be passed this year. No LGBTQ+ student should be forced to enter the classroom in Term 1 of 2024 fearful of discrimination. It’s time for Dreyfus, and the Albanese government, to step up and pass amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act before the end of the year. Religious schools – which receive significant public funding – should not have a free pass to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Tasmania, the ACT, Victoria and the NT already protect LGBTQ+ students and staff against discrimination. Queensland protects students and has committed to protecting teachers, as has WA. Albanese predicts Coalition won’t be satisfied with voice opinion Circling back to the PM’s media conference in Sydney. Albanese is predicting the opposition will still find more “nonsense arguments” to oppose the proposed changes. Albanese: Quite clearly Peter Dutton is not interested in bipartisanship … a whole lot of nonsense arguments have been put up, including the solicitor-general’s argument. There will be another one. When the Coalition have a look at the solicitor-general’s advice – my prediction, my bold prediction – is that they will say now there is another test that has to be made. They still won’t support it. They have made that clear. The National party didn’t even wait to see what the question was before they rejected it as well. That is why Australians, I believe, are tiring of the negativity of the opposition. Just because Peter Dutton has the title of opposition leader, shouldn’t mean he opposes everything. But he has taken his title literally. Mark Speakman is the new leader of the New South Wales Liberals. He was chosen as opposition leader by his parliamentary colleagues during a party room meeting this morning. The former attorney general and moderate Cronulla MP beat out former planning minister Anthony Roberts for the top job. The meeting continues. The prime minister Anthony Albanese has stepped up for a media conference after visiting at a childcare centre in south-west Sydney. He’s speaking about the release of the solicitor-general’s legal opinion on the Indigenous voice, which says the proposed change “will not fetter or impede the exercise of the existing powers of the Parliament”. Albanese says: This puts to bed the absolute nonsense of Peter Dutton and Barnaby Joyce and all the nonsense that they have carried on with, saying that somehow recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution will lead to Anzac Day being abolished. It is complete nonsense – they are just determined to play politics with this. Hospital denies reports about Barry Humphries St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney has denied reports that Barry Humphries is unresponsive. The hospital has confirmed Humphries is resting, stable and in “the best of hands at St Vincents.” Mark Speakman expected to become NSW Liberal leader New South Wales Liberals are voting on a new leader this morning. The party room meeting kicked off at 10am in parliament. The former attorney general Mark Speakman is expected to take the top spot after weeks of brokering deals across the party. Entering the building this morning, the Cronulla MP said he was on a “united team with Damien Tudehope and Natalie Ward” as he entered with the pair of upper house members. Regulator to examine how banks set interest rates The competition regulator will consider the approach banks use to determine interest rates on home loans and deposits amid growing concerns over their pricing practices. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said today it would look into any mismatch in pricing as part of its inquiry into retail deposits, with submissions due by 19 May. The ACCC said: While increases in the cash rate have generally been passed through to interest rates on variable rate home loans, the interest rate increases for retail deposit products have often been smaller or conditional. The Reserve Bank ordered 10 consecutive cash rate rises dating back to May in a bid to slow spending to combat inflation. The central bank then paused its hiking cycle in April, leaving the official rate at 3.6%. Concerns over pricing have re-emerged in recent months after the country’s biggest lenders posted bumper profits as financial pressures intensified on households. The regulator said Australians hold over $1.45tn in savings, transaction or term deposits. For many Australians, the interest earned on these accounts is an important source of income, and consumers are understandably keen to ensure they are receiving a good return on their savings. The inquiry, ordered by the federal government, will examine how interest rates of similar products vary between consumers depending on the amounts deposited, whether they are new or existing customers, or if they belong to a particular demographic. Lachlan Murdoch is dropping his defamation proceedings against Private Media, the publisher of Crikey. Murdoch filed a notice of discontinuance in the ongoing defamation proceedings. Murdoch lawyer John Churchill said: It is a matter of public record that Crikey admits that there is no truth to the imputations that were made about Mr Murdoch in the article. In their latest attempt to change their defence strategy, Crikey has tried to introduce thousands of pages of documents from a defamation case in another jurisdiction, which has now settled. In that case, in the US state of Delaware, the trial judge ruled the events of January 6, 2021, in the US Capitol, were not relevant. Further, the plaintiff Dominion Voting Systems made clear it would not argue that Fox News caused the events of January 6, and at no point did it ever argue that Mr Murdoch was personally responsible for the events of January 6. Yet this is what Crikey’s article alleged and what Crikey is attempting to argue in Australia. Mr Murdoch remains confident that the court would ultimately find in his favour, however he does not wish to further enable Crikey’s use of the court to litigate a case from another jurisdiction that has already been settled and facilitate a marketing campaign designed to attract subscribers and boost their profits. Solicitor-general says voice would not clog courts The solicitor-general’s opinion on the Indigenous voice is that it would not clog up the courts or slow down government decision-making through its power to advise the executive government (public servants and the cabinet). The proposed constitutional amendment “would not pose any threat to Australia’s system of representative and responsible government,” the opinion said. The opinion, dated 19 April, released today shows that Stephen Donoghue believes the voice “would not impose any obligations upon the Executive Government to follow representations of the Voice, or to consult with the Voice prior to developing any policy or making any decision.” The opinion states: The text of proposed s 129 imposes no such requirements. Further, no such requirements can be implied by reference to proposed s 129(ii), because that would be inconsistent with the deliberate textual choice to empower the Voice to make “representations” rather than to “consult”, and with the ordinary operation of responsible government. For those reasons, in my opinion proposed s 129 would not preclude the ordinary operations of government from continuing unless the Executive Government has first consulted with, or received representations from, the Voice. A small number of conservative critics have raised concerns about the voice’s proposed power to make representations to the executive government, arguing that it would be an impediment to decision-making or lead to excessive court cases – or both. The opinion states that litigation about executive decision-making is already commonplace. The suggestion that a consequence of empowering the Voice to make representations to the Executive Government will be to clog up the courts, or to cause government to grind to a halt, ignores the reality that litigation concerning the validity of decisions of the Executive Government is already very common, and that it does not have either of those consequences. Accordingly, even if proposed s 129(iii) did not empower the Parliament to legislate to specify the legal effect of representations of the Voice (which in my view it clearly does), proposed s 129 would not pose any threat to Australia’s system of representative and responsible government. The federal government has released the long-awaited solicitor-general’s opinion on the Indigenous voice, which says the proposed change “will not fetter or impede the exercise of the existing powers of the Parliament”. The opposition had long-called for the government to release the advice. Peter Dutton has claimed the solicitor-general advised against some of the wording in the proposed constitutional amendment. In the opinion, released by attorney-general Mark Dreyfus in a submission to the parliamentary inquiry on the referendum, the solicitor-general says he was asked to consider two questions, and provided “short answers” before going on to explain the answer in far more detail. The short answers are as follows: Question (1): Is proposed s 129 of the Constitution compatible with Australia’s system of representative and responsible government established under the Constitution? Answer (1): Yes. Question (2): Would the power to legislate “with respect to matters relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice” in proposed s 129(iii) of the Constitution empower the Parliament to specify whether, and if so, how, Executive Government decision-makers are legally required to consider relevant representations of the Voice? Answer (2): Yes. The solicitor-general states “the Voice’s function of making representations will not fetter or impede the exercise of the existing powers of the Parliament”. The solicitor-general says that the inclusion of “executive government” in the amendment “would not impose any obligations upon the Executive Government to follow representations of the Voice, or to consult with the Voice prior to developing any policy or making any decision. The text of proposed s 129 imposes no such requirements.” More to come shortly. There were 6,052 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 18 people are in intensive care. Cases are up by more than 200 on last week, which were 5,811, and deaths are also greater than the previous week’s 30. There were 12,393 new cases in the weekly reporting period, and 26 people are in intensive care. The case numbers represent a big upswing from last week’s 9,646 (almost 3,000 more) and brings the total to above 10,000 for the first time since January 13. Pair escape from light plane crash off Western Australian beach A woman and a teenage boy have swum to shore after the light plane they were in crashed into the sea off Leighton beach, just north of Fremantle, AAP reports. WA police say the plane crashed about 30 to 50 metres offshore just after 5pm (WST) on Thursday and is now mostly submerged in the water. The pilot, a 45-year-old woman, and a 15-year-old boy reported to be her son were checked over by paramedics after they reached the beach. Police said in a statement: They were both able to exit the plane and swim to shore. The pair were flying to Jandakot airport from Exmouth, where they had viewed Thursday’s solar eclipse, ABC TV reported. ‘Every budget decision is seen through a gendered lens,’ says Gallagher Less than three weeks out from the budget, the minister for finance and women, Katy Gallagher, says “every budget decision is seen through a gendered lens.” Gallagher yesterday led a consultation for the national strategy for gender equality, and says the government is “getting cracking because, frankly, women have waited long enough.” Australian Law Reform Commission’s anti-discrimination inquiry extended Protections for LGBTQ students and staff in religious schools will be further delayed following an extension of the Australian Law Reform Commission’s (ALRC) anti-discrimination inquiry. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has allowed the commission until the end of this year to hand down its recommendations into religious exemptions for educational institutions under federal anti-discrimination and employment laws. It’s a move Equality Australia says will delay “urgently needed protections” but the Australian Association of Christian Schools (AACS) has welcomed. The legal director of Equality Australia, Ghassan Kassisieh, said discrimination against LGBTQ+ people was happening in religious schools across the country because of gaps in Australian laws that made it lawful: While we have waited for the law to change to protect our community, more people have lost their jobs and more children have been forced to leave school or been denied leadership roles. These legal gaps could have been addressed very simply, and quickly. We have engaged constructively with the ALRC and hope it uses the extension to get the detail right. People should not lose their jobs because they refer to their same-sex partners at work or be denied opportunities for leadership because they come out as gay or transgender, or support LGBTQ+ people. Vanessa Cheng, the executive officer of AACS, said the extension came as a recognition that the recommendations put forward did not adequately address the government’s own terms of reference. And as all teachers know, when the homework task is not right, extensions must be given … The ALRC has a lot of work to do to get this right. We hope the extension of time allows it to deliver a much more balanced set of recommendations which will protect the personal rights of staff and students while also allowing the freedom of religious schools to build a ‘community of faith’. Victoria University $73.2m in the red Victoria University has become the latest tertiary institution to publish a net operating deficit in 2022 as fallout from the pandemic comes back to bite. At a town hall meeting on Thursday, vice-chancellor Prof Adam Shoemaker confirmed the university recorded a net operating deficit of $73.2m last year, pinned to lower than expected student numbers and reduced value of investments. In March, it was revealed universities logged a record $5.3bn surplus in 2021. But of Australia’s 38 public universities, 10 have now disclosed their 2022 results recording a combined deficit of more than $900 million. Shoemaker: As expected, last year was a very tough one for us, as it was for many universities across Australia. While we have no borrowings, and our cash position remains strong, our operating expenditure exceeds revenue. We will have to work collectively and responsibly to return to surplus. We will examine all parts of the institution to do this.” During its Town Hall, Victoria University also confirmed it would release a statement regarding its commitment to the Uluru Statement of the Heart. Former and current customers whose personal information including key identity documents was compromised during the Optus data breach have launched a lawsuit against the telco, AAP reports. The suit, filed by class action law firm Slater and Gordon and representing 100,000 people, accuses Optus of breaching privacy, telecommunication and consumer laws as well as the company’s internal policies. The Singapore-owned telco breached its duty of care to ensure customers did not suffer harm arising from the unauthorised access or disclosure of their personal information, did not take reasonable steps to protect customer information and failed to destroy or de-identify former customers’ personal information, the lawsuit alleges. Almost 10 million Optus customers had their personal information stolen during last year’s breach, including passport, driver’s licence and Medicare details. Slater and Gordon class actions practice group leader Ben Hardwick said: The type of information made accessible put affected customers at a higher risk of being scammed and having their identities stolen, and Optus should have had adequate measures in place to prevent that. Concerningly, the data breach has also potentially jeopardised the safety of a large number of particularly vulnerable groups of Optus customers, such as victims of domestic violence, stalking and other crimes, as well as those working in frontline occupations including the defence force and policing. Information from 10,200 customers was exposed publicly during ransom demands, but no customer had suffered any financial loss or fallen victim to a crime through misuse of the data, the chief executive of Optus, Kelly Bayer Rosmarin, said last month. The telco also offered customers free access to identity theft monitoring. Among the 100,000 people who registered for the class action is a domestic violence victim who spent money intended for counselling for her children on increasing security measures around the house, and a retired police officer concerned his home address may have been shared with criminals he’d put away. Victims of burglary, stalking and scam calls also signed up after being concerned about their future. The lead applicant, whose identity is being kept secret, said: Not knowing what still might happen as a result of having my information accessed and by whom haunts me. It feels like only a matter of time before I get scammed or defrauded, which is a constant worry that I didn’t have before I was let down by Optus. The breach is being investigated by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, Australia’s media watchdog and other agencies. The Albanese government in February also set up a national cyber security office within the Department of Home Affairs to co-ordinate the national response to major cyber attacks. Husic stands firm on stage-three tax cuts Independent MP Zoe Daniel has done a survey of what her electorate of Goldstein thinks of the stage three tax cuts. She says the majority of her fairly affluent electorate wants to see the cuts reconsidered. Asked it that’s persuasive, Husic says: We took a commitment to the election … we take very seriously if we say one thing at the election we’re going to make sure we honour it. Husic scoffs at gas companies threatening to cut investment if taxes are raised We know the treasurer Jim Chalmers is looking at options to reform the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) ahead of the budget. But this morning the sector is pushing back, forecasting that its companies will deliver a windfall $16bn in taxes, excises and royalties by the end of the financial year. Husic isn’t buying the argument: At various points in time the sector doesn’t like highlighting how much profit it is benefiting from, only at another point when they want to avoid tax exposure, this gets raised … They are doing very well, they can price in a much more moderated way … It is a bit rich for all of these firms to say, well, if you make any moves here, regulatory uncertainty will force us not to invest at a time where gas prices where they’re at. I’ll leave that to your good [RN breakfast] listeners to make their mind up as to whether or not that’s believable. New government tool to help households rate home energy efficiency The government will roll out a new tool for Australians to identify how energy efficient their homes are, and help compare with other homes in the market. Husic says the pilot program between CSIRO and CoreLogic Australia will provide the data needed to bring down emissions from Australian homes: We’ve got about nearly 12% of the country’s emissions are as a result of what’s happened in our homes. There are about 10 million residential buildings in the country. And we haven’t had data – particularly for the banking and finance sector – that they can see how energy efficient homes are. And we’ve got a we are doing a lot of work as a government to try and improve that efficiency. And I chair the building ministers meeting that sets future building codes for new homes, but to be able to use artificial intelligence from the CSIRO working with firms like CoreLogic to be able to crunch the numbers and inform ways in which to build much cheaper products potentially, is a really big deal. So being able to have that set up for the first time is a terrific initiative is something that I think will be important in trying to bring down emissions. Ed Husic says board appointments alone won’t guarantee RBA diversity The ministry for industry, Ed Husic, says he believes new appointments to the RBA board alone isn’t enough to bring diversity to the central bank – he says there need to be “deeper structures” put in place. Speaking to ABC Radio this morning Husic says: As a government, I can give you this assurance. We do like to take into account people’s views from different vantage points. I do think it is important that where decisions have an impact – not just in terms of investors or industry but the people that work in them or the broader community – I think it’s a healthier decision … Some people will fix on ‘well, someone should have a seat at the board’ for that to occur and I understand why they’ll make those arguments. I’m not necessarily convinced that that specifically guarantees that will occur, just having one person on the board. There need to be a lot deeper structures for people to have that sense that they’ve had a say and that they can have an ability to influence and inform decision making. Penny Wong calls on both sides of Sudan conflict to cease hostilities The minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, says Australia condemns the violence in Sudan and changed the travel advice warning Australians against visiting the country. Violence broke out in Sudan when two generals turned rivals after a faltering transition to civilian-led government. Wong has called on both parties to cease hostilities. If you want to read more about the situation in Sudan, this explainer tells you what’s behind the fighting, how the military rivalries developed, and what’s at stake in the region: Angus Taylor says government doesn’t need to raise taxes Two weeks out from the budget, Taylor says if the government “gets it house in order” it shouldn’t need to raise taxes. Following Taylor’s calls for the government to manage its finances in a way that takes pressure off Australian households, Rowland asks: Managing [the] budget and, by definition, bringing down the deficit involves two things pretty much: cutting spending and raising taxes, do you support both of those? Taylor: No, firstly it means having a strong economy. That is the single most important thing you can do. Then you need to make sure that your economy is growing faster than your spending. This is an objective that we had when we were in government. We achieved it between 2013 to 2019, in the lead-up to the pandemic. It is achievable and it should be a goal for this government. In doing that you repair the budget, take pressure off inflation, interest rates and in the process you avoid having to raise taxes. The government shouldn’t be raising taxes. It doesn’t need to if it gets its house in order. Chalmers ‘completely ignored’ RBA review’s recruitment process, Taylor says Yesterday Jim Chalmers also named two new appointments to the existing nine-member board: Iain Ross, a former Fair Work Commission president and former assistant secretary of the ACTU, and Elana Rubin, who has also worked with the ACTU. But Angus Taylor is this morning criticising the appointments for ignoring the recruitment process: We were disappointed that the first two appointments that have been made by the treasurer, he completely ignored the recruitment process, the merit-based rigorous process that is laid out in the review. We do think it is important that the government is going to say it supports the recommendations of the review, it walks the walk and doesn’t just talk the talk. Michael Rowland: Aren’t those appointments we speak of Ian Ross and Elana Rubin all aimed to bring greater diversity views to the Reserve Bank board. The board is dominated by RBA officials and the Treasury secretary and big business leaders? Taylor: We want intellectual diversity. The review laid that out plainly and I endorsed the need for that. There is a clear process, a rigorous merit-based process that is laid out in recommendation 14.2 of the report and the government hasn’t followed it with its first two appointments. We want the government to get serious about the recommendations that are laid out in this report. Chalmers ‘jumping ahead of himself’ on RBA review, Taylor says The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, believes the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is “jumping ahead of himself” accepting all 51 recommendations of the RBA review. Taylor, speaking to ABC News, is asked if he has endorsed all 51 recommendations like the treasurer: No, I think [Chalmers] is jumping ahead of himself. We are working closely with the government. I worked closely with the review panel and we very much welcome the report. We think there is some very good features of this. The sharp focus on the 2% to 3% inflation target. The clear focus on accountability and transparency of the Reserve Bank. We are very open focus on that monetary policy board and a merit-based recruitment process for board members for that board and the pre-existing board, all these things we think are a step in the right direction. We are working through the recommendations. We will do it in a spirit of bipartisanship. Good morning! Natasha May on deck with you. ‘Australia has the world’s best combinations of wind and solar energy resources’ We’ve also got former ACCC commissioner Rod Sims writing for us today and he agrees with the treasurer that Australia can become a green energy superpower. In fact he argues that green energy represents an even bigger opportunity for Australia than the resources boom of the past 20 years because it’s more sustainable: Australia has the world’s best combinations of wind and solar energy resources, and it has enormous sources of biomass for a zero emissions chemical industry. Think about that. The world is moving to a zero emissions economy – albeit at an uncertain speed – and we can have the lowest-cost zero emissions electricity available for large-scale economic development in the world. Second, we have among the largest resources of the minerals needed in the energy transition. Renewable energy is not easily exported so it makes sense for industry to relocate to the source. Put simply, more of Australia’s minerals should now be processed in Australia. Read his whole piece here: Treasurer Jim Chalmers really is the man of the moment. The budget is fast approaching but today is all about the economy of the future as he hosts his latest roundtable in Brisbane, this time on clean energy. This is a snippet of his comments before the event this morning: The transformation to cleaner, cheaper, more reliable energy is one of our big opportunities in what will be a defining decade for Australia. Around the table today we have some of the nation’s leading investors, major banks, global asset managers and superannuation funds all wanting to work with us to make the most of this moment. Australia has the potential to be a renewable energy superpower and aligning our efforts is critical to achieving this ambition. That’s why this gathering is so important – so that governments, investors and energy experts can work together to advance our plans in a coordinated way. We have what the world needs, when the world needs it and we will keep adapting to changes in the global landscape to maximise our comparative advantages. The government has a substantial agenda when it comes maximising our advantages from the energy transition, and we will build on this agenda in the budget. Nearly one month after former New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet resigned as Liberal leader another MP is set to grasp the nettle and become the state opposition leader. Former attorney general, barrister and moderate Mark Speakman is understood to have the numbers to take the role, and is expected to leave a party-room meeting today as leader of the NSW Liberals. Speakman’s main competition will come from former minister and right factionist Anthony Roberts, who signalled this month he intends to run, and Alister Henskens, another ex-minister believed to be in the hunt for the top job. The Liberal party room will also vote to replace deputy leader Matt Kean, who resigned in the wake of the Coalition’s election defeat to spend more time with his family. Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be bringing you a few of our top stories this morning before my colleague Natasha May takes the reins. Doctors, police and drug reform advocates have welcomed reforms passed last night that will see Queensland take a more progressive approach to policing the personal consumption of illegal drugs. The state hopes it will help deal with the “underlying causes of substance use”. It leaves New South Wales as the odd state out. Treasurer Jim Chalmers will host a roundtable of investors, banks and energy and climate leaders in Brisbane today to discuss “reducing barriers and encouraging stronger investment” in clean energy projects. Chalmers said: Australia has the potential to be a renewable energy superpower and aligning our efforts is critical to achieving this ambition. Also present will be energy minister Chris Bowen along with institutional investors and superannuation fund managers representing more than $2tn in capital. Still with politics, it’s a big day for the Liberals in New South Wales whose state MPs will be holding a party-room meeting in Sydney today to decide their new leader and deputy leader. It follows their chastening defeat in last month’s state election with moderate Mark Speakman the favourite to take the baton from departed leader Dominic Perrottet.

Flower Turbines, based in the US and the Netherlands, has installations across Rotterdam, Amsterdam, parts of Germany, Israel and Colombia. The company aims to democratise green energy for everyone and make small windfarms a leading player in the green energy industry. The turbines pose no danger to birds and other wildlife, particularly in urban settings, the company claims, and they create noise at a low frequency undetectable to humans. Opponents of windfarms often cite noise concerns along with aesthetic complaints. Dr Daniel Farb, the CEO of Flower Turbines, hopes to have solved this problem with an “eco-art” design. “Big turbines are very efficient, but for some people they’re an eyesore,” he said. “They definitely produce noise, flicker and some degree of environmental degradation. I was looking for a way to solve these problems, to make wind energy available for everybody. “I felt that there had to be a missing solution that would work for the combination of houses, large buildings, the environment – close to people. In other words, how could you make something that could be quiet but also efficient?” The company has also looked into expanding into e-mobility, creating wind- and solar-powered electric bicycle charging stations. Roy Osinga, the European director of Flower Turbines, said: “Our product – compared to big windmills – is silent, and good-looking, which makes it very successful for building in cities, because nobody wants to live next to a turbine which is up to 200 metres high making a lot of noise. “Solar power doesn’t perform that well at night, or during the winter. The turbines that we are delivering are a good match with solar energy, because wind and solar have natural opposite panel patterns when they produce energy. “We are not a competitor or an alternative for the big energy companies. We are a solution provider for companies and corporates that really want to pivot their business towards sustainability.” Quirky wind turbines have been at the forefront of wind power. Vortex Bladeless, a turbine that can harness energy from winds without the sweeping white blades synonymous with wind power, went viral on Reddit in March where the turbine was likened to a giant vibrating sex toy, or “skybrator”. Another company, Alpha 311, which began in a garden shed in Whitstable, Kent, has begun manufacturing a small vertical wind turbine that it claims can generate electricity without wind. Europe is working towards becoming climate-neutral by 2050, after member states and the UK parliament agreed on the necessary targets ahead of a virtual climate summit hosted by Joe Biden. In the UK, most of the offshore workforce, including in wind power, could be involved in delivering low-carbon energy by 2030."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jan/11/meet-mr-trash-wheel-and-the-other-ingenious-tools-that-eat-river-plastic","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-11T08:15:10Z","webTitle":"Meet Mr Trash Wheel – and the other new devices that eat river plastic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/meet-mr-trash-wheel-and-the-other-ingenious-tools-that-eat-river-plastic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jan/11/meet-mr-trash-wheel-and-the-other-ingenious-tools-that-eat-river-plastic","fields":{"headline":"Meet Mr Trash Wheel – and the other new devices that eat river plastic","bodyText":"The Great Bubble Barrier is just that – a wall of bubbles. It gurgles across the water in a diagonal screen, pushing plastic to one side while allowing fish and other wildlife to pass unharmed. The technology, created by a Dutch firm and already being used in Amsterdam, will be trialled in the Porto region of Portugalas part of the EU-supported Maelstrom (marine litter sustainable removal and management) project. It is the latest in a series of new technologies designed to find sustainable ways to remove and treat river debris before it reaches the sea. Plastic can be spread by natural disasters, such as a tsunami, which can push invasive species and debris halfway across the world. But rivers carry a much more regular supply of plastic to the oceans. Research in 2017 found that 10 river systems transport 90% of all the plastic that ends up in the world’s oceans (two in Africa – the Nile and Niger – with the other eight in Asia: the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Yangtze, Haihe, Pearl, Mekong and Amur). Molly Morse, a scientist at UC Santa Barbara’s Benioff Ocean Initiative and lead on its global Clean Currents Coalition, says: “In some cases, communities don’t have access to proper waste pickup services and must turn to what might seem to be the only alternative: dump the trash directly in the river to be carried away. “In other cases, plastic litter on land is moved by rain or wind into a river, where […] the plastic may make its way to the ocean.” An estimated 0.8m to 2.7m tonnes of plastic are carried by rivers to the ocean each year. That is the equivalent of 66,000 to 225,000 doubledecker buses. Without barriers, river currents carry plastic directly to the sea, where it becomes far trickier to tackle: plastic often floats for vast distances, can host invasive species and becomes part of the wider plastisphere, such as the concentration of seaborne waste in the Great Pacific garbage patch. That is why some scientists are calling for greater efforts to stop plastic going into rivers in the first place. A 2020 study found that a “significant reduction” of plastic in the ocean could be achieved only by stopping it reaching the sea, or through a combination of river barriers and other clean-up devices. Cue inventors, who have developed an array of river barriers and collection devices to catch and remove riverine plastic – from simple nets and booms to conveyor belts and robots. Mr Trash Wheel, known officially as the Inner Harbor Water Wheel, is a conveyor-belt system powered by currents and solar energy, launched in 2014 in the US city of Baltimore. Long booms with submerged skirts funnel waste into a central hub, where autonomous rakes scoop it on to a conveyor belt that deposits it on a barge, with more than 17 tonnes collected in a day. Once full, the barge takes the rubbish to be incinerated in a power plant, though it is hoped that eventually the collected waste can be sorted and recycled. There is now a whole family of Trash Wheels in Baltimore, the latest addition being Gwynnda, the Good Wheel of the West. Or there’s the Interceptor, a floating, solar-powered device developed by the non-profit organisation The Ocean Cleanup, billed as the “world’s first scalable solution” to rid the oceans of plastic. Similar but larger than the trash wheel, it has barriers that guide rubbish on to a conveyor belt, where a shuttle distributes it among five onboard waste bins. Another design, the Azure barrier, developed by the UK-based startup Ichthion to operate in any river, can remove up to 80 tonnes of plastic a day using durable, tide-sensitive booms that direct plastic to extraction points along the bank. The plastic is processed into flakes for recycling. Other more hi-tech inventions include the WasteShark, an electronically controlled “aquadrone” that preys on plastic – up to 350kg at a time. Using algorithms from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, the WasteShark moves around and back to its docking station autonomously, where up to five of the catamaran-shaped vessels can deposit the collected plastic and recharge. The design, developed by a Dutch startup, RanMarine, is due to be showcased at CES 2022 in Las Vegas this month. While the cost of implementing these technologies may be feasible for some cities and towns – and vastly preferable to the cost of plastic pollution, which it is estimated will reach $7.1tn (£5.25tn) by 2040 – there are many other factors to consider. These include, says Morse, “the physical river characteristics, amount of waste, seasonal changes, ecology, power sources, workforce availability, security, boat traffic [and] funding”. Philip Ehrhorn, co-founder of the Great Bubble Barrier, says: “One of the biggest challenges we face is the lack of regulation regarding plastic pollution in our waterways and thereof the lack of ownership and responsibility for the problem. “The urgency to solve our plastic pollution problem in rivers is down to forward-thinking water authorities and governments, since plastic is not yet officially considered a water pollutant,” he says. Most of the world’s top 20 plastic-polluting rivers are in developing countries. But Ehrhorn adds: “Europe still has a huge issue with plastic pollution, which shouldn’t be ignored nor underestimated.” EU laws were introduced in January last year to tackle the “wild west” of plastic waste being dumped in poorer countries; the UK is one of Europe’s worst offenders, exporting about 70% of its plastic. But the wildest west lies across the Atlantic: the US is the world’s biggest plastic polluter, accounting for more than all EU countries combined. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, says Morse. “Rivers vary immensely in respect to factors such as depth, width, flow and seasonality. What might work in a massive river like the Mississippi in the United States, which flows all year round, likely will not work for a smaller, more seasonal river like the Tijuana in Mexico.” In Ecuador, Ichthion’s Azure prototype had problems on the Portoviejo River. Data had suggested the river’s depth varied in the wet and dry seasons by two metres; in reality, it fluctuated by as much as four metres within a few days. Getting support from the local people and permission for new infrastructure can also be difficult. For the Clean Currents Coalition, which is working with eight teams around the world, simplicity works best. “The most successful solutions have been the simpler technologies – such as booms, barriers and traps – that are manufactured locally and require manual removal of the captured waste,” Morse says. This can also create extra jobs. One example of these is Wildcoast’s “brute boom” at the Los Laureles Canyon, a tributary of the Tijuana River. The double-walled float stretches across the river and allows the boom to move with the changing depth. A suspended steel mesh catches the plastic, which is taken for processing once the boom is full. Reports from San Diego in California suggest that it has succeeded in reducing plastic downstream. TerraCycle’s river traps, which are installed in some of Bangkok’s 1,600 polluted canals, catch up to 2.5 tonnes of waste a day, helping to recycle plastic instead of sending it to landfill. A German startup, Plastic Fischer, has installed TrashBooms in waterways in Indonesia, India and Vietnam. It advocates a local, low-tech and low-cost approach, using locally manufactured mesh-and-float barriers to catch rubbish. Many environmentalists argue that these innovations treat the symptoms, not the problem, and that the only real solution is to curb plastic production. But, with plastic manufacturing shipments estimated to have risen by 2.2% last year by the Plastic Industry Association, this is not likely any time soon. “If we’re going to keep producing, consuming and disposing of plastics at, or near, our current rate, our ability to manage it needs to catch up – and quickly,” says Morse."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/07/what-is-cop27-and-why-does-it-matter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T06:00:41Z","webTitle":"What is Cop27 and why does it matter?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/what-is-cop27-and-why-does-it-matter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/07/what-is-cop27-and-why-does-it-matter","fields":{"headline":"What is Cop27 and why does it matter?","bodyText":"What is Cop27? For almost three decades, world governments have met nearly every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC), every country is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change” and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. Cop stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC, and the annual meetings have swung between fractious and soporific, interspersed with moments of high drama and the occasional triumph (the Paris agreement in 2015) and disaster (Copenhagen in 2009). This year is the 27th iteration, and promises to be a difficult follow-up to the landmark summit last year, Cop26 in Glasgow. When does it start? The conference will be hosted by the Egyptian government in Sharm el-Sheikh, opening on 6 November. For two days after that, Monday 7 and Tuesday 8 November, world leaders will gather for a series of closed-door meetings, and direct their officials to get the kind of deal needed. They will then depart, leaving the complex negotiations to their representatives, mainly environment ministers or similarly senior officials. The talks are scheduled to end at 6pm on Friday 18 November but past experience of Cops shows they are likely to extend into Saturday and perhaps even to Sunday. Why do we need a Cop – don’t we already have the Paris agreement? Yes – under the landmark Paris agreement, signed in 2015, countries committed to holding global temperature rises to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, while “pursuing efforts” to limit heating to 1.5C. Those goals are legally binding and enshrined in the treaty. However, to meet those goals, countries also agreed on non-binding national targets to cut – or in the case of developing countries to curb – the growth of – greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, by 2030 in most cases. Those targets – known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – were inadequate to hold the world within the Paris temperature targets. If fulfilled, they would result in 3C or more of warming, which would be disastrous. Everyone knew at Paris that the NDCs were inadequate, so the French built into the accord a “ratchet mechanism” by which countries would have to return to the table every five years with fresh commitments. Those five years ended on 31 December 2020, and at Cop26 in November 2021, countries assembled to set out new targets. Didn’t all this get sorted out at Cop26? The most important development at Cop26 was that countries agreed to focus on the tougher 1.5C aspirational goal of the Paris agreement, acknowledging that the 2C target would allow massive devastation to take place. Research conducted since the Paris agreement was signed has shown a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels would cause changes to the climate system that would be, in many cases, catastrophic, and some of them would be irreversible, so switching the focus to a 1.5C goal represents vital progress. Many countries also updated their NDCs at Cop26, and countries responsible for about three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions set out long-term targets to reach net zero carbon by about mid-century. However, to stay within 1.5C, the world must not only reach net zero by about 2050 but also halve greenhouse gas emissions, compared with 2010 levels, in this decade. However, the emissions pledges at Cop26 were not adequate to meet that goal. So at the Glasgow summit, countries also agreed to hasten the ratchet mechanism, decreeing that progress on NDCs should be updated every year, and countries were encouraged to come forward this year, and as often as necessary, with new NDCs until they are adequate. What has happened since? No one at Glasgow last year could have foreseen what a changed world we would live in today. Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in February was not only brutal but has sent shockwaves around the world. Geopolitics have been upended, alliances and relationships redrawn, and the world has been plunged into crisis. Energy prices were already rising before Putin’s invasion, as the world recovered from the Covid-19 shock, but the Ukraine war has sent gas prices soaring. Putin has shown his willingness to use European dependence on Russian gas as a weapon of war, turning down the taps, threatening to withdraw supplies, then (almost certainly) sabotaging the Nord Stream pipeline. The result has been even higher gas prices and a bonanza for fossil fuel companies, which have been raking in record profits. Faced with record-high gas prices, the EU has taken a series of steps that include an energy efficiency drive, a windfall tax on the excess profits of fossil fuel companies to try to lower household bills and a massive push for renewable energy. But some EU countries have also returned – temporarily, they insist – to coal-fired power generation and embarked on a hunt for new fossil fuel supplies, building liquefied natural gas terminals and seeking deals with countries in Africa and elsewhere to explore new gasfields. The International Energy Agency warned last year that no new fossil fuel development could take place if the world was to stay within 1.5C. If these developments are not swiftly curtailed they could be disastrous for hopes of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown. That’s quite a difficult situation for Egypt And it’s not all. Food prices have also soared owing to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as both are massive producers of grain, sunflower oil and other staples, and also because fertiliser prices have increased – Russia and Ukraine are big producers of fertiliser, and even fertiliser produced elsewhere is more expensive as it requires a lot of energy to produce. This has led to the threat of food shortages, particularly to the vulnerable, and to a cost of living crisis engulfing developed and developing countries. The poor in many parts of the world are facing renewed economic hardship. Finally, to add to the geopolitical woes, relations between the world’s two biggest emitters, the US and China, have plunged to a new low, after the visit of Nancy Pelosi, the third highest-ranking member of the US’s ruling Democratic party, to Taiwan this summer. Last year, at Cop26, China and the US surprised everyone by signing a new bilateral deal to cooperate on tackling the climate crisis. This year, although technically climate negotiations are supposed to be in a “bubble” of their own, unaffected by the wider diplomatic context, in reality the countries have ceased to talk on this issue too. Sameh Shoukry, the Egyptian foreign minister who will chair the Cop27 talks, has offered his services as mediator between the US and China. But his task will be made more difficult by the tense geopolitical situation, the possibility of walkouts in protest at Russia’s actions, and Egypt’s position as an ally of key oil producers such as Saudi Arabia. Isn’t Egypt a dictatorship? Yes, and there is little freedom of the press and virtually no ability to protest. The government is accused of myriad serious abuses of human rights, and the jails are full of political prisoners. One of them, the British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, is on hunger strike, and the subject of negotiations with the UK government. Campaigners are concerned that civil society activists will be shut out of the Cop27 conference, or unable to demonstrate effectively. The UN guarantees a right of participation for civil society groups, and in an interview with the Guardian, Shoukry was keen to emphasise that campaigners would be welcome and that 9,000 had registered. But civil society groups are treading carefully, concerned that any work they do with local activists in Egypt could leave those people exposed when the UN Cop27 circus departs. What about the UK? The host country of Cop26 had its own dramas in the past year, running through three prime ministers, as well as the death of the Queen and the accession of King Charles III. While Alok Sharma, the UK president of Cop26, has spent the year trying to shore up the “fragile” deal achieved in Glasgow – he has repeatedly warned that the 1.5C target is “on life support … its pulse is weak” – his ministerial colleagues have often seemed to be working against him. The UK is mooting a new coalmine, has vowed to “squeeze every last drop” of oil and gas from existing fields in the North Sea and is awarding more than 100 new licences for oil and gas exploration. Even the question of who will attend Cop27 has been controversial. The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who took office in mid-October, at first said he would not go – a serious snub to the Egyptian hosts and other world leaders. It would be unusual for the leader of a country that hosted a successful Cop to not turn up to the next one to hand over the baton. Sunak was roundly criticised for the snub by developed and developing countries, and even a few of his own MPs, while charities and activists urged him to reconsider. The Observer then revealed that the former prime minister Boris Johnson was planning to go. Suddenly, it seemed that Sunak might be able to find time in his busy diary after all. But even if he does, the prime minister still seems adamant that he will not allow the UK’s new monarch, King Charles, to attend. This is hugely disappointing for many countries, as the king has been an important figure at previous Cops, including the Paris summit of 2015 and Cop26, and he is highly regarded around the world for his work on environmental issues. He is also the head of state of many Commonwealth countries, some of which are on the frontline of the climate crisis, and which got no say in whether he was allowed to go. Are we nearly there on 1.5C at least? No. Even if all the long-term and short-term pledges made in Glasgow were met, temperatures would still rise by about 1.8C above pre-industrial levels, according to the International Energy Agency – a vast improvement on the NDCs submitted in Paris but still far off where the world needs to be. What is worse, those estimates place a lot of emphasis on meeting long-term goals for which most countries have only the barest plans in place, making them highly optimistic. If only countries’ short-term goals – their NDCs, setting out emissions cuts to the end of this decade – are counted, then according to the UN temperatures could rise to about 2.5C by the end of this century. That leaves a lot remaining to be done at Cop27, and the signs are not good so far. Only 24 countries have updated their NDCs between Cop26 and Cop27, far fewer than were hoped for under the updated ratchet system. Of those, many will make little difference. Australia stands out as having made significant progress on its NDC under its new government. Why is 1.5C so important? As part of the Paris agreement, the world’s leading authority on climate science – the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – was charged with examining closely what a 1.5C temperature rise would mean for the planet. They found a vast difference between the damage done by 1.5C and 2C of heating, and concluded that the lower temperature was much safer. An increase of 1.5C would still result in a rising sea levels, the bleaching of coral reefs and an increase in heatwaves, droughts, floods, fiercer storms and other forms of extreme weather – but these would be far less than the extremes associated with a rise of 2C. Further findings from the latest IPCC reports, published since Cop26, have underlined these warnings and concluded that there was still a slim chance for the world to stay within the 1.5C threshold but that it would require concerted efforts. Crucially, they also found that every fraction of a degree of increase is important. How far do we have to go? Temperatures around the world are already at about 1.1-1.2C above pre-industrial levels, and greenhouse gas emissions are still rising. Carbon dioxide output plunged during the Covid-19 lockdowns but emissions rebounded as economies recovered. To stay within 1.5C, global emissions need to come down by about 7% a year for this decade. Yet they are still rising. What about net zero? To stay within 1.5C, we must stop emitting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases – from burning fossil fuels, from agriculture and animal husbandry – which create methane – from cutting down trees and from certain industrial processes – almost completely by mid-century. Any residual emissions remaining by then, for instance from processes that cannot be modified, must be offset by increasing the world’s carbon sinks, such as forests, peatlands and wetlands, which act as vast carbon stores. That balance is known as net zero. Long-term goals are not enough, however. The climate responds to cumulative emissions, and carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for about a century after it is released, so we could reach net zero by 2050 but still have emitted so much in the meantime that we exceed the 1.5C threshold irrevocably. That is why scientists are calling the 2020s the crucial decade for the climate – if emissions can peak soon and be reduced rapidly, we can keep cumulative emissions from growing too much, and still have a chance of staying within 1.5C. Is Cop27 just about 1.5C? The NDCs are a central part of the negotiations but, given the geopolitical upheavals since Cop26, it is unlikely that much further progress will be made on them this year. So at Cop27, there will be far more emphasis on climate finance, adaptation and loss and damage, issues of vital importance to developing countries. Climate finance is the money provided to poor countries, from public and private sources, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. They were promised at the Copenhagen Cop in 2009 they would receive $100bn a year by 2020. That target has been missed: a report at Cop26 found the pledge would not be fulfilled until 2023. There are also problems with how climate finance is allocated: most of the money that flows currently goes to middle-income countries for projects that reduce emissions, such as wind or solar energy. Far less goes to the poorest countries, and only a fraction of the money goes to helping countries adapt to the inevitable impacts of the climate crisis. At Cop26, developed countries agreed to double the amount of climate finance devoted to adaptation. Poor countries will want to see significant progress on that at Cop27, and to see more finance provided in the form of grants rather than loans that can push countries further into debt. Equally important will be the issue of loss and damage. This refers to the most devastating ravages of extreme weather, so great that no amount of adaptation can help with them. Examples include hurricanes and typhoons, the devastating floods that hit Pakistan this summer, or the droughts afflicting swathes of Africa. Recovery from such devastation can take years, if it is ever achieved, and the infrastructure of developing countries, services such as health and education, and their chances of improving the lot of their people, can suffer permanent damage. The world’s poorest countries, which have done least to cause the climate crisis, are most at risk. In the past, some experts characterised loss and damage as a form of compensation or reparations for poor countries from the rich. However, this was unacceptable to developed and large developing countries, which refused to sign legal agreements potentially leaving them liable for unlimited future costs. So the discussion has moved on to loss and damage as a form of rescue and rehabilitation for the countries suffering most, differing from climate finance in that it does not apply to emissions cuts and addresses broader social and development issues as well as the immediate impacts of extreme weather. For years, little progress has been made but at last developed countries have signalled they will discuss new finance mechanisms for loss and damage. Few expect loss and damage to be solved at Cop27 but at least the first steps towards a new settlement should be made. What about China? The world’s biggest emitter, China, produced its NDC days before the start of Cop26 but analysts said it was disappointing. China will aim for emissions to peak by 2030, and reach net zero by 2060, and reduce the amount of carbon it produces per unit of GDP by 65%. But these were the same commitments made by the government before, and experts believe China is capable of doing far more – of peaking emissions by 2025, which would be a significant boost to global efforts to remain within 1.5C. Climate Action Tracker, which analyses global targets, said China’s NDC would mean temperatures were on a trajectory to 2.4C, well above even the upper goal of the Paris accord. China is unlikely to update its NDC before Sharm el-Sheikh but experts have said it is making good progress on switching to renewable energy. This is the 27th Cop – why has all this taken so long? Since the industrial revolution, the modern world has run on fossil fuels. We live in a Promethean age – nearly all of our prosperity and technology has been built on cheap, easy-to-access energy from fossil fuels. Ending their reign will require huge changes, to energy systems, to the built environment, to transport, to our behaviour and diet. Getting everyone to agree on something so complex has not been easy. Developed countries have been unwilling to take on the costs, while developing countries have demanded the right to continue to use fossil fuels to achieve economic growth. There have been wranglings over historical responsibility, over burden-sharing, over costs, over science, and the politics has been influenced by changes of government in key countries – Donald Trump, for instance, withdrew the US from the Paris agreement. On the plus side, the cost of renewable energy and other green technology has plunged in recent years, so that it is cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world. Electric vehicle technology also progressed rapidly, and new fuels such as hydrogen are being developed. The energy crisis and economic woes of the past year could even make Cop27 a turning point towards clean energy and a low-carbon future where governments are no longer in hock to fossil fuel producers – now they have seen where that can lead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/10/katharine-hayoe-climate-change-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-10T13:00:04Z","webTitle":"Leading climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe: ‘You have the ability to use your voice’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/katharine-hayoe-climate-change-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/10/katharine-hayoe-climate-change-interview","fields":{"headline":"Leading climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe: ‘You have the ability to use your voice’","bodyText":"Katharine Hayhoe has wrestled with her climate footprint. The climate scientist, who is now chief scientist for the nonprofit The Nature Conservancy, was shocked when she realized how much of her personal emissions came from work travel. But are these more justifiable because her work is educating people about the climate crisis? There has long been a debate about how much individual actions matter when it comes to climate. The oil industry’s promotion of the concept of the carbon footprint has led some to believe that the whole idea is a huge distraction technique to divert attention from corporations driving the crisis. But as Greta Thunberg demonstrates, individuals can have a big impact, just not always in ways that can be measured. Part of the challenge is that we have no good way to conceptualize our impact as individuals. I came up with the concept of a “climate shadow” to try to help visualize how the sum of our life choices influences the climate emergency. Your shadow includes the car you drive and what you eat, but it’s also about where you work, how you engage in the workplace, where you invest your money and how much you talk about climate. I spoke with Hayhoe about the limitations of the carbon footprint, the impact we can have as employees and community members, and why it may be more profound than we think. The interview has been edited for clarity and length. There’s an ongoing debate about individual responsibility versus corporate responsibility when it comes to carbon emissions and the climate crisis. A lot of people feel as if there’s nothing they can do to make a difference – we’re just individuals. And yet, corporations are made up of individuals. Absolutely. I mean, look [at the climate strikes] at Amazon, that really shows the power of individual people using their voices. When you look at how change has happened before with corporations, with governments, with cities, it’s because one or two or three or four people began by using their voice, and typically they were not the people at the top. It reminds me of a story in my book about a guy who works for a big hospital in New York. He was horrified to find out that their pension fund was invested in fossil fuels when fossil fuel air pollution is responsible for almost 9m premature deaths a year. He said: “Isn’t our Hippocratic oath to do no harm?” So he talked to the pension fund about it and they said: “well, we don’t care.” Then he started a petition. He started going around the hospital talking to the doctors, the nurses, and the other people who work there, saying, “would you be interested in signing this petition?” I don’t even know if he has succeeded yet, he hadn’t when I wrote the book, but that’s what he’s doing. That’s his attempt to use his voice. Everybody has a voice, and wherever you work, you have the ability to use your voice. One of the reasons I created the climate shadow was my frustration with the carbon footprint and how it devalues actions that can’t be measured, such as voting or activism. Can you speak a little bit about the tension between higher impact actions that can’t be measured and actions that have less impact but can be measured? I think that climate shadow is such a powerful concept. Ten years ago I stepped on the carbon scale, so to speak, to measure my carbon footprint. I was genuinely shocked to find out that the biggest part of it was my travel. I was going to a lot of scientific meetings and going places to talk to people about climate change. I decided that I was going to transition most of my talks to virtual talks and when I traveled, I was going to bundle my talks. One of my last bundled trips was to Alaska, where I visited three different cities and did 28 events with an average of 75 people per event. So I spoke to about 2,000 people and I calculated that if eight individual people reduced their individual carbon footprint by 10% as a result of listening to me talk – and a 10% reduction is very easy to achieve – then that was the carbon of my flight. Now let’s extrapolate this. Say that I put solar panels on my house. That’s great. But what if my place of work transitions to clean energy? You can calculate the difference, we’re talking orders of magnitude. But my place of work is only going to transition to solar energy if someone starts the conversation. Your recent book, Saving Us, is focused on hope and fighting hopelessness. And it does seem that if we want to tackle that hopelessness, the most important thing we can do is empower people within their corporate and political groups. Can you speak to that? Somehow we see corporations as not being made up of people, but they are made up of people. Every big organization is made up of people. In some corporations, the leadership is aware of the problem but they’re not sure what to do. In some cases, they would make a change, but people just haven’t called for it. We often have the image of corporations being completely immovable, but they’re made up of people who want to do the right thing. Even in the fossil fuel industry, there are people at those corporations who want to do the right thing. Often people feel that they’re just trying to hold on to their jobs and survive. How do we navigate that so people aren’t like: ‘Oh great, now I have to also be a climate warrior on top of just trying to not get fired’? We think of climate change as a separate issue on our priority list, but the only reason you care about climate change is because of what’s already at the top of your list – keeping your job, taking care of your family, worrying about your health, worrying about your kids, worrying about the place where you live – whatever it is that you’re already worrying about. When you are taking action for climate, it’s not for climate change, it’s for you. It’s for your family, it’s for everything you love, everyone you love, every place that you love – that’s why you’re doing it. There’s a significant mind shift there, so that we don’t see it as an extra “to do” on our list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/aug/12/energy-commission-dials-back-plan-to-charge-households-to-send-rooftop-solar-power-to-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-11T17:30:03Z","webTitle":"Energy commission dials back plan to charge households to send rooftop solar power to grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/12/energy-commission-dials-back-plan-to-charge-households-to-send-rooftop-solar-power-to-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/aug/12/energy-commission-dials-back-plan-to-charge-households-to-send-rooftop-solar-power-to-grid","fields":{"headline":"Energy commission dials back plan to charge households to send rooftop solar power to grid","bodyText":"A proposal for households with rooftop solar panels to be charged for exporting electricity into the power grid at certain times has been softened, with regulators guaranteeing a “free option” under which people will not face any cost. The Australian Energy Market Commission said its final decision on changes designed to prevent “traffic jams” of electricity at sunny times in the middle of the day, would also prevent network operators placing a blanket ban on customers sending energy to the grid. Under changes to be announced on Thursday, electricity network companies would have to offer solar customers an option under which they would not face a financial penalty, but would probably face a limit on how much electricity they can export. Other options would involve solar users paying an upfront cost in return for being paid a higher rate for energy exported when demand for grid electricity is higher. One of the goals of the paid option is to make it more attractive for people to invest in batteries, electric vehicles (EVs) and appliances that allow them to timeshift household energy use. The commission said proposed network offers for solar offers would be assessed by the Australian Energy Regulator, which would have to consider the “long-term consumer interest”. Existing solar customers would not move on to the new system before July 2025. The shift follows a pushback against a draft declaration in March that critics said could penalise people who had installed solar in good faith and give too much power to networks in proposing consumer charges. A final decision was delayed due to the extent of public feedback. In a statement released to media ahead of the final announcement, the commission said the changes would impose “tough new obligations” on network companies requiring them to make their businesses solar and battery friendly. It said it was part of a plan to have more solar households, cut greenhouse gas emissions and keep costs down. The commission’s chief executive, Benn Barr, said it had listened to feedback and tightened protections for consumers to ensure people would not have to pay to export solar if they chose not to. He said people could earn by sending electricity to the grid when it was needed, or save by using delay-start functions to set appliances such as dishwashers to run on solar energy in the middle of the day. The commission’s chair, Anna Collyer, said it would turn the “current one-way street delivering power to people’s homes into a two-way super-highway where energy flows in both directions”. “Power network companies will need to deliver services to support solar and they’ll be judged on their performance on how much solar exports they allow into the grid,” she said. “These new measures to drive smart solar are fundamental to enabling a modern electricity grid.” She said the changes reflected widespread concern from industry, consumers and environment groups that the grid would not be able to handle a forecast doubling of household solar power over the next decade. About 2.8m Australian households now have solar systems. At peak moments in the middle of the day, slightly more than half the electricity across the national market is from renewable sources, compared with about 30% across the year. Advocacy group Solar Citizens has been sharply critical of the commission’s proposed change, describing it as a “sun tax”. It argued solar users should be rewarded for helping cut emissions, and that changing the rules after the fact was unfair. But the fairness principle was also invoked by those broadly supportive of the commission’s proposal. The change was a response to proposals from power distribution company SA Power Networks, the Total Environment Centre and welfare organisations the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and St Vincent de Paul. Kellie Caught, senior adviser on climate and energy for Acoss, has said the country needed a rapid transition to renewable energy, but increased network costs to deal with the influx of household solar should not be paid by people without panels, including the third of households who rent. She told Guardian Australia last month it was important that people with solar were given a choice over whether they paid to send electricity to the grid at busy times or could accept a limit on how much they exported. State governments raised concerns about the commission’s draft proposal to varying degrees. Victoria and Queensland indicated they did not support export charges. The commission estimated under a worst-case scenario solar owners choosing paid plans would still earn at least 90% of what they do now from their panels. It said it should lead to a power bill reduction for 80% of customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/feb/03/terrawatch-the-adventurous-icebergs-that-trigger-ice-ages","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-02-03T06:00:53Z","webTitle":"Terrawatch: the adventurous icebergs that trigger ice ages","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/03/terrawatch-the-adventurous-icebergs-that-trigger-ice-ages","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/feb/03/terrawatch-the-adventurous-icebergs-that-trigger-ice-ages","fields":{"headline":"Terrawatch: the adventurous icebergs that trigger ice ages","bodyText":"How does an ice age start? We know that changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun alter the amount of solar energy reaching our planet, but it has long been a mystery as to how this triggers such a dramatic change in the climate. A study shows that Antarctic icebergs may be responsible for tipping the balance. Aidan Starr, from Cardiff University, and his team analysed sediments recovered by the International Ocean Discovery Program from the ocean floor south of South Africa. Within those sediments were tiny fragments of rock dropped by melting Antarctic icebergs. By studying the chemistry of the tiny deep-sea fossils found throughout the sediment core, the scientists were able to show that when climate conditions enabled icebergs to travel this far north they made the North Atlantic fresher and the Southern Ocean saltier. Climate and ocean simulations revealed that this pulse of freshwater to the North Atlantic triggered changes in ocean circulation patterns that led to more carbon dioxide being pulled out of the Earth’s atmosphere, helping to plunge the planet into an ice age. The results, which were published in Nature, show that every glacial period over the last 1.6m years is associated with Antarctic icebergs straying farther north than normal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2021/aug/21/from-solar-power-in-africa-to-uk-tomatoes-the-eco-schemes-to-turn-your-cash-green","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-21T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"From solar power in Africa to UK tomatoes – the eco-schemes to turn your cash green","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/aug/21/from-solar-power-in-africa-to-uk-tomatoes-the-eco-schemes-to-turn-your-cash-green","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2021/aug/21/from-solar-power-in-africa-to-uk-tomatoes-the-eco-schemes-to-turn-your-cash-green","fields":{"headline":"From solar power in Africa to UK tomatoes – the eco-schemes to turn your cash green","bodyText":"Environmentally conscious consumers fed up with low savings rates are being targeted by a variety of green investments paying up to 8% interest a year. However, those thinking about signing up need to be prepared to accept some risk to their cash. This is a lot riskier than a bank or building society savings account. The investments include a scheme that allows people to put money into companies providing African families with access to clean, affordable solar energy, and one involving a company that has found a way to grow “greener” tomatoes in the UK. Energise Africa enables people to invest in bonds issued by solar companies, allowing them to provide “life-changing” solar home systems to low-income families in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For first-time investors, Energise Africa is currently guaranteeing investments up to £100. Launched in 2017, Energise Africa is the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. This involves putting your money into bonds (mainly unsecured, although some are secured) that are not listed on a public market. The minimum investment is £50. At the time of writing, there were several projects on the Energise Africa website either open for investment or about to go live. There is a 30-month bond from a solar company called Oolu, based in Senegal, with an expected interest rate of 7% a year. Oolu aims to raise just over £112,000 and says the money will help it provide solar home systems to 432 families in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, a company called Sollatek in Kenya is offering a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 5% a year. It says it is aiming to raise £40,000, so it can make 200 solar home systems available to families in rural Kenya. Also still open to investors at the time of writing was a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 6% that aims to raise £500,000. It has been launched by a Kenya-based agricultural supply chain company called iProcure. Lisa Ashford, the chief executive of Energise Africa and Ethex, says: “We’ve definitely seen an increase in people investing across both our platforms since the beginning of the pandemic. There are multiple factors at play, including low interest rates, but we’ve seen lots of new customers that want to support initiatives that can have a direct benefit on their community or a positive impact on the environment. The recent UN climate report and events such as the Greek wildfires put this into perspective.” The guarantee on offer to new investors will reassure some, although above and beyond that guarantee, your capital is at risk and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there is some kind of disaster, crisis or bankruptcy, you could lose some or all of your capital and would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Meanwhile, individuals concerned about the environmental cost of food production are being targeted by a new investment offering 8% interest a year. On offer is an opportunity to put money into Sterling Suffolk, a company building and operating carbon-capturing glasshouses that grow “greener” tomatoes. The investment has been launched by the crowdfunding platform Abundance Investment, and the aim is to raise up to £6.75m. In the UK we eat more than 500,000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes each year but only grow 20% of them here. We rely on imports all year round, and this has a high environmental cost. The UK imports most of its tomatoes from countries such as the Netherlands that operate gas-heated greenhouses, or places such as Spain that benefit from lower heating requirements but have other major environmental impacts including transport and water usage. Based in Bramford, near Ipswich, Sterling Suffolk is tackling this issue head-on. Its semi-closed glasshouses are the first of their kind in the UK and use 25% less energy per tonne of tomatoes than other conventional glasshouses while capturing and reusing at least 75% of the CO2 generated from heating, a spokesman says. The minimum investment is £5, and those who put their money in will be buying tradeable debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. However, debentures are not covered by the FSCS or the FOS and, again, there is a risk you may not get back the money you invested or make any return on your investment. The quoted 8% return assumes you hold the debentures until maturity in October 2032. According to the offer document, someone investing £1,000 now would be in line to receive a total of £1,555 at maturity – ie their original capital plus £555 of interest income. These debentures are secured, in contrast to some other Abundance investments that are unsecured, and can be sold on to other investors free of charge via the Abundance Marketplace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/jun/18/donors-pull-support-after-university-of-newcastle-appoints-coalmining-executive-mark-vaile-vice-chancellor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-18T12:49:00Z","webTitle":"Donors say they won’t support University of Newcastle after coalmining executive made chancellor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jun/18/donors-pull-support-after-university-of-newcastle-appoints-coalmining-executive-mark-vaile-vice-chancellor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/jun/18/donors-pull-support-after-university-of-newcastle-appoints-coalmining-executive-mark-vaile-vice-chancellor","fields":{"headline":"Donors say they won’t support University of Newcastle after coalmining executive made chancellor","bodyText":"Prominent philanthropists have said they will not donate to the University of Newcastle after coalmining executive Mark Vaile was appointed the institution’s new chancellor. Vaile, a former federal Nationals leader and the current chairman of Whitehaven Coal, was named the university’s new chancellor earlier this month, a decision that prompted a member of the university council to resign. In a sign of further backlash, 16 philanthropists wrote in an open letter published on Friday that they would not support the university given Vaile’s appointment. “It is of course up to the council of the University of Newcastle to decide who should lead them,” the letter, published in the Newcastle Herald, said. “But it up to us to decide which universities we will support. As significant donors we write this letter to make clear to the university, that we, and many like-minded others, will not support a university who would choose as their leader someone who is determined to build new coalmines when most of the world is determined to reduce fossil fuel use.” Among the signatories were entrepreneurs Alan Schwartz and Graeme Wood, the former Australian rugby captain, David Pocock, and philanthropist Sue McKinnon. They noted that Whitehaven Coal was seeking to expand the Vickery coalmine in northern New South Wales. The proposal was the subject of a recent landmark federal court judgment that found the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, had a duty of care to protect young people from the climate crisis. The letter follows a decision by Prof Jennifer Martin, from the school of medicine, to quit the university council in protest, while the University of Newcastle Students’ Association has also called on the university to reconsider. In response to the criticism, Vaile acknowledged in an op-ed for the Newcastle Herald that there had been “questions, of course, about how my background does or doesn’t fit with what the university and our region needs”. He said he was “excited” to be able to help the university deliver on its “commitment to become carbon neutral by 2025”. “While people often hear about my experience in Australia’s well-established industries in the energy sector, including Whitehaven Coal, they may not be as familiar with other areas of my portfolio,” Vaile said. “For example, I am the chair of Palisade Investment Partners – an organisation that has $1bn of assets under management in wind and solar energy technologies. “I strongly believe that if we are to address the challenges of human-made climate change, we must help our industries and our communities to transition our energy sector – there is no place in this country where this challenge is more important than in the Hunter.” Vaile said it could not be an “ideological debate of coal versus renewables”. His critics, writing in their open letter, pointed to the university’s motto “I look ahead” and said his appointment “speaks volumes”. “Mr Vaile has played an important role in Australian politics and business, but that role has included questioning the science of climate change and its links to drought, and leading companies that are determined to build new coal mines,” they wrote. Vaile was the Nationals leader and deputy prime minister from 2005 to 2007 and has been chairman of Whitehaven Coal since 2012. The ABC reported Vaile as saying he believed his role as Whitehaven chairman and his post at the university were “not mutually exclusive”. He said he would not attempt to change the strategic direction of the university and was committed to its pledge to be carbon neutral by 2025. Approached for comment by Guardian Australia, the university pointed to Vaile’s op-ed published by the Newcastle Herald this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/may/06/coalition-vetoes-funding-for-wind-and-battery-farm-in-northern-queensland","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-06T02:12:35Z","webTitle":"Coalition vetoes funding for wind and battery farm in northern Queensland ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/may/06/coalition-vetoes-funding-for-wind-and-battery-farm-in-northern-queensland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/may/06/coalition-vetoes-funding-for-wind-and-battery-farm-in-northern-queensland","fields":{"headline":"Coalition vetoes funding for wind and battery farm in northern Queensland ","bodyText":"The Morrison government has vetoed public funding of a windfarm and battery project in northern Queensland, with a cabinet minister declaring it was inconsistent with its goals and policies. The Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility (Naif), a government agency, in January approved up to $280m funding for the Kaban green energy hub 80km south-west of Cairns. The proponents, Neoen Australia, estimated the development could reduce electricity prices for Queensland consumers by $461m over the life of the project. Keith Pitt, the minister for resources, water and northern Australia, blocked the loan in March. In a letter to the head of the agency, Pitt said the development would not provide “dispatchable” generation into the national electricity market and he was “not convinced” it would lower power prices. The blocked funding would have helped build a 157-megawatt windfarm and 100MW battery. The project also includes a 320km transmission line upgrade. Neoen says the hub would create 247 jobs during construction and five ongoing positions. In a written explanation of his reasons for the veto, Pitt said the government’s technology investment roadmap policy had identified that the widespread deployment of mature technologies including wind and solar energy would be mainly driven by the private sector unless there was a clear market failure. He said the government’s policy was to support dispatchable generation, which refers to electricity capacity that can be called on when required to support variable solar and wind energy. “I am satisfied that providing Naif support for the project would be inconsistent with the objectives and policies of the commonwealth government. Because of this, I am giving a rejection notice,” Pitt wrote. Labor’s spokesman on northern Australian, Murray Watt, said the letter showed the government had an “ideological obsession” against renewable energy that was costing jobs and lower power prices. The opposition’s climate change and energy spokesman, Chris Bowen, said north Queensland should be getting 250 new energy jobs and reduced electricity bills “but they’ve been hung out to dry”. “Queensland has the resources and the workers to continue to power the country and the world, but a government that is leaving them behind,” he said. In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Pitt said his statement of reasons for the decision would be tabled in parliament as required under Naif legislation. “The company is free to put its case to other suppliers of finance, including the Queensland government,” he said. Neoen Australia told the Courier Mail the company was disappointed by the government’s decision, but remained committed to the project. Its website says Kaban has a wind profile different to most windfarms in the national grid, and it would be able to help provide stronger supply during periods of peak electricity use. The company has signed a power purchase agreement with the Queensland government-owned agency CleanCo under which it would provide energy to contribute to reaching the state target of 50% renewable energy by 2030."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-21T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"Government should have moved earlier to low-carbon, say industry experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","fields":{"headline":"Government should have moved earlier to low-carbon, say industry experts","bodyText":"Renewable energy and low-carbon heating could do much more to alleviate the gas supply problems of the future – and could have done much to reduce the impact of this winter’s soaring gas prices, if the government had done more to shift the UK’s energy market sooner, industry experts have said. The gas supply crunch has prompted a flurry of government meetings with industry, and reassurances in parliament on Monday from the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, that “there is no question of the lights going out” and that the UK is “highly resilient”. But the supply issue demonstrates that fossil fuels are inherently subject to wild price fluctuations, which happen at least once a decade, according to Roger Fouquet, of the London School of Economics. “Price volatility is an inevitable part of the fossil fuel energy system,” he said. “Renewables do not suffer from these market-related problems.” Switching to renewables reduces the impact of fossil fuel price fluctuation, but the UK is still “particularly exposed to international gas prices”, said Rob Gross of UCL. “Gas power stations set prices [in the UK], particularly when demand is high and renewables output is low. Countries with a lower share of gas in their power mix experience less volatile prices and we should expect that here too.” Dan McGrail, chief executive of RenewableUK, which represents wind energy companies, said the government should learn the lesson for future years. “The first priority for government and the sector is, of course, protecting consumers in response to this price surge. The only way to do that in the long term is to have an energy system powered by cheap renewables, with flexible storage, hydrogen and other low-carbon technologies to meet demand at lowest cost.” He pointed out that it was already cheaper, even before the gas price began soaring, to generate electricity by building a new windfarm than running an existing gas power plant. The growth of renewables has cut the proportion of power the UK gets from fossil fuels from 60% to under 40% in the last few years. McGrail said: “The industry is working with government to accelerate investment in renewables, which is key to ending our reliance on gas for heating our homes and in heavy industries. Alongside massive investment in renewables, we need to shift the dial on electrification and green hydrogen production in the UK to meet net zero at lowest cost.” Solar power has also plummeted in cost in recent years, despite a lack of support from the government, and is forecast to be the cheapest form of power within a few years, surpassing even onshore windfarms. Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade body Solar Energy UK, said solar power could continue to provide electricity through the winter months. Solar currently provides about 4.5% of the UK’s electricity, but he said it was “eminently achievable” to triple that by 2030, at no cost to consumers, if the government would clear the way by removing regulatory difficulties. Heat pumps for homes could also reduce the UK’s reliance on gas, added Jan Rosenow, Europe director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, as they run on electricity, though electricity in the UK is partly generated by gas. “But even if all of the electricity used by heat pumps was generated by gas the much higher efficiency of heat pumps would still result in a reduction of gas use.” However, as Fouquet notes, “wind and solar do suffer from intermittency problems. So, while accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources is welcome for environmental reasons, it is important to develop an energy system that is flexible to these intermittencies.” That can involve investing in large-scale battery storage technologies, which the UK has signally failed to do, or in backup power. Nuclear reactors, though controversial, can supply a steady stream of power to the grid that can counterbalance the intermittency of some renewable energy, but plans by successive governments for more than two decades to build a new fleet of reactors that would replace the UK’s current ageing nuclear plants have been mired in difficulties. The trade union Prospect called on the government to beef up its commitment to nuclear power. Sue Ferns, senior deputy secretary general of the union, said: “This is a wake-up call for the government, which must intervene immediately to ensure short-term security of supply. The current crisis is a product of an over-reliance on imports and weather-dependent renewables leaving us dangerously exposed to fluctuations in global natural-gas markets. The UK must prioritise domestic sources of firm power, particularly nuclear, to ensure a secure, resilient and low-carbon future.” Another vital measure is to reduce the amount of energy that is wasted. British homes are among the draughtiest and least efficient in Europe, but little has been done to improve that. The government introduced an insulation scheme, the green homes grant, last year as part of its much-vaunted push to “build back greener” from the pandemic. Within six months, however, it had all but collapsed owing to poor administration and in March this year it was scrapped by the Treasury, with nothing to replace it. After the current crisis has passed, it will be tempting for ministers to return to normal. But experts contacted by the Guardian warned that this should be a wakeup call to the government to introduce the suite of measures needed to protect the UK’s gas supply and shift the economy to a low-carbon footing. Gross concluded: “Ultimately, it will depend on the level of storage, interconnection and demand management to make best use of renewable resources and break the link between gas and power prices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/sep/01/opec-member-urges-oil-producers-to-focus-more-on-renewable-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-01T12:27:25Z","webTitle":"Opec member urges oil producers to focus more on renewable energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/01/opec-member-urges-oil-producers-to-focus-more-on-renewable-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/sep/01/opec-member-urges-oil-producers-to-focus-more-on-renewable-energy","fields":{"headline":"Opec member urges oil producers to focus more on renewable energy","bodyText":"The finance minister of Iraq, one of the founding members of the global oil cartel Opec, has made an unprecedented call to fellow oil producers to move away from fossil fuel dependency and into renewable energy, ahead of a key Opec meeting. Ali Allawi, who is also the deputy prime minister of Iraq, has written in the Guardian to urge oil producers to pursue “an economic renewal focused on environmentally sound policies and technologies” that would include solar power and potentially nuclear reactors, and reduce their dependency on fossil fuel exports. Along with the executive director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, he wrote: “To stand a chance of limiting the worst effects of climate change, the world needs to fundamentally change the way it produces and consumes energy, burning less coal, oil and natural gas … If oil revenues start to decline before producer countries have successfully diversified their economies, livelihoods will be lost and poverty rates will increase.” Ministers of the 13 Opec member states are scheduled to meet virtually on Wednesday to negotiate potential curbs to production, as oil prices waver. Opec had earlier agreed to boost production as economies recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic, but slowing markets have led some to suggest a halt to the increase. The US president, Joe Biden, controversially called for Opec to increase oil production further last month, to keep oil prices from rising and assist with the US economic recovery. His plea was rejected. The Guardian understands Wednesday’s Opec meeting may also discuss the climate crisis, in an unusual move for the fossil fuel producers, before vital UN climate talks called Cop26, scheduled for Glasgow in November. Allawi and Birol suggested current oil price volatility, driven by the pandemic, was only the beginning of problems for producers. The climate crisis will not only require a move away from oil, but will strike the Middle East and north Africa particularly badly, where rising temperatures are already causing severe problems. The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) recent global roadmap to net zero by 2050 found that global demand for oil was likely to plunge from more than 90m barrels per day to fewer than 25m by 2050, resulting in a potential 85% drop in revenues for oil-producing economies. “In a region with one of the youngest and fastest-growing populations in the world, economic hardship and increasing unemployment risk creating broader unrest and instability,” Allawi and Birol wrote. An alternative to remaining tied to increasingly volatile oil prices would be to invest in renewables, especially solar power. “The energy sector could play a role here by making use of the region’s vast potential for producing and supplying clean energy,” they wrote. Iraq is a founder member of the cartel that includes many of the world’s biggest producers, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Nigeria and several other African oil-producing states. The Opec+ grouping also includes Russia and some smaller producers. Most have been hostile to calls for action on climate change, while some have been dismissive of climate science and Saudi Arabia, in particular, has frequently been obstructive to UN negotiations on global climate action. The IEA warned in May that for the world to stay within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the lower limit set out in the Paris agreement – to which all Opec members are signatories – then all new oil exploration must cease from this year. Asked about the findings, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the energy minister of Saudi Arabia, told reporters after an Opec meeting in June: “I would have to express my view that I believe it is a sequel of [the] La La Land movie … Why should I take it seriously?” In the past, Saudi ministers have flirted with climate action, for instance suggesting that the country could power itself with solar energy in future. But none have seriously suggested a policy to cease oil exports. However, some oil producers have taken a more dovish stance. Oman, which is no longer an Opec member, is pursuing hydrogen as a potential low-carbon fuel for the future. UAE is also working on hydrogen, and boosting renewables, and recently inaugurated a new nuclear plant. Egypt, Morocco and Jordan are among other countries in the region with sizeable renewable energy programmes. Birol, one of the world’s leading energy economists, told the Guardian: “More than at any point in history, fundamental changes to the economic model in resource-rich countries look unavoidable. Countries in the region have been making some efforts on the energy transition. There are promising initiatives [among oil producers], but as is the case for many other countries around the world, reaching net zero emissions will require much stronger actions and much greater international collaboration.” He added: “The IEA has been warning for many years that countries that rely heavily on oil and gas revenues need to move quickly to diversify their economies away from fossil fuels to keep pace with the transition to clean energy. The impact of Covid on the oil market last year gave us a fleeting image of what the region’s economies could look like in the future in a world where demand for oil and gas is structurally weaker – and where countries do not take serious measures to diversify their economies and increase their resilience.” On Wednesday oil prices fell slightly after analysts said they expected Opec to stick to its plan of gradually increasing oil production."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/aug/09/australia-lagging-at-the-back-of-the-pack-of-oecd-countries-on-climate-action-analysis-finds","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-08T17:30:27Z","webTitle":"Australia ‘lagging at the back of the pack’ of OECD countries on climate action, analysis finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/09/australia-lagging-at-the-back-of-the-pack-of-oecd-countries-on-climate-action-analysis-finds","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/aug/09/australia-lagging-at-the-back-of-the-pack-of-oecd-countries-on-climate-action-analysis-finds","fields":{"headline":"Australia ‘lagging at the back of the pack’ of OECD countries on climate action, analysis finds","bodyText":"Claims by the Morrison government that Australia has done more to cut greenhouse gas emissions than other countries have been challenged by an analysis that found it has gone backwards compared to similar countries over the past 15 years. Energy analyst Dr Hugh Saddler ranked the performance of 23 OECD countries and Russia on eight climate measures, including share of electricity from non-fossil fuels, per capita emissions from transport and overall emissions intensity of each economy. He found Australia was ranked 20th or worse in seven of the eight categories. In relative terms, it had not improved in any category since 2005 and had gone backwards compared to other developed countries in four. Saddler, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said his research – published by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute – showed the country was “lagging at the back of the pack” among developed countries in transforming its economy. He contrasted it with Morrison’s claim, made ahead of a virtual climate summit hosted by the US in April, that Australia’s record in reducing emissions was better than many of the other major countries appearing at the event. “Despite the last decade of growth in solar and wind energy, fossil fuels still dominate Australia’s energy sector and its rate of electrification – that is, getting off coal, oil and gas for energy – is one of the worst in the OECD,” Saddler said. The emissions analysis precedes the release on Monday night of a landmark report by the world’s leading climate scientists that will assess the state of the global climate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report is a comprehensive review of the world’s knowledge of the climate crisis and how rapidly human actions are altering the planet. Saddler said his research showed the government’s “so-called gas-fired economic recovery”, under which the Coalition has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to fossil fuel power and opening up new gas basins, was “absolutely counter to the needs of Australia’s energy system transition”. “Over the past 15 years, Australia has squandered its golden opportunity to decouple its energy sector from fossil fuels, unlike so many other OECD countries,” he said. “As a result Australians are left with high-polluting and inefficient power, heating, housing and transport. This also drives up our cost of living and drives down our energy productivity.” The government defends its performance on climate by arguing the fall in Australia’s emissions since 2005 – about 20%, according to the most recent national accounts – is better than many comparable counties. Morrison and other government MPs have repeatedly cited the figure when asked why Australia’s 2030 emissions reduction target is only half that set by the US and European Union, and less than half that promised by Britain. They say Australia has a record of “over-achieving” on emissions targets. But Saddler’s research backs earlier analyses that suggest this claim is misleading. He found all of Australia’s emissions reductions since 2005 have been due to farming activities, mainly due to a large fall in the amount of “land-clearing”. In basic terms, the annual destruction of forests and other ecosystems for agriculture and timber collection decreased over the decade from 2007 to 2017 – it still happens, but at a slower rate. Saddler’s report said if this change in how land was used was excluded from national emissions accounts Australia’s emissions had increased by 7% since 2005. He said it was a key, and often overlooked, point when comparing Australia’s emissions were compared to other countries. “Large one-off reductions in land-clearing are in no way evidence of a trend towards the decarbonisation of the Australian economy,” the report said. “For the purposes of international comparison, it is important to note that most other developed countries have no capacity to benefit from large reductions in land-clearing for the simple reason that they cleared most of their land centuries ago.” Saddler excluded changes in land use by choosing indicators that measured changes in energy consumption and emissions. They included energy combustion emissions, energy consumption, energy productivity (the amount of economic output for each unit of energy consumed), non-fossil fuel share of electricity and transport emissions. Findings included: Australia had the second most emissions-intensive energy system after Poland, a big coal producer. It achieved the second smallest increase in energy productivity across the 15 years, ahead of only Portugal. This is despite federal and state energy ministers releasing a national energy productivity plan in 2015. It has significantly increased its share of wind and solar energy but other countries have moved faster – it slipped from 13th (in 2005) to 14th (in 2019) on a ranking of the share of electricity from new renewable energy generation. It was one of only three countries to have increased total energy combustion emissions. Prior to Covid-19, it had the third highest per capita transport emissions, behind the US and Canada. Both North American countries reduced per capita transport emissions faster between 2005 and 2019 than Australia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2021/jan/05/how-greenhouse-gases-are-actually-cooling-earths-upper-atmosphere","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-01-05T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"How greenhouse gases are actually cooling Earth's upper atmosphere","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jan/05/how-greenhouse-gases-are-actually-cooling-earths-upper-atmosphere","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/jan/05/how-greenhouse-gases-are-actually-cooling-earths-upper-atmosphere","fields":{"headline":"How greenhouse gases are actually cooling Earth's upper atmosphere","bodyText":"In all the discussions about climate change, one thing is often overlooked – the upper atmosphere of Earth is actually cooling while the lower atmosphere grows warmer, and this strange paradox is a clear fingerprint of greenhouse gases at work. Carbon dioxide in the lower atmosphere helps trap heat from the sun’s solar energy reflected off the Earth’s surface and so, like a greenhouse, the lower atmosphere grows warmer. But at high altitudes it is a different story, because the upper atmosphere is so thin that the carbon dioxide releases its energy into space and so the upper atmosphere cools. And that cooling is also making the upper atmosphere contract. Past studies have shown that the cooling trend is driven by greenhouse gases, as well as shifts in the Earth’s magnetic field and the roughly 11-year cycle in the sun’s solar activity. A recent study disentangled these different factors by simulating the upper atmosphere at 100-500km altitude from 1950 to 2015. The results confirmed that rising carbon dioxide levels were the main driving force cooling the upper atmosphere. Shifts in the Earth’s magnetic field and variations in the solar cycle played much smaller roles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/dec/20/as-the-coalition-and-labor-inch-closer-on-emissions-are-australias-climate-wars-ending","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-20T01:37:06Z","webTitle":"As the Coalition and Labor inch closer on emissions, are Australia’s climate wars ending?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/20/as-the-coalition-and-labor-inch-closer-on-emissions-are-australias-climate-wars-ending","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/dec/20/as-the-coalition-and-labor-inch-closer-on-emissions-are-australias-climate-wars-ending","fields":{"headline":"As the Coalition and Labor inch closer on emissions, are Australia’s climate wars ending?","bodyText":"If a week is a long time in politics, three years is a geological age. Long-held assumptions can change dramatically in that time. Just ask the Business Council of Australia. In 2018, before the last federal election, the lobby group representing 100 of the country’s biggest businesses described a Labor pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 as “economy wrecking”. The Coalition’s more modest and less scientifically based goal of a 26-28% cut was deemed “appropriate and achievable”. (To its credit, the business council has chosen not to delete its incriminating tweet.) Three years of worsening science news and a once-in-a-century pandemic later, the BCA has turned on its heel. It believes Labor’s new, fractionally reduced 2030 target – a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels – and the policies that support it are a “sensible and workable plan”. Remarkably, given its history of opposing a national carbon price, it recently called on both major parties to do more. The BCA is not the only establishment heavyweight to have embraced greater ambition and offered support for Anthony Albanese and his climate change shadow minister, Chris Bowen, since the ALP emissions policy was released earlier this month. The Australian Industry Group – the country’s largest employer group – said Labor’s target could be delivered with “sensible policy reforms, greater collaboration and a close focus on industry competitiveness”. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said it offered “a pathway to achieve the economic and technological transition towards a more sustainable future”. And the Australian Automobile Association said it was a “win for consumers”. This response is not a complete surprise. Most major corporates are persuaded the world will inevitably move on climate and that it is in their interests to do the same – or at least be seen to. But the support from business for Labor’s more ambitious stance reflects a sea change in the battle-weary world of Australian climate politics. Some observers have wondered if this is how the “climate wars” end, having helped bring down multiple political leaders on both sides and held back policy for more than a decade. Political disagreements and attacks will continue, but will the potency of a dishonest campaign over emissions policy have diminished by the time next year’s election rolls around? ‘There’s no going back’ Analysts mostly say: let’s not get ahead of ourselves. But they also say people should not underestimate what it means that the Coalition has promised the country will reach net zero emissions by 2050. Scott Morrison’s net zero plan, released shortly before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, includes no new policies, largely relies on unproven technology and does not actually get the country to net zero, but the long-delayed decision to set the target means for the first time Australia’s major political parties agree on the destination. It narrows the scope for political attack. “I think the war is over in the sense the fundamental differences about doing anything about climate change is over,” says Tony Wood, the energy program director with the Grattan Institute. “There is a rump of people on both sides who don’t want there to be bipartisan support for climate change and who see benefit in differentiation, but I think the question is whether we’re now entering a stage of cold wars and skirmishes.” Frank Jotzo, professor of climate change economics at the Australian National University Crawford School of Public Policy, says the centre of debate has shifted and bipartisan support for a net zero target opened “many, many opportunities and really changes the tone of the debate”. “There’s no going back on that,” he says. “Now that a conservative government that had a ‘no-action’ point of view supports a net zero target, there’s really no room for saying we shouldn’t be doing anything. “If you went just by what business says and what civil society says, then you would say there’s really nothing that could hold back a shift to effective and sensible climate policy in Australia. Large parts of the spectrum now agree on the fundamentals – they want ambitious targets and meaningful policies of some kind.” Of course, things are not that simple. “This agreement doesn’t necessarily translate into how elections are campaigned,” Jotzo says. “The preconditions for an end to the climate wars are there, but I think it’s too early to call.” Unanswered questions about the 2022 campaign include whether News Corp newspapers, which have run misleading campaigns against the cost of climate policies and attacked the scientific consensus, have moved on since launching a “mission zero” series on climate before the Glasgow summit or will return to their old ways. To date, the response has been more muted than some in Labor expected. There have been news stories describing the ALP policy as targeting big emitters – which is true, with the important caveat that it is gradual and has the support of business groups. Others have raised doubts about whether it would create more than 600,000 jobs and the extent to which it would lead to a reduction in energy bills – though it was not disputed that they would be cut. The most aggressive media attack was on the front page of News Corp’s Brisbane daily, the Courier Mail, which quoted backbencher Matthew Canavan creatively describing a plan to use an existing Coalition policy – the safeguard mechanism – to start to cut emissions from big industry as “Labor’s revenge” on Queensland. Morrison and his ministers have not gone as hard and the initial attack was quickly over, but it’s early days, and campaign lines have been tested. The prime minister claimed Labor’s policy would be bad for coal regions and manufacturing, and several MPs described the promised changes to the safeguard mechanism as a “sneaky new carbon tax”. In reality, Labor is proposing a more gentle use of the safeguard than promised by its architect, Liberal cabinet minister Greg Hunt, back in 2015. In response, Albanese said the Coalition was “frozen in time while the world warms around it” and that he expected the government to lie about Labor’s policy. Closing the climate policy gap Analysts expect Coalition criticism to be more targeted than in previous campaigns, reflecting not only the shared net zero target, but that the government is under pressure from climate-focused independents in heartland Sydney and Melbourne seats. A differentiated campaign – trying to convince inner-city residents the government is acting, while telling some parts of Queensland and New South Wales a Labor government would be devastating for them – is not impossible, but harder to land than in the past. Labor’s policy was designed with this in mind. There is a gap between the parties on 2030 targets, but it is relatively narrow once the government’s rhetoric is factored in. The prime minister still backs a target set under Tony Abbott six years ago, but claims official projections show the country would cut emissions by 35%. Whether you accept this or not – and there is reason not to – it leaves Labor promising just eight percentage points more than the Coalition. Albanese accurately described the ALP’s target as modest. The gap between the parties on renewable energy is similarly difficult to exploit. The government forecasts that 69% of electricity in the national market will be zero emissions by 2030, largely due to the tumbling cost of solar energy and incentives offered by state governments. Labor says it would lift that to 82% just by bringing forward construction of transmission lines to planned renewable energy zones. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director for the Australia Institute, says Labor has gone out of its way to avoid any area where it was at risk of being wedged by the government or other opponents. “It means the animosity and ridiculous scare campaigns about climate change that we’ve seen are unlikely to dominate this election,” he says. If this proves correct, it may leave the biggest battleground where those who believe the debate should be led by climate science say it should have always been – over what Australia has to do to live up to its global commitment to try to limit global heating to 1.5C. Politically, they include the Greens, who want a 75% cut by 2030 including a rapid phaseout of coal power, and some independent candidates. Merzian, a former diplomat representing Australia at climate talks, is among those who believe this is where the debate is finally headed, saying: “The battle will not be over until we have a decent climate policy that reflects the reality of what’s needed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/08/tuesday-briefing-johnson-shamed-over-mobbing-of-starmer","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-08T06:28:14Z","webTitle":"Tuesday briefing: Johnson blamed over mobbing of Starmer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/tuesday-briefing-johnson-shamed-over-mobbing-of-starmer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/08/tuesday-briefing-johnson-shamed-over-mobbing-of-starmer","fields":{"headline":"Tuesday briefing: Johnson blamed over mobbing of Starmer","bodyText":"Top story: No 10’s new PR ‘lobbied for Huawei’ Hello, I’m Warren Murray, and I hope this will help you feel more on top of things. MPs from all sides have accused Boris Johnson of whipping up political poison after the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, was set upon by protesters who accused him of protecting the paedophile Jimmy Savile. Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, had to be bundled into a police car after anti-vax protesters surrounded him near parliament with shouts of “traitor” and “Jimmy Savile”. The former chief whip Julian Smith described the events as appalling and said the prime minister’s false Savile slurs must be “withdrawn in full”. Johnson said the behaviour directed at Starmer was “absolutely disgraceful” and “completely unacceptable” but once again stopped short of apologising. Johnson is expected to reshuffle his team today including possibly sacking the chief whip, Mark Spencer. The prime minister will also continue a No 10 overhaul after recruiting Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Office minister, as his chief of staff, and Guto Harri, his former spokesperson, as his new director of communications. Harri has drawn criticism from Labour over his previous job for a lobbying firm that worked for Huawei, the company linked to the Chinese Communist party that has been banned from the UK’s 5G mobile network. * * * Diplomacy but no detente – Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin had nothing in the way of a breakthrough to show for five hours of talks at the Kremlin on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Macron, the French president, is due today in Kyiv to hold talks with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has met with Joe Biden at the White House. Biden insisted the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany would be shut down if Russia attacked, but Scholz would not be so specific. Biden said of Putin: “I know that he’s in a position now to be able to invade, almost assuming that the ground is frozen above Kyiv. He has the capacity to do that. What he’s going to do I don’t know.” The president advised US civilians to leave Ukraine, saying: “I don’t want them to get caught in the crossfire.” As the Russian build-up continues, Britain has agreed to send a further 350 troops to Poland. * * * Over-18 checks on porn sites – British users of pornography websites would have to provide credit card or passport details to prove they are over 18 under revived plans. Ministers have said the forthcoming online safety bill will cover commercial porn sites, updating draft legislation that now applies to providers of user-generated pornography such as OnlyFans. More than a third of the British population are estimated to watch online pornography, according to estimates by the age verification industry, meaning age checking could be both an enormous technical challenge and potentially big business. * * * High street faces hit – Britain’s biggest retailers have warned the cost of living crisis will mean consumers tightening their purse strings over the coming months. Households already grappling with rising energy bills, petrol prices, tax, mortgage payments and rent can also expect to pay more for groceries this year. Supermarkets are responding by cutting back on staff costs; squeezing farmers and other suppliers not to increase their prices; “shrinkflation” tactics such as reducing the amount in a pack of peanuts while keeping the price the same; and cutting out unnecessary product lines. And while it won’t solve the energy price crunch, thousands of homes could soon be paid to halve their electricity usage during high-demand times. Octopus Energy and the National Grid are to trial the scheme. * * * Toxins in tap water – Drinking water containing dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals known as PFOS was piped into the homes of more than 1,000 people in south Cambridgeshire, the Guardian can reveal. The aquifer supplying the affected houses, close to Duxford airfield, was found to have PFOS levels at almost 400 nanograms per litre (ng/l) of water – four times the Drinking Water Inspectorate’s limit. Cambridge Water has admitted it removed the supply in June last year and said the exposure was under investigation. It admitted it had not told the community but said it had blended the water with another source. It would not say how long the villages had been drinking the contaminated supply, only that modelling and sampling undertaken in 2020 suggested the levels were previously below 100ng/l. PFOS has been associated with increased cholesterol, low birthweight and suppressed immune response. In the past it was used in firefighting foams, including at airfields. Defra, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency declined to comment. * * * Runs like it’s on rails – The Elizabeth line must be “flawless” before it can officially launch this year, London’s transport chief has said, amid speculation that the £18.9bn Crossrail project’s opening could be moved to the spring – before the Queen’s jubilee celebrations. As trials continue, Gwyn Topham, the Guardian’s transport correspondent, has taken a trip on the line, riding on spacious trains along the tunnels winding from Paddington to Liverpool Street. The official deadline for opening is the end of June. Andy Byford, the transport commissioner, said he would not give the go-ahead until entirely satisfied: “Better to take an extra couple of weeks, after how long Londoners have had to wait, than have people loving the surroundings but disappointed by the reliability. Some days it is 98% on time, but some days have been 80%, and that’s not good enough.” Today in Focus podcast: Hooked on crypto With endorsements from celebrities and ads on TikTok, cryptocurrency has gone mainstream.

Not if he’s planning a climate con job","bodyText":"Should Scott Morrison go to the climate conference in Glasgow? It depends. In my view, he should only go to the Cop26 conference if he plans on making a decent contribution to increasing global climate action. And whether he would do that remains highly questionable. One of the biggest shocks I’ve had recently was hearing US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi congratulating Scott Morrison on his “climate leadership”. I nearly fell off my chair. The master of spin had somehow gone to Washington and conned one of America’s most important political figures, receiving accolades he didn’t deserve. He ran his government’s usual “meet and beat” line about the current Australian 2030 target, a claim that is fallacious and wrong, and not supported by its own projections. He presented it as a fact to Pelosi and to gullible foreign correspondents. The same could easily happen in Glasgow. In reality, Australia is one of the world’s laggards on climate change. Analysis after analysis has compared Australia’s performance on climate with other countries and all come up with the same view. The Climate Action Tracker’s latest analysis downgraded Australia’s overall rating to “highly insufficient” and shows the country isn’t on track to meet its 2030 target, which is itself insufficient. If all others followed this level of ambition we would warm the planet by 3C. The same analysis was repeated by a recent Climate Analytics/WRI G20 report, and others have made similar criticisms, including the UN secretary general’s office. Scott Morrison himself has publicly questioned whether it is worth his while going to Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow. He has been rightfully criticised for this uncertainty, given the fundamental importance of the Glasgow meeting for climate action globally, and the conjunction between the Glasgow meeting and the G20 leaders’ meeting in Italy the weekend before. Many of our partners have attached strategic importance to this meeting, notably the United States, the UK, the European Union, India, our Pacific island neighbours and many others. While it would be unusual for Morrison to miss out on being in the big G20 leaders’ photo call, he might want to avoid the G20 altogether, given that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, will be there – and who doesn’t want to be a fly on the wall for THAT conversation? If he’s planning to go to continue the spin seen in Washington DC and make empty announcements, he should stay at home. There are a set of conditions I think any Australian leader should meet before attending the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow next month. First, a suitably enhanced 2030 target (or “nationally determined contribution”) well north of a 50% reduction in emissions (below 2010 levels). A fully 1.5C compatible domestic pathway for Australia would be at least 65% reduction by 2030. Morrison should not sidestep and dodge this by talking about 2035. Second, a firm commitment to substantially increase financial contributions to climate action globally. Australia is one of the laggards in this area – the Climate Action Tracker gave it a “critically insufficient” rating on this issue. Australia needs to stop funding fossil fuels overseas and increase the level of its international climate finance. Third, take off the table, unambiguously, without conditions and once and for all, Australia’s long-held position on using “carryover” credits for meeting its Paris agreement obligations. Because to meet your 2030 target using carbon credits substantially derived from historically high deforestation levels 40 years ago would be the ultimate con job. And while he has announced he might not do this, there is wiggle room in the government’s target submitted to the United Nations framework convention on climate change. Fourth, Australia needs to support the highest possible level of environmental and accounting integrity in the Paris agreement rulebook, which is still not finalised and in which Australia had appalling positions in Madrid in 2019. Fifth, Australia needs to join with many other countries that are moving to phase out coal from the power sector early. The UK Powering Past Coal Alliance now has 41 state members, and the UN secretary general has called on countries to phase out thermal coal by 2030, consistent with the science. Coal phaseout will also be on the G20 agenda. Finally, Australia should join with many other countries in committing unambiguously to reach net zero emissions nationally by 2050 at the latest. This may sound like a lot, but it’s actually exactly what many of our peers have done. This position would put Australia at parity with the UK, the EU, the US and others. That’s all. It would not particularly establish Australia as a leader but one that has simply just caught up with what its counterparts are doing as the world responds to the growing climate crisis. Unless Morrison does these things, then whatever he does in Glasgow would simply be more empty announcements, which he is becoming famous for. Because, on the ground in Australia the federal government has virtually no policies on anything that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions; if anything it’s the opposite. The Morrison government’s gas-led recovery is pouring tens of millions into enabling more gas resource development when we don’t need it – a move that will only make meeting Paris compatible targets harder. He is focusing on subsidising carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology that has a well-established track record for not working, increasing rather than decreasing costs, and deploying this in the next decade to expand the production of oil. His government continues to support coal and developing new coalmines. With the Adani coalmine heading towards its first shipment of coal by the end of the year, possibly around the Glasgow timeframe, how great will that look? Morrison’s government continues to promote policies that would keep coal in the power system and that would create blockages to solar energy, dubbed “coalkeeper” and “solar stopper”, respectively. Fortunately, the states are jacking up against this, but that has not stopped him. He has no policies to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles, and his government appears antagonistic to this technology. Australia is alone in the developed world for not having motor vehicle CO2 efficiency standards, and our fleet efficiency is going backwards. Morrison does not support green hydrogen, instead he is focusing on so-called “clean hydrogen” – hydrogen made with fossil gas, deploying carbon capture and storage which goes under the marketing name of “blue hydrogen”. Blue of course is a marketing colour that is designed to have a soft appeal to consumers, but there is nothing soft or nice about blue hydrogen. And it will not reduce emissions. So should Scott Morrison go to Glasgow? Sure, but only if he does his homework. • Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the managing director of Climate Analytics"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2021/jul/08/uk-must-match-rhetoric-with-action-on-chinas-treatment-of-uyghurs-say-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2021-07-07T23:01:45Z","webTitle":"UK must match rhetoric with action on China’s treatment of Uyghurs, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/08/uk-must-match-rhetoric-with-action-on-chinas-treatment-of-uyghurs-say-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2021/jul/08/uk-must-match-rhetoric-with-action-on-chinas-treatment-of-uyghurs-say-mps","fields":{"headline":"UK must match rhetoric with action on China’s treatment of Uyghurs, say MPs","bodyText":"Britain must act to stop China’s atrocities against Uyghur Muslims by banning the import of Chinese cotton and solar panels from Xinjiang province, as well as by announcing that no government officials will attend the Winter Olympics in Beijing, a report by MPs says. The chair of parliament’s foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, said that without action the UK would be allowing China “to nest the dragon deeper and deeper into British life”. The committee’s report says the government’s often tough rhetoric over “the industrial-scale forced labour schemes in Xinjiang” is not matched by effective action. The MPs accuse ministers of setting lax requirements on companies to remove forced labour from their supply chains, failing to sanction the Chinese official most responsible for mass atrocities, and failing after six months to publish “an urgent review” of UK trade controls from Xinjiang. They also urge ministers to join the UK parliament in describing what is happening as genocide, saying the tactics of naming and shaming has been shown to be more effective than closed-door diplomacy. A special fast-track asylum system for Uyghurs is also proposed. The all-party report also calls for technology firms underpinning what is described as Xinjiang’s police state to be banned from the UK. The report is certain to provoke an angry reaction from the Chinese government, but one committee member, Alicia Kearns, said MPs could not shy away from making criticisms. Kearns said: “It’s time for big boy politics. You cannot work with any partner on a best friend basis. We are the mother of all parliaments and if we are not willing to speak up for those that others seek to silence, then what parliament is going to do it?” The report says: “The Chinese government is responsible for the mass detention of more than a million Uyghurs, for forcing them into industrial-scale forced labour programmes, and for attempting to wipe out Uyghur and Islamic culture in the region through forced sterilisation of women, destruction of cultural sites, and separation of children from families. “The mass incarcerations and connected factories and farms mean it should be assumed that any product originating from Xinjiang is the product of forced labour. While much focus has been placed on the textile and apparel sector, other areas such as solar energy, agriculture and electronics also bear a substantial risk of using forced labour.” It says as many as 570,000 people are forced to pick cotton, often paid little to nothing. As a remedy it proposes that “until there can be definitive proof that products are not tainted by forced labour, UK companies and consumers should not be purchasing them”. It also calls for a government import ban on cotton and other products sourced to forced labour, something Tugendhat said was in compliance with WTO rules. More than 80% of China’s cotton comes from Xinjiang, and China provides a quarter of the world’s cotton products. Similarly, 40% of UK solar panels have Xinjiang-sourced materials. The report also proposes that “the British Olympic Association does not participate in the opening or closing Beijing 2022 ceremonies, beyond one representative carrying the union flag. It should abstain from sending government officials to any ceremonies or functions, strongly discourage UK businesses from sponsoring or advertising at the Olympics, encourage fans and tourists to stay away, and discourage athletes from supporting or accepting the Chinese government’s propaganda efforts.” The report calls for a ban on the use in Britain of surveillance equipment supplied by the Chinese firm Hikvision, saying the firm operates in Xinjiang and so has helped turn the province into “a modern police state where advanced technology is deployed to support an unprecedented level of surveillance, invasion of privacy and repression”. At the same time the report praises the government’s diplomatic efforts to raise the issue internationally, and accuses China of using its belt and road initiative as a means of putting pressure on many Islamic countries not to speak out against the atrocities in Xinjiang. Tugendhat, who has already been personally subject to Chinese government sanctions, said there was a growing need to adopt a tough approach. “We are seeing a growing nationalism in China and we need to be cautious that what we are not doing is being seen to be feeding the crocodile and hoping to be eaten last.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The evidence of the scale and the severity of the human rights violations being perpetrated in Xinjiang against the Uyghur Muslims is far-reaching, and paints a truly harrowing picture. “The UK government has led international efforts to hold China to account for its human rights violations in Xinjiang at the UN. We will carefully consider the findings of this report.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/sep/13/greenland-ice-sheet-melting-fridtjof-nansen","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-13T10:07:18Z","webTitle":"Rain fell on Greenland's ice sheet for the first time ever known.

Alarms should ring","bodyText":"Many people believed he couldn’t do it. Ski across the Greenland ice sheet, a vast, unmapped, high-elevation plateau of ice and snow? Madness. But Fridtjof Nansen, a young Norwegian, proved them wrong. In 1888, he and his small party went light and fast, unlike two large expeditions a few years before. And unlike the others, Nansen traveled from east to west, giving himself no option of retreat to a safe base. It would be forward or die trying. He did it in seven weeks, man-hauling his supplies and ascending to 8,900ft (2,700 meters) elevation, where summertime temperatures dropped to -49F (-45C). That was then. This is now: Last month, for the first time in recorded history, rain fell on the highest point of the Greenland ice sheet. It hardly made the news. But rain in a place historically defined by bitter cold portends a future that will alter coastlines around the world, and drown entire cities. The Greenland ice sheet contains four times more ice than all of Earth’s other glaciers and ice fields combined, outside Antarctica. The largest island in the world, Greenland is more than 36,000 times the size of Manhattan, and ice covers most of it, in many places thousands of feet thick. As carbon dioxide and methane accumulate in our atmosphere, causing our planet to heat (the six warmest years on record have been the last six), the ice sheet disintegrates. Greenland lost more ice in the past decade than it did in the previous century. Massive summertime meltwater rivers now flow over the ice sheet where, in Nansen’s time, no signs of surface water could be found. If the people of Miami, Shanghai, Tokyo, Mumbai, Lagos, Bangkok and New York are not concerned, they should be. The great Greenland ice melt is a climate crisis sword of Damocles for all coastal, low-lying, densely populated areas. No other single factor will probably contribute more to sea level rise over the next few decades. A consortium of climate scientists writing two years ago in Nature, a prestigious scientific journal, concluded that if Greenland continues to melt, in one bad-case scenario after another, tens of millions of people could be in danger of yearly flooding and displacement by 2030 – less than nine years from now. And by the end of this century, when Antarctica, which contains vastly more ice than Greenland, also enters a phase of catastrophic melting, the number of annual flood-prone people could reach nearly half a billion. It’s more than farewell, Miami. It’s goodbye, Florida. The assumption that land will always last is no longer valid. “Land is about the only thing that cannot fly away,” the English novelist Anthony Trollope once observed. True. But it can go bone dry – or drown. After Nansen’s Greenland expedition, he oversaw the construction of a small wooden ship named Fram (“Forward”), designed to enter the Arctic pack ice in an attempt to reach the north pole. Later, he mentored the explorers Roald Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton. His final act, however, was his most inspiring. As high commissioner for refugees for the League of Nations, he devised a passport to repatriate thousands left homeless after the Great War, and was awarded the 1922 Nobel peace prize. Nansen did what humankind must now do. He transcended himself. He respected science, and cared deeply for others. In the face of great challenges today, we can – and must – do the same. A good example is Jason Box, who Jeff Goodell, in his 2017 book The Water Will Come, describes as “a maverick scientist and Greenland ice junkie who got a lot of attention in 2012 when he publicly predicted just weeks before the summer melt season that Greenland would experience a record-breaking year for ice melt”. Raised and educated in Colorado, Box suspected that soot from wildfires in the American west and Canada, and from coal-fired power plants in the industrial north, would enter the atmosphere and travel far. When it settled in Greenland, the soot would darken the ice sheet and make it absorb, not reflect, solar energy. The result: the ice sheet would melt like gangbusters. Which is exactly what has happened. In 2014, Box was stunned to find the ice sheet so dark. He has since said that humanity’s burning of fossil fuels has probably set in motion nearly 70ft of sea level rise. A bold prediction, and not out of character for Box, who has spent more than a year on the ice. “I like ice because it’s nature’s thermometer,” he told Goodell. “It’s not political. As the world heats up, ice melts, it’s simple. It’s the kind of science that everyone can understand.” While science, endeavoring to avoid alarmism, can be overly cautious, science isn’t the problem. Disinformation and a lack of political will are the problems. To save the Greenland ice sheet – and Florida – will require a Nansen-esque transformation on steroids, something inspired by, but much larger than, President Franklin D Roosevelt’s New Deal. To begin, we need to elect representatives who respect science, and accept the magnitude of what we’re up against. If they do not, they must be defeated. It’s time to put our planet first. A little more than a thousand years ago, back when the world seemed large and wondrous and unknown, the Vikings settled Greenland. For every one person alive on earth back then, there are 25 today, most of us trapped in a fossil fuel economy that has given us great prosperity but now must be replaced. By what? By trains powered by wind, trucks powered by the sun, highways made of solar panels. Fantasy? No, they already exist. And are just the beginning. We are all on Greenland’s ice sheet with Nansen now. It’s forward or fail. No turning back.

Emissions will rise again this year and next year, after a fall last year, and 2023 is now on track to see the highest levels of carbon dioxide output in human history, equalling or surpassing the record set in 2018, according to forecasts released by the International Energy Agency on Tuesday. Such a rise would put the goals of the Paris climate agreement all but out of reach, as scientists have warned that emissions must halve this decade if the world is to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C, beyond which the effects of climate breakdown will ravage swathes of the globe. The reason for the sharp rise is that governments have failed to invest in green energy as they have sought to rebuild their economies from the Covid-19 pandemic. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA and one of the world’s foremost energy economists, said: “Of more than $16tn [£11.7tn, being spent on recovery from Covid-19] only 2% is going to clean energy investments. This is by far not enough. What we will see is that 2023 will reach an all-time record high [in emissions]. This is very worrying.” Significant to the forecast emissions rise is the pattern of pandemic recovery in emerging economies. Big wealthy economies, such as the US, EU member states, Japan and South Korea, have been investing in renewable energy and are on track to reduce their emissions. But countries such as India, Indonesia, Latin American countries and other emerging economies are falling behind in clean energy investments. About 90% of the forecast growth in emissions will come from the developing world, so helping such countries invest in green energy is of global importance, said Birol. “The most critical faultline [in attempts to tackle the climate crisis] is providing clean energy investments in emerging countries.” He said developing countries needed financial help to make the leap. “At the global scale, there is no lack of capital [available for investment in green energy] but that capital does not look at these projects in emerging economies,” he said. “There is a perception that the risk is higher.” He called on institutions such as the International Monetary Fund to step up their help to direct funds towards clean energy projects. Wind and solar energy are now cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world, while investments in energy efficiency also yield strong returns, and electric vehicle technology is becoming more affordable. Rich countries must also fulfil their promises to ensure at least $100bn a year in climate finance flows to developing countries, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather, Birol said. The pledge of $100bn a year has been a serious sticking point in the run-up to the Cop26 talks. “This $100bn should be a floor, not a ceiling,” he added. Cutting emissions in developing countries is cheaper than doing so in the industrialised world, giving rich countries an added impetus to extend assistance. “Advanced economies have both an economic rationale and a moral obligation to supply climate finance to the emerging world,” he said. China, the world’s biggest emitter, has also been investing in renewable energy but has strong and continuing investments in coal and high-CO2 infrastructure. Birol said there were encouraging signs, however, that coal investment was reducing. “There is good news on coal. We do not see so much investment in coal.” Birol will present his findings to the climate and energy ministers of the G20 nations, meeting later this week in Italy. He said it was vital that the G20, and all countries meeting for the crunch UN Cop26 climate talks this November in Glasgow should put in place a real “green recovery” from the pandemic. “We need to have as a purpose how to mobilise investment in clean energy,” he said. “We need this at Cop26 – there is no way out.” CO2 emissions have already rebounded strongly after their sudden plunge last spring, when governments around the world sent their countries into successive lockdowns. They are set to jump this year by the second highest amount on record, according to the IEA, the gold standard for emissions predictions. There had been hopes that this bounceback would be temporary, because the “brown economy” – dependent on high fossil fuel use – came roaring back after the Covid-19 recessions in many countries, while the green economy is still in development. Last week, Vivid Economics found that only about a tenth, or about $1.8tn, of all spending on recovery measures would have a beneficial impact on the climate and environment, while about twice that amount would have an environmentally harmful impact."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2023/jan/04/australia-news-live-floods-kimberley-climate-change-emergency-services-fitzroy-crossing-helicopter-crash-gold-coast","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-04T07:55:48Z","webTitle":"Unprecedented amount of water moving down Fitzroy River in Kimberley – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jan/04/australia-news-live-floods-kimberley-climate-change-emergency-services-fitzroy-crossing-helicopter-crash-gold-coast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2023/jan/04/australia-news-live-floods-kimberley-climate-change-emergency-services-fitzroy-crossing-helicopter-crash-gold-coast","fields":{"headline":"Unprecedented amount of water moving down Fitzroy River in Kimberley – as it happened","bodyText":"And that’s where we’ll leave you for this Wednesday. Here’s what we learned: • Major flooding in the Kimberley is “far from over”, authorities say, with the Fitzroy River at Fitzroy Crossing currently sitting at 15.75 metres, around 1.82 metres higher than the previously recorded peak. • The Bureau of Meteorology says 60,000 cubic metres of water per second is moving down the Fitzroy River – more water than it has ever seen in an Australian river. The amount moving down the river in one day is equal to the amount of water used in Perth over 20 years. • Severe storms have hit parts of New South Wales and south-east Queensland, with reports of at least golf-ball-sized hail and storm damage across regional NSW and outer suburban areas of Sydney. • The federal Coalition has continued its criticism of the Labor government’s recent announcement that it will require travellers from China to return negative Covid tests, with the Coalition health spokesperson, Anne Ruston, saying the government ignoring advice from the chief medical officer “undermines the trust Australians have” in government advice. • The Nationals’ Darren Chester has defended his party’s decision to oppose the Indigenous voice to parliament before campaigning has even begun. • Surf Life Saving NSW is urging beachgoers to ensure they only swim at patrolled beaches, after the state recorded three drownings in a week – all at unpatrolled beaches. Lifesavers say they have performed more than 1,200 rescues already this summer. • Eight zones have been established along the Murray River in South Australia to progressively lift restrictions on river activities as flood waters in that state recede. • The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is continuing its investigation into the fatal helicopter accident on Monday that left four people dead and severely injured three more. Aviation experts have speculated that the number and frequency of joy flights may factor into the investigation. Thanks for your company today.

Man charged with murder after body of escaped prisoner found outside Hobart home A young man has been charged with murder a day after the body of an escaped prisoner was found outside a Hobart home, AAP reports. Police were called to the house in the northern suburb of Granton about 1.30am on Tuesday following reports of a gunshot. Officers discovered the body of Nicholas Aaron Scott, 26, who had allegedly escaped custody several hours earlier while being treated at Royal Hobart hospital. Tasmania police on Wednesday charged the 20-year-old Granton man Brock Callum Davey with murder. He remained in custody after his matter was briefly mentioned in Hobart magistrates court. Davey did not enter a plea and was scheduled to next appear in court on 20 January. A 20-year-old man who was found inside the house with head injuries had helped police with inquiries, Det Insp Troy Morrisby said on Tuesday. A police investigation into how Scott allegedly escaped was ongoing while the Tasmanian prison service was conducting its own probe. Police have said Scott borrowed a phone from an unwitting member of the public at a restaurant after leaving the hospital. Four people have died after a car and a ute collided in Pine Lodge near the Victorian rural city of Shepparton. A Victoria police spokesperson said emergency services were called to Pine Lodge North Road, near Cosgrove-Lemnos Road, about 4.45pm. Five people were in the car, which ended up in a nearby paddock, and four of them died at the scene. The driver of the vehicle has been airlifted in a serious condition. The driver of the ute was not seriously injured and stopped to help. The exact cause of the collision is under investigation and detectives from the major collision investigation unit are on their way. Police are calling on anyone who witnessed the collision, has dashcam footage or other related information to contact Crime Stoppers. Severe weather warning for damaging winds and intense rain for Kimberley Here’s the Bureau of Meteorology’s update about the expected track of ex-tropical cyclone Ellie, which has been hovering over the Kimberley. It’s expected to move slowly around its current location over the next 18 hours before moving to the south-east on Thursday. Severe weather warnings for damaging winds and intense rainfall are still in place, as well as the flooding. Helicopter joyrides likely to be examined after Gold Coast crash Investigators will likely examine the number of helicopter joyrides operating at Sea World after a mid-air collision killed four people, an expert says. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is investigating the cause of the crash which occurred when one helicopter was landing and the other had taken off at the Gold Coast theme park on Monday afternoon. The pilot Ashley Jenkinson, Sydney woman Vanessa Tadros and British couple Diane and Ron Hughes died in the crash. Tadros’s 10-year-old son, Nicholas, remains in hospital along with the Geelong woman Winnie de Silva, 33, and her nine-year-old son. Across Australia’s tourism sector, the aviation expert Neil Hansford said reduced flying during the Covid pandemic has increased the commercial imperatives for quick flights. He said this has put immense pressure on pilots who need to complete flights around major tourism landmarks in blocks of five or 10 minutes. Read the full story here: Coalition calls on government to explain new Covid rules for China arrivals The Coalition is amping up the pressure for the government to better explain the Covid testing rules for Chinese arrivals, claiming Labor has “flip-flopped” on the decision. The shadow foreign affairs spokesman, Simon Birmingham, speaking on 2GB radio, claimed the government needed to explain why the rules had been brought in just days after the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said they weren’t needed. Most members of federal parliament are on a break in this first week of January (indeed, Birmingham said in the interview that he himself was on holidays and was calling in on his way to a brewery for lunch with his family), but the Coalition has criticised the health minister, Mark Butler, for not further explaining the changes. Birmingham, the former trade minister, turned up the heat on the prime minister, Anthony Albanese: The Albanese government has acted against the advice of the chief medical officer here and that’s why it is so perplexing and concerning that Anthony Albanese doesn’t seem to be fronting the cameras or hitting the airwaves himself to explain why they’ve ignored the advice of the chief medical officer. Albanese today posted an Instagram story of his dog, Toto, sitting on a beach. The photo was captioned “summer”. Birmingham said: Why it is that they have flip-flopped in their position over the course of the last week or so, and just what the actual rationale for it is, because the story just seems to keep changing. Finally, WA’s emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, says there will be disaster relief funding available for pastoralists and other businesses that have received damages. He does not give details on how that will roll out, but I expect those details will emerge in the coming days. More on that point below: if you’re not familiar with how the wet season works in the far north, roads frequently become impassable in the summer months and communities are partly or totally isolated for periods as there is regularly a lot of rain in that part of the country at this time of year. This flooding event, though, is unprecedented – the water level is extraordinarily high, and the inundation is well beyond usual wet-season levels. ADF to help get food and essential supplies to stranded WA communities We’re hearing from the emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, again. He says part of the reason they’ve asked for ADF assistance is to help get food and other essential supplies into stranded communities. In the smaller Aboriginal communities, restocking started in December, because for many of those communities they are cut off at this time of year anyway … obviously the weather we’re seeing is different to what we’d see normally, so there are plans in place to replenish food stocks [and medicines etc]. Fitzroy River sees extraordinary amount of water, Bureau of Meteorology says Some extraordinary numbers in this press conference: James Ashley from the Bureau of Meteorology says 60,000 cubic metres of water per second is moving down the Fitzroy River – that’s more water than they believe they’ve seen in any river in Australia, ever. Moving down the river in one day “is about what Perth uses, water wise, in 20 years”, says Ashley. The risk of the ex-cyclone moving over the ocean and reforming into another cyclone is now unlikely, Ashley says: The really unique thing about this system is that it’s hovered so long over a similar area. It came into WA last week … not only has it been slow moving but it’s also been well structured and been drawing the moisture from the monsoon in the north and producing heavy rain. Transport routes through the western part of the Kimberley are expected to be cut off soon as flood waters move through there, Ashley says. The weather system is expected to cross into the Northern Territory area over the weekend, when the weather in Broome will start to ease. Before then, though, Broome can expect in excess of 200mm of rain in 24 hours. Kimberley flood event is unprecedented, WA BoM manager says The Fitzroy River at Fitzroy Crossing is currently sitting at 15.75 metres – that’s “six feet” (around 1.82 metres) higher than the previous recorded peak levels. “This really is an unprecedented flood event,” says the WA manager of the Bureau of Meteorology, James Ashley. There are reports of storm damage to homes in Broome, Klemm says. He says arrangements are being made for people in the Kimberley region who need dialysis to be transported to Broome. Broome itself, though, is experiencing heavy rain and severe weather too. Klemm says listening to local ABC radio and following official Facebook pages is the best way to stay up to date with official and verified information. Authorities are asking anyone who had plans to travel into the Kimberley region to postpone those plans: basically, don’t go there. The fire and emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, says the flooding event is “far from over” and will affect the area for the days and weeks to come: This continues to be a very dangerous and fast-changing situation, and more rain is expected over the coming days. He also urges people not to rely on social media for information, but to seek out and rely on official sources. Klemm says flood warnings and messages have been translated into local Kriol to assist the Aboriginal communities in the region. We will continue to undertake rescues where possible but people need to understand that this will take time. The Fitzroy Crossing evacuation centre is near capacity, and there are plans to open another one. WA floods press conference: 39 requests for help so far, minister says We’re now hearing from authorities in Western Australia about the record-breaking flooding situation in the Kimberley region, which has left communities isolated and the Fitzroy River completely impassable. The emergency services minister, Stephen Dawson, is speaking. He says there have been 39 requests for assistance so far from people in the region. Three Australian defence force aircraft have been deployed to assist, two of which will arrive tomorrow. Fitzroy Crossing is completely isolated now and can only be accessed by helicopter; the flooding levels have also broken the previous record – set in the 90s. Australia ‘decades’ behind in phasing out cage eggs, advocates say Animal welfare activists have called on Australia to bring forward its ban on cage eggs after battery cages for layer hens became illegal in New Zealand on 1 January. The Australian government last year committed to phasing out battery cages for hens by 2036, a 14-year lead time for a reform that followed seven years of negotiation with the egg industry to update the animal welfare standards and guidelines for poultry. New Zealand announced its 2023 phase-out in 2012. Australia is more than a decade behind similar nations in responding to consumer sentiment and improving chicken welfare, according to Glenys Oogjes of Animals Australia. Europe phased them out in 2012 and that’s about when New Zealand started their phase-out. So we’re not just 10 years behind. We are at least 20 if not 30 years behind in regard to the science and the ethics. Read the full story here: Press conference on WA floods to be held shortly We’re expecting a press conference shortly out of Western Australia, with an update on the Kimberley floods. I’ll bring you the details when we get them.

La Niña lingers in the Pacific but an El Niño might be lurking too As we mentioned earlier, Australia’s big wet might make way for the big dry if the models pointing to a possible El Niño forming in the Pacific in 2023 are accurate. The Bureau of Meteorology has filled in more of the blanks with its fortnightly update of the main climate drivers for Australia. The La Niña is still hanging on but it may not be too long before the Pacific returns to more neutral conditions. La Niñas typically have the usual easterly equatorial winds strengthening. Rain is more likely than normal in Australia’s north and east, and after three La Niña events in a row we would rather not have more floods, thank you very much. Looking ahead, there is the prospect of an El Niño developing in the Pacific later in the year, as BoM’s own model shows: Meteorologists, though, will caution not to read too much in the prospects just yet. For one thing, an autumnal productivity gap needs to be cleared. We’ll have a clearer view in the next few months. Stay tuned.

In a statement to Nine News, the company’s owner, Ray Itaoui, said the shift to digital platforms for music and film meant continuing with physical stores was “impossible”: With our customers shifting to digital for their visual and music content consumption, and with diminishing physical content available to sell to our customer, it has made it impossible to continue with our physical stores. Our online business – sanity.com.au – will continue to operate, and will service the many loyal customers the brand has continued to be dedicated to over the decades. Our priority right now is to ensure each of our team members knows exactly what this means for their career and employment future. Sanity had its origins in a single store called Jetts, in the Melbourne suburb of Pakenham, in 1980, which sold vinyl and cassettes. It rebranded and expanded as Sanity in 1992. Itaoui bought the business 13 years ago. He said in his statement that all physical stores would be closed by the end of April. There are some pictures circulating on various NSW local Facebook pages of reportedly very large hailstones, between golf and tennis-ball sized, in the Lithgow area. Another Twitter outage hits Australian users Here’s my excellent colleague Josh Taylor on the recent apparent Twitter outage for Australian and New Zealand users, who reported difficulty accessing the social media site for several hours on Wednesday – its second outage in the past few weeks. The website Downdetector received thousands of reports from about 7am AEST on Wednesday saying that load times for the site were slow, they were given error messages, or they were unable to access it entirely. “Feed has a 50-50 chance of not loading and timing out,” one user posted.

This time it’s a video from Graeme McCrabb of the Darling River at Yampoola Creek, courtesy Sarah McConnell at the ABC. Severe thunderstorm warning for parts of south-east Queensland There are also severe thunderstorm warnings in place for parts of south-east Queensland. Damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall are forecast for parts of Maranoa and Warrego, Darling Downs and the Granite Belt and Southeast Coast forecast districts. There’s also a severe thunderstorm crossing the Queensland/NSW border into parts of the Scenic Rim council area. Please check out all the details on the BoM website and follow any safety advice for your area. Australian company launches ‘satellite stack’ into space to help track aircraft An Australian company established as a spinoff from UNSW Canberra has launched a “satellite stack” into space, and says it’s the biggest payload (meaning space cargo) Australia has ever launched. Skykraft says the 300kg payload weighs more than all other Australian-built space objects put together. The satellites were on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida overnight. They will form part of a constellation of satellites to help track aircraft. The Skykraft chief executive officer, Dr Michael Frater, said: We rely on air traffic control to avoid mid-air collisions, even in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. With Skykraft’s service, air traffic controllers will be able to see the aircraft at all times and talk directly with the pilot anywhere in the world. There’s a big storm coming in New South Wales – the Bureau of Meteorology has issued a warning for damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall for the Grafton, Penrith, Parramatta, Katoomba, Tamworth and Gunnedah areas, among others. All the details are on the BoM website. If you can see this tweet (Twitter has been very buggy today) there’s a map here: Hello folks. Lovely to be back with you again this week, and I’ll be here until early evening.

Thanks for reading. Pilot rescued after small plane crashes in Victoria’s high country AAP is reporting that a pilot has been rescued after crashing his small plane in Victoria’s high country. It comes after earlier reports of the small aircraft crashing into trees in the Mount Buffalo area after it took off from Porepunkah, near Bright in the state’s north-east, about 4.40am on Wednesday. The male pilot, who is believed to be the sole occupant and aged in his 50s, suffered upper and lower body injuries. He was treated at the scene by paramedics before being flown to Melbourne’s Alfred hospital in a stable condition, Ambulance Victoria said. Four conservation workers are waiting to be rescued from a remote wildlife camp, with canoes at the ready in case they’re forced to flee to higher ground, AAP is reporting. Record flooding in Western Australia’s Kimberley region has forced the evacuation of two sanctuaries run by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy. One mission is complete, with three people choppered off the Charnley River-Artesian Range Wilderness Camp after the power and water systems went out. Four others were airlifted from the Mornington Wilderness Camp on Wednesday, but four more remain after flood waters swamped most of the buildings at the site. It’s hoped those still stuck there can be rescued later in the day but much will depend on the weather generated by ex-tropical cyclone Ellie. The four are safe and dry, sheltering in the highest of the structures that didn’t go under, says Aled Hoggett, the regional operations manager for AWC in the Kimberley. That’s where everybody has been sitting for the last couple of days. Everybody’s safe. They have been dry and sheltered but obviously it’s been a long and anxious wait for them. With the weather conditions the way they are, there’s been no certainty about our ability to evacuate them. The flood waters rose to within 20 metres of the group’s safe haven. The houses are at the base of a ridge of rock. They’ve got canoes to the houses just in case they had to evacuate, and get up on to even higher ground. But fortunately the water only came so high and it has started to recede. Hoggett says the water rose very quickly after more than 350mm of rain was recorded at Diamond Gorge a few days ago. He says it will take some time to determine how the floods have impacted scientific work including an ongoing project to monitor a population of the endangered purple-crowned fairywren. Four of the eight people caught up in the flooding at Mornington were from Monash University, and were there to carry out annual field work. “They monitor the birds, including collecting samples for genetic analysis. At the moment we’re trying to make sure we rescue those samples and don’t lose the work they’ve already done this year,” Hoggett says. “But it will put a significant hole in that continuous dataset. And in terms of science, continuous datasets are precious and we always try to avoid breaks in them.” Pre-flight testing won’t result in additional data on Covid variants, Coalition says The Coalition health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has been somewhat making the rounds today, as the opposition attempts to pin the government on its introduction of entry restrictions for travellers from China. This time, Ruston was speaking to AAP, where she repeated that the government ignoring advice from the chief medical officer “undermines the trust Australians have” in the advice provided by the government: Right the way through the pandemic, Australians have been provided the confidence that the Australian government was responding to the best available advice of Australia’s chief medical experts. Until now. The current arrangements for pre-flight testing will not result in any additional data on new or emerging Covid variants, because the tests will not provide Australia with any genomic sequencing. Small plane crashes in Victoria’s north-east AAP is reporting that a small plane has crashed in Victoria’s high country, sparking a rescue operation. Victoria police say the aircraft took off from Porepunkah, near Bright in the state’s north-east, about 4.40am on Wednesday before crashing into trees in the Mount Buffalo area. Paramedics are treating the plane’s male pilot, who is believed to be the sole occupant, at the scene. His condition is unknown. Government announces $41.5m in grants to improve solar energy performance The Australian Renewable Energy Agency has granted 13 research and development projects around the country $41.5m to improve the performance of solar photovoltaics and boost commercialisation of new technologies. The funding is in addition to $45m to support the University of NSW-based Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics (ACAP) granted by the Albanese government back in June. As with that earlier funding, the work began under the Morrison government. Still, the government has made climate action, particularly in the energy sector, a higher priority since taking office in May. (The issue tended to be an embarrassment to the previous government and so they sometimes avoided publicity about the better things they did to avoid bringing attention to their gaps.) Projects to receive funding include research into screen printing of industrial solar cells at the terawatt scale, and the use of robotics to roll out and maintain solar fields. “Renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy, and it’s getting cheaper,” the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said in a statement: Australia has been a world leader on solar PV research for decades. The same universities that blazed the solar PV trail will step up again to help get utility-scale technology off the ground and help transform Australia into a renewable energy superpower. The UNSW, Australian National University and University of Sydney will share in the funding. Renate Egan, who heads the ACAP work at UNSW, said the latest grant had been in the works for about 12 months. Among the recipients will be Martin Green, a UNSW professor who has been a global pioneer in developing more efficient solar panels. About half of the $41.5m will go to improving panel efficiency and the rest on commercialisation efforts, Egan said. Arena’s target is to boost panel efficiency in converting solar energy to electrons from about 24% now for commercial panels to 30% by 2030. Price per watt of capacity would also drop from about 50-60 cents to 30 cents by then, Egan said, referring to the 30/30/30 goal. Given the quickening (but not yet quick enough) global race to decarbonise, we might expect more government assistance in this industry. Watch this space, as they say. Beachgoers urged to swim at patrolled beaches after three drownings in NSW The Surf Life Saving NSW CEO, Steve Pearce, is urging beachgoers to ensure they only swim at patrolled beaches, after the state recorded three drownings in a week. Pearce told ABC News that lifesavers had performed “over 1,200 rescues” during the summer, and that “every beach is overwhelmed and overrun”, adding that all of the drownings had occurred at unpatrolled beaches: This is the first true, hot Australian summer we’ve seen since 2019, and since those bushfires. Since then we had the Covid lockdowns and the floods, and big heavy rain. So we’ve seen a mass inundation of people coming down to the coastline, and every beach is just overwhelmed and overrun. And it’s just so important while we’re trying to push this message about swimming at patrolled locations because every drowning that has occurred has happened at an unpatrolled beach. I think it comes down to people trying to find spots that aren’t as crowded, but the issue is, if you’re trying to find a spot that’s uncrowded, essentially, it’s unpatrolled. If you don’t see any red and yellow flags there, essentially we can’t see you to save you. We’re just imploring people, if you’re coming down to the coastline, if you are on holidays, make sure you find a spot where you see our lifesavers, because we’ve seen so many tragic drownings already this summer. Our lifesavers have performed over 1,200 rescues, they’ve conducted so many CPRs and successful resuscitations as well. South Australia sets up eight zones along Murray River to progressively lift flood restrictions Eight zones have been established along the Murray River in South Australia to progressively lift restrictions on river activities as flood waters recede, AAP reports. Recreational activities, including fishing and swimming, were banned along the river late last year amid safety concerns as water levels rose to heights not seen for more than half a century. The peak has now passed Renmark and other Riverland towns but is yet to reach communities downstream, including Mannum, east of Adelaide. The premier, Peter Malinauskas, said it made sense to treat the various parts of the river differently as the flood waters moved through the system. Restrictions are never an easy thing to apply. It hurts some businesses, it makes life inconvenient for some communities. But naturally when we’ve got a huge volume of water coming down the river at a record pace, that provides dangers as does the amount of debris. By having these eight zones, we’re acknowledging the fact that what is occurring in the Riverland is very different to what’s occurring in Murray Bridge. The police commissioner, Grant Stevens, said work was under way to develop a set of principles to guide the lifting of restrictions across the river zones. Stevens said officials hoped to lift restrictions as soon as possible but it was too early to tell when they would start to be eased. The flooding in SA has so far impacted about 3,400 properties, including nearly 400 primary residences. It has also closed 119 roads across river communities with nine ferries shut down. The Murray is expected to peak at Waikerie and Morgan this weekend and at Blanchetown, Swan Reach and Mannum by 13 January. Frequency of joy flights may be a factor in fatal Gold Coast helicopter collision, experts say Aviation experts have speculated that the number and frequency of joy flights may factor into the investigation into the fatal helicopter collision on the Gold Coast. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is continuing its investigation into the accident that left four people dead and severely injured three more. Aviation expert Neil Hansford told the ABC that the number of joy flights being carried out may come under scrutiny in the investigation: That’s a lot of movements if you’re doing a five-minute or even 10-minute land, get the people off, get the people on and go again. That’s a fairly stressful environment. I think it’s the business model that’s existed for years and, with good pilot management, we haven’t had an accident. Helicopter joy flights are, in themselves, absolutely safe. But there will be a complete rethink, I would think, by Queensland Maritime, Queensland Police, but most importantly, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Ticket racket warning ahead of Australian Open AAP is reporting that tennis and concert goers have been urged to do their research to avoid ticket scalpers ahead of the Australian Open and major concerts. Consumer Affairs Victoria fielded more than 1,100 reports about event ticketing and resales in the 2021-22 financial year, prompting warnings from authorities to be vigilant. “I urge everyone to do their research to ensure resale sites are legitimate before purchasing tickets and avoid the pain of missing out on an event you’ve been looking forward to,” the consumer affairs minister, Danny Pearson, said. All event organisers and ticketing agencies should have contingency plans and understand their obligations if things don’t go as expected. Victoria was Australia’s “events capital” and no one should miss out on live sport and music because of a scammer, Pearson said. The Australian Open begins in Melbourne on 16 January. Victorian laws prohibit ticket resellers from reselling tickets at more than 10% above their original face value. The federal health department has clarified that Moderna’s Covid jab is still “widely available” in Australia, clearing up a statement on its website which was misinterpreted by vaccine sceptics to claim the rollout had been shelved. Australia is now administering the upgraded bivalent Moderna vaccine for adults, with the department saying the original Moderna vaccine is no longer being manufactured or delivered to clinics. That upgraded vaccine, which targets both the original Covid strain and the Omicron variant, is available for all adults over 18 as a booster dose. However, a statement on the health department’s website for vaccine bookings caused some confusion in recent weeks, after it noted that “the ‘Moderna (6-11 years)’ and ‘Moderna (12 years +)’ vaccine types will no longer be available in Australia from mid-December 2022”. The note was quoted by numerous Covid sceptic accounts on social media over the holiday period to claim the Moderna rollout had ceased. But the same website also notes that the “Moderna (6 months to 5 years)” and “Moderna bivalent (18+ booster)” were still available. The health department clarified to Guardian Australia that the note about the Moderna types no longer being available referred specifically to the original vaccines only, which are being replaced in the stockpile by the bivalent vaccines. “The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine continues to be widely available across Australia,” they told Guardian Australia. “The Australian government advises that the Moderna (original) Covid-19 vaccine is no longer being manufactured. This vaccine is being replaced by increased production and availability of the Moderna bivalent Covid-19 vaccine,” they said. The spokesperson said the last deliveries of the original vaccine to administration sites occurred in late November. “Based on shelf-life, the Moderna (ancestral, or original) vaccine is no longer available for routine administration in Australia,” they said. Darren Chester defends Nationals’ decision to oppose voice to parliament The Nationals’ Darren Chester has defended his party’s decision to oppose the voice to parliament before campaigning has even begun. Chester, who has been moved to become opposition spokesperson on regional education, regional development and local government and territories, told ABC News he supported constitutional recognition but was opposed to enshrining the voice into the constitution. There is nothing stopping the prime minister from coming to the parliament in the first week next year and legislating for such an organisation. But once you move to enshrine it in the constitution, you’re saying for all times, in the content of constitutional Australia, our founding document, that this body has to exist, and I have a problem with that. Defence personnel have been called in to help evacuate people isolated during “once-in-a-century” flooding hitting a remote town in Western Australia’s Kimberley region, according to AAP. Homes have been inundated by flood water in Fitzroy Crossing – home to about 1,200 people – and the Great Northern Highway is cut in both directions as some residents are airlifted 400km to Broome by helicopter. The fast-flowing waters also washed away part of a major bridge as the region is swamped in record flooding of the Fitzroy River. Authorities warned the Fitzroy River level was still rising early this morning ahead of a possible peak of 15.7 metres, smashing previous records for Fitzroy Crossing. Federal emergency services minister Murray Watt said the Albanese government had approved a WA request for Australian defence force aircraft and personnel to help evacuate residents from Fitzroy Crossing and nearby areas. Downstream at Noonkanbah, major flooding is also likely. Fire and emergency services commissioner Darren Klemm warned residents in the communities of Willare and Noonkanbah on Tuesday they would be inundated in the next 24 to 48 hours. People in those areas need to get to higher ground. He said roads had been cut and it was too late to leave as the region faced “at least a one-in-100-year” flood event. The rain is coming from ex-tropical cyclone Ellie, which has dumped between 200mm and 600mm since Saturday and is predicted to deliver further widespread heavy falls into the week. The weather system has been moving slowly towards the coast and was located immediately east of Broome this morning, lashing the region with strong winds and intense downpours. An evacuation order remains in place for properties expected to be impacted by flooding. Twitter uses still struggling to access site Twitter users in Australia and New Zealand have reported difficulties accessing the social media site for the past two hours or so. In addition to people who managed to tweet about their problems in accessing the site, website Downdetector suggests it has received thousands of reports from people in Australia about the site’s sluggishness. It’s not clear what the cause may be and when it might be resolved. Since Elon Musk took over the platform last year, Twitter no longer has a communications department, let alone Australian representatives to ask about the issue. This week the company was reportedly sued for failing to pay rent on its San Francisco headquarters amid reports the company had ceased paying rent on its offices globally. Ruston calls China travel decision a ‘breach of faith’ with Australian public Opposition health spokesperson Anne Ruston has doubled down on comments issued yesterday, demanding that the government explain why it ignored advice from the chief medical officer on entry restrictions for travellers from China. Ruston was on Sky News and said it was a “breach of faith” in not taking the advice while continuing to “learn to live with Covid”: This government made a commitment to the Australian public that we were going to learn to live with Covid. A decision that has been based without any medical advice or medical necessity shows we aren’t really pursuing that. It’s a breach of faith with the Australian public about that commitment to say we were going to get on with our lives. Indexed increase of income support payments on 1 January ‘simply not enough’ The Australian Council of Social Service is calling for the Albanese government to increase income support payments, saying routine indexation is “simply not enough”. In a statement, Acoss CEO Cassandra Goldie said the routine indexation of payments on 1 January were not enough, adding that as rents and the cost of living continue to rise, the government needs to support those on the payments and not leave them at below-poverty levels: The routine indexation of payments on January 1 does not deliver the real increase that so many people desperately need. Income support payments were woefully inadequate before the prices of food, rent, medicines, energy and other essentials sky-rocketed and they will still be totally insufficient after indexation. Youth Allowance and Austudy payments are only indexed once a year and are even lower than other income supports. Even with 6.1 per cent indexation, Youth Allowance will increase by $16.20 per week to $281.40 for a single person living away from home. That’s just $40.20 a day. There are more than three million people living in poverty in Australia and this Christmas one in five of us were struggling to afford food. People battling floods in South Australia and now the Kimberley in Western Australia will be among those glad to see a shift back to more typical rainfall patterns. As it happens, that sort of shift in climate influences looks to be under way, particularly as the La Niña in the Pacific continues to weaken. We looked at the outlook in this piece, with early signs of a possible El Niño to develop this year: We’ll get a more formal update from the Bureau of Meteorology later today but we probably won’t know for sure about an El Niño for a couple of months yet. Still, should we get such an event, we can expect conditions in eastern Australia at least becoming relatively dry, with heatwaves (and bushfires) more of a risk. In the meantime, it looks as though the Kimberley has a lot more rain to fall in the next couple of days, so those communities are likely to be on edge for a while yet. Returning to the Gold Coast, the father of the 10-year-old boy fighting for his life in hospital has taken to social media to say his son Nicholas “needs all the prayers he can get”. Simon Tadros was watching when his 36-year-old wife Vanessa Tadros was killed in a helicopter collision on Monday. Tributes have poured on to social media for the four people who lost their lives in the accident, with Tadros saying: I ask everyone to pray for the little man. He is on life support in a critical condition. May God pull him back with me and make a good recovery. He is in an induced coma on a life support machine to help him breath[e]. He is in a very serious and critical state. I’m asking for all your prayers to bring my little man back to me. An online fundraiser has been set up by family friend Rochelle Fajloun, with Vanessa Tadros described as a loved mother and friend: We are praying for a miracle that our Nicky, (as he is playfully known) can be brought back to his grief-stricken father Simon. If by God’s grace Nicky survives his catastrophic injuries, he will have an intense and protracted recovery period. Simon distressingly witnessed the accident unfold and is totally shattered. The Bureau of Meteorology has maintained its severe weather warning for northern Western Australia, as ex-tropical cyclone Ellie continues to batter the region. The storm is expected to slowly track west to be centred just east of Broome sometime this morning, with the bureau forecasting heavy rainfall for Broome, Roebuck Plains and the Dampier Peninsula from Tuesday to Thursday. Daily rainfall of 100mm to 200mm with isolated falls of 250mm and very isolated falls of 300mm are possible. A major flood warning for the Fitzroy River has been maintained overnight, with major flooding at Noonkanbah this morning. Record major flooding is occurring at Fitzroy Crossing, with river levels still rising and with further rises expected later in the week. AMA calls for coherent strategy in place of ‘political responses’ AAP is reporting that the head of the Australian Medical Association, Prof Steve Robson, is calling for a genuine strategy rather than a “series of political responses” being needed to address the Covid outbreak in China. Despite chief medical officer Paul Kelly advising that imposing restrictions on travellers from China, or any other country, at this time was “unnecessary and inconsistent with Australia’s Covid-19 management”, health minister Mark Butler imposed the testing measure. Butler has defended the decision, saying he was acting with “an abundance of caution”. Multiple countries around the world including the US, UK and European nations have already imposed the same restriction. Robson said it was another example of why a far-reaching plan would hold the country in good stead: We really would love to see a comprehensive strategy about how to deal with the Covid situation in the northern hemisphere, at a time when there’s a huge amount of travel going on and almost no mitigations rather than what would look to people like a series of political responses. We want to see a comprehensive strategy that’s informed by public health practice, to just say, ‘What needs to be done to protect Australians at this vulnerable time?’ Acknowledging Australians were going into their fourth year of Covid, Robson said while he understood the fatigue people were feeling, more people would die unless fundamental principles were adopted: We’ve just literally come out of the most lethal year of the pandemic by a long shot … We want to see a strategy that’s evidence-based, nimble … and based on good public health principles. We haven’t really heard anything from the government except a plan that really seems cobbled together … it’s time for this cobbling to stop and coherence to start. ‘Countries will make their own decisions about travel arrangements’ The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has commented on China’s apparent threat to impose counter-measures if countries pursue excessive or discriminatory Covid travel policies. Chalmers said he would not “pre-empt or guess” what counter-measures China might take but indicated Australia would make its own decisions about measures like the pre-flight travel tests. Chalmers told Radio National: I think countries will make their own decisions about travel arrangements and how they manage covid more broadly. We’ve been pretty clear we’ve taken this decision out of an abundance of caution. Now, I don’t think it’s an especially onerous requirement, to be frank. And it’s consistent with the steps being taken in other countries. Asked about whether the imposition of pre-flight testing was part of an internationally coordinated move to pressure China to release more information, Chalmers did not exactly deny it: I don’t see it precisely like that, but there certainly is a lot of concern around the global health community ... around the transparency and quality of data we see out of China on Covid. China hits back against entry restrictions Last night Chinese authorities warned that there could be retaliatory measures after the Australian government introduced entry restrictions on travellers from China. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a briefing last night that the restrictions being introduced by various countries lacks “scientific basis”: Some countries adopt entry restriction measures only targeting China, which lacks a scientific basis. We firmly oppose the practice of manipulating epidemic prevention and control measures to achieve political goals, and will take corresponding measures according to the principle of reciprocity according to different situations. New strains can emerge anywhere, so there is no need for special entry restrictions on China. China always believes that the epidemic prevention measures of various countries should be scientific and appropriate, and should not take the opportunity to engage in political manipulation, discriminatory practices, and normal personnel exchanges, exchanges and co-operation should not be affected. Australian officials have reiterated multiple times that the lack of detail surrounding the outbreak in China has led to the concerns behind the entry restrictions. You can read more on these comments at the story below: It appears Twitter is down – in Australia at the least – with two websites that track the status of websites, Down for Me and Downdetector, reporting problems. Down for Me says Twitter has been down for approximately 23 minutes, while Down Detector is reporting a spike in user-reported problems in the last 24 hours. The website is not working for me, with tweets not showing and only an error message on screen. We will keep you updated on how this develops. Two Nationals appointed to shadow ministry The Coalition has announced the appointment of two Nationals – Darren Chester and Anne Webster – to the shadow ministry to take the roles vacated when MP Andrew Gee quit to become an independent. Gee resigned in December, citing the Nationals’ opposition to the Indigenous voice to parliament. The Liberal leader, Peter Dutton, and Nationals leader, David Littleproud, revealed Chester would take on the shadow regional education, development, local government and territories portfolios. Webster will become assistant shadow minister for health. Dutton said: These new appointments will strengthen the Coalition’s representation of regional Australia and I look forward to continuing to work with Mr Chester and Dr Webster as they carry out their new roles. I thank my Coalition team for their hard work and their unity in holding the government to account. I can assure all Australians that the Coalition will continue to focus on delivering positive plans and policies for the future of our country in 2023 and in the lead-up to the next election. Chester is a moderate National who has served as minister for infrastructure and veterans affairs but had a torrid time in government, in and out of cabinet three times from 2016 to 2021, a victim of power struggles with former leader Barnaby Joyce. Webster was elected in 2019 and has served as shadow assistant minister for regional development since June. Chalmers defends entry restrictions on visitors from China Federal treasurer Jim Chalmers is on RN Breakfast this morning, responding to some of the criticism raised of the government’s decision to introduce entry restrictions on travellers from China. Chalmers repeats yesterday’s line that he doesn’t think the measures are “especially onerous”, regardless of the pressures on the Chinese health system (RAT tests need to be ratified by a health professional under these measures). He is also asked about potential countermeasures but says managing Australia’s relationship with China is a “complex task”: I think countries will make their own decisions about travel arrangements and how they manage Covid. More broadly, we’ve been pretty clear we’ve taken this decision out of an abundance of caution. I don’t think it’s an especially onerous requirement, to be frank, and it’s consistent with the steps being taken in other countries. We’ve said for some time that we think it’s in Australia’s national interest interest to stabilise that relationship. There have been some welcomed developments on that front but we’re realistic about it too. You know, managing the relationship with China is a complex task. It’s a difficult task. Nobody pretends it’s easy. There will be bumps along the road. But our objective remains pretty clear and consistent. But there certainly is a lot of concern around the global health community and the global economy, about the transparency and quality of data that we see out of China on Covid. I think that’s very clear. If you look at what the World Health Organization has been saying about the sorts of steps that people have countries have been taking to manage travellers out of that part of the world, they said that these kinds of steps are understandable and that’s because they have a concern. We share that concern about the quality and transparency of the data. We do need to make sure that we’ve got the best possible surveillance of strains as they emerge, but also waves as they emerge and become more difficult to manage. And so that’s really one of the key considerations here as we put these responsible restrictions in place. Good morning, and happy first Wednesday of the year. Mostafa Rachwani with you, to take you through the day’s news. We begin on the Gold Coast once again, where two boys are fighting for their lives after the fatal helicopter collision this week. Four other people remain in hospital as investigators continue to look into the crash. Ten-year-old Nicholas Tadros and nine-year-old Leon De Silva, from Geelong, were both in a critical condition in hospital overnight, while Leon’s mother, Winnie De Silva, was in a serious condition. Historic flood waters have hit Western Australia’s Kimberley region, with the Fitzroy River forecast to hit record levels and Fitzroy Crossing residents warned to find higher ground as homes were inundated and the Great Northern Highway cut. WA emergency services minister Stephen Dawson told reporters that the situation was “dangerous and fast-changing”: We have not seen rain like this for at least a hundred years so it’s kind of shocking to see the water as high as it is. We will bring you more on both situations as news emerges, as well as everything else happening around the country.

Morrison hailed Tuesday’s plan as a “practical way” to neutralise Australia’s emissions by 2050 but the plan showed almost a third of the abatement task is comprised of cuts via unspecified “technology breakthroughs” and “global trends” while a further 20% will be achieved through offsets. New energy department projections suggest Australia could reduce emissions by 30-35% by 2030 but following internal resistance from members of the National party – who are in a coalition with the conservative Liberal party – the federal government won’t change its formal 2030 target of a 26-28% cut compared to 2005 levels which was set in 2015. Australia’s emissions are among the highest in the world on a per capita basis and the country has long trailed behind similar developed countries in pledging to reduce emissions. The government has refused to release modelling underpinning the 2050 plan and is keeping details of the package – promised to secure Nationals support for the mid-century target – secret. The plan – which Morrison promoted as “the Australian way” – is underpinned by an updated technology roadmap that prioritises investment in clean hydrogen, energy storage, low emissions steel and aluminium and carbon capture and storage. It also adds ultra-low cost solar as a new priority. The overall investment totals $20bn, the government said. The Coalition claims this will unlock between $60bn and $100bn of additional investment from the private sector and the states – an upgrade to the $50bn forecast last year – and create 62,000 new regional mining and heavy industry jobs. As a result, gross national income will be 1.6% higher, and Australians would be nearly $2,000 better off on average in 2050 compared to a scenario where no action was taken. Modelling underpinning the projections would be released “eventually”, Morrison said. The prime minister also emphasised that the “technology not taxes” plan was based on existing government programs and would not require any new legislation, despite calls from Labor and independent MPs to enshrine the target in law. The focus of the plan was on bringing down the relative cost of low emissions technologies, which would result in an “accelerating deployment at scale across the economy”. Hydrogen, for example, has a production cost target of less than $2 a kilogram. “Our plan works with Australians to achieve this goal. Our plan enables them, it doesn’t legislate, it doesn’t mandate, it doesn’t force them. It respects them and understands that Australians want to do this … they want to protect their industries,” the prime minister said. The policy was based on “choices not mandates”, he said. Morrison conceded that at least 15% of the abatement task was based on “technology breakthroughs” in the future, saying this had been the experience of the modern world and no one could predict advances over the next 30 years. “The rate of technological advance is a given, it is actually a given in the modern world,” Morrison said. “To not think that is going to play a role over the next 30 years, that would be the more surprising assumption.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the 15% attributed to “established global technology trends” included technology such as low emissions cement and feed supplements that were in the “early days” of development. “This is not technologies we don’t necessarily know about. It may well be technologies that we know quite a lot about, but have not yet gotten to the point where we can make priority technologies,” Taylor said. Morrison said the additional 15% earmarked as coming from future “breakthroughs” would come from the “evolution and the momentum” of earlier technology developments. “That is what has happened time immemorial. That is probably one of the safest assumptions you can make, that the rapid escalation of technology will continue to drive these costs down.” A breakdown of the emissions reduction forecasts shows that the electricity sector will reduce its emissions by 96% by 2050, signalling the withdrawal of coal from the sector. Taylor said gas would still play a role in Australia’s electricity generation mix. The transport sector would achieve a 79% cut in emissions supported by battery charging and hydrogen refuelling stations as “enabling” infrastructure. Emissions from mining, industry and manufacturing would drop 54%, while in agriculture, the forecast is for a 40% cut. Labor blasted the proposal as a “scam” that lacked substance and criticised the government for its decision not to release details of the deal struck with the Nationals. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said Morrison had outlined the “vibe” of a climate policy which had no new commitments. “We haven’t seen the modelling, and we haven’t had the detail. Because there is net zero modelling, net zero legislation and net zero unity,” Albanese said. “But in their own words, there is nothing new in this plan. The word plan doesn’t constitute a plan no matter how often he said and what form it’s printed. As always, with this prime minister, it is all about marketing. All about the spend, never about the substance.” The shadow climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the only new element of the climate policy was “a pay rise for Keith Pitt” – in reference to the extra cabinet position secured by the Nationals. “They’ve introduced an emissions trading promotions policy. That’s all we’ve got.” Morrison said the agreement with the Nationals had resulted in the inclusion of a five-yearly review of the net zero target that would be undertaken by the Productivity Commission and a pledge to invest in the regions and to cut red tape. He said any other spending commitments made as part of the deal would be unveiled in the lead-up to the next election. “All of our policies will be announced before the election, in particular, there will be a budget next year,” Morrison said. After abandoning efforts to update Australia’s 2030 emissions target from the 26% to 28% cut on 2005 levels, Morrison announced that the country was on track to achieve an actual reduction of between 30% and 35% on 2005 levels. This was attributed to the rapid take-up of rooftop solar, energy efficiency measures, and changes in land use. In question time on Tuesday, Morrison presented the government’s policy as one that was “based on choices, not mandates on the Australian people”. The deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Barnaby Joyce, went further, saying Labor’s policy was only about legislation. “Legislation brings in laws, and laws outlaw things, and laws enforce penalties, so we do have a clear differentiation, we have a chasm between the two different policies because we believe in inspiration and technology and they believe in laws and penalties.” Albanese is yet to detail Labor’s climate policy after it abandoned a previous target of a 45% reduction by 2030 after the last election. Labor is expected to unveil its new “ambitious” policy after the Glasgow summit, with Bowen saying it would be announced in “the coming weeks”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/aug/11/us-federal-reserve-inflation-interest-rates-ftse-100-gdp-house-prices-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T14:20:31Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson in ‘lower bills’ talks with energy bosses but leaves action to next leader – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/aug/11/us-federal-reserve-inflation-interest-rates-ftse-100-gdp-house-prices-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/aug/11/us-federal-reserve-inflation-interest-rates-ftse-100-gdp-house-prices-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson in ‘lower bills’ talks with energy bosses but leaves action to next leader – as it happened","bodyText":"The UK government is in a tricky situation, with the prospect of genuinely enormous energy price rises for households but no leader able to commit to big policy actions. Boris Johnson, still just about prime minister for another fourish weeks, tried to show he is gripping the issue by unexpectedly turning up at a meeting of energy company bosses on Thursday. However, he told energy bosses that he is leaving any big decisions to his successor, the Treasury said. The government has been careful to keep the option of further taxes on the table for the next prime minister, but it did not express much enthusiasm for more windfall taxes in the meeting, the Guardian’s Alex Lawson reports. An energy industry source briefed on the meeting said: It was a constructive discussion about ways to support customers and accelerate investments in energy security in the UK. It was clear the windfall tax is not a preferred option for anyone – ministers or electricity companies. Zahawi, who is widely expected to be demoted from chancellor by a new leader, said that energy firms agreed to “do more” to help the most vulnerable households with bills, but the Treasury did not provide details of what help that might be, or who it counts as the people who need more help. Johnson also said that he wanted to see more investments from energy companies in renewable energy and biomass, but also added that he wanted firms to do more drilling of oil and gas in the North Sea. Tomorrow we will get a first reading of how badly the UK economy was affected by the energy crisis in the second quarter of 2022, with the Office for National Statistics publishing GDP figures.

Do join me again tomorrow morning for the UK’s second-quarter GDP reading. JJ We have pictures from inside the government’s meeting with energy bosses. All of the photos are focused on outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, so it is unclear which bosses attended in person and which were on a video call. We also know of several other companies who joined the meeting (beyond those mentioned earlier). They were retailer provider Octopus Energy, oil trader Vitol, generator Intergen, renewables investor Greencoat Capital and lobby group Energy UK. On the other side of the Atlantic the US is coping with its own inflationary pressures. The latest data today suggests those pressures might be easing – even if they remain strong. The US producer price index, which measures what goods cost when leaving the factory gate, rose by 9.8% year-on-year in July, according to the US Labor Department. That is a steep increase, but less than the 11.3% recorded in June and the 10.4% that economists had expected, according to a Reuters poll. The monthly figures also showed that the index actually fell by 0.5% month-on-month. Economists had suggested that the index would rise, so that counts as a genuine surprise. Earlier this week the news that consumer prices remained flat in July sparked a relief rally on stock markets as investors entertained the hope that inflation may have peaked. That might mean that central banks do not have to raise interest rates and tip countries into recession, as is still widely expected. But beware: US Federal Reserve officials last night said the battle against inflation is far from over. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he will keep urging the electricity sector to cut bills after meeting energy bosses today. He asked the oil producers present to keep investing in North Sea oil and gas, citing the UK’s energy security. Johnson, chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also stressed the importance of investments in renewables, biomass and nuclear energy. Some of the discussions addressed how to lower energy bills, while Zahawi is understood to have told the meeting that the government was considering measures aimed at the “extraordinary profits” of some parts of the electricity generation sector. In written comments after the meeting, Johnson said: Countries around the world are feeling the impact of Putin’s damaging war in Ukraine. We know that this will be a difficult winter for people across the UK, which is why we are doing everything we can to support them and must continue to do so. Following our meeting today, we will keep urging the electricity sector to continue working on ways we can ease the cost of living pressures and to invest further and faster in British energy security. We are continuing to roll out government support over the coming months, including the second £324 instalment of the cost of living payment for vulnerable households, extra help for pensioners and those with disabilities, and the £400 energy bills discount for all households. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said that energy companies who attended a meeting with him and Prime Minister Boris Johnson today agreed to “do more to help the people who most need it” – but did not detail what that would entail. In a readout from the meeting Zahawi said the companies pledged to work “in the spirit of national unity”. However, Johnson also told the meeting that it will be for his successor to make significant fiscal decisions, again ruling out significant policy action before 5 September. Zahawi said: This morning I hosted industry leaders from the electricity sector to discuss what more they can do to work with Government and act in the interest of the country in the face of rising prices caused by Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. We have already acted to protect households with £400 off energy bills and direct payments of £1,200 for 8m of the most vulnerable British families. In the spirit of national unity, they agreed to work with us to do more to help the people who most need it. There is a notable absence from the list of people at the Downing Street meeting between ministers and energy bosses: big oil. Neither of the UK’s “supermajor” oil and gas companies, BP and Shell, were among the chief executives in attendance. Between them the two FTSE 100 oil producers made profits of $35bn (£29bn) during the first half of the year – much of it thanks to surging oil and gas prices following Vladimir Putin’s order for Russia to invade Ukraine. BP talks about a “cash balance point” for the next few years of around $40 per barrel of Brent crude oil. That means that pretty much everything above that price is gravy. With Brent futures prices recovering to $98 per barrel on Thursday, the profits bonanza starts to be understandable. Both Shell and BP say they need the profits to make genuinely large investments in renewable energy – solar energy provider Lightsource BP is a notable example. Yet shareholder returns of $16bn this year from the two companies have far outweighed spending on zero-emissions energy. BP has committed to spending of $2.5bn this year on net zero-compatible energy. • This post was amended on 12 August 2022. The boss of Lightsource BP did not attend the meeting as previously stated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also joined the meeting of energy company bosses. Johnson had not been expected at the meeting, but was a last-minute addition, it is understood. The prime minister, who will be pushed out of office by 5 September, has been criticised for refusing to act to cut energy costs in recent months. The meeting’s attendees cover a significant proportion of the UK’s electricity generation abilities. They also serve many of Britain’s households with gas. EDF’s generators nuclear power stations generate about a fifth of the UK’s electricity. Centrica’s British Gas is the largest supplier of gas to UK households. Some of the companies have also been among the big beneficiaries of the energy price spike. For instance, Centrica made operating profits of £1.3bn during the first half of 2022 thanks to higher prices for the oil and gas it drills. Others have not fared so well. Gas distributor Uniper required a €15bn (£13bn) bailout from the German government after Russia cut back gas supplies to Europe. France’s EDF Group is suing its own government for €8.3bn (£7bn) after it was forced by Emmanuel Macron’s administration to sell energy to consumers at a loss. The company is being wholly nationalised as part of France’s effort to minimise energy bills. The bosses of some of the UK’s biggest energy companies have started a meeting with the chancellor and business secretary who are expected to pressure them to invest in green energy rather than pay-outs for shareholders. It is understood that attendees of the meeting this morning include Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, and Simone Rossi, the boss of EDF in the UK. The government has the option of increasing taxes on energy companies, after belatedly introducing a windfall tax in response to the surge in energy prices that has driven inflation in the UK to a 40-year high. However, neither chancellor Nadhim Zahawi nor business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng are thought to favour raising taxes further, and government sources briefed last night that the talks will focus on investments and ensuring security of supply. There is a big question mark over whether investments in new projects can have any effect on the energy price increase expected over the winter. The consultancy Cornwall Insight said on Tuesday that it expected the UK’s energy price cap (the annual rate paid by an average household) to reach £4,266 for the first three months of next year. The meeting this morning is also thought to include the bosses of Denmark’s Orsted, Germany’s Eon, RWE and Uniper, and Britain’s Drax and SSE. • This post was amended on 12 August 2022. The boss of Lightsource BP did not attend the meeting as previously stated. There is an arm wrestle ahead over regulation of the City of London. Earlier this week Conservative leadership race frontrunner Liz Truss signalled (in briefings to allies reported by the Financial Times) that she will bring in powers to “call in” financial regulatory decisions if they are too cautious. Rishi Sunak previously said he would do something similar. That means both the candidates to be the next prime minister want to clip the Bank of England’s wings. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has restated his position that government interference in regulatory decisions would be detrimental to the UK. In a letter to the Treasury select committee (from 27 July, so before Truss jumped on the bandwagon) Bailey wrote: Regulatory independence is important, not least because our international standing, and therefore the competitiveness of the UK financial sector which the reforms are aimed at enhancing, depends on it. Anything that would weaken the independence of regulators would undermine the aims of the reforms. File under one to watch. The UK housing industry’s expectations for the year ahead are the most downbeat since the first coronavirus lockdowns began in March 2020, according to a regular poll of chartered surveyors. The balance of respondents believing prices will fall in the next 12 months rose to 36% in July, up from 21% in June, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Enquiries by potential new buyers dropped for the third consecutive month. The surveyors blamed the prospect of higher interest rates and the cost-of-living crisis for the drop in demand: if borrowing is more expensive as the Bank of England battles inflation and people can save less then a fall in demand would not come as a surprise. Yet one of the defining economic themes of the UK’s last decade has been the way that house prices have defied apparent economic gravity. Rics said “house prices continue to rise across the UK”, with a balance of 63% of respondents reporting that prices increased. Tarrant Parsons, Rics’s senior economist said: Amid a backdrop of sharply rising living costs, slowing economic growth and higher interest rates, it is little surprise that housing market activity is now losing some momentum. With monetary policy set to be tightened further over the coming months, sales expectations point to a further softening in transaction volumes going forward. Nevertheless, with respect to house prices, limited supply available is still seen as a crucial factor underpinning the market. Although house price growth is likely to continue to ease, respondents still anticipate prices will be modestly higher than current levels in a year’s time. Another sign that inflationary pressures in the US economy may have peaked: the average price of US retail gasoline fell below $4 per gallon on Thursday. The national average price for regular unleaded petrol fell to $3.990 a gallon on 11 August, according to the American Automobile Association’s price tracker. That is down from $4.68 a month ago, and above $5 in mid-June. Rising petrol prices have been an important part of the inflationary story around the world, as many people outside urban areas cannot avoid filling up their cars. It filters through to the price of almost everything else via businesses. Fuel subsidies have been used in several countries to cushion the inflationary blow, although many economists and analysts say this can be counterproductive, as it encourages people to continue to buy more fuel. And rich households tend to spend more on fuel, so subsidies help them more. A few more interesting points. Firstly, the American Automobile Association’s map of petrol prices is not a bad proxy for a US election map (albeit with the colour scheme swapped): Secondly American petrol prices enjoy a huge implicit subsidy: prices are fundamentally lower than many other parts of the world. $4 per gallon – a pump price level that prompts howls of outrage in the US – equates to about 87p per litre in British money. That is less than half what British drivers pay, according to the RAC. The FTSE 100 leaders this morning are Ladbrokes owner Entain and Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, both of which have given their shareholders positives amid a tricky macro environment. Coca-Cola HBC, one of the biggest owners of a bottling franchise for US-based Coca-Cola, gained 3.6% after it forecast operating profits in 2022 similar to 2021 – even after reporting a €190m (£160m) hit from its Russian business, after it stopped selling Coke products following the invasion of Ukraine. Gambling company Entain said it is buying a Croatia’s SuperSport Group bookmaker in a growth drive, and its profits (otherwise known as customers’ gambling losses) were up 20% on a year earlier. Its share price rose by 2.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Stock markets around the world have rallied after US consumer price index inflation slowed in July. However, Federal Reserve officials have done their best to emphasise that the world’s largest and most influential economy is not out of the woods yet. The relief rally prompted by the slower inflation (which could imply less need for interest rate hikes to slow economic growth) continued in Asia overnight, with the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index gaining 1.5% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng up 2.1%. In Europe the Stoxx 600 index gained 0.4% in the opening minutes of trading, but the FTSE 100 edged down. Investors are trying to balance their hopes that inflationary pressures may be falling with the knowledge that the US Federal Reserve is still committed to increasing interest rates further, potentially triggering a recession. Falling inflation in the US would feed through directly to economies around the world, including the UK, where the Bank of England has already forecast a year-long recession. Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, last night said the slower-than-expected US inflation reading was “welcome” news but did not alter his expectation that the US central bank would need to raise its rates to 3.9% by year-end and to 4.4% by the end of 2023. The rate is currently in the 2.25%-2.5% range. The Fed is “far, far away from declaring victory” on inflation, Kashkari said at the Aspen Ideas Conference, Reuters reported. Another official, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank president Mary Daly, gave the Financial Times a similar message on Wednesday. She said: There’s good news on the month-to-month data that consumers and business are getting some relief, but inflation remains far too high and not near our price stability goal. We will have a further indication of inflationary pressures in the US later today, with the producer price index giving an indication of the prices manufacturers are charging. The agenda 1:30pm BST: US producer price index inflation (July; previous: 11.3%; consensus: 10.4%) 1:30pm BST: US initial jobless claims (week ending 6 August; previous: 260,000; consensus: 263,000)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/mar/26/uk-startup-octopus-energy-becomes-renewable-energy-giant-in-3bn-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-03-26T00:01:28Z","webTitle":"UK startup Octopus Energy becomes renewable energy giant in £3bn deal ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/26/uk-startup-octopus-energy-becomes-renewable-energy-giant-in-3bn-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/mar/26/uk-startup-octopus-energy-becomes-renewable-energy-giant-in-3bn-deal","fields":{"headline":"UK startup Octopus Energy becomes renewable energy giant in £3bn deal ","bodyText":"The UK’s fastest growing energy supplier will soon become one of Europe’s biggest renewable energy investors in a deal worth more than £3bn, which could bring green energy to 50 million homes in six years. Octopus Energy will snap up its sister company Octopus Renewables in a move that will hand the startup a portfolio of about 300 renewable energy projects, across six different countries, enough to power more than 1.2 million homes. The fast-growing energy supplier hopes to grow its international business to create 50 million Octopus Energy customers by 2027, and plans to increase its new renewables division to generate as much clean electricity as it sells. Octopus Energy last year achieved double “unicorn status” – a term used to describe young startup companies worth at least $1bn –after investors valued the company at more than $2bn, just five years after it began supplying gas and electricity. Greg Jackson, the founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy, said the deal would create a business that was “unrivalled on the global stage” by combining the supplier’s unique technology platform with the investment expertise of Octopus Renewables. He said the deal could “change the entire energy lifecycle, make every green electron matter, and deliver the green energy transition faster and cheaper for everyone”. Jackson, who owns a 7.4% stake in Octopus Energy, amassed a paper fortune of an estimated $155m (£115m) after the company’s £2bn valuation last year, making him one of the most successful green energy entrepreneurs in UK corporate history. Chris Hulatt, the co-founder of Octopus Group, which owns both companies, said there was “a huge opportunity” to “unleash pent-up capital that can help deliver the green energy transition faster than anyone ever imagined”. Octopus Renewables was founded 21 years ago and owns a string of wind and solar projects in the UK, including several rooftop solar assets in Manchester and Birmingham and windfarms in South Lanarkshire and Northamptonshire. Earlier this month Nest, the UK’s largest workplace pension scheme, which manages pensions for more than 10 million employees, chose Octopus Renewables to help invest an initial sum of £250m directly into onshore wind and solar energy projects after divesting from fossil fuels. Octopus Energy’s ambition to increase its customer base to 50 million homes globally, includes a plan to reach another 50 million homes through its bespoke software platform which it leases to other suppliers to help run their energy supply businesses. Octopus has struck deals with big utility companies in Australia and Japan to use the “elect-tech” software, which uses bespoke algorithms to make it easier to offer customers “smart” renewable energy tariffs that can integrate home batteries and electric vehicles to make using renewable power cheaper. The technology platform is already used in 17 million homes, including customers of E.ON and Good Energy which lease the technology to run their own businesses. Octopus Energy has also made inroads into the German and US markets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/dec/09/as-the-coalition-and-labor-pretend-australias-ageing-coal-plants-have-a-future-the-figures-dont-add-up","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-09T01:04:31Z","webTitle":"As the Coalition and Labor pretend Australia’s ageing coal plants have a future, the figures don’t add up | Temperature check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/09/as-the-coalition-and-labor-pretend-australias-ageing-coal-plants-have-a-future-the-figures-dont-add-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/dec/09/as-the-coalition-and-labor-pretend-australias-ageing-coal-plants-have-a-future-the-figures-dont-add-up","fields":{"headline":"Coalition and Labor claim Australia’s ageing coal plants won’t close early, but the figures don’t add up","bodyText":"Just how much coal-fired power will Australia have left running in 2030? It has become a sensitive question for the country’s major political parties ahead of next year’s election. Both parties have recently released data that suggests under their leadership the country’s shift towards a clean electricity grid would accelerate dramatically over the next nine years. But both claim there will not be an accelerated closure of Australia’s ageing coal plants that currently provide the bulk of the power. It is an implausible argument given the scale of the shift under way. Over the past year about 31% of electricity in the national electricity market (covering the five eastern states and the ACT) has come from renewable energy. The proportion has doubled in just four years, but coal still dominates, providing 63% of electricity. Gas-fired power contributes 6%. The Morrison government has not touted the figure, but official federal data suggests the proportion of renewable energy will hit 69% by 2030 if we continue on our current course. Anthony Albanese says a Labor government would build on this by introducing a $20bn “re-wiring the nation” policy to connect solar and wind farms and batteries in renewable energy zones to the grid sooner than planned. Modelling of the ALP plan by the research firm RepuTex suggests that by 2030 the grid would run on 82% renewable electricity, leaving less than 20% coming from coal and gas combined. In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, the Coalition expects a 55% cut from electricity generation by 2030 compared with 2005 levels on the current path. Labor’s modelling implies a 74% cut from electricity over the same timeframe under its plan. But in both cases the emissions reduction from the electricity sector is much bigger than that planned across the economy. Labor has set a 43% target – a notable improvement, but still less than what scientists say is necessary for Australia to play its part in living up to the Glasgow climate pact – while the Coalition has not increased the 26%-28% goal it set under Tony Abbott more than six years ago. Chris Bowen, Labor’s climate change and energy shadow minister, has been emphatic that the ALP plan would not lead to coal-fired power plants shutting earlier than scheduled. How does this add up? It’s not entirely clear. The Australian Energy Market Operator lists 23GW of coal-fired capacity currently connected to the national market. Just four plants – Liddell and Vales Point in New South Wales, Yallourn in Victoria and Callide B in Queensland – are scheduled to close before 2030. They would cut the total coal capacity of the grid by about 24% compared with today. But we know that other coal-fired plants are under financial strain. There is now so much cheap solar energy in the middle of the day that coal is barely needed at times. Kerry Schott, the former head of the Energy Security Board, earlier this year said coal companies were “going broke” and plants were likely to shut four or five years earlier than expected. Officials in the federal energy department appear to agree. The official projections suggest the country (including Western Australia, which has its own grid) will have 14GW of coal capacity in 2030 under the Coalition – about a further 5GW reduction on what is formally scheduled to close by then. A new analysis by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a clean-energy focused thinktank, expresses this another way – it says there will be a more than 40% cut in coal power capacity between now and 2030 under the Coalition, based on its own documents. It assumes Labor’s policy would lead to further closures. The ALP rejects this. Bowen’s argument is that Australia will need more electricity by 2030 as the country “electrifies everything” – industry starts to switch away from using fossil fuels as a direct feedstock to running on renewable power and there is a greater uptake of electric vehicles. This is true. But the modelling released by Labor leaves out some details – for example, how much electricity use is expected to increase between now and 2030, and how often the coal-fired plants left connected to the grid would actually be operating. Johanna Bowyer, a lead research analyst with IEEFA, says even with a rise in demand for electricity it “doesn’t add up” to suggest there will not be more early coal closures. “If you’re at 82% renewables there is not much left for fossil fuel generators to actually generate,” she says. “The only way they could be online is if they were generating some other payment that essentially subsidises them to sit there.” That subsidy could come in the form of a “capacity mechanism” that both the Coalition and Labor have backed to ensure there is the necessary support in the system that can be called on when needed to back up variable solar and wind. The Coalition says the mechanism would be “technology neutral” and not focused on coal, specifically; Labor says it should encourage investment in renewable energy and was a bridge to clean “dispatchable” technologies such as pumped hydro, hydrogen and batteries. But that does not rule out both parties paying coal companies to keep a fleet of generators alive as backup, even if they are rarely, if ever, used. Experts say it is hard to see what else would keep so much coal in the system. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It would not necessarily lead to higher emissions – coal turbines do not emit when not turned on – but both sides of politics could expect questions about whether paying coal bosses to keep their plants idle is the best use of taxpayers’ money. There are other important questions. When will MPs of all colours level with voters in coal communities that the economics of clean energy and the need to address the climate crisis will inevitably mean coal plants shutting, or effectively shutting, earlier than planned? And what will they do to help give them a future in a post-coal world? Ridd reports on reef ‘selective’ Peter Ridd, the former James Cook University professor who was sacked for breaches of the university’s code of conduct relating to public commentary that the university said denigrated a colleague, has continued his criticism of scientists and government agencies working on the health of the Great Barrier Reef. Ridd was given space in The Australian last Friday to argue an annual reef long-term monitoring survey by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) had found “spectacularly good results”, and that across the reef’s three regions there had “never been more coral since records began in the mid-1980s”. He accused Aims and others of ignoring this data, hoping nobody would notice and contriving a “spurious but apparently plausible reason that the good news is actually bad news” for the reef. Aims has responded, saying Ridd has been “very selective” in quoting from its report. A spokesperson for the institute agreed with Ridd on one point – that the latest results showed the reef could recover during periods when it was not disturbed by mass bleaching, cyclones or other disturbances, and that this was good news. But they said this had not yet lifted coral cover to record levels, and that Ridd consistently ignored a key point – that the scale, intensity and frequency of bleaching events had increased over the past decade, giving it less time to recover. Ridd emphasised that fragile, fast-growing corals had driven a recent increase in overall hard coral cover, but the spokesperson said he ignored that all types of corals were affected by the unprecedented three mass bleaching events in 2016, 2017 and 2020, and the time between major disturbances was now too short for other coral types to recover. They said Ridd continued to incorrectly reject the overwhelming scientific consensus that the climate crisis was the biggest threat to the reef, that oceans were warming and the reef would be increasingly susceptible to bleaching due to rising temperatures. On this, the report was clear, saying: “Periods of low disturbance, such as that seen in 2021, are becoming shorter, reducing the time for recovery. The recovery to date will be easily undone by the next severe tropical cyclone or widespread bleaching event.” The Aims spokesperson said there was an inherent contradiction in Ridd’s argument – he suggested both that Aims’ survey was proof of a permanent recovery in coral cover and that its data could not be trusted. “Unfortunately, he can’t have it both ways,” the spokesperson said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-21T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"Microbes and solar power ‘could produce 10 times more food than plants’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","fields":{"headline":"Microbes and solar power ‘could produce 10 times more food than plants’","bodyText":"Combining solar power and microbes could produce 10 times more protein than crops such as soya beans, according to a new study. The system would also have very little impact on the environment, the researchers said, in stark contrast to livestock farming which results in huge amounts of climate-heating gases as well as water pollution. The concept uses electricity from solar panels and carbon dioxide from the air to create fuel for microbes, which are grown in bioreactor vats and then processed into dry protein powders. The process makes highly efficient use of land, water and fertiliser and could be deployed anywhere, not just in countries with strong sunshine or fertile soils, the scientists said. Food security is a “critical issue” for humanity in coming decades, they said, with the global population growing, biofuels competing for land with crops, and about 800 million people already undernourished today. Furthermore, tackling the climate crisis will be near impossible without slashing emissions from animal and dairy food production. Microbes are already used to make many common foods, such as bread, yoghurt, beer and Quorn. But other researchers said converting consumers to eating microbial protein might be difficult and that such foods may not be nutritionally complete. Dorian Leger, at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam, Germany, who led the new analysis, said: “We think microbial foods are very promising and will be one of the major contributors to solving the potential food crisis. “It might pick up quite quickly on the consumer side, but it’s hard to say. “But I do some exercise, and if I was offered a bacterial protein shake now, I would have it.” The team focused on soya beans, as these are linked to the destruction of forests and are mostly fed to animals, but other bacteria produce the main elements of palm oil. “Bacteria are very flexible, so they could eventually be tuned to different products,” Leger said. At least a dozen companies are already producing animal feed from microbes but the bacteria are typically fed either sugars from other crops or methane or methanol from fossil fuels. Solar Foods, based in Finland, is using electricity to create food for humans. The new assessment, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, is the first quantitative comparison of land use and energy efficiency between traditional agriculture and solar-powered microbial production systems. The researchers used data on today’s technologies to calculate the efficiency of each step of the process, including capturing CO2 from the air and processing the microbes into food that people could eat. They found the microbial system used just 1% of the water needed by the crops and a small fraction of the fertiliser, most of which is wasted when used in fields. The analysis estimated that the solar-microbial process could produce 15 tonnes of protein from each hectare (or per 2.5 acres) a year, enough to feed 520 people, which the scientists said was a conservative estimate. In comparison, a hectare of soya beans could produce 1.1 tonnes of protein, feeding 40 people. Even in countries with relatively low sunlight levels like the UK, microbial protein production was at least five times greater from each hectare than plants. The microbial protein would cost about the same as current proteins eaten by people, such as whey or pea, the researchers suggested. But it was several times more expensive than current animal feeds, although future technological improvements are expected to lower costs. Leger said plants’ ability to photosynthesise is remarkable but, in terms of energy efficiency, staple crops only convert about 1% of solar energy into edible biomass. This is because plants have evolved to compete and reproduce as well as just grow, and use less of the solar light spectrum than photovoltaic panels. All the components of the system exist, but Leger said they now need to be tested together and at scale, in particular the capturing of CO2 from the air and ensuring that used solar panels can be recycled. “For human food, there’s also a lot of regulation that needs to be overcome,” he said. Pete Iannetta, at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, said: ““It’s a really interesting concept – you are divorcing food production from land use, which would mean you could have all that land available for rewilding.” But he said food is not only composed of the main nutrients, like protein and carbohydrate: “There are an awful lot of secondary compounds that are important for your wellbeing.” Iannetta also questioned whether microbial foods would become mainstream: “For example, we have used algae for a long time as a potential food resource, but it’s still not widely accepted.” Dr Toby Mottram, a consultant on agricultural technology, said: “Until the model is tested and costed with a pilot-scale plant, including a lifecycle assessment of [solar panel] production, it is hard to comment on whether it improves on [farming] systems which have been sustained for thousands of years, albeit for a lower population than we are planning to feed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2021/apr/16/facebook-says-it-has-reached-net-zero-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-16T14:35:34Z","webTitle":"Facebook says it has reached net zero emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/16/facebook-says-it-has-reached-net-zero-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2021/apr/16/facebook-says-it-has-reached-net-zero-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Facebook says it has reached net zero emissions","bodyText":"Facebook has reached net zero emissions, the company has announced, paving the way for it to achieve its wider target of net zero emissions across its entire supply chain by 2030. The social network said it had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 94% over the past three years, and its operations were now supported by 100% renewable energy. “We set these goals in 2018 and today we are one of the largest corporate buyers of renewable energy,” Facebook said. “We have contracts in place for more than six gigawatts of wind and solar energy across 18 states and five countries. All 63 projects are new and located on the same electrical grids as the data centres they support.” In 2018 the company announced a more limited goal of cutting emissions by 75% by 2020. Overshooting that bodes well for Facebook’s ability to hit its 2030 target, which incorporates not just the emissions caused by Facebook’s own datacentres but also those from the company’s suppliers, from the hardware developers who build its servers to the outsourcing companies who handle its moderation. While the company is buying enough renewable energy to power its entire business, though, it is not yet powering its entire business with renewables. Instead, the company, like many others pursuing a net zero goal, can buy renewable energy certificates to match fossil-generated power it is forced to rely on if the electricity grids do not have enough renewable electricity available to satisfy demand. “The biggest lever is to design and build some of the world’s most energy-efficient datacentres,” said Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer. “But we’ve also become one of the world’s largest buyers of renewable energy.” Schroepfer, a key member of Mark Zuckerberg’s inner circle, cited a 180MW solar project in Utah, which came online in mid-April, as an example of the company’s positive impact. He said Facebook’s net zero pledge involved investment in less traditional areas as well. The company’s datacentres are cooled using less water, and less electricity, than traditional air conditioning units, meaning that about 10% of the datacentre’s energy use is for non-computing tasks such as cooling. Facebook’s announcement brought a mixed reception from climate activists. “This is the bare minimum a company can do in the middle of a climate emergency,” wrote Luke Kingma, a climate activist and brand strategist. “The biggest source of emissions from social platforms is not their data centres. It’s their advertising and content policies.” In October, the thinktank InfluenceMap found that Facebook had helped promote adverts denying the reality of the climate crisis more than 8m times in the US alone in the first six months of last year. The discovery prompted the US senator Elizabeth Warren to warn that Facebook’s leadership “would rather make a quick buck while our planet burns and communities – disproportionately black and brown – suffer”. She said Facebook “must be held accountable for its role in the climate crisis”. The race to net zero has become a point of positive competition for some of the world’s largest tech companies. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon all have different, ambitious goals for cutting their climate emissions. In September, for instance, Google announced that it had not only reached carbon neutrality but offset all carbon it had ever produced. Apple has announced a goal to become carbon neutral by 2030, counting not only its entire supply chain but the lifecycle of all its products, including the energy consumed in their use. For instance, it will plant trees to absorb carbon equal to the estimated lifetime carbon emissions of the electricity used to charge iPhones. On Thursday, Apple announced a $200m fund to invest in reforestation projects to that end. The Restore fund will invest in managed forest properties, generating a financial return that the company hopes will “drive further change”, according to Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice-president of environment, policy, and social initiatives."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/may/06/hydrogen-fuel-risks-reliance-on-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-06T15:14:09Z","webTitle":"Using hydrogen fuel risks locking in reliance on fossil fuels, researchers warn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/06/hydrogen-fuel-risks-reliance-on-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/may/06/hydrogen-fuel-risks-reliance-on-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Using hydrogen fuel risks locking in reliance on fossil fuels, researchers warn","bodyText":"Using hydrogen-based fuels for cars and home heating risks locking in a dependency on fossil fuels and failing to tackle the climate crisis, according to a new analysis. Fuels produced from hydrogen can be used as straight replacements for oil and gas and can be low-carbon, if renewable electricity is used to produce these “e-fuels”. However, the research found that using the electricity directly to power cars and warm houses was far more efficient. The analysis estimated that hydrogen-based fuels would be very expensive and scarce in the coming decade. Therefore, equipment such as “hydrogen-ready” boilers could end up reliant on fossil gas and continue to produce the carbon emissions driving global heating. However, a few sectors such as aviation, shipping, steel and some chemicals are extremely hard to electrify. The researchers said hydrogen-based fuels would be needed for these by 2050, when the world needs to have reached net zero emissions. But they said enormous investment in technology and fast-rising carbon taxes would be needed to achieve this. Renewable electricity production is increasing rapidly as costs tumble. But it still makes up a small proportion of all energy used, which is mostly provided by coal, oil and gas. Using the electricity directly is efficient, but requires investment in new types of car and heating systems. Using the electricity to create hydrogen from water and then using carbon dioxide to manufacture other fuels can produce “drop-in” replacements for fossil fuels. But the new study concludes this cannot work on a large enough scale to tackle the climate emergency in time. “Hydrogen-based fuels can be a great clean energy carrier, yet their costs and associated risks are also great,” said Falko Ueckerdt, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany, who led the research. “If we cling to combustion technologies and hope to feed them with hydrogen-based fuels, and these turn out to be too costly and scarce, then we will end up burning further oil and gas,” he said. “We should therefore prioritise those precious hydrogen-based fuels for applications for which they are indispensable: long-distance aviation, feedstocks in chemical production and steel production.” Prof Gunnar Luderer, also at PIK and part of the study team, said: “As climate targets require immediate emission reductions, direct electrification should come first to assure a safe future. It is clear that the contribution of e-fuels and hydrogen will be marginal on the timescale of 2030.” The research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, calculated that producing and burning hydrogen-based fuels in home gas boilers required six to 14 times more electricity than heat pumps providing the same warmth. This is because energy is wasted in creating the hydrogen, then the e-fuel, then in burning it. For cars, using e-fuels requires five times more electricity than is needed than for battery-powered cars. Romain Sacchi, from the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland and part of the study team, said: “We are currently far from 100% renewable electricity. If produced with the current electricity mixes [in Europe], hydrogen-based fuels would increase – not decrease – greenhouse gas emissions, [compared with] using fossil fuels.” Daryl Wilson, the executive director of the global, industry-backed Hydrogen Council, said hydrogen could become the most competitive low-carbon solution for some sectors by 2030, such as long-haul trucking and steel. “Other applications such as buildings and power will require a higher carbon cost to become cost-competitive,” he said. “However, these are currently also seeing strong momentum as large-scale and long-term solutions to decarbonise the gas grid.” Members of the global Hydrogen Council include Saudi Aramco, BP and Total, and some critics say hydrogen provides a “cover story for fossil fuels”. Luderer said the EU target for green hydrogen production in 2030 was a thousand times higher than current levels of production, suggesting the scale-up would have to go far faster than even the rapid solar energy rollout of the last decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/sep/20/the-potential-for-solar-is-huge-future-looks-bright-for-lightsource-bp","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-20T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"‘The potential for solar is huge’: future looks bright for Lightsource BP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/20/the-potential-for-solar-is-huge-future-looks-bright-for-lightsource-bp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/sep/20/the-potential-for-solar-is-huge-future-looks-bright-for-lightsource-bp","fields":{"headline":"‘The potential for solar is huge’: future looks bright for Lightsource BP","bodyText":"Nick Boyle, the founder and chief executive of solar power giant Lightsource BP, is striding through its central London headquarters speaking as quickly as he walks. It takes a lot of energy for one man to make a sprawling office emptied by Covid-19 feel alive, but the Irishman has more than enough for the job. It is less than a year since the oil corporation BP, the venture’s joint-owner, thrust it into the spotlight by unveiling plans to grow its renewable energy generation 20-fold within this decade. Now Boyle is poised to set out how Lightsource will help power one of the biggest corporate transformations ever attempted. “We knew that the interest in solar and renewables was going to rise. But not even in my wildest dreams would I have assumed that it was going to rise at the pace that it has,” Boyle says. The former financial services executive founded the company, then known as Lightsource Renewable Energy, at the end of 2010 with five employees and a solar farm in Truro, Cornwall, capable of generating enough electricity to power 430 homes. Within seven years Boyle had grown the company to a team of 300, with solar farms in Ireland, Netherlands, India and the US – catching the eye of major players hoping to buy into the solar boom. It was at the end of 2017 that the oil giant’s acquisition of 43% of the company, now rebranded as Lightsource BP, was agreed. Two years later that stake was increased to create the 50:50 joint venture in place today. “The word ‘symbiosis’ seems to be used to describe the relationship we have with BP, and I think that’s a very fair description’,” Boyle says. It was a deal that helped make Lightsource one of the fastest growing solar companies in the world, and provided BP with the clean-energy testbed it needed to propose one of the greatest transformation plans in corporate history. The venture has tripled its global reach to 15 countries, and doubled its workforce from 300 in 2017 to around 600 staff across its global portfolio today. Lightsource BP’s initial goal was to use the oil giant’s financial muscle to grow a 1.6 gigawatt pipeline of solar projects to a portfolio of 10GW of solar investments by 2023. “We didn’t sit back and plan to deliver 10GW; we realised at some point the question would be asked: ‘Have you got the capability to do more?’” Boyle says. Since then BP has brought in a new CEO, Bernard Looney, and discovered a renewed appetite for renewable energy. The new target is now for Lightsource BP to more than double its planned solar rollout, to 25GW by 2025. “One of things that we’ve done really well in the first years in partnership with BP is that we’ve set aggressive targets and we’ve delivered on every one them … They were able to believe us when we said: ‘Guys, 10GW isn’t really pushing the envelope.’ That was the start of the conversation about how we redefine what ‘good’ looks like,” Boyle says. Solar energy is expected to play a crucial role in helping BP meet its 2030 renewable energy target because solar farms can be rolled out far quicker than its plans to build offshore wind farms by the second half of the decade. As well as Lightsource’s facilities, BP also plans to finance its own solar farms which the solar venture will develop and run as a “gun for hire”. “We already have momentum,” Boyle says. “The fact that we are able to deliver with confidence allows BP to believe that their early 2025 [interim target] is actually doable predominantly through solar, and that’s important to them.” This confidence is also important to BP’s shareholders, many of whom remain sceptical that the financial returns from renewable energy can compete with the cash generated from barrels of crude. “This is always an amusing one for me,” Boyle says. “People who compare the returns on solar with oil and gas miss the fact that they’re comparing an apple to a fish.” Boyle was drawn to the solar industry from a background in retail financial services, “selling a little bit to a lot of people”, because he recognised solar power’s long-term predictable returns as the “Holy Grail of small volume investments”. “We know that the sun will come up and the sun will go down so we’re essentially creating an annuity of very predictable generation multiplied by a fixed price that has already been agreed with some of the largest companies in the world.” Lightsource BP earlier this month struck a deal to build the largest solar farm in the US state of Louisiana to supply clean energy to McDonald’s and eBay. It has also agreed a deal to supply electricity to Amazon from an existing solar farm in Ohio, and to supply power to BP service stations from solar farms in New South Wales, Australia. “That’s a very different bet to digging a hole and wondering whether you’ll hit gas or oil, and how much, and what it’ll cost to get it out, and what the market price will be when you get it out,” he says. By the same analogy investing in solar would be “like digging a hole and knowing how much oil is there, how much it will cost and how much you’ll be paid for it before you start”, Boyle says. The solar industry is not without its challenges. Earlier this year reports emerged that some of China’s biggest solar companies may have ties to Uyghur forced-labour camps in Xinjiang via polysilicon production. Ongoing US sanctions against China’s solar supply chain threaten to raise costs, and slow the pace of the industry globally. Lightsource BP was one of the companies that sourced their panels and components from the companies linked to Xinjiang, albeit prior to 2016 when the state-sanctioned abuse of Uyghur communities began to gain international attention. Boyle says the company is ready to meet these challenges “head on”. Lightsource has not used Chinese-made solar panels “for years now” due to the US sanctions, and is working with industry groups across its geographical portfolio to help improve the “traceability” of the solar supply chain. “At the end of the day there shouldn’t be a trade-off between the advantages of renewables and the disadvantages of individuals being put through hardship,” he says. There’s no slowing down solar, he says. In the future, demand for solar electricity will be fuelled by two things: the boom in low-cost batteries that mean solar can be used at any time, and the desire to produce green hydrogen – made from renewable electricity and water – which will mean solar will effectively be used anywhere from sea to train to plane. “Hydrogen could be shipped around the world as an energy source which essentially came from the sun but is captured as a gas, and burned the same way as historic hydrocarbons,” Boyle says. “The future in hydrogen alone makes the 25GW target look small. The potential for solar is absolutely huge.” The potential for Lightsource BP appears to be just as bright."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2019/nov/19/bill-gates-energy-startup-sunlight-heliogen-solar-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2019-11-19T08:58:43Z","webTitle":"Bill Gates backs startup using sunlight to create 1,000C-plus heat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/19/bill-gates-energy-startup-sunlight-heliogen-solar-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2019/nov/19/bill-gates-energy-startup-sunlight-heliogen-solar-energy","fields":{"headline":"Bill Gates backs startup using sunlight to create 1,000C-plus heat","bodyText":"Bill Gates is backing a new venture which aims to turn sunlight into a source of heat exceeding 1,000C that could help replace fossil fuels. The world’s richest man is joining investors behind Heliogen, the first company to concentrate sunlight to reach temperatures that are high enough to power heavy industry without carbon emissions. The technology could even reach temperatures of 1,500C to split hydrogen molecules from water to create a fossil-free gas to warm homes, fuel cars and power factories. Bill Gross, the chief executive and founder of California-based Heliogen, said the company represents a technological leap forward in tackling the emissions from industry and transport that make up 75% of the world’s carbon footprint. The company uses software to align a large array of mirrors to reflect sunlight to a target, creating a source of heat almost three times as intense as previous commercial solar systems. Gross said creating low-cost, ultra-high-temperature process heat gives the company an opportunity to make meaningful contributions to solving the climate crisis. The technology can generate temperatures high enough to manufacture cement without fossil fuels. Cement is the world’s third largest source of emissions behind oil and coal, and its production is expected to boom due to urbanisation in developing countries and economic growth. If allowed to continue unchecked, cement production would pose a major threat to the targets set by the Paris agreement, which aims to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Heliogen has the backing of private equity investors and entrepreneurs who believe its technology could help the most polluting industries to cut their carbon emissions. Early investors in Heliogen include Gates, the venture capital firm Neotribe and the billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong’s Nant Capital. Gates said he was pleased to be an initial backer of a “promising development in the quest to one day replace fossil fuel”. “Today, industrial processes like those used to make cement, steel, and other materials are responsible for more than a fifth of all emissions,” he added. “These materials are everywhere in our lives but we don’t have any proven breakthroughs that will give us affordable, zero-carbon versions of them. If we’re going to get to zero carbon emissions overall, we have a lot of inventing to do.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-13T18:31:24Z","webTitle":"Musk is right that dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas don’t sit well together","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2021/may/13/elon-musk-right-dirty-bitcoins-clean-teslas","fields":{"headline":"Musk is right that dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas don’t sit well together","bodyText":"Elon Musk moves in mysterious ways, so it would be foolish to assume that his new sceptical stance on bitcoin will last longer than his previous cheerleading. But he has now landed on the right spot: bitcoin is an environmental abomination. Researchers at the University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance have been chronicling as much for ages. At last count, electronic mining of the cryptocurrency was consuming the same quantity of energy as economies the size of Argentina or the Netherlands. That matters because the super-computers in China, the ones doing the bulk of the mining, are running mostly on electricity generated by coal – the point referenced by Musk. The crypto crew will counter that gold and other “stores of value” (their description-cum-hope) aren’t squeaky-clean either. True, but the difference with bitcoin is that the puzzle-solving method of discovery makes the energy consumption more intense over time. And the plea in some quarters that the computers’ vast appetites will boost the advance of low-cost solar energy is, to put it mildly, elaborate. In the here and now, bitcoin mining is a dirty business. True believers weren’t happy about Musk’s U-turn but Tesla’s shareholders ought to be delighted. The founder’s talent for publicity has saved the company a fortune in advertising, but there were clear dangers in tying his personal brand, and Tesla’s, to a single cryptocurrency. A plunge in the price of the coins would not help his popularity. Being seen to step off the rollercoaster when the price is 25% off its highs but, critically, up massively over 12 months, may prove smart timing. More importantly, dirty bitcoins and clean Teslas just don’t sit well together. That was also true in February, of course, when Tesla was a buyer of $1.5bn-worth and said it would accept payment in the tokens. Don’t expect Musk or the board to explain the about-turn, but it may be a belated recognition that bitcoin’s dire environmental record was a business risk too far for Tesla. Maverick geniuses can get away with a lot, but hypocrisy tends to take a toll in the end. All BT needs to do now is to dig BT had to be cajoled and threatened over many years, but it is finally in a defensible position on fast-fibre broadband rollout. The company will aim to reach 25m premises by the end of 2026, an upgrade on the previous promise of 20m by the mid-to-late part of this decade. The City, in its dull way, preferred to concentrate on the short-term hit to cashflows, the consequence of investing more money sooner. The shares fell 6%. Investors ought to count their blessings. BT has secured its “fair bet” on financial returns – the cause of all the wrangling – and has been gifted “super deductions” on infrastructure spending for two years. Meanwhile, the last lot of 5G licences were secured at lower-than-expected prices. The dividend is back at 7.7p a share. Even the pension fund has become slightly less heavy. The financial cherry would be joint-venture deals with infrastructure investors to fund the rollout to 5m of the 25m premises, but the chief executive, Philip Jansen, is adamant that BT can take the solo route if necessary. When the trenches have been dug and filled, BT should account for somewhere between one half and two-thirds of the UK’s fast-fibre network. The rejigged plan has tilted the odds towards the higher figure, which is surely a good thing for investors. One wonders how the directors, reportedly, find so much to quarrel over. The outlook looks clear for the next half-decade. Just dig. James Anderson’s Amazon tease is intriguing James Anderson, one of the world’s best technology investors, signed off his last set of figures as co-manager of the £15bn Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust by taking a pop at all favourite targets: the “irretrievably broken” fund management industry, media doom-mongers, and more. He’s right on all his main points, of course. The investment game changed when it became possible for companies to grow their revenues at a compound rate of 41% for over two decades, as Amazon has done. It is amazing that Scottish Mortgage’s success has not spawned more fund imitators that hunt for such “extreme upside” opportunities. But there was also a tease on Amazon as Jeff Bezos steps down as chief executive. “Amazon is now seen as good value, safe and acceptable. It no longer has a founder CEO.
