The campaign group Together Against Sizewell C (Tasc) had launched a judicial review against the government’s decision to give the green light to the 3.2 gigawatt plant on the Suffolk coast, which is being built by French energy company EDF. The group said the government had failed to consider alternatives to nuclear power to meet its emissions targets when approving the project. It cited the threat to water supplies in an area officially designated as seriously water-stressed, the threats to coastal areas from the climate crisis, and environmental damage. Mr Justice Holgate rejected the group’s challenge against the secretary of state for energy security and net zero in a written ruling at the high court on Thursday. Holgate ruled the government’s decision was in keeping with energy policy intended to achieve “diversity of methods of generation and security of supply”. He said the judicial review was an attempt to “rewrite the government’s policy aims by pretending that the central policy objective is … to produce clean energy, without any regard to diversity of energy sources and security of supply”. Tasc said it would continue its campaign and was examining options for how to do so. Sizewell got the go-ahead from government last year, when the then business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, overruled a verdict from the independent Planning Inspectorate. The planning body had said that “unless the outstanding water supply strategy can be resolved and sufficient information provided to enable the secretary of state to carry out his obligations under the Habitats Regulations, the case for an order granting development consent for the application is not made out”. Kwarteng’s decision to override these concerns came against the backdrop of plans to approve one new nuclear reactor a year, under an energy strategy drawn up under the former prime minister Boris Johnson. The strategy envisaged the UK sourcing up to 25% of its projected energy demand from nuclear by 2050. The Tasc chair, Jenny Kirtley, said: “Naturally, Tasc is disappointed, but this verdict does not signal the end of our efforts. Together with our lawyers we are examining all possible options open to us and can promise our supporters that in one form or another, this campaign will continue. “The Suffolk Heritage Coast cannot be sacrificed for such an unnecessary and inappropriate development, and we will examine every avenue of opposition until all are exhausted.” Sue Ferns, a senior deputy general secretary of the trade union Prospect, said the ruling “removes one of the blocks” to getting Sizewell C started. “Nuclear must play an important role in our energy mix as we race to net zero. We now need to get on with building Sizewell C, and secure the jobs, economic benefits and clean reliable energy it will bring.” A spokesperson for EDF’s Sizewell C project said the judgment “dismisses the challenge and underlines the confidence the people of east Suffolk can take in our plans for Sizewell C. “While the project has strong local support, we will continue to listen to the views of all east Suffolk residents as we have done for more than a decade. We are as determined as ever that this project will deliver as much long-term benefit as possible to the local area. “Work at our site will continue to prepare for full construction, which will unlock major benefits for Suffolk and the rest of Britain. As well as creating huge numbers of jobs, apprenticeships and investment, the project will lower energy costs for consumers and build a stronger homegrown low carbon electricity system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-12T05:00:47Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: concerns over climate impact on UK nuclear power sites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2023/may/12/weatherwatch-concerns-over-climate-impact-on-uk-nuclear-power-sites","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: concerns over climate impact on UK nuclear power sites","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Successive governments since the 1980s have had plans for new generations of nuclear power stations sited around the coasts of the United Kingdom. Although the main reason for building them, according to politicians, is to provide a low-carbon form of electricity to combat the climate crisis, no thought seems to have gone into what the climate crisis might do to the nuclear power stations. Prof Andy Blowers, a former government adviser on nuclear waste, points out in the Town and Country Planning Association Journal that the eight sites identified in 2011 as suitable for new stations are the same as those identified half a century earlier, on which the first generation of nuclear power stations were built. The reason the sites were originally chosen was their remoteness, for safety, and their proximity to the sea, for cooling purposes. The latest reasoning is that they would have a better chance of public acceptance because two generations of local people have worked in the industry. The new installations are planned to operate for 60 years and will need another century after closure to cool sufficiently to remove the waste. Blowers, an opponent of the government plans, worries that ministers seem to have taken no account of sea level rise, intense storms and the prospect of flooding at these sites."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T21:56:15Z","webTitle":"AI should be licensed like medicines or nuclear power, Labour suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2023/jun/05/ai-could-outwit-humans-in-two-years-says-uk-government-adviser","fields":{"headline":"AI should be licensed like medicines or nuclear power, Labour suggests","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK should bar technology developers from working on advanced artificial intelligence tools unless they have a licence to do so, Labour has said. Ministers should introduce much stricter rules around companies training their AI products on vast datasets of the kind used by OpenAI to build ChatGPT, Lucy Powell, Labour’s digital spokesperson, told the Guardian. Her comments come amid a rethink at the top of government over how to regulate the fast-moving world of AI, with the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, acknowledging it could pose an “existential” threat to humanity. One of the government’s advisers on artificial intelligence also said on Monday that humanity could have only two years before AI is able to outwit people, the latest in a series of stark warnings about the threat posed by the fast-developing technology. Powell said: “My real point of concern is the lack of any regulation of the large language models that can then be applied across a range of AI tools, whether that’s governing how they are built, how they are managed or how they are controlled.” She suggested AI should be licensed in a similar way to medicines or nuclear power, both of which are governed by arms-length governmental bodies. “That is the kind of model we should be thinking about, where you have to have a licence in order to build these models,” she said. “These seem to me to be the good examples of how this can be done.” The UK government published a white paper on AI two months ago, which detailed the opportunities the technology could bring, but said relatively little about how to regulate it. Since then, a range of developments, including advances in ChatGPT and a series of stark warnings from industry insiders, have caused a rethink at the top of government, with ministers now hastily updating their approach. This week Sunak will travel to Washington DC, where he will argue that the UK should be at the forefront of international efforts to write a new set of guidelines to govern the industry. Labour is also rushing to finalise its own policies on advanced technology. Powell, who will give a speech to industry insiders at the TechUK conference in London on 6 June, said she believed the disruption to the UK economy could be as drastic as the deindustrialisation of the 1970s and 1980s. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is expected to give a speech on the subject during London Tech Week next week. Starmer will hold a shadow cabinet meeting in one of Google’s UK offices next week, giving shadow ministers a chance to speak to some of the company’s top AI executives. Powell said that rather than banning certain technologies, as the EU has done with tools such as facial recognition, she thought the UK should focus on regulating the way in which they are developed. Products such as ChatGPT are built by training algorithms on vast banks of digital information. But experts warn that if those datasets contain biased or discriminatory data, the products themselves can show evidence of those biases. This could have a knock-on effect, for example, on employment practices if AI tools are used to help make hiring and firing decisions. Powell said: “Bias, discrimination, surveillance – this technology can have a lot of unintended consequences.” She argued that by forcing developers to be more open about the data they are using, governments could help mitigate those risks. “This technology is moving so fast that it needs an active, interventionist government approach, rather than a laissez-faire one.” Matt Clifford, the chair of the Advanced Research and Invention Agency, which the government set up last year, said on Monday that AI was evolving much faster than most people realised. He said it could already be used to launch bioweapons or large-scale cyber-attacks, adding that humans could rapidly be surpassed by the technology they had created. Speaking to TalkTV’s Tom Newton Dunn, Clifford said: “It’s certainly true that if we try and create artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than humans and we don’t know how to control it, then that’s going to create a potential for all sorts of risks now and in the future. So I think there’s lots of different scenarios to worry about but I certainly think it’s right that it should be very high on the policymakers’ agendas.” Asked when that could happen, he added: “No one knows. There are a very broad range of predictions among AI experts. I think two years will be at the very most sort of bullish end of the spectrum.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-04T21:30:11Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer says nuclear power is ‘critical part’ of UK’s energy mix","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/04/keir-starmer-says-nuclear-power-is-critical-part-of-uks-energy-mix","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer says nuclear power is ‘critical part’ of UK’s energy mix","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Keir Starmer has described nuclear power as a “critical part” of the UK’s energy mix and pledged to get stalled projects over the line, as Labour positions itself firmly behind the technology. Before the Labour leader presents his net zero energy policies during a speech in Scotland early next week, the party said it would “push forward” nuclear to boost energy security, cut costs for consumers and create jobs. On Sunday Starmer accused the Conservatives of a “shambolic” failure to open any nuclear power plants during 13 years in power. On Monday he will visit Hinkley Point C in Somerset, one of a number of new plants still not operational despite having been identified in 2009 when Labour was last in power. “My government will lower household energy bills, create jobs and ensure Britain’s energy security. Nuclear is a critical part of the UK’s energy mix,” said Starmer, who claimed Tory failure to approve the new plans had cost 7,000 British jobs. However, another plank of the party’s energy plans came under renewed attack on Sunday from a union that is one of Labour’s biggest donors. Gary Smith, the GMB general secretary, accused the Labour party of being naive over its plans to ban North Sea oil and gas production. Labour has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power, proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. The proposals, which Starmer is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland this month, will involve not only a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences but also a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. Smith said Labour had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. “We are critical friends of the Labour party and I think this is just a lack of intellectual rigour and thinking about where they have got to on oil and gas,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “They are focusing on what they think is popular rather than doing the proper thinking to understand what is right for the country.” The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said earlier on the same programme that the existing oil and gas fields in the North Sea would run until 2050 and the party was not talking about turning those off. Starmer’s promise to block new North Sea oil and gas exploration has received the backing of an eclectic range of high-profile groups, including environmental campaigners, trade unions and even the Women’s Institute. The radical pledge is a key plank of Labour’s environmental platform, but has angered business and political leaders in the north-east of Scotland, where the industry is concentrated. Starmer is being urged to stick to the plan in a letter signed by 139 organisations, including the Countryside Charity, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the National Federation of Women’s Institutes. The groups write: “We urge you to stand firm on Labour’s policy of no new oil and gas developments and its significant investment in well-planned, nature-positive renewables and energy efficiency, and to confirm more details on how Labour will support workers to transition from fossil fuels to good quality, secure green jobs during your speech in June.” Shadow ministers confirmed last month that the party intended to ban new domestic oil and gas developments as part of its strategy to achieve zero-carbon power by 2030. Starmer will formally announce the pledge as part of a speech later this month setting out his green agenda in more detail. The plans have drawn fire from Aberdeen-based business leaders and the Tories, with Grant Shapps claiming the policy was an “ideological vendetta against British energy independence” and warning it would put jobs at risk and boost Russia’s global power. Shapps, the energy secretary, is due to make a decision within weeks over whether to approve drilling at the giant Rosebank oilfield off Shetland. Comments from Rishi Sunak – who has said it would be “economically illiterate” not to invest in new UK oil and gas – have been interpreted as a sign that the government is prepared to give it the green light, although there have been warnings that Labour’s green policies could make it less attractive to investors. In an article for the Times, Ryan Crighton, the policy director of Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: “If the alternative is importing, at a greater carbon cost, then surely the UK should always favour domestic production, where we can control the regulatory environment.” The high-profile opposition to Labour’s plans has caused concern among environmental groups, with Labour recently having backtracked on a range of other policies, including a pledge to abolish university tuition fees. Starmer is also under pressure from some of his frontbench to change the remit of the party’s £28bn climate fund to allow it to invest in infrastructure projects that are not explicitly green in nature. Tessa Khan, the founder of Uplift, a group that campaigns for the UK to move away from fossil fuels, and which signed the letter, said: “We were disturbed by the way in which Labour’s position to oppose development of new oil and gas field has come under attack in the last week. We wanted to make it clear that it is a core position of the climate sector and more broadly among different sectors in the UK. It’s a mainstream position and backed up by climate science.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-15T06:00:35Z","webTitle":"Germany’s last three nuclear power stations to shut this weekend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/15/germany-last-three-nuclear-power-stations-to-shut-this-weekend","fields":{"headline":"Germany’s last three nuclear power stations to shut this weekend","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations will shut down on Saturday, 12 years after the Fukushima disaster in Japan accelerated the country’s exit from atomic energy. The closures mark the conclusion of a stop-start approach to atomic energy and a victory for the country’s vociferous anti-nuclear movement. The facilities shutting are in Emsland, in the northern state of Lower Saxony, the Isar 2 site in Bavaria, and Neckarwestheim, in Baden-Württemberg in the south-west. The shutdowns leave a conundrum for energy policymakers attempting to balance growing electricity demand in one of Europe’s industrial superpowers and efforts to decarbonise, against the backdrop of uncertainty caused by the war in Ukraine. Germany last year delayed the closure of the three sites – which provided about 6.5% of the country’s electricity in 2022 – after Russia reduced European gas supplies, triggering concerns about a shortage of energy over the winter. The country began phasing out nuclear power more than two decades ago amid a long-fought campaign against the technology, but, in 2010 Angela Merkel, then chancellor, announced an extension to the life of the country’s 17 nuclear plants until 2036 at the latest. This policy was swiftly reversed the following year after an earthquake and tsunami caused the meltdown of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan, triggering fresh anti-nuclear protests and political resolve to exit the technology. Nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island in the US in 1979 and Chernobyl in 1986 had already entrenched the push against nuclear in Germany, which had begun earlier in the 1970s. Germany has switched off 16 reactors since 2003. The final shutdowns have raised questions about security of energy supplies and the outlook for Germany’s carbon emissions. The country plans to close all coal-fired power plants by 2038, with the first round of closures planned in 2030. However, its parliament approved emergency legislation to reopen mothballed coal-fired power plants to aid electricity generation last year. A push to build more terminals to import liquefied natural gas has also been accelerated since the Ukraine war began. Coal accounted for just over 30% of Germany’s electricity generation in 2022, ahead of wind – responsible for 22%, gas-fired generation at 13% and solar at 10%. Biomass, nuclear and hydroelectric power made up the bulk of the remainder. The thinktank Ember has estimated that Germany and Poland will be the EU’s two largest producers of coal-fired electricity in 2030, responsible for more than half of EU power sector emissions by that point. Advocates of nuclear power argue that it provides a low-carbon, reliable alternative to fossil fuels for electricity generation. Critics say new projects are costly, frequently delayed and present environmental concerns over the disposal of nuclear waste. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the UK’s Nuclear Industry Association, said the phaseout would worsen carbon emissions and “for a country supposedly renowned for its logical and evidence-driven approach is environmentally damaging, economically illiterate and deeply irresponsible”. He added: “At a time of heightened concern about energy security, Germany will be abandoning assets that can displace 34bn cubic metres of gas a year.” But Tom Burke, chair of the thinktank E3G, played down fears over energy security, and said a mild winter and high levels of gas storage in Europe meant concerns about power supplies next winter had eased. He said Germany’s renewables industry was growing and that improving grid connections and battery storage across the country would be key to moving the country’s energy system away from fossil fuels. “The coal is mainly being burnt for social and economic reasons, making sure the industry doesn’t shut down all at once,” said Burke. “You cannot have a technology transformation without a social transformation.” Germany’s abandonment of nuclear power is in contrast to the stated ambitions of the UK government, which last month kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear. Ministers have set up a delivery body for new nuclear projects and are running a competition for small nuclear reactors. However, progress on developing two existing large projects, Sizewell C in Suffolk and Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been slow, with the latter delayed and overbudget."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-07T10:00:49Z","webTitle":"Leaks from Minnesota nuclear power plant raise safety fears across US","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/apr/07/minnesota-nuclear-power-plant-leak-safety","fields":{"headline":"Leaks from Minnesota nuclear power plant raise safety fears across US","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In December, Janica Jammes started a microgreens business in the basement of her home in Big Lake, Minnesota, just across the river from Xcel Energy’s nuclear plant in Monticello. At least once each day, she uses water from her well to nourish the plant trays. She delivers her product to customers within a 10-mile radius and says the business has been a success. But now she worries that her water could be contaminated by a leak of about 400,000 gallons of radioactive water that occurred in November at the plant, which is about 40 miles north-west of Minneapolis. Moreover, Jammes is upset that the company did not alert the public about the leak until March – and then detected a second leak, which the company described as smaller than the first one. “We don’t know for sure if” side-effects from the leaks “will happen or when anything will happen but just the lack of transparency is very concerning”, said Jammes, a 36-year-old mother of four. While Xcel Energy representatives have said the leaks did not affect local drinking water or pose a safety threat to residents, residents such as Jammes want more answers from the company. Independent nuclear energy experts agree that the company should have been more transparent, but they say that based on reports from state and federal agencies, they also do not think the leaks pose a health risk to residents or that the incidents will serve as a significant setback to efforts to promote the carbon-free power source in the US. “This leak, even though it was contained and poses no danger”, according to the official reports, “it should be used as some sort of wake-up call”, said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor who specializes in nuclear safety at the University of Southern California. While some scientists see increasing nuclear energy as a crucial, safe way to reducing carbon emissions and increasing the country’s energy independence, the disasters at the Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima nuclear power plants continue to cause fears of the power source. “Nuclear is the only clean energy sector that has the capacity to” transition away from fossil fuels “on a large scale”, said Charlyne Smith, a senior nuclear energy analyst at the Breakthrough Institute, an energy thinktank. “It is an industry that is highly scrutinized compared to other industries, and I think the Nuclear Regulatory Commission does a really good job at ensuring that safety is something that is practiced in the industry.” Even though Xcel did not announce the leak publicly, they notified the Regulatory Commission, which is a federal agency, and the state and in November, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. The company reported that about 400,000 gallons of water containing tritium leaked from a pipe at the facility. The regulators concluded that the spill had not reached the Mississippi River or contaminated drinking water sources near the plant. “While we immediately informed state and federal agencies, with no immediate safety risk, we focused on investigating the situation and containing the affected water in concert with our regulatory agencies,” Kevin Coss, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, stated in an email to the Guardian. “Making the announcement when we did allowed us to provide the public a more accurate and complete understanding of the leak and our plan to resolve it.” Smith said she agreed that the leak did not pose a significant safety risk but “learning about it months after really doesn’t help the industry”. After the announcement, Xcel held two open houses about the leaks. The company also shut the plant down after discovering the second leak but said it would reopen this week. Jammes was among hundreds of people to attend the meetings. She and others said they were frustrated that there was no presentation about the leaks and that company representatives just stood at tables and answered only some of attendees’ questions. “It was just a quick question and answer sort of thing, like if you have questions, then we’ll try to answer them, but it was very much: you’re going to hear what we want you to hear,” Jammes said. She wants to know why the pipe broke and what Xcel will do to prevent such accidents. Michael Voll, a 60-year-old warehouse associate, also criticized the company’s approach at the meetings. He has lived in Monticello for most his life and said Xcel, which opened the plant in 1971, has benefited the local economy. “You didn’t have to come from a nuclear submarine. You could go out there, and if your uncle or your dad worked there, you probably were going to get a job,” Voll said. He also remains a supporter of nuclear energy and has never feared the plant. But after the leaks and the public meetings, he said his trust in Xcel “is way down”. Xcel sent the pipe that leaked to an independent group, where experts are studying it to determine what caused it to fail, Coss, the Xcel spokesperson stated. “The results will help us understand whether there are other potential steps we need to take at the plant,” he wrote. The company also will conduct a “thorough inspection” of the plant while it’s offline for refueling this month, Coss added. Xcel “will work to maintain” the community’s trust, Coss wrote, “by thoroughly cleaning up the leaked tritium and providing prompt updates if anything about the situation changes”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-16T13:36:37Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt wants nuclear power classed as ‘sustainable’: is it?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/16/jeremy-hunt-wants-nuclear-power-classed-as-sustainable-is-it","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt wants nuclear power classed as ‘sustainable’: is it?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt has kickstarted a fresh push into nuclear power, which he hopes will provide a quarter of Britain’s electricity by 2050. In his budget speech, the chancellor announced a competition to co-fund small nuclear plants and hopes a new delivery body, Great British Nuclear, will ease the creation of nuclear projects. He also launched a consultation to classify nuclear as “environmentally sustainable”. But is it? Does Britain need nuclear power? Hunt follows in the footsteps of the former prime minister Boris Johnson in making bold statements on the importance of nuclear. Britain’s nuclear power stations date back to the 1950s and are now ageing, with just one, Sizewell B, still scheduled to be running after 2028. Last week, France’s EDF – which operates the stations – said it had extended the life of two other plants. Proponents argue that nuclear provides a “baseload” of power that can be relied on, whereas renewable energy such as wind and solar is dependent on weather conditions, meaning it cannot always help match supply with demand. There are also high hopes for nuclear fusion as an energy source, but this has not been commercialised. Why is nuclear being reclassified? To attract private investment. The consultation is on the “taxonomy” or financial classification system of energy. This is important as there have been a proliferation of funds dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments springing up in global financial markets in recent years. These funds promise their investors that their cash is going towards social good, such as tackling the climate crisis. Hunt was also under pressure to respond to the Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden’s $369bn climate subsidy package. Is Britain the first country to do this? No. The European Commission decided last year to label nuclear as a “green” investment. The EU’s parliament said the taxonomy change aimed “to boost green investments and prevent ‘greenwashing’”. However, the decision has faced legal challenges by groups including Greenpeace. Will it make a difference? Nuclear projects cost tens of billions of pounds to develop and build, so smoothing the path to secure investment is seen as crucial. In the UK, the government has tasked bankers with finding funders for Sizewell C, in partnership with EDF, after easing China General Nuclear out of the project over security fears. The government has committed £700m to the Suffolk plant, which could cost more than £30bn to build. Its sister site, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, has been beset with delays and cost overruns. Senior industry sources said the taxonomy change would help in the hunt for Sizewell C’s funders. The backers of small modular reactors, including a programme developed by Rolls-Royce, will also hope to receive significant investment. Rolls-Royce’s’ aim is to create a fleet of smaller, factory-built nuclear plants across Britain. Is nuclear energy renewable? Uranium, the element used in nuclear power, is a finite resource, which is mined from the ground and not considered renewable. However, it can be argued that, as nuclear power stations use a very small amount of fuel to generate the same amount of electricity, they are preferable to gas-fired power stations, which are expected to be around for many years. Is it really green? Advocates of nuclear claim it should be seen as a green energy source as it does not release harmful emissions into the air. National Grid says that the “lifecycle emissions” – emissions resulting from every stage of the production process – are also significantly lower than in fossil fuel-based generation. Hunt said on Wednesday that “increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations”. However, there are questions over how useful nuclear will realistically be in this mission. As projects take years to build – Sizewell C could be finished by the mid-2030s at a push – it can be argued that pursuing the project could prove a drain on government and financial resources, which could be better spent on rapidly scaling up Britain’s wind and solar capacity and improving electricity networks and storage. An effective ban on onshore wind developments remains in place. Nuclear detractors also say nuclear cannot be seen as sustainable given the concerns over the potential environmental hazards in the long term. Shutting down sites such as Sellafield, in north-west England, will take generations and involves a painstaking process of carefully managing ageing buildings to ensure radioactive waste is not mishandled. In Finland, a huge effort is under way to bury waste in concrete deep underground. It has also been argued that – as nuclear plants need water for cooling so are often built near the coast – rising sea levels could make some projects obsolete before building work is completed. That is not the only concern, is it? No. The history of the nuclear industry has shown an oscillating interest from governments and investors, influenced by a series of devastating incidents including Three Mile Island in 1979, Chornobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, in Ukraine, has again raised concerns over a nuclear incident. ."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T09:00:07Z","webTitle":"Atomic Hope review – a powerful case for pressing the nuclear power button","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/feb/15/atomic-hope-review-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Atomic Hope review – a powerful case for pressing the nuclear power button","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is a film that returns us to a thorny revisionist subject which I haven’t seen aired in documentary form since the film Pandora’s Promise in 2013 – which isn’t mentioned here, though a poster for it is visible in one shot. For many environmentalists, the last realistic hope we have to avert climate disaster is the great unthinkable, the great unmentionable: stop worrying and learn to love nuclear energy, because nuclear is a colossally efficient and very clean energy source. Like Pandora’s Promise, Atomic Hope revisits the case studies of Chornobyl and Fukushima and argues that, although clearly catastrophic, a mythology of horror has grown up around these events that has stymied all debate and shut down thought. The film doesn’t say so, but another way the eco-nuclear movement became tainted was perhaps a speech by Margaret Thatcher to the UN general assembly which made the case in 1989, partly to undermine the coal industry as a trade union powerbase. At any rate, here again is the argument: nuclear energy provides the clean, climate-friendly energy we need. Renewables such as wind and solar are important, but progress on them is desperately slow and time is running out. The risks of nuclear are real, but they are misunderstood and uncontextualised, safety measures have evolved and risk must in any case now be considered in the light of clear and present danger of the global harm from fossil fuels. But none of this is easy. Generations have been brought up on the idea that nuclear equals apocalypse. Convincing them of the opposite is a challenge. Guardian readers will know that George Monbiot has ventilated ideas on this issue. The inevitable question is: what does Greta think? This film was apparently made too late to include Thunberg’s startling intervention in October 2022, when she claimed the German government was wrong to close down nuclear plants in favour of coal. Anything that stimulates discussion of this issue is to be welcomed. • Atomic Hope is released on 17 February in cinemas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-13T06:00:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is not the only option | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/nov/13/nuclear-power-is-not-the-only-option-letters","fields":{"headline":"Letters: nuclear power is not the only option","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"I do not share your enthusiasm for the “good news” that Sizewell C is believed to be safe from Jeremy Hunt’s budgetary cuts (“Britain can’t afford to waver over nuclear power – soon it will be too late”, Editorial). “On a freezing cold, windless, winter’s evening”, Britain’s grid will indeed need an alternative power source to wind or solar, but why is it assumed that only nuclear can provide an alternative base load? And at the cost of how many billions? And how many decades of lead time? Geothermal could do the job faster, more safely and cheaply – for about a quarter of the cost. Geothermal power plants operate already in the United States, Italy and Iceland. And nothing is more certain and regular than the tide twice a day; sea turbines already operate in tidal flows off Orkney and Shetland and are another safe source of energy baseload. Let us not be blinkered by nuclear. Wendy Fowler Carnac-Rouffiac, France Your leader on Sizewell C ignores a couple of factors that are key to our local objections. First, the coastline on which Sizewell A and B are built and Sizewell C is proposed is disintegrating at an increasingly alarming rate – just two weeks’ ago a building at nearby Thorpeness had to be demolished due to collapse of the cliffs. Second, there is insufficient water in Suffolk to build and operate Sizewell C, which was one of the main reasons the government’s own planning inspectorate advised against it recently. Water is planned to be found through the construction of desalination plants – these require huge amounts of energy, but more importantly the waste salt and other minerals from the extraction process will be put back into the sea, poisoning the waters around for miles. There are other reasons why this is a disastrous location: it is a site of special scientific interest and an area of outstanding natural beauty and the prototype for this type of reactor has yet to be proved at Flamanville – still not operational, years over schedule and way over budget. Nuclear has moved on since the design of these reactors. The government should think again. Rosie Hoare Saxmundham, Suffolk No wonder we Irish are off “There’s not many left,” noted Peggy O’Donoghue, a long-time Irish resident in your highly revealing article (“Britain’s dwindling Irish community mourn the fading of a great migration”, Focus). But what your article didn’t ask is what is the attraction of the UK to young Irish people in 2022? England is no longer the land of opportunity it once was. Brexit and the negative media attitudes that painted a picture of a country that didn’t welcome foreigners only encouraged young people to emigrate to America, Australia, South Africa and Europe. Ireland has emerged from the shadow of a colonial power and the grip of the Catholic church and developed into a well-educated, diverse and globalised society. Like many others, I left Ireland in 1990 because of a lack of opportunities at home. Today, the opportunities on offer to school leavers in Ireland are much improved. Ireland is not without its problems, such as a lack of affordable housing and unequal income distribution, but at least we have a generation who have hope for their country. I don’t see that in England today. Stuart Finegan Lewes Get Brexit undone I do not agree with your correspondent Tanya Firth when she says that the Labour party did not support remain in the EU referendum (Letters). As an ordinary Labour party member, I canvassed, telephoned and door-knocked to stay in the EU following a six-point question list from national Labour. It was a deeply unpleasant experience and many of my colleagues stopped because of the nightly racist comments. One night it was against Poles, the next Romanians. When Boris Johnson announced the Turks were coming, they were the target. We can see the same today with the hatred being generated against asylum seekers. Steven Bowditch Stanwix, Carlisle I wholeheartedly agree with David Mitchell’s critical analysis of politics as the art of the possible when concluding that “reversing Brexit would be the most significant geopolitical choice that Britain could make in its own interests” and a goal that Labour should embrace (“Labour should reverse on not reversing Brexit”, New Review). Reversing the Brexiters’ winning election slogan and campaigning vigorously to “Get Brexit Undone” would be a powerful means. Mick Beeby Westbury on Trym, Bristol The way to net zero Keir Sarmer rightly points out the gap between rhetoric and reality that has characterised the UK’s response to the climate emergency over the last 12 years (“Rishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age”, Comment). It should not be the case that the biggest backers of our potentially “world-leading” renewable energy technologies have been ordinary investors putting their money where their mouth is via regulated crowdfunding platforms such as Abundance Investment. Labour should also be celebrating those local councils that have engaged their citizens directly, by issuing or pledging to issue Local Climate Bonds, including Labour’s newly won council of Westminster. These raise funds directly from residents, paying a fair return to fund council efforts to decarbonise their economy, ranging from solar energy to EV charging, biodiversity to waste recycling. They are democratic finance in action and can transform the political narrative of the transition to net zero. The chaos of the last few months has offered Labour a unique opportunity to bring a consistent and clear message to consumers, businesses and markets that the transition to net zero is not a cost to be borne, but an opportunity to seize. Investment in green infrastructure and support for green businesses (and the solutions they are creating) is the route to sound money and sustainable growth.

Ted O’Brien, the shadow minister for climate change and energy, issued a statement on Friday saying he was “launching a grassroots community engagement program” under the banner “Time to Talk Nuclear”. He urged Australians to “join the conversation” by completing a short survey on the website, with the first question being: “What do you think could be the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia?” Guardian Australia can reveal the web domain was registered by Helixos Pty Ltd, a Sydney-based consulting company whose projects include “supporting the commercialisation of new nuclear energy technology”. Helixos lists the US company NuScale Power as one of its clients. Helixos says on its own website that NuScale Power “is reinventing nuclear energy and Helixos is helping them bring it to market”. It adds: “Helixos also provides training for employees to become technology ambassadors and engage with stakeholders and the public.” A search of domain records for O’Brien’s website shows the contact name for the domain registration is Lenka Kollar, a nuclear engineer who co-founded Helixos in 2020. She previously held the role of director of strategy and external relations for NuScale Power. In that previous role, Kollar was “working to bring NuScale’s small modular reactor to market through business plan development and clean energy outreach”, according to a profile published in 2017. Kollar addressed a Global Uranium Conference in Adelaide last month on the topic “reaching net zero with nuclear energy”. In tweets summarising her speech, Kollar said: “The time is now for Australians to have a conversation on nuclear energy and potentially overturn the ban.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup It is understood O’Brien engaged Helixos – which also does design work – as a contractor to support the development of the website. As part of designing the website it also registered the domain name. A source close to the matter said O’Brien’s team had sought out Helixos, believing it was ideal for the job because of its familiarity with the topic of nuclear energy. But the source said O’Brien had come up with the idea of the survey and the questions, and paid for the work himself. In a written response, O’Brien said the purpose of the survey and the use of collected data had “all been openly and accurately communicated”. “I’m personally paying for the grassroots community campaign ‘Time to Talk Nuclear’ out of my own back pocket because I think it’s an important conversation to have with the Australian people,” O’Brien said. “As we assess the prospect for nuclear energy moving forward, I will continue to seek assistance from people who are experts in the field.” The vice-president of marketing and communications for NuScale Power, Diane Hughes, said: “Helixos does in fact provide services for NuScale Power. “However, outside of providing an example image of our small modular reactor technology, NuScale does not have any involvement in the website, survey, nor outreach on advanced nuclear technologies being conducted by Mr O’Brien.” Helixos and Kollar were also contacted for comment. Helixos describes itself as a business that works “at the intersection of strategy consulting and technical advisory, specialising in cleantech commercialisation” and says it acts in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Helixos’s projects are listed openly on its own website. It works with the Energy Policy Institute of Australia “on editing public policy papers to promote progressive, technology-inclusive energy policy”, including one focusing on “the ability of small modular reactors (SMRs) to support a ‘just transition’ for coal communities in Australia”. Helixos states it worked with SMR Nuclear Technology Pty Ltd “to develop a proactive stakeholder engagement strategy” to “help achieve the main goal of having nuclear energy considered as part of Australia’s future energy mix”. Robert Pritchard, who is both chair of SMR Nuclear Technology and executive director of the Energy Policy Institute of Australia, declined to comment. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said in his budget reply speech that the Coalition wanted “an intelligent conversation on the role that these new-age nuclear technologies might or might not be able to play” in Australia. Announcing the “grassroots community engagement program” on Friday, O’Brien said the starting point would be “an online survey that will open a two-way conversation with the Australian public about the benefits and concerns of advanced nuclear technology becoming part of Australia’s future energy mix”. “Other countries are reducing their emissions while keeping costs down and their network secure with nuclear energy,” O’Brien said. “The question is - should we? Together with the Australian people, let’s find out.” The survey has only three mandatory questions, starting with views on the benefits of nuclear energy in Australia. It then asks what concerns, if any, the participant holds about nuclear energy, followed by any questions they might have. There is an optional section to “stay informed” by submitting an email address and postcode to O’Brien’s team. O’Brien’s website also sets out frequently asked questions such as: “Is nuclear energy clean?” The answer states: “Yes! Nuclear power’s total life-cycle carbon emissions and raw material requirements are the lowest among other energy sources, even lower than wind and solar.” The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has previously accused the Coalition of pushing the nuclear debate as a “rearguard attempt to undermine and deny the transition to renewables”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-21T22:08:01Z","webTitle":"California’s last nuclear power plant gets $1bn funding to extend life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/21/california-nuclear-power-plant-biden-grant","fields":{"headline":"California’s last nuclear power plant gets $1bn funding to extend life","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"California’s last nuclear plant could get a new lease on life after the Biden administration announced the approval of up to $1.1bn in conditional funding on Monday. The grant funds may offer a path to keeping the ageing facility known as Diablo Canyon online beyond its scheduled shutdown in 2025. Tucked against picturesque bluffs along California’s central coast, the plant has faced a spate of controversies over the decades, for its impact on underwater ecosystems, the production of toxic waste and its proximity to earthquake fault lines. Its planned closure by 2025 seemed an all-but-certain step in California’s ambitious journey toward a greener future. But concerns over the state’s ability to generate enough green energy to fill the gap left by the plant’s closure grew as the deadline neared. The state is far from finding a reliable and climate-conscious replacement for the energy produced by the plant. The largest single-source provider in the state generates more than 8% of California’s electricity, enough to supply more than 3 million residents. California is facing steep energy challenges that are only expected to worsen as the climate crisis intensifies. It’s an issue being grappled with in states across the US. The nuclear power industry’s 92 reactors generate more than half of the country’s virtually carbon-free electricity, but about a dozen reactors have closed since 2013 in the face of competition from renewable energy and plants that burn plentiful natural gas. As part of its effort to fight the climate crisis, the Biden administration set aside these grant funds to keep struggling nuclear plants online. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has also been among those strongly advocating for extending the life of Diablo Canyon, thereby giving the state more time to complete its ambitious green energy transition. In September, the governor pushed state lawmakers to approve a $1bn loan to keep the facility running an additional five years. The federal funds – the terms of which are still being negotiated – would help cover operating costs and be doled out over the course of four years. Diablo Canyon still has obstacles to cross though, most significantly the need for a renewed license from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Significant upgrades were needed to ensure the plant could continue to operate safely and sustainably. And there are still vocal critics of any plan to keep it open. “The danger of Diablo Canyon is that it is a tempting way of somehow assuming that there’s an easy way to avoid responsibility for the next phases of the clean energy transition,” said Ralph Cavanagh, the energy co-director of the environmental advocacy organization Natural Resources Defense Council’s Climate and clean energy program, who helped negotiated the plant’s decommission. Critics also highlight how the region is vulnerable to earthquakes and that there is no permanent place for disposing of radioactive nuclear waste. Suzanne Hosn, a spokesperson for PG&amp;E, the utility company that operates the plant, said Diablo can “safely withstand extreme natural events, including potential earthquakes, tsunamis and flooding”. Hosn pointed to analyses performed in 2015 by the NRC after the 2011 crisis at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan that was slammed by a tsunami, releasing radioactive materials and forcing the evacuation of some 80,000 residents. The NRC said in the 2015 reports that Diablo was safe from tsunamis including ones generated by underwater landslides and earthquakes. Calling nuclear the “nation’s largest source of clean electricity”, US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, said the grant was a “critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power”. Biden has set a goal of decarbonizing the grid by 2035, and the administration is relying on nuclear energy to play a part. The grant is intended to ensure that plants like Diablo Canyon can stay afloat. “We can protect these facilities and the communities they serve,” Granholm said.

At least three and up to five of that eight will be Virginia-class submarines it will buy from the United States. The “only actual promise” under Aukus is for Australia to build three nuclear powered submarines, Greens senator David Shoebridge said. It has been widely reported that all eight submarines will be SSN-Aukus boats built in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The misunderstanding appears to have crept in because, while successive governments have talked about acquiring eight submarines under the Aukus program, those submarines will not all be SSN-Aukus submarines. Vice admiral Jonathan Mead, the navy’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce chief, told estimates last week the government had “indicated eight nuclear powered submarines for Australia”. “Based on our modelling and working with our US and UK partners, we are looking to have a fleet of eight SSNs for the Royal Australian Navy in the mid-2050s,” he said. The Greens senator David Shoebridge then said: “Sorry, eight Aukus-SSN?” To which Mead replied: “No, eight nuclear powered submarines. That includes three of the Virginias.” The majority of reports on the Aukus submarine program refer to eight Aukus submarines, to be built in Australia. The defence minister, Richard Marles, has consistently referred to the Aukus plan to acquire a “fleet of eight nuclear-powered submarines”, not SSN-Aukus submarines. He has said the threat of a capability gap as the existing Collins class submarines are retired and before the SSN-Aukus starts to roll out in the 2040s is why they arranged with the US to get the three Virginia class submarines. “But were those timelines to slip, there is the option to have four and then potentially five Virginias,” he has said. When Aukus was first announced by the former prime minister Scott Morrison, he promised to find the “optimal pathway” to deliver “at least eight submarines”. When the “optimal pathway” was announced in March, the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, described the SSN-Aukus as a “new, conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine, based on a British design and incorporating cutting edge Australian, UK and US technologies”. “This will be an Australian sovereign capability, built by Australians, commanded by the Royal Australian Navy and sustained by Australians in Australian shipyards, with construction to begin this decade,” he said, while describing the 20,000 jobs and increased skills set to flow from the project as well as the plan to buy Virginia submarines. The defence department’s guide to the optimal pathway mentions the possibility of up to five US boats, but no overall number for the SSN-Aukus. The US president, Joe Biden, said the SSN-Aukus would “feature cutting edge propulsion technology and provide unmatched stealth and manoeuvrability”. He confirmed the US would sell three Virginia-class submarines to Australia, “with the potential to sell up to two more if needed”. But “selling subs” was not the ultimate goal, he said. “It’s developing something new together. We’re calling it the SSN-Aukus.” The UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said the new submarine would be “one of the most advanced nuclear-powered subs the world has ever known”. Shoebridge continued to question Mead in the May estimates about the number of SSN-Aukus submarines to be built. “The decision to go beyond eight nuclear powered submarines would be a question for a government in the future,” Mead said. The secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty, said the government had been “very upfront” about deciding on five SSN-Aukus submarines. “But [defence minister Richard Marles] has also said that a future government will take a decision about acquiring additional SSN-Aukus,” he said. “In Mr Marles’s view, once we have that production line going, he thinks we will involve ourselves in a continual shipbuilding production run of SSNs in Adelaide.” The Australian Industry and Defence Network chief executive, Brent Clark, said a future government might decide to keep building submarines, but the timeframes are so long it starts to become a “flight of fantasy”. “We don’t know what a government in five election cycles will do … it may determine it doesn’t want a nuclear submarine at all. It may want underwater drones,” he said. That uncertainty made it difficult for industry to plan, he said, adding that the uncertainty had been increased by the defence strategic review emphasising speed and capability “trumping” Australian content. Shoebridge said he was surprised by Mead’s admission, but “nowhere near as surprised as workers” would be, and that it made the Aukus decision appear a “thought bubble”. “Labor’s promise that a future government might decide to build some more boats from 2060 is about as useful as flyscreen on a submarine,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-considering-sending-cluster-munitions-to-ukraine-reports","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-30T17:59:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russia reducing its presence at nuclear power plant, says Ukraine; Pope says war seems to have ‘no end’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-considering-sending-cluster-munitions-to-ukraine-reports","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-considering-sending-cluster-munitions-to-ukraine-reports","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Russia reducing its presence at nuclear power plant, says Ukraine; Pope says war seems to have ‘no end’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny, said in an interview published on Friday. A teacher and another employee of a school in the Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. Pope Francis said there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow. Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) has claimed. GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. Ukrainian prosecutors charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson, some of them as young as one, Reuters reported. Overnight, the Russian army reportedly attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s air force claimed four S-300 missiles and 13 Shahed drones were fired, and that air defence forces shot down 10 drones. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to several news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say. Speaking at a press conference, Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has said the commission “will focus prudently on the windfall profits from the immobilised assets of the Russian central bank”. Belgium’s prime minister said earlier on Friday that the windfall profit from Russia’s frozen assets in Europe could provide $3.27bn (£2.57bn) a year to rebuild Ukraine. The Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces is making slow but steady progress, US army general Mark Milley said on Friday. “It’s going slower than people had predicted. Doesn’t surprise me,” Miley told an audience at the National Press Club. “It is advancing steadily, deliberately, working its way through very difficult minefields, etc.” The comments came after Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, told Ukrainian television on Friday: “If we talk about the entire frontline, both east and south, we have seized the strategic initiative and are advancing in all directions. “In the south, we are moving with varying success. Sometimes there are days when it is more than a kilometre, sometimes less than a kilometre, sometimes up to 2 kilometres,” she said. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. The award-winning Ukrainian writer and war crimes researcher Victoria Amelina was critically injured in a Russian missile strike on a pizza restaurant in eastern Ukraine this week. Human activists say the attack on the crowded building, which killed 12 people including 14-year-old twins and injured at least 60 others, was a war crime. The Ria Lounge was one of the most popular restaurants in Kramatorsk and was filled with civilians when it was hit on Tuesday evening. “There were no military objects that could have been a legal target for the attack around that day,” PEN Ukraine and the war crimes campaign group Truth Hounds said in a statement that confirmed Amelina was among injured people.

Ukraine hopes to use Spain’s rotating EU presidency to try to “gain influence” in Latin America, where several countries have opposed Kyiv’s efforts to retake territory occupied by Russia, President Zelenskiy told Spanish media. Speaking on Friday on the eve of a visit by Pedro Sánchez, Spain’s prime minister, Zelenskiy said several unspecified countries had blocked an invitation extended to him by Sánchez to take part in an EU-Latin American summit in Brussels in mid-July, Reuters reports. “We have a peace formula, and Pedro has supported us a lot. He has a constant dialogue with Latin America and they listen to him, it’s a fact. But I’ll say frankly that some Latin American countries are blocking the decision and this invitation,” he said in comments from Kyiv aired by state broadcaster TVE. “I want them not only to join the peace formula, but to stand against war,” Ukraine’s president added. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from Ukraine: Reuters has more on what was discussed during the telephone call with President Putin and Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister (See post at 14:02). The Indian government said Putin, who will also join Modi on Tuesday for a virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, informed the prime minister about the recent developments in Russia during their conversation. “While discussing the situation in Ukraine, PM (Modi) reiterated his call for dialogue and diplomacy,” the government said in a statement. India remains dependent on Moscow for its defence needs and has sharply increased its imports of cheap Russian oil. An oligarch who made a fortune in Russia and is under Ukrainian sanctions has UK residency after being granted a special visa for rich people. Pavel Fuks, a Ukrainian national who had sanctions imposed upon him in 2021, is also under criminal investigation for fraud and tax evasion in his home country. But the Guardian has established that Fuks, known as a regular at an exclusive Mayfair restaurant, was granted a so-called golden visa in 2012, followed by indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 2017. “It’s effective as of today,” his spokesperson said. All accusations against Fuks in Ukraine “are exclusively political and are not confirmed by court decisions,” the spokesperson said, adding that his lawyers “are challenging the sanctions and charges in court”. Fuks says the sanctions are legally flawed.

Overnight, the Russian army reportedly attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s air force claimed four S-300 missiles and 13 “Shahed” drones were fired, and that air defence forces shot down 10 drones. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to multiple news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say. Russian communications watchdog Roskomnadzor has blocked media outlets linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, chief of the Wagner mercenary group which staged a brief mutiny last Saturday, Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on Friday. Last Saturday, Russia appeared to have averted an immediate descent into civil war after Prigozhin said he would order his Wagner fighters to end their march on Moscow and return to their bases in southern Russia. Drone strikes hit an airbase in eastern Libya used by mercenaries of the Russian paramilitary group Wagner early on Friday without causing any casualties, a military official told AFP. AFP reports: The origin of the overnight strikes on the Al-Kharruba airbase, about 90 miles southwest of Benghazi, was “unknown”, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The base that was hit is “where members of the Wagner group are located”, the official said, adding there were “no victims”. Reports carried by Libyan and Arab news websites claimed that the strikes had been launched from aircraft that belong to the UN-recognised government in divided Libya. But the government of National Unity based in the capital Tripoli denied any involvement. Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny, said in an interview published on Friday. Zaluzhny told the Washington Post he was frustrated by the slow deliveries of promised weaponry from the west. It “pisses me off” that some in the west complain about the slow start and progress to the push against Russian occupying forces in the country’s south, he said. Zaluzhny said his western supporters would not themselves launch an offensive without air superiority, but Ukraine was still awaiting F-16 fighters promised by its allies. “I do not need 120 planes. I’m not going to threaten the whole world. A very limited number would be enough,” he told the newspaper. “But they are needed. Because there is no other way. Because the enemy is using a different generation of aviation,” Zaluzhny said, adding that he had a fraction of the artillery shells that Russia was firing, the Washington Post reported. A teacher and another employee of a school in Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. It posted to its official Telegram channel: Russian troops shelled a school in the village of Serhiivka in the Pokrovsk district of Donetsk region: a teacher and the chief accountant were killed, and six other employees were injured. At the time of the shelling, there were 12 employees at the school. Part of the building is completely destroyed. The post was accompanied by images that showed officials inspecting the damage. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s parliament voted on Friday to return tax rates from the start of August to levels they were at before Russia’s invasion. The move is aimed at boosting budget revenues and complying with an International Monetary Fund lending program, Reuters reports. The government introduced tax cuts and other economic measures soon after Russia’s 24 February 2022 invasion to help businesses weather the disruption caused by the war. Ukraine depends heavily on foreign aid to finance its budget spending this year as the war is severely affecting the economy. Scrapping tax privileges and boosting budget revenues are vital conditions under the IMF’s $15.6bn (£12.3bn) lending programme. In Kramatorsk today, a funeral has been held for the 14-year-old twins Anna and Yuliia Aksenchenko who were among 12 people who were killed when a Russian missile hit a pizza restaurant in the eastern city on Tuesday evening. At the ceremony, a crowd of about 30 relatives, friends and local residents gathered to pay their respects. Max Hunder was there for Reuters, and described the scene, saying that the mother of the twins looked completely drained of vitality as she sat by the graves of her daughters. None of the family members were in any condition to speak to reporters, the girls’ godfather said. The girls lay in coffins with open caskets, but were covered with a glistening white and gold sheet. Mourners said the girls had been dressed in wedding dresses for their burial, a custom in Ukraine for girls who die too young to marry. Initially unable to find two wedding dresses in a city not far from the front and where wedding parlours are closed, friends and family issued an online appeal for well-wishers to donate two dresses so that the girls could be buried. “This is a tradition. If girls become angels, go up to heaven before getting married, they are dressed in wedding dresses so they can find their other half there,” said Viktoria Kushka, 50, a teacher who taught Anna and Yuliia in first grade. Speaking in one of the classrooms at the nearby school where the girls studied, Kushka recalled her memories of the girls, saying: “They were two little sunshines. Smiling, big light blue eyes. Always together, always supporting each other.” In a telephone call on Friday with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, Vladimir Putin discussed the situation around Ukraine and how Moscow had resolved an armed mercenary mutiny, the Kremlin said. It said that Modi had expressed support for what the Kremlin called the Russian leadership’s decisive actions in handling the mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group last Saturday, Reuters reports. The Russian rouble tumbled past 89 against the dollar for the first time in more than 15 months on Friday, Reuters reports. Bank of Russia deputy governor Alexei Zabotkin said reduced export revenues and the balance of payments were determining the rouble’s weakening, which he said carried no risks to financial stability. Moscow has said the Wagner mercenary group, which recently attempted a short-lived mutiny in Russia, would continue to work in Africa if governments on the continent decided to maintain contracts with the private military group, AFP reports. “The future of the agreements between African countries and the Wagner private military company is above all up to the governments of the countries concerned,” Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, told reporters during a briefing. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, ordered top military commanders on Friday to strengthen Ukraine’s northern military sector following the arrival of Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Russian Wagner mercenary group, in Belarus. “The decision... is for commander-in-chief (Valeriy) Zaluzhnyi and ‘North’ commander (Serhiy) Naev to implement a set of measures to strengthen this direction,” Zelenskiy said on Telegram. He said government and military leaders had also heard a report from Ukrainian intelligence and security forces on the situation in Belarus, Ukraine’s northern neighbour, Reuters reports. On Thursday, satellite images emerged of a military base south-east of the Belarus capital, Minsk, that appeared to show new facilities set up in recent days, suggesting the swift construction of a base for Wagner. Russian media have reported that Wagner, whose leader, Prigozhin, arrived in Belarus on Tuesday, could set up a new base at a vacant military facility near the town of Osipovichi, about 50 miles (90km) from Minsk. Pope Francis said on Friday there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow, Reuters reports. “The tragic reality of this war that seems to have no end demands of everyone a common creative effort to imagine and forge paths of peace,” the pope told a religious delegation from the Patriarch of Constantinople. The Vatican said in a subsequent statement that the pope’s envoy, Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, had finished his consultations in Moscow, where he had met Yuri Ushakov, one of President Putin’s advisers, and Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. “(The visit was) aimed at identifying humanitarian initiatives, which could open roads to peace,” the statement said. Francis has repeatedly called for an end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In May, President Zelenskiy asked Francis to back Kyiv’s peace plan, and the pope indicated the Vatican would help in the repatriation of Ukrainian children taken by Russians. The World Bank has approved a $1.5bn loan to Ukraine to support the country’s development and reconstruction policies, according to the organisation’s press service. The loan, as reported on by the Kyiv Post, will be used to ensure transparency in the use of public funds and to strengthen the social security system. Kazakhstan has announced it has uncovered online efforts to recruit its citizens to fight alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, AFP reports. The warning from regional officials in the Kremlin-friendly country late on Thursday follows reports in local media that Kazakhstan citizens have been killed in Ukraine. Both the Russian military and the Wagner mercenary group have targeted citizens of the ex-Soviet country in central Asia to join their ranks. Prosecutors in the northern Kostanay region, which borders Russia and is home to a large Russian minority, warned residents not to “succumb” to attempts on social media to enlist men into Moscow’s forces. The region is home to about 880,000 people, 41% of whom are ethnic Russians, government figures show. “On the territory of our region, attempts were made to recruit the local population to the territory of the Russian Federation in order to participate in the armed conflict in Ukraine,” the region’s prosecutor’s office said in a statement. Wimbledon has banned its merchandise from being sold in Russia and Belarus as part of its ongoing condemnation of the war in Ukraine. The All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) has said it will not allow any of its products to be shipped to the two countries due to Vladimir Putin’s illegal invasion. An AELTC spokesperson said: We continue to totally condemn Russia’s illegal invasion and our wholehearted support remains with the people of Ukraine. We will donate £1 for each ticket-holder attending the championships to the British Red Cross Ukraine relief efforts, which will result in a contribution of more than half a million pounds. We will also welcome 1,000 refugees to join us for a day at Wimbledon, with their food and transport provided. We are maintaining the ban on broadcasting the championships in Russia and Belarus, as well as the ban on Wimbledon merchandise being sold and shipped to both countries. You can read the full story from my colleague Emine Sinmaz below: More information has come in about the ice hockey player from Poland’s major league who has apparently been charged with spying for Russia (See post at 09:38). The man, a Russian citizen, was reportedly arrested on 11 June in Silesia, southern Poland, and is believed to be part of a Russian spy ring. According to the national prosecutor’s office, the detained man is the 14th person arrested as part of an investigation into a “spy ring collaborating with Russian special services”. “The suspects, identified as foreigners from across the eastern border, carried out intelligence as well as propaganda activities against Poland,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement. Among their activities were “monitoring of railway routes” and spreading “propaganda against Nato, Poland and the Polish government’s policy”, it said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Moscow had demanded an explanation from Poland over its arrest of Russian citizens, state news agency RIA reported. Russia is scaling back its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plower plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) warned on Friday, with staff told to relocate to Crimea and military patrols scaled back. The agency’s chief, Kyrlo Budanov, has said that Moscow approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four out of six power units, as well as a cooling pond. Last week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the Russians were plotting a “terrorist attack”. According to the GUR, several representatives of Russia’s state nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, have already left. Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom have been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea, it said. The intelligence agency named three senior individuals who had already departed: the plant’s chief inspector, the head of the legal department, and the deputy in charge of supplies. It said the number of Russian soldiers at the station and in the nearby town of Enerhodar had reduced. Since seizing the plant last year, the Russian army has turned it into a full-blown military base. It moved hardware into the turbine halls including armoured vehicles and ammunition. Soldiers used the territory to bombard Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro reservoir. This has mostly dried up after the Kakhovka dam downstream was blown up earlier this month. Western governments and Kyiv say Russia deliberately sabotaged the dam in order to impede Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Former plant workers said it would be difficult to damage the reactors, which were protected by thick steel and concrete. But they said the small cooling pond – which the Russians have allegedly mined – was more vulnerable, as was a dry storage area used for spent nuclear fuel. An explosion in the cooling pond could lead to a partial nuclear meltdown similar to the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the US state of Pennsylvania, said Oleksiy Kovynyev, a former senior engineer. In this scenario, most radiation would be contained. But he added: “Of course, if you are an absolute maniac and open the ventilation channels this would throw out radiation.” Kovynyev said the dry storage area at the plant contained 24 spent “fuel assemblies”, sealed in 120 “hermetic” thick steel casks. “In a normal situation they are absolutely safe. [But] if you wanted, you could destroy them. You could shell several times. This could cause a nuclear accident with radiation release.” He said he remained “optimistic” that no disaster would take place. Before the full-scale invasion, the plant employed 11,500 workers. An estimated 2,500 remain. Some, including the plant’s Ukrainian director, have signed contracts with Rosatom. Others have refused and have had their security passes revoked. Staff receive salaries from Russia as well as Ukraine. The GUR said on Friday that personnel remaining at the station had been instructed to “blame Ukraine in case of any emergencies”. Russia has claimed that Kyiv has endangered the station by shelling it. Ukraine has urged the international community to pay attention to the alarming situation at the plant and to put pressure on Moscow to step back from the brink. Officials point out that Zelenskiy warned last year that the Kremlin was preparing to blow up the Kakhovka dam – something that happened seven months later. The chief rabbi of Ukraine, Moshe Azman, urged the “entire world community” to do everything in its power to stop a possible catastrophe. This week Russia told the UN security council it had no plans to blow up the plant. It previously assured the council it would not invade Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors on Friday charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson. Reuters reports: They are the first suspects to be charged by Ukraine, which says more than 19,000 children have been illegally transferred to Russia or Russian-held territory, officials told Reuters. The charges brought by Ukraine’s prosecutors follow a wider investigation carried out in cooperation with The Hague-based international criminal court, the chief prosecutor of which visited the Kherson Children’s Home. On Friday, the charges were filed in Ukraine, a pre-trial stage when prosecutors determine [whether] there is sufficient evidence to suspect a person of committing a criminal offence. The ICC, the world’s permanent war crimes tribunal, issued an arrest warrant in March against Russian president Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights, accusing them of the war crime of illegally deporting hundreds of children from orphanages and children’s homes in Russian-occupied Ukraine. The Kremlin on Wednesday again dismissed allegations that Russia had violated children’s rights in Ukraine and said that, on the contrary, its armed forces were rescuing children from conflict zones. Prosecution documents seen by Reuters allege that 48 orphans were taken from the Kherson regional children’s home in September and October and relocated to Moscow and Russian-occupied Crimea. If proven, this is a violation of the laws and customs of war under the 1949 Geneva conventions, and punishable by up 12 years in prison under Ukrainian law, the document seen by Reuters said. The current whereabouts of the orphans, ranging from one to four years old, is uncertain, prosecutors said. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said Moscow will emerge from the aftermath of a recent armed insurrection by the Wagner mercenary group “stronger” than before, AFP reports. “Russia has always overcome all its problems... it comes out stronger and stronger. It will be the same this time, too. This process has already begun,” Lavrov told journalists during a briefing in Moscow, after the rebels marched on the capital last week to oust the country’s military leadership. The revolt, led by mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, posed the most serious threat to Vladimir Putin’s decades-long rule and spurred Kremlin efforts to disband the private military outfit. Answering a question from foreign media, Lavrov said: “thank you for your concern about our national interests, but you shouldn’t be worried”. Hello everyone, this is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be running the blog until 7pm (UK time). Please do feel free to get in touch on Twitter if you have any story tips. A Ukrainian senior defence official has repeated that the ciuntry’s troops are advancing in all directions of their counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces. “If we talk about the entire frontline, both east and south, we have seized the strategic initiative and are advancing in all directions,” the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, told Ukrainian television. Russia is gradually reducing its personnel numbers at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday. The GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. It said Ukrainian employees who had signed a contract with Rosatom had also been advised to depart. Employees should leave by 5 July, it said, and have been told to preferably head for the Crimea peninsula. Overnight, the Russian army attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s air force claimed four S-300 missiles and 13 “Shahed” drones were fired, and that air defence forces shot down 10 drones. Ukraine’s general staff has claimed that it struck the headquarters and storage depots of Russian troops in the suburbs of Berdiansk. Local Russian-imposed officials said that air defence had repelled the attack. Video distributed on social media appeared to show smoke rising over the occupied city. In Kramatorsk, a makeshift memorial has been set up displaying pictures of some of the people killed in a missile strike on a restaurant earlier this week. Twelve people died and at least 56 people were injured, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Friday that he believed the west was aiming to freeze the conflict in Ukraine to buy time to pump more arms into the country. He also accused the west of having a “schizophrenic” approach to the conflict, saying they first wanted to see Russia lose on the battlefield and for its leaders to go on trial – and only then to press for peace in Ukraine. Lavrov also described the west’s attitude to the Black Sea grain deal as “outrageous” and lamented the fact that grain was not being exported to the world’s poorest countries. Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine after their leader refused to sign contracts with the Kremlin. Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to sign the contracts, according to the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov. Overnight, the BBC has been reporting that recruitment continues at Wagner mercenary offices across Russia, despite the fallout from the weekend’s armed mutiny. Sweden’s prime minister said on Friday his Hungarian counterpart had assured him that Budapest would not delay the Nordic country’s Nato accession, after reports that Hungary’s parliament would delay a ratification of the membership. Hungary rejects the European Commission’s plans to grant more money to Ukraine and is not willing to contribute additional money to finance the EU’s increased debt service costs, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on Friday. Poland has detained a Russian ice hockey athlete, who plays for a first division Polish team, on spying charges, prosecutors said on Friday, describing him as the 14th person to be arrested from one espionage network. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has accused Ukraine of committing war crimes by stationing troops and military equipment in civilian areas. He denied on Friday that Russia’s armed forces intentionally attacked civilian targets in Ukraine, saying they only targeted military infrastructure or other military targets. Speaking at a news conference, Reuters reports that Lavrov accused Ukraine of deploying troops and heavy weapons to civilian infrastructure such as in schools and apartment buildings. He said such tactics were war crimes. Russia staged its latest invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Since that time, the UN has recorded more than 19,000 casualties, including 6,000 deaths, among the civilian population of Ukraine in areas controlled by the Kyiv government. Earlier this week, 12 people, including four children, were killed when a Russian missile hit a restaurant in Kramatorsk. An eight-month-old baby was among the wounded. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has been giving a wide-ranging press briefing this morning. He says he believes the west is aiming to freeze the conflict in Ukraine to buy time to pump more arms into the country. This accusation mirrors a frequent talking point from Ukrainian officials – a fear that peace talks or a stalemate on the ground would give Russia time to re-equip for a renewed push into the county. Reuters reports Lavrov accused western countries of taking a “schizophrenic” approach to the conflict, saying they first wanted to see Russia lose on the battlefield and for its leaders to go on trial – and only then to press for peace in Ukraine. On the topic of the forced deportation of children, which the international criminal court has accused Russia of carrying out, Lavrov said Russia had evacuated children from orphanages in war zones. The Ukrainian government says it has identified more than 19,000 children whom it claims have been unlawfully deported or otherwise separated from their parents or guardians. He also accused the west of hypocrisy for attacking Russia over its alleged human rights abuses in Ukraine while, in his view, ignoring what he described as “racist” statements by Ukrainian authorities about killing Russians. Suspilne reports that Ukraine’s general staff has claimed that earlier today it struck the headquarters and storage depots of Russian troops in the suburbs of Berdiansk. Unverified social media footage showed smoke rising in the sky above the occupied city earlier. Russian sources say that air defences repelled the attack. The claims have not been independently verified. A Ukrainian senior defence official has repeated that its troops are advancing in all directions of their counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces. Since the start of its counteroffensive, Ukraine says it has reasserted control over clusters of villages in the south-east although Russia still holds swathes of territory in the east, south and south-east. “If we talk about the entire frontline, both east and south, we have seized the strategic initiative and are advancing in all directions,” the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, told Ukrainian television, Reuters reports. Poland has detained a Russian ice hockey athlete, who plays for a first division Polish team, on spying charges, prosecutors said on Friday. They described him as the 14th person to be arrested from one espionage network. “Russian spies are falling in one by one!” wrote justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro on Twitter, Reuters reports. “A spy who acted under the guise of an athlete was caught. The Russian was a player of a first division club.” The hockey player was taken into custody in the southern Polish region of Silesia, prosecutors said in a statement. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Friday described the west’s attitude to the Black Sea grain deal as “outrageous” and lamented the fact that grain was not being exported to the world’s poorest countries. Moscow has again been threatening not to extend the deal. It says there are obstacles to exporting its own agricultural products which need to be removed. These include financial sanctions on the banking and insurance sectors, and the reopening of an ammonia pipeline that would allow Russia to export ammonia via Ukraine’s port of Odesa, a city frequently targeted by Russian missile strikes. Speaking in a news briefing, Lavrov also called for an expansion in the membership of the UN security council to give more representation to Asian, African and Latin American countries. “A majority of the world does not want to live according to western rules,” Reuters quotes him saying. Sweden’s prime minister said on Friday that his Hungarian counterpart had assured him that Budapest would not delay the Nordic country’s Nato accession, following reports that Hungary’s parliament would delay ratification of Sweden’s membership. “I spoke to Viktor Orbán yesterday and he confirmed very clearly that what he said to me last time still applies,” Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson said on Friday. “Hungary will not delay Sweden’s ratification process in any way,” he told the media. Reuters reports Kristersson did not specify whether Orban’s comments implied a vote could take place before the Nato summit in Vilnius. Russia is gradually reducing the number of personnel at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday. “According to the latest data, the occupation contingent is gradually leaving the territory of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant,” the main directorate of intelligence at the defence ministry (GUR) said on the Telegram messaging app. GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”, Reuters reports. It said Ukrainian employees who had signed a contract with Rosatom had also been advised to depart. Employees should leave by 5 July, it said, and had been told to preferably head for the Crimea peninsula, which Russia illegally seized from Ukraine in 2014. GUR said the number of military patrols was also gradually decreasing on the plant’s vast territory and in the nearby city of Enerhodar, and that personnel remaining at the plant had been told to blame Ukraine “in case of any emergency situations”. Russian authorities declined to comment on the claims when approached by Reuters. Ukraine and Russia have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the plant and its vicinity. Russia has occupied the plant since March 2022, and Kyiv accused Russia this month of planning a “terrorist” attack at the nuclear plant involving the release of radiation, an accusation which Russia has dismissed. Unverified video footage being shared on social media appears to show explosions in Berdiansk. On the Telegram messaging app, one of the Russian-imposed leaders in occupied Zaporizhzhia, Vladimir Rogov, shared the clip with this message: According to preliminary data, the Ukrainian armed forces militants tried to strike this morning with Storm Shadow missiles. The series of explosions heard is the result of the work of the Russian air defence, which successfully repelled an enemy attack on civilians on the outskirts of the city. The location and time the video clip was taken has not been verified by the Guardian. In Kramatorsk, a makeshift memorial has been set up carrying pictures of some of the people killed in a missile strike on a restaurant earlier this week. Twelve people died and at least 56 people were injured, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia claimed the strike was on a military target. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, offers this roundup of overnight news from across Ukraine: At night, the Russian army attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region: four S-300 missiles and 13 “Shahed” drones were fired, air defence forces shot down 10 drones, the air force reported. No people were injured in the night attack in Zaporizhzhia. In Mykolaiv a fire broke out due to the fall of fragments of downed drones, and there were no injuries. In the Lozova district of the Kharkiv region, a 13-year-old boy found an unknown explosive device in his own yard; he was hospitalised with a traumatic amputation of the fingers of his left hand, the state emergency service reported. The claims have not been independently verified. Hungary rejects the European Commission’s plans to grant more money to Ukraine and is not willing to contribute additional money to finance the EU’s increased debt service costs, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on Friday. “One thing is clear, we Hungarians … will not give more money to Ukraine until they say where the previous around €70bn worth of funds had gone,” Orban said. “And we find it utterly ridiculous and absurd that we should contribute more money to finance debt service costs of a loan from which we have still not received the funds we are entitled to get.” Orbán was speaking on the sidelines of the EU summit in Brussels. Budapest – along with Poland – has not received funds from the EU’s recovery fund amid a rule of law dispute. Reuters reports that on Thursday, EU leaders declared they would make long-term commitments to bolster Ukraine’s security as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged them to start work on a new round of sanctions against Russia. Orbán said there was almost no chance that EU member states would approve these financial plans and that a “long fight” would start. Overnight, the BBC has been reporting that recruitment continues at Wagner mercenary offices across Russia, despite the fallout from the weekend’s armed mutiny. It writes: Using a Russian phone number, we called more than a dozen recruitment centres saying, if asked, that we were inquiring on behalf of a brother. All those who replied confirmed that it was business as usual. From Kaliningrad in the west to Krasnodar in the south, no one believed the group was being disbanded. Several people who picked up the phone stressed that new members were signing contracts with the mercenary group itself, not the Russian defence ministry. “We are working. If something had changed, they’d have told us. But there’s nothing,” a female recruiter in Krasnodar, southern Russia, was clear. In Volgograd, the man we spoke to said that if someone signed up today, “I could deploy him tomorrow,” and confirmed that Belarus was now a possible destination. Sarah Rainsford, who compiled the report for the BBC, pointed out on Twitter the contrast between the treatment of the armed insurrectionist group Wagner and those who have peacefully opposed Russia’s president. The sound of explosions has been reported in the Russian-occupied city of Berdiansk. Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency is carrying a statement from a local Russian-imposed authority saying that at 8am Moscow time (6am BST): “According to preliminary information, the air defence system of the Russian Federation armed forces went off.” Citing regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin, Suspilne reports that two people – a 72-year-old woman and a 70-year-old man – have been injured this morning by Russian shelling in the region. The claims have not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Nato is nearing consensus on how to address Ukraine’s membership push at its coming summit and aims to show it is moving “above and beyond” an earlier vow to Kyiv, the US envoy to Nato has said. Agence France-Presse reports that Kyiv, backed by Nato allies in eastern Europe, has called for a commitment at the gathering in Lithuania in two weeks that it will join the military alliance when the war with Russia ends. Diplomats at Nato say the US has been reluctant to move beyond a 2008 pledge made in Bucharest that promised Ukraine would become a member but did not set a timeline. Nato’s 31 member countries are haggling over the exact wording on Ukraine’s potential membership for a final communique at the summit. The US ambassador to Nato, Julianne Smith, said on Thursday that the final version could begin to answer how Ukraine would eventually become an alliance member. I think most of us feel confident that we are going to be able to come to an agreement that will reflect where we are and that the Ukrainians will believe and feel is something above and beyond restating Bucharest. Smith said the alliance was getting closer to finding a consensus on the language but that she did not want to preempt the final phrasing. Spain will take on the EU’s rotating presidency on Saturday with the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, visiting Kyiv to show steadfast European support for Ukraine as it battles Russian forces, his office has said. The announcement was made as Sanchez attended an EU summit in Brussels, in which Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, participating via video link, confirmed the visit, Agence France-Presse reports. Spain will hold the EU presidency from July to the end of December, taking over from Sweden. The role puts ministers from the EU presidency country in the chair of most EU meetings, influencing the agenda and priorities of topics being decided. Zelenskiy told the summit that Sanchez’s visit “says much about the importance … for our Europe and the membership candidacy of Ukraine for the EU”. EU leaders declared they would make long-term commitments to bolster Ukraine’s security as the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged them to start work on a new round of sanctions against Russia. Reuters reports that at a summit in Brussels, the leaders restated their condemnation of Russia’s war against Ukraine and said the EU and its member countries “stand ready” to contribute to commitments that would help Ukraine defend itself in the long term. In a text summarising the summit’s conclusions, the leaders said on Thursday they would swiftly consider the form those commitments would take. Josep Borrell, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, suggested they could build on existing EU support, such as the European Peace Facility fund that has financed billions of euros in arms for Ukraine and a training mission for Ukrainian troops. “The military support to Ukraine has to [be for the] long haul,” Borrell said. Greta Thunberg has denounced the ecological havoc caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the lack of international reaction to the disaster. “Ecocide and environmental destruction is a form of warfare … as Ukrainians by this point know all too well – and so does Russia,” the Swedish climate activist said on Thursday during a visit to Kyiv as part of an international delegation investigating the environmental consequences of the conflict. And that’s why they are deliberately targeting the environment and people’s livelihoods and homes and therefore also destroying lives. Thunberg was speaking at a news conference along with Ukrainian presidential aide Andriy Yerma, Agence France-Presse also reports. She and the rest of the delegation met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the southern region of Kherson on 6 June caused disastrous flooding, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands of others to flee. Zelensky has criticised what he says is an inadequate international response to the disaster. A senior Czech official has labelled Russia a “direct military threat” to the Czech Republic and its eastern Nato allies as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued. Martin Povejsil, head of the Czech foreign ministry’s security department, said it was “impossible to rule out a direct military threat [from Russia] in the foreseeable future”. Agence France-Presse reports he was commenting on a new security strategy approved by the Czech government the previous day and designed to raise awareness of the security situation among the Czech public. “We can see how agendas that were until recently perceived as free of security aspects are gradually taking security into account,” Povejsil said on Thursday, naming science and research – prone to cyber-attacks and espionage – as an example. The security strategy says the Czech Republic should get ready “for the possibility that it could become part of an armed conflict”. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say. Yuriy Malashko, governor of the southern Ukrainian region that includes the plant, said the drills in Zaporizhzhia city and the district around it were intended to coordinate the response of all services to an “emergency situation” at the plant, Reuters reports. Ukraine accused Russia this month of planning a “terrorist” attack at the plant involving the release of radiation. Moscow denied the accusation. Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said on Thursday that he wrote to the UN security council and the secretary general, António Guterres, to say: We do not intend to blow up this NPP [nuclear power plant] we have no intention of doing so. Reuters television footage showed rescuers in protective gear and gas masks using dosimeters to check passenger cars and trucks for radiation levels and then cleaning wheels before vehicles underwent additional decontamination at specialised washing points. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to multiple news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Cluster munitions are bombs containing smaller bomblets that scatter as they drop from the air, causing wider damage. US officials said the decision from the White House was expected soon, CNN reported, while NBC News said it could come as early as next month. Politico reported that late last year the Biden administration said it had “concerns” about delivering the munitions to Ukraine, mainly for humanitarian reasons and also because the US didn’t assess Ukraine as needing them at that point. In other news: Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine after their leader refused to sign contracts with the Kremlin. Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to sign the contracts, according to the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov. He said that a few days before the attempted rebellion, Russia’s defence ministry announced that all groups performing combat missions must sign a contract with the ministry, Russian state news agency Tass reported. Prigozhin did not sign the contracts and was informed that Wagner would not take part in what the Kremlin calls the “special military operation” in Ukraine, according to Kartapolov, who added: “That is, funding, material resources will not be allocated.” The Kremlin has declined to answer questions about the whereabouts of Sergei Surovikin amid unconfirmed reports that the Russian army general had been detained and was being questioned by the security services. US intelligence has claimed that Surovikin, who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine, had prior knowledge of Prigozhin’s uprising, in which Wagner mercenaries captured the city of Rostov-on-Don and moved on Moscow before striking an amnesty deal. Surovikin has not been seen in public since last Saturday. Former US President Donald Trump has said now is the time for the US to try to broker a negotiated peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine and that Vladimir Putin has been “somewhat weakened” by Wagner’s aborted mutiny. “I want people to stop dying over this ridiculous war,” Trump told Reuters in an interview. Trump said everything would be “subject to negotiation” if he were president. Ukrainian forces are advancing “slowly but surely” on the frontlines in the east and south-east of the country as well as around the longstanding flashpoint of Bakhmut, senior military officials have said. Ukrainian commander-in-chief Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi told the chair of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, that his forces had “succeeded in seizing the strategic initiative”. Ukrainian forces had made advances in sectors in the south designated by two occupied towns, Berdiansk and Mariupol, the Ukrainian deputy defence minister said. “Every day, there is an advance,” Hanna Maliar said on national television. “Yes, the advances are slow, but they are sure.” Mike Pence met Volodymyr Zelenskiy during surprise Ukraine trip. Pence is the first Republican presidential candidate to meet the Ukrainian president during the US campaign. Pence told NBC News: “Coming here just as a private citizen … just steels my resolve to do my part, to continue to call for strong American support for our Ukrainian friends and allies.” Russia has ruled out Switzerland as location for peace talks, saying it had “lost its status as a neutral state” after supporting EU sanctions. Russia’s ambassador to Switzerland said Moscow could not accept any Swiss-hosted peace summit on Ukraine after it joined EU sanctions against his country, adding that Switzerland had lost its reputation for neutrality. The EU is considering imposing a levy on interest made from frozen Russian cash that could raise about €3bn ($3.3bn, £2.6bn) a year to help Ukraine’s recovery from the war. A “windfall contribution” was to be discussed by EU leaders at a current European Council summit in an attempt to harness the value of sovereign Russian funds immobilised by sanctions. The death toll in a Russian rocket attack on a pizza restaurant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk has risen to 12, including four children. Ukraine’s state emergency service said at least 56 people were injured, some critically, when two Iskander missiles were fired into the restaurant in the city centre on Tuesday evening. The regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said rescue attempts had ended. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it killed two Ukrainian generals and up to 50 officers in a missile strike when referring to this attack. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence agency has arrested a local man it accused of helping the Russians carry out the attack on Kramatorsk. The SBU said it had arrested an employee of a gas transportation company who helped coordinate the strike and allegedly sent video footage of the cafe to the Russian military. It provided no evidence for the claims. The Russian-imposed acting governor of the occupied Kherson region has denied claims that Ukrainian troops had succeeded in establishing any kind of bridgehead over the Dnipro River at the location of the Antonivskyi Bridge. Vladimir Saldo also claimed Russian forces had repelled multiple landing attempts in the area. The Israeli prime minister said he had rejected calls from Washington and Kyiv to arm Ukraine due to “concerns that I don’t think any of the western allies of Ukraine have”. Benjamin Netanyahu said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that Israel needed “freedom of action” in Syria, where Israel often bombs Iranian targets near Russian forces. He said he also had fears that Israeli weaponry could be captured in Ukraine and turned over to Iran. Hungary’s vote on Sweden joining Nato has again been delayed, with the Hungarian parliament’s house committee rejecting a proposal to schedule the vote on the ratification of Sweden’s membership for next week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/27/ineos-in-talks-with-rolls-royce-to-build-mini-nuclear-power-plant-in-scotland","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T17:43:12Z","webTitle":"Ineos in talks with Rolls-Royce on mini-nuclear power plant technology ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/27/ineos-in-talks-with-rolls-royce-to-build-mini-nuclear-power-plant-in-scotland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/27/ineos-in-talks-with-rolls-royce-to-build-mini-nuclear-power-plant-in-scotland","fields":{"headline":"Ineos in talks with Rolls-Royce on mini-nuclear power plant technology ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ineos, the chemicals company owned by the billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has held exploratory talks with Rolls-Royce on nuclear technology that could eventually be chosen to provide zero-carbon energy to the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland. A deal between Ineos, one of the UK’s biggest privately owned companies, and FTSE 100 engineer Rolls-Royce could help Ineos with the tricky task of decarbonising the giant refinery, while also providing Rolls-Royce with an early customer for a new technology it hopes will transform its prospects. Rolls-Royce’s main business is building and maintaining jet engines for commercial aeroplanes, as well as power systems for boats and land vehicles. However, it is one of a handful of companies around the world hoping to use the expertise gained from building nuclear reactors for the UK’s submarine fleet for use on land. Ineos, which produces fuel and the chemicals used in plastics, is planning to use hydrogen to power the Grangemouth plant, which employs about 2,000 people across nearly 700 hectares (1,700 acres) of land. However, creating zero-carbon hydrogen from water requires large amounts of electricity, and it is considering options to source that power. Ratcliffe is regularly counted among the UK’s richest people, although he moved to low-tax Monaco in 2020. He has used the £6bn fortune built up from Ineos to pursue various other interests, including a delayed attempt to build a rugged off-road vehicle, and purchases of several sports clubs. He has previously tried to buy Chelsea football club, and is seen as a possible bidder for Manchester United after its owners put it up for sale this month. The talks between Ineos and Rolls-Royce were still at an early stage, said one person with knowledge of the situation. Another person said that discussions had centred on understanding the technology, and that no commercial negotiations have taken place. The Sunday Telegraph first reported the contacts. The former prime minister Boris Johnson aimed to put nuclear energy at the heart of the UK’s energy strategy in April as he responded to the chaos on global energy markets prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As well as building several large reactors capable of generating gigawatts of power, he also gave his approval to efforts to build megawatt-scale small modular reactors (SMRs). Warren East, Rolls-Royce’s outgoing chief executive, has said that the SMR revenues could end up being many times larger than its current business, as global demand for zero-carbon energy increases during the transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company still has a host of regulatory and political and financial problems to overcome, as well as proving that it can actually build the reactors in a factory at a cost to make them viable. However, Rolls-Royce is working to find locations for reactors. In September, it signed a memorandum of understanding with the Czech nuclear engineering firm Škoda JS to look at sites in the Czech Republic and other parts of central Europe. Rolls-Royce this month said it was prioritising four sites of old nuclear reactors in the UK to install the new SMRs. They were Trawsfynydd and Wylfa in north Wales, a site near Sellafield in Cumbria, and Oldbury in Gloucestershire. East will hand over the reins of the company to the ex-BP executive Tufan Erginbilgic in January, although the SMR effort is being headed internally by Tom Samson, who last week told a parliamentary committee that the company wanted to begin formal funding talks with the UK government. Ineos and Rolls-Royce declined to comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T22:23:10Z","webTitle":"IAEA to inspect future nuclear-powered submarines built in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/15/iaea-to-inspect-future-nuclear-powered-submarines-built-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"IAEA to inspect future nuclear-powered submarines built in Australia","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UN nuclear watchdog will insist on inspecting Australia’s future nuclear submarines before and after deployments as part of a “watertight” agreement to ensure no fissile material is diverted, the agency’s chief has said. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the agency and the partners in the Aukus nuclear sharing agreement – the US, UK and Australia – will hold further negotiations on how to make sure it does not conflict with their non-proliferation obligations. The Aukus deal exploits a loophole in the 1968 Nuclear Non Proliferation treaty that allows nuclear fuel used for non-explosive military uses like naval propulsion to be exempted from IAEA inspections. As one of the ways of limiting the possibility that fissile material could be diverted to making weapons, nuclear fuel will be delivered to Australia in welded power units which would be installed in submarines to be assembled by Australia and ready by the 2040s. Grossi said that in negotiations with Australia, the IAEA would insist that its inspectors would be allowed to check the amount of nuclear fuel in the sealed units before and after the submarines put out to sea. “We have to check before it goes in the water, and when it comes back,” Grossi told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. “This requires highly sophisticated technical methods, because there will be welded units, [but] our inspectors will want to know what is inside and whether, when the boat comes back to port, everything is there and there has not been any loss. It’s the first time something like this will be done.” “We are going to be very demanding on what they are planning to do. So the process starts now. And the proof of the pudding is in the tasting,” Grossi said. Grossi is due to report on progress on the non-proliferation agreements related to the Aukus deal to the member states on the IAEA’s board in June. “We are going to put together a solid watertight system to try to have all the guarantees. If we cannot do that, we would never agree,” Grossi said. Arms control advocates have generally welcomed the precautionary measures adopted by the Aukus partners, but have expressed concern that the precedent it sets could encourage other states to use the NPT loophole potentially to use the pretext of developing nuclear naval propulsion as a way of hiding work on weapons. “If it was the case that country X wants to do this, they will have to do the exact same thing if they want to stay within the law,” Grossi said. “They will have to come to us. They will have to inform us what they are planning to do, and they will have to open a process of consultation and negotiation.” China has strenuously objected to the deal and its foreign ministry has alleged that the Aukus partners had “coerced” the IAEA into accepting it. “Countries have strong feelings about it,” Grossi said, but he added: “Nobody coerces me. Nobody coerces the IAEA.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/30/a-form-of-self-destruction-japan-weighs-up-plan-to-expand-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T04:07:17Z","webTitle":"‘A form of self-destruction’: Japan weighs up plan to expand nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/30/a-form-of-self-destruction-japan-weighs-up-plan-to-expand-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/30/a-form-of-self-destruction-japan-weighs-up-plan-to-expand-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"‘A form of self-destruction’: Japan weighs up plan to expand nuclear power","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Look carefully through the trees, and it is just possible to catch sight of Onagawa nuclear power plant from its visitors’ centre, perched on a hill surrounded by thick woods. The plant’s supporters may have had its remote location, on a rugged peninsula in Japan’s north-east, in mind when they campaigned to bring nuclear power – and the promise of subsidies – to the town more than 40 years ago. Despite its seclusion, the plant is now in the political spotlight, as Japan prepares to again put its faith in nuclear power, more than a decade after the triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi. In a sweeping change to the country’s energy policy, the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has announced plans to build next-generation reactors and restart those left idle after the 2011 triple meltdown, in an attempt to end Japan’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and help meet its net zero target by 2050. Kishida’s “green transformation”, which could include extending the lifespan of existing reactors beyond the current maximum of 60 years, underlines Japan’s struggle to secure an affordable energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine and a power crunch that has triggered warnings of potential blackouts in Tokyo during this summer’s heatwave. Most of Japan’s nuclear power plants have remained offline since the Fukushima meltdown, and previous governments indicated they would not build new reactors or replace ageing ones, fearing a backlash from a shaken and sceptical public. Japan plans for nuclear to account for 20-22% of its electricity supply in 2030, compared with about a third before Fukushima. In 2020 the figure was less than 5%. Just 10 nuclear reactors among more than 30 have been restarted since the post-Fukushima introduction of stricter safety standards. If Kishida gets his way though, seven additional reactors will be restarted after next summer, including the No. 2 unit at Onagawa, which sustained structural damage from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami but escaped a catastrophic meltdown despite being the closest atomic plant to the quake’s epicentre. ‘A threat to the safety of local people’ The restart has been approved by Japan’s nuclear watchdog and given “local consent” by Yoshihiro Murai, the governor of Miyagi – the prefecture where Onagawa is located. But many residents argue that contingency plans for potential accidents would put lives at risk. “The evacuation plans won’t work … they are a threat to the safety of local people,” says Masami Hino, one of 17 residents living within 30km of the plant who last year launched a legal action to block the restart, now scheduled for early 2024. In the event of a serious accident, 1,000 residents living within 5km of the plant would leave immediately, while 190,000 people within a 30km radius would evacuate in stages, according to the official blueprint. “There will be huge traffic jams, and we won’t be able to escape,” says Hino, who cited one expert simulation – dismissed by local authorities – showing that it could take up to five days for everyone to make it to safety. “If there is an accident it is ridiculous to think that people will leave in an orderly way,” he said. “They will just get out as quickly as they can and then get stuck for days without food, water or access to toilets.” Critics say an evacuation in the wake of an accident would clog the area’s narrow, winding roads, leaving people at risk of exposure to radiation. Most would leave in private cars, but others would have to board buses. The plant’s operator, Tohoku Electric Power, and local authorities would provide almost 1,000 staff to screen people for radiation exposure before directing them to temporary shelters. “How can Tohoku Electric and the prefecture guarantee that an evacuation would go smoothly after something like a major earthquake? It’s impossible,” says Mikiko Abe, an independent member of the Onagawa town assembly who has spent 40 years campaigning for the plant’s closure. “Instead of planning for an evacuation, wouldn’t it be better to live safely in a place where there’s no need to even think about fleeing our homes?” Kishida’s response to energy insecurity and the climate crisis has won the backing of Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA), who said restarting more nuclear plants in Japan – one of the world’s biggest consumers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) – would free up more LNG and help ease Europe’s energy supply fears during the winter. Domestic opposition to a bigger role for nuclear in the energy mix appears to be weakening. A poll by the Nikkei business paper in June found that 53% of respondents agreed with putting reactors back into service if their safety could be assured – the first time that support for restarts had exceeded opposition since the 2011 triple disaster. While pro-nuclear members of the Miyagi prefectural assembly have helped resist calls for a referendum, a poll in April by the local Kahoku Shinpo newspaper found that 56% of residents were “strongly” or “somewhat” opposed the restart. “All of Japan’s nuclear power plants are on the coast … and this is a country that has earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes,” says Tsuyoshi Suda, a member of local anti-nuclear group Kaze no Kai, as he looked at the plant – complete with a newly built 29-metre high seawall – from a nearby beach. “For Japan to keep putting its faith in nuclear power plants is like a form of self-destruction.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T06:30:12Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on Britain’s urgent need to commit to nuclear power | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/06/the-observer-view-on-britain-urgent-build-more-nuclear-power-plants","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on Britain’s urgent need to commit to nuclear power","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"For a moment last week, our cash-strapped government seemed ready to abandon a project that many experts believe is central to our plans of achieving energy independence and net zero emissions. According to the BBC, the Treasury had indicated the proposed new nuclear reactor Sizewell C was on a list of major construction projects that were under review for possible cancellation. Its days could be numbered, it was suggested. The threat has since been denied by Number 10. The new atom plant in Suffolk will go ahead, it has insisted. For a nation that hopes to wean itself off its fossil fuel addiction and its dependence on natural gas imports, this is good news. The UK’s future prosperity depends on its ability to generate electricity, independently and at low cost and nuclear power is expected to play a critical role in ensuring this happens. The trouble is that these plans have very shaky foundations, as was revealed last week when uncertainties about Sizewell C first surfaced. Britain has pledged to close all its coal power plants by 2024 while those that burn oil and gas are to be phased out by 2035. After that, a mix of renewables and nuclear plants is expected to fill this capacity, lighting and warming our homes, running our factories and keeping our trains and electric cars moving. For their part, renewables are doing well, with wind and solar plants providing healthy chunks of power for the UK grid. This is not the case for the nuclear component of this energy package, however. Just as the nation’s fossil fuel plants are being closed down, reactors have been providing less and less power for the nation. In the 1990s, atomic power generated 25% of Britain’s electricity. By 2020, this figure had dropped to 16% and it will continue to decline as more of our ageing nuclear plants are closed. Of the six reactors currently in operation, five are destined for closure by 2028. One additional new reactor, Hinkley Point C, should be in operation by then, leaving Britain with two reactors and limited fossil fuel provision – in addition to renewable sources – to supply power for the nation. Unless new reactors are built, by 2050 British nuclear capacity – the proposed cornerstone of the nation’s energy supply for the future – will be a third of what it is today. Solar and wind power will no doubt do their bit but on a freezing cold, windless, winter evening, the UK’s lack of a central generating capacity will be cruelly exposed. Blackouts will be inevitable. The proposed Sizewell C reactor will therefore be welcome, though on its own the plant will be insufficient for the nation’s needs. Britain will require at least half a dozen such reactors to provide the gigawatts of electricity on which it will depend to fend off a future that lacks power to run our homes and operate our factories. The problem is that a new nuclear plant takes around a decade to build once it has been approved. By that arithmetic, time is now desperately tight if the United Kingdom is to have the numbers it requires to generate the power the country is going to need. Nuclear energy is certainly not without flaws. Construction costs and waste storage are two clear examples. However, the government has committed the nation to atomic power. Having done so, it is now obliged to act with a speed that will provide the country with sufficient nuclear electricity – and keep the lights on over the next two decades."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-27T19:14:06Z","webTitle":"Germany delays exit from nuclear power to offset energy shortfall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/27/germany-delays-exit-from-nuclear-power-to-offset-energy-shortfall","fields":{"headline":"Germany delays exit from nuclear power to offset energy shortfall","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Germany’s planned exit from nuclear power by the end of this year has been officially delayed in order to shore up energy supplies during an expected shortfall this winter, the economic minister, Robert Habeck, announced on Tuesday. The decision follows a shortage in supplies of electricity coming from France due to the fact that more than half of its nuclear power stations are offline, Habeck told journalists in Berlin. He said that the resulting gap in electricity supplies was being “observed with concern”, with Europe’s energy network in danger of being put under too much strain, potentially leading to power cuts. The electricity that Germany is not able to acquire from France is being compensated for with electricity produced by gas-fired power stations in Germany. But this in turn involves using up valuable supplies of gas that Germany is trying to save before winter arrives. Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations were due to be turned off at the end of this year, the end of an 11-year process. The decision to withdraw from nuclear power was made by the government of Angela Merkel after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. Habeck had long resisted calls for the power plants in southern Germany – Isar 2 and Neckarwestheim 2 – to be extended as Germany coped with the effect of Russia slowing down, and then turning off completely, its gas supply via the Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 1 earlier this month. But his arguments against keeping the plants in operation became increasingly difficult to defend. A majority of Germans, despite being in favour of moving away from nuclear power, has said it is in favour of extending the plants’ use temporarily. Habeck had announced earlier this month that the plants would be put into a standby mode but would effectively stay offline unless needed. His decision amounts to an awkward U-turn, though Habeck said it was a reaction to the current situation, including what he called an escalation of the situation in Russia, “which is developing fairly dramatically”, and that he was resistant to populist demands. Habeck said that the necessary changes to the law covering the extension of the plants would be voted on in the Bundestag at the end of next month. Reacting to security concerns, and whether nuclear plants may be open to hacking attacks and terrorist threats, Habeck said the government was well aware of the concerns and was “doing its utmost” to secure them. German and Danish authorities were examining evidence on Tuesday suggesting that the Nord Stream pipelines 1 and 2 may have been deliberately damaged on Monday night in an act of sabotage, after dramatic drops of pressure in them and evidence of gas leaking into the Baltic Sea with possible explosions. Fingers have inevitably been pointed at Russia as a possible culprit. The incident has heightened concerns over the vulnerability of energy infrastructure in Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T18:25:50Z","webTitle":"Wood burning stoves and the harm done by inflating the risk of nuclear power | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/14/britain-has-been-undervaluing-lives-lost-to-air-pollution-for-years","fields":{"headline":"Wood burning stoves and the harm done by inflating the risk of nuclear power","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Your article on the harmful effects of burning wood (‘Eco’ wood burners produce 450 times more pollution than gas heating – report, 8 December) highlights a broader problem with risk management in public health. Very different values are placed on human life, depending on the specific risk. The level of air pollutants considered acceptable by the World Health Organization is already dangerous, increasing mortality by 2%. In contrast, the level of radioactivity considered acceptable is 100-500 times below levels that cause a similar increase in mortality. What this means is that a life lost to air pollution is valued 100- to 500-fold lower than a life lost to exposure to radioactivity. It is partly because of this difference, and the resulting regulatory regimes, that coal-fired power stations are much cheaper to build than nuclear power stations, even though they are at least 500 times more dangerous. It is only because of concerns about the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change that countries are now considering alternatives to coal, including nuclear power. If we had, from the outset, valued lives lost to air pollution the same as lives lost to radioactivity, we would have been building nuclear power plants rather than coal-fired power plants for the past 40 years. Many millions of lives would have been saved, and the climate emergency might have been avoided. Anton van der Merwe Oxford • Your article about wood burning stoves seems to be yet another example of individuals being made to feel responsible for the world’s environmental woes while governments and business pay little more than lip service to such issues. The wood that I burn is collected within a five-mile radius of my home, and I would guess that most wood burned domestically is similarly local. By contrast, Drax power station, about 15 miles from me, burns millions of tons of woodchips imported from forests in North America and elsewhere, brought here in huge, polluting tankers. But because it is called “biomass”, it attracts billions of pounds in government subsidies. While I am concerned about pollution, I will be continuing to burn biomass, without subsidy, for the foreseeable future.

Overnight residential buildings and a medical facility were damaged by a Russian rocket attack on Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region. Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions came under fire from Ukrainian forces across the border in the early hours of Wednesday, the regions’ governors said, adding that no casualties were reported. Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The strike hit a parking lot outside a residential building in the town of around 28,000 people. Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported Wednesday that the website and mobile app of the Russian railways network has been subjected to “a massive hacker attack”. Yelena Milashina, the prominent journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, who was brutally beaten in Chechnya yesterday, has been moved to a hospital in Moscow. The Ukraine government accused Russia on Tuesday of planning a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while Russia claimed that Kyiv was planning to “attack” the facility. Fears over the safety risks for the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, have been constant throughout Russia’s invasion, but increased in early June after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the source of cooling water for its reactors. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that “objects resembling explosives” had been placed on the roof of several power units “perhaps to simulate an attack”. He added: “The world sees – can’t but see – that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Russia and no one else.” Russia sees no basis for renewing the Black Sea grain deal, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday, less than two weeks before the expiration of the agreement, which has allowed grain to be shipped out of Black Sea ports despite the war in Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement Russia was doing everything so that all ships covered by the deal could leave the Black Sea before it expires on 17 July, Reuters reported. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday that Ukraine launched a drone attack on the Russian capital and its region, temporarily disrupting flight operations at the Vnukovo airport. “At this moment, the attacks have been repelled by air defence forces,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. “All detected drones have been eliminated”. There were no casualties or injured reported. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia remains “united as never before” in the wake of the failed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group and claimed the country continued to flourish in the face of heavy western sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine. In an address from the Kremlin to a virtual gathering of leaders from the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group founded by Russia and China to counter western influence, the Russian president attempted to rebuff any suggestion that he had been weakened by last week’s chaotic but short-lived rebellion led by Yevgeny Prigozhin. A funeral service has taken place in Kyiv for the celebrated writer Victoria Amelina. A Ukrainian novelist, poet and public intellectual, she died from injuries sustained when a Russian missile attack struck a pizza restaurant in the eastern town of Kramatorsk, killing 12 people in total, including children. Oleksiy Danilov has described recent days of battle as “fruitful” for Ukraine in terms of destroying the resources of the Russian forces. In a post to social media, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defence council described Ukraine as acting “calmly” and “wisely’ in its counteroffensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/07/german-chancellor-rejects-calls-to-reverse-nuclear-power-plants-closure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-07T16:39:35Z","webTitle":"German chancellor rejects calls to reverse nuclear power plant closures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/07/german-chancellor-rejects-calls-to-reverse-nuclear-power-plants-closure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/07/german-chancellor-rejects-calls-to-reverse-nuclear-power-plants-closure","fields":{"headline":"German chancellor rejects calls to reverse nuclear power plant closures","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has rejected calls for his government to commit to a longer-term extension of the life of the country’s nuclear power plants and insisted that Europe’s largest economy would have enough energy to get through the winter. Scholz shut down criticism from the opposition conservative alliance and at least one leading economist, who have described his coalition’s decision to keep two remaining reactors in emergency reserve rather than letting them produce electricity, as “madness” while the government refuses to reverse its long-term plan to close down the last remaining plants. Criticism about the nuclear roadmap is also coming from within Scholz’s government. His coalition partner, the pro-business FDP, has urged Scholz to overturn the 2011 ban on nuclear power introduced by Angela Merkel as a reaction to the Fukushima disaster. In a heated parliamentary debate on Wednesday morning, Scholz defended his government’s strategy to tackle the energy crisis. Facing fierce criticism from the opposition, he said his government was confronting problems created by the previous administration under Merkel – in which he served. The crisis, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has been exacerbated in recent weeks by Moscow’s reduction of gas supplies to Germany, which was followed a week ago by a complete halt. Moscow has cited maintenance issues linked to sanctions imposed by the west. Scholz accused Friedrich Merz’s conservative alliance (CDU/CSU) of refusing to accept responsibility for its role in the crisis, calling it “the party which holds complete responsibility for the fact that Germany made decisions to withdraw both from coal and from atomic energy, but never had the strength to enter into anything else”. He also accused the conservatives of failing to embrace renewable energy and actively campaigning against it. “You were incapable of bringing about the expansion of renewable energies. You led defensive battles against every single wind turbine,” he said. By trying now to save as much gas, electricity and oil as it can before winter kicks in – in part with the construction of LNG terminals and expanding renewable energy – Scholz said his government was “solving problems that the union failed to recognise as such when it was in power”. Scholz said Germans would “rise above themselves” and deal with the coming winter with “with boldness and bravery” and said that Germany was close to its goal of becoming independent from Russian gas exports. Gas storage facilities were 86% full on Wednesday. Merz accused Scholz’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, of “pandering to environmental lobbyists” and squandering the chance to find solutions to the energy crisis by seeking what he called a “lazy compromise” by refusing to allow Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations to continue operation for the next two to three years. On Monday Habeck had announced that two of them would remain “on standby” supported by the necessary staff, equipment and security, but would not be producing electricity unless needed. Merz said the decision was irresponsible, arguing that continuing running the plants would help secure energy supplies and that the increased electricity production would help control the market price. “The ignorance shown to this topic is written all over your face,” he said to Habeck, calling the last existing nuclear power plants “the most modern and safe reactors in the world”. In Wednesday’s Bundestag debate, Alice Weidel, co-leader of the far-right AfD, accused the government of leading Germany to financial ruin with its policies, including a €65bn (£56bn) package announced on Sunday, aimed to ease household finances. “You have every reason to fear a heated autumn and winter,” she said, in reference to figures on the right and left who have called for protests against high living costs. She said people had “every right” to take to the streets. Amira Mohamed Ali, parliamentary leader of the far-left Die Linke, accused the coalition government of having “no social conscience”. She urged the government to approach Russia in an attempt to bring it to the negotiating table and end its hostilities in Ukraine. The instability of nuclear power is one of the main reason for not relying on it, the economics ministry argued when it presented its plans on Monday. Currently only 28 of 56 plants in France are on the grid, due in part to the shortage of cooling water linked to this summer’s drought, meaning Germany has had to supply its neighbour with electricity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jul/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-particularly-fruitful-in-recent-days-senior-ukraine-official-says","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-05T17:50:08Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia situation ‘tense’ as both sides accuse each other of planning attack on nuclear plant – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-particularly-fruitful-in-recent-days-senior-ukraine-official-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jul/05/russia-ukraine-war-live-counteroffensive-particularly-fruitful-in-recent-days-senior-ukraine-official-says","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia situation ‘tense’ as both sides accuse each other of planning attack on nuclear plant – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is coming up to 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines: Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of planning to attack one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants, which is located in southeastern Ukraine and occupied by Russian troops, but neither side provided evidence to support their claims. Citing intelligence reports, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russian troops had placed “objects resembling explosives on the roof of several power units” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The objects could be used to “simulate” an attack, he said, meaning a false flag attack, AP reported. A man who detonated explosives in a court house in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday has died, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said. Klymenko, in a statement at the site of the explosion at the Shevchenkivskyi court house said the man may have stepped inadvertently on explosives. James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, and Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary, joined with their Polish counterparts Zbigniew Rau and Mariusz Blaszczak at a pre-Nato summit meeting in London on Wednesday and followed it up with a press conference. The two countries are ruled by right-leaning parties, and each emphasised their mutual agreement on defence and foreign policy ahead of next week’s Nato meeting where the key topic will be Ukraine’s demand for concrete steps towards membership whenever its war with Russia ends. The United Nations is making “every effort” to ensure that the Black Sea grain deal and a memorandum of understanding to facilitate access of Russian fertiliser and other products to global markets are extended, UN trade chief Rebeca Grynspan said. “We need both to continue bringing down prices and have stable markets of food and fertilisers in the world,” Grynspan told reporters in Geneva. Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that Russian forces had struck three Ukrainian army groups near Bakhmut, amid conflicting reports about fighting in the area. Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield situation. The ministry made no comment in its daily briefing on reports that Russian forces have retreated from the village of Klishchiivka, south-west of Bakhmut, which a Russian-installed official in eastern Ukraine has denied. Vladimir Rogov, one of the prominent pro-Russian figures in occupied Zaporizhzhia region has reported on his Telegram account that “the houses of local residents, a garage and a car were damaged” in the region due to Ukrainian fire. He said there were no casualties. The claims have not been independently verified. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s former election spokesperson has been appointed to run the state news agency Tass, according to a government order published on Wednesday. The Kremlin has tightened its control over the media since the start of the Ukraine war, forcing the closure of leading independent news outlets and designating many journalists and publications as “foreign agents”, Reuters reported. Next week’s Nato summit must offer “real security guarantees” to Ukraine, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said today. Speaking in Warsaw alongside the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, Meloni said Italy and Poland were “in perfect agreement” on the issue, Reuters reported. Russia accused a small US based charity of “sabotaging” the construction of a huge gas pipeline to China and banned it as an “undesirable organisation”. Jennifer Castner, director of the Altai Project, described the accusation as absurd but said it had been only a matter of time. The move followed clamp-downs on many foreign NGOs in Russia, including a similar ban last month on the local arm of the WWF environmental group. Russia said on Wednesday that one person was killed and another 41 injured, including two children, by Ukrainian fire in the east Ukraine town of Makiivka, which is occupied by Russian forces. Overnight residential buildings and a medical facility were damaged by a Russian rocket attack on Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region. Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions came under fire from Ukrainian forces across the border in the early hours of Wednesday, the regions’ governors said, adding that no casualties were reported. Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The strike hit a parking lot outside a residential building in the town of about 28,000 people. Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported Wednesday that the website and mobile app of the Russian railways network has been subjected to “a massive hacker attack”. Yelena Milashina, the prominent journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, who was brutally beaten in Chechnya yesterday, has been moved to a hospital in Moscow. That’s all from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. Thanks for following along. A man who detonated explosives in a court house in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday has died, Ukrainian interior minister Ihor Klymenko said. Klymenko, in a statement at the site of the explosion at the Shevchenkivskyi court house said the man may have stepped inadvertently on explosives.

Jennifer Castner, director of the Altai Project, described the accusation as absurd but said it had been only a matter of time. The move followed clamp-downs on many foreign NGOs in Russia, including a similar ban last month on the local arm of the WWF environmental group. The Russian prosecutor general’s office said that while claiming to advocate nature conservation, the Altai Project was meddling in Russia’s internal affairs and could damage its economic security. “The key direction of the organisation’s work is sabotaging the construction of the Power of Siberia-2 gas pipeline,” it said. The planned pipeline is intended to deliver 50 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year from Russia to China via Mongolia. James Cleverly, the UK foreign secretary, and Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary, joined with their Polish counterparts Zbigniew Rau and Mariusz Blaszczak at a pre-Nato summit meeting in London on Wednesday and followed it up with a press conference. The two countries are ruled by right-leaning parties, and each emphasised their mutual agreement on defence and foreign policy ahead of next week’s Nato meeting where the key topic will be Ukraine’s demand for concrete steps towards membership whenever its war with Russia ends. Polish foreign minister Rau said “we have no doubt that at this summit Ukraine will become instituationally closer to Nato” and emphasised that Warsaw would help Ukraine align its political and military structures to alliance standards. Cleverly was more cautious and said that the way Ukraine had modernised its military during the war will have shortened the eventual timescale by which it can join: The process by which Sweden and Finland applied was a truncated one. I think we should reflect on that when we discuss what process there will be for Ukraine to join. Ukrainian police said on Wednesday they were investigating a reported explosion in a district court in the capital Kyiv. Police said on the Telegram messaging app that officers and other experts were at the site. It quoted preliminary information that a device had been detonated by a man who had been taken to a court hearing. Experts from the UN nuclear watchdog based at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine have yet to observe any indications of mines or explosives at the plant, but more access is needed to be sure, the agency said. “The IAEA experts have requested additional access that is necessary to confirm the absence of mines or explosives,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement. “In particular, access to the rooftops of reactor units 3 and 4 is essential, as well as access to parts of the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system at the plant.” The UK has signed a new partnership with Poland aimed at deepening foreign policy and defence cooperation. Foreign secretary James Cleverly and defence secretary Ben Wallace alongside Polish national defence minister Mariusz Blaszczak agreed joint priorities on issues including Belarus and China, PA reported. The Ministry of Defence said the new 2030 Strategic Partnership signed at Lancaster House on Wednesday builds on the 2017 UK-Poland treaty, which provided a framework for enhanced cooperation between the two Nato allies. At a meeting before the signing, the ministers discussed support for Ukraine and defence and security in the Euro-Atlantic area. Cleverly said: Just as the UK and Poland fought together to preserve freedom in Europe during World War Two, so today the UK and Poland are standing together once more, at the forefront of international support for Ukraine. Our 2030 Partnership commits the UK and Poland to even greater defence, security and foreign policy cooperation into the future. Wallace said: As historic defence partners and Nato Allies, the UK stands with Poland to defend Nato’s Eastern Flank and support Ukraine against Russian aggression. The 2030 Strategic Partnership strengthens our commitment to develop closer military deployments and exercises and deliver on immediate and long-term capability projects. Pjotr Sauer and Jason Burke report on the fate of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s business interests in Russia – including the notorious troll farm: As Wagner mercenaries captured a major Russian military base and began their armed march on Moscow, members of Russia’s federal security services stormed one of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s headquarters in St Petersburg. Masked men quickly seized computers and documents belonging to the Patriot group, a media holding at the heart of Prigozhin’s information empire that for years promoted the warlord at home while sowing chaos and interfering with elections abroad. “They barged in, smashing the front door. It felt like they were busting a brothel, and not the workplaces of patriotic journalists,” said a senior staffer at Ria Fan, the flagship Patriot online outlet, who was present during the search. The incident on 24 June, described to the Guardian by several Patriot members, marked the start of the Kremlin’s efforts to clamp down on Prigozhin’s vast business empire, after a mutiny that presented the biggest challenge to Vladimir Putin’s 23 years in power. Over three decades, Prigozhin built one of the world’s most shadowy and complex corporate structures that stretched far beyond his mercenary activities and included companies in media, logistics, mining, film and catering – for which he earned his nickname as Vladimir Putin’s chef. Read more here: ‘He lived by the troll, he dies by the troll’ – Putin takes on Prigozhin’s business empire Vladimir Rogov, one of the prominent pro-Russian figures in occupied Zaporizhzhia region has reported on his Telegram account that “the houses of local residents, a garage and a car were damaged” in the region due to Ukrainian fire. He said there were no casualties. The claims have not been independently verified. Turkey’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan, spoke by phone with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and discussed the Black Sea grain deal, a Turkish foreign ministry source said on Wednesday. Fidan also discussed Nato enlargement with Blinken, the source told Reuters. Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of planning to attack one of the world’s largest nuclear power plants, which is located in southeastern Ukraine and occupied by Russian troops, but neither side provided evidence to support their claims. Citing intelligence reports, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russian troops had placed “objects resembling explosives on the roof of several power units” of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The objects could be used to “simulate” an attack, he said, meaning a false flag attack, AP reported. A statement from the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said the “foreign objects” were placed on the outer roof of the plant’s third and fourth power units. “Their detonation should not damage power units but may create a picture of shelling from Ukraine,” the statement said. In Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov raised the spectre of a potentially “catastrophic” provocation by the Ukrainian army at the nuclear plant, which is Europe’s largest but has its six reactors shut down. “The situation is quite tense. There is a great threat of sabotage by the Kyiv regime, which can be catastrophic in its consequences,” Peskov said in response to a reporter’s question. He also claimed that Kremlin is taking “all measures” to counter the alleged Ukrainian threat. Russia’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that Russian forces had struck three Ukrainian army groups near Bakhmut, amid conflicting reports about fighting in the area. Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield situation. The ministry made no comment in its daily briefing on reports that Russian forces have retreated from the village of Klishchiivka, south-west of Bakhmut, which a Russian-installed official in eastern Ukraine has denied. Ukraine has said its forces had “partial success” in the Klishchiivka area. Russian president Vladimir Putin’s former election spokesperson has been appointed to run the state news agency Tass, according to a government order published on Wednesday. The Kremlin has tightened its control over the media since the start of the Ukraine war, forcing the closure of leading independent news outlets and designating many journalists and publications as “foreign agents”, Reuters reported. The prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, signed an order dismissing Sergei Mikhailov as general director of Tass and appointing Andrei Kondrashov in his place. Mikhailov had served as general director since 2012. Kondrashov, 50, is a state television journalist who in 2018 worked as the press secretary of Putin’s election headquarters. The United Nations is making “every effort” to ensure that the Black Sea grain deal and a memorandum of understanding to facilitate access of Russian fertiliser and other products to global markets are extended, UN trade chief Rebeca Grynspan said. “We need both to continue bringing down prices and have stable markets of food and fertilisers in the world,” Grynspan told reporters in Geneva. “The United Nations remains committed to making every effort for the continuation of the agreements.” Next week’s Nato summit must offer “real security guarantees” to Ukraine, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said today. Speaking in Warsaw alongside the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, Meloni said Italy and Poland were “in perfect agreement” on the issue, Reuters reported. Nato leaders are meeting in Vilnius on 11-12 July. Russia said on Wednesday that one person was killed and another 41 injured, including two children, by Ukrainian fire in the east Ukraine town of Makiivka, which is occupied by Russian forces. Overnight residential buildings and a medical facility were damaged by a Russian rocket attack on Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region. Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions came under fire from Ukrainian forces across the border in the early hours of Wednesday, the regions’ governors said, adding that no casualties were reported. Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The strike hit a parking lot outside a residential building in the town of around 28,000 people. Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported Wednesday that the website and mobile app of the Russian railways network has been subjected to “a massive hacker attack”. Yelena Milashina, the prominent journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, who was brutally beaten in Chechnya yesterday, has been moved to a hospital in Moscow. The Ukraine government accused Russia on Tuesday of planning a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while Russia claimed that Kyiv was planning to “attack” the facility. Fears over the safety risks for the nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, have been constant throughout Russia’s invasion, but increased in early June after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the source of cooling water for its reactors. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that “objects resembling explosives” had been placed on the roof of several power units “perhaps to simulate an attack”. He added: “The world sees – can’t but see – that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Russia and no one else.” Russia said on Wednesday that one person was killed and another 41 injured, including two children, by Ukrainian fire in the east Ukraine town of Makiivka, which is occupied by Russian forces. “Forty-one people have been injured due to the shelling, including two children. One person has died from their wounds,” Vladislav Klyucharov, the Russian-appointed head of the city’s administration said on Russia’s state-run broadcaster Rossiya-24, according to AFP. Earlier the Russian-installed leader of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian forces had launched “fierce attacks” on residential areas and a hospital complex in the city. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that the website and mobile app of the Russian railways network has been subjected to “a massive hacker attack”. Images have been released from Russia that claim to show the damage in the Belgorod region hit by cross-border strikes from Ukraine. Air alerts have been declared across most southern and eastern regions of Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force has warned of a missile danger in the south of Ukraine, alerting on “probable launches of Kalibr cruise missiles”, according to Suspilne. More details soon … Yelena Milashina, the prominent journalist for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, who was brutally beaten in Chechnya yesterday, has been moved to a hospital in Moscow, Reuters reports. Milashina had her head shaved, fingers broken and green dye thrown over her while on her way to Grozny. Alexei Venediktov, the former head of the closed Ekho Moskvy radio station, said in a message on Telegram that Milashina and the lawyer Alexander Nemov – who was also attacked – were now in a Moscow hospital. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that overnight residential buildings and a medical facility were damaged by a rocket attack on Druzhkivka in the Donetsk region. The claims have not been independently verified. An air alert has been declared in Kherson region. This is not an uncommon event, as the line of contact in the region runs along the Dnipro River, with Ukraine holding the northern portion of the oblast on the right bank, and Russian forces occupying the southern portion of Kherson on the left bank. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine the Russian Federation has claimed to annex despite not fully controlling the territory. The UK ambassador to Ukraine has said “things don’t feel calm” in Kyiv despite the capital of Ukraine going without attacks for several days. In a post to social media, Melinda Simmons said: “In spite of Russia directing their murderous missiles at smaller Ukrainian towns with less air defence leaving Kyiv alone for now, things don’t feel calm.” Accompanied by a picture of the cathedral through trees, she added: “I walked over to peek at Andriivsky Cathedral through the trees. Never fails to bring balance.” Volodymyr Litvinov, head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, has reported that, in the last 24 hours, four settlements in the district came under fire, causing damage to houses and farm buildings. No injuries or casualties were reported. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. A woman has been wounded in the attacks on Belgorod, Reuters reports. “The attack on the town of Valuyiki lasted for more than an hour,” Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on the Telegram messaging app. A woman suffered shrapnel wounds to her chest. Gladkov said that Russian defence forces shot down three air objects, including one drone. Ukraine forces also fired 12 times from the Grad rocket launchers, he added. At least eight private houses were damaged in the attacks. Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions came under fire from Ukrainian forces across the border in the early hours of Wednesday, the regions’ governors said, adding that no casualties were reported. “The town of Valuyki is under fire from Ukraine‘s armed forces,” Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote on the Telegram messaging app at 07:36am local time (0436 GMT). He did not specify whether it was rocket fire, artillery shelling or some other form of attack. “Air defence system worked, but there is destruction on the ground,” Gladkov said. Separately, Roman Starovoyt, the governor of the Kursk region, north of Belgorod and also bordering Ukraine, said that a school and a private house were damaged when the village of Tyotkino came fire, again without specifying the form of attack. Neither the Guardian nor Reuters have independently verified the reports. Zelenskiy has again warned Russia may be planning to “simulate an attack” the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, claiming that Russian troops have placed “objects resembling explosives” on the roofs of buildings at the site. Citing Ukrainian intelligence, Zelenskiy said the objects had been positioned on the roof of several power units of the power plant that is currently held by Russia. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelenskiy briefed the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Russia’s “dangerous provocations” at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine. He said he and Macron had “agreed keep the situation under maximum control together with the IAEA”, the UN’s nuclear watchdog. Zelenskiy’s warnings echo comments he made last week at a joint news conference in Kyiv with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. “There is a serious threat because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the station, which could lead to a [radiation] release,” Zelenskiy said at the time. Ukraine’s military said it had destroyed a Russian “formation” in Russian-controlled Makiivka in the frontline Donetsk region, where Moscow-installed officials and media said one civilian was killed and dozens wounded in attacks by Kyiv. “As a result of the effective fire impact of the units of the defence forces, another formation of Russian terrorists in the temporarily occupied Makiivka ceased to exist,” Ukraine‘s armed forces said in a statement late Tuesday. A video accompanying the post showed a huge explosion lighting up the night sky and the silhouette of at least one building. It did not give further details. The Russian-installed head of Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, said Ukrainian forces had launched “fierce attacks” on residential areas and a hospital complex in Makiivka, AFP reports. A Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces has been “particularly fruitful” in the past few days and Ukraine’s troops are fulfilling their main tasks, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine‘s National Security and Defence Council said on Tuesday. Moscow has not acknowledged Ukraine’s gains. Ukraine’s Deputy Defence Minister, Hanna Maliar, also reported gains around the shattered city of Bakhmut despite fierce Russian resistance, Reuters reports. Russian forces had captured it in May after 10 months of battles. “At this stage of active hostilities, Ukraine’s Defense Forces are fulfilling the number one task: the maximum destruction of manpower, equipment, fuel depots, military vehicles, command posts, artillery and air defense forces of the Russian army,” Danilov, head of Ukraine‘s National Security and Defence Council, wrote on Twitter. “The last few days have been particularly fruitful,” he said, without providing any details from the battlefield. Valeriy Shershen, spokesperson for the Tavria, or southern, military command, said Ukrainian troops had advanced by up to 2 km (1.2 miles) in the Berdiansk direction of southern Ukraine, despite fierce Russian resistance. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. A Ukrainian counteroffensive against Russian forces has been “particularly fruitful“ in the past few days and Ukraine’s troops are fulfilling their main tasks, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, said on Tuesday. More on this shortly. Other key recent developments: Ukrainian officials said at least 43 people, including 12 children, were wounded in a Russian missile strike on Tuesday which an officer said targeted a military funeral in the north-eastern Kharkiv region. The strike hit a parking lot outside a residential building in the town of around 28,000 people. The Ukraine government accused Russia on Tuesday of planning a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, while Russia claimed that Kyiv was planning to “attack” the facility. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that “objects resembling explosives” had been placed on the roof of several power units “perhaps to simulate an attack”. Russia sees no basis for renewing the Black Sea grain deal, the Russian foreign ministry said on Tuesday, less than two weeks before the expiration of the agreement, which has allowed grain to be shipped out of Black Sea ports despite the war in Ukraine. The ministry said in a statement Russia was doing everything so that all ships covered by the deal could leave the Black Sea before it expires on 17 July, Reuters reported. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Tuesday that Ukraine launched a drone attack on the Russian capital and its region, temporarily disrupting flight operations at the Vnukovo airport. “At this moment, the attacks have been repelled by air defence forces,” Sobyanin said on Telegram. “All detected drones have been eliminated”. There were no casualties or injured reported. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia remains “united as never before” in the wake of the failed mutiny by the Wagner mercenary group and claimed the country continued to flourish in the face of heavy western sanctions over his invasion of Ukraine. A funeral service has taken place in Kyiv for the celebrated writer Victoria Amelina. A Ukrainian novelist, poet and public intellectual, she died from injuries sustained when a Russian missile attack struck a pizza restaurant in the eastern town of Kramatorsk, killing 12 people in total, including children. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Tuesday that 185,000 new recruits had joined the Russian army as professional contract soldiers since the start of the year. In a video posted on Telegram, Medvedev, who was earlier this year appointed to a role overseeing Russia’s domestic military production, said that almost 10,000 new recruits had joined up in the last week. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has said it was lending €25m (£21.4m) to the Ukrainian city of Dnipro to help it cope with an influx of people fleeing fighting. It said the loan would help ensure the continuous provision of vital municipal services in the south-eastern city after the arrival of people forced to flee other locations because of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Reuters reported. US president, Joe Biden, on Tuesday welcomed Nato’s decision to extend secretary general Jens Stoltenberg’s term by a further year. “With his steady leadership, experience, and judgment, secretary general Stoltenberg has brought our alliance through the most significant challenges in European security since the second world war,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. The Kremlin has said there were “certain contacts” with the United States over the case of detained Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich, but that it did not want to make them public. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made the comments in a regular briefing. Oleksiy Danilov has described recent days of battle as “fruitful” for Ukraine in terms of destroying the resources of the Russian forces.

Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said on Tuesday that the body’s latest safety review of the planned discharge “makes the science of the treated water release clear for the international community and it answers the technical questions related to safety that have been raised”. The report said discharging the water would have “a negligible radiological impact on people and the environment”. “This is a very special night today,” Grossi told the prime minister, Fumio Kishida, before handing him a blue folder containing the final report. Kishida said Japan would “continue to provide explanations to the Japanese people and to the international community in a sincere manner based on scientific evidence and with high level of transparency”. Grossi later said the document was “neither a recommendation nor an endorsement” of the water release plans drawn up by Japan’s government and the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). In a tweet, he said the IAEA would “continue our impartial, independent and objective safety review during and after the discharge phase”, adding that agency experts would “have a continuous on-site presence”. The end of the two-year safety review brings Japan closer to the start of the long operation to pump the treated water – a mixture of groundwater, rain that seeps into the area, and water used for cooling damaged nuclear fuel – into the Pacific Ocean. It is not clear when that process will begin, although there is speculation that it could be this summer. About 1.3m tonnes of water stored in huge tanks on the site has been filtered through Tepco’s advanced liquid processing system (Alps) to remove most radioactive elements except for tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is difficult to separate from water. The “treated” water – Japanese officials object to the use of the word “contaminated” – will be diluted with seawater so that the concentration of tritium is well below internationally approved levels before being released into the ocean 1km from the shoreline via an undersea tunnel. The water – enough to fill 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools - becomes contaminated when it is used to cool fuel rods that melted after the plant was hit by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. The disaster triggered a triple meltdown, in the world’s worst nuclear crisis since Chornobyl 25 years earlier. Discharging the water is expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete, pending the IAEA’s review and official approval from Japan’s nuclear regulatory body, which could come as early as this week. Attempts by Japanese government officials to win regional support for the plan have had limited success. China, which denounced the plan as “extremely irresponsible” when it was announced in 2021, reiterated its opposition on Tuesday, calling for the discharge to be suspended. Through its embassy in Japan, China said the IAEA’s report should not be interpreted as a “pass” for the water release. Last week, a spokesperson for the country’s foreign ministry said Beijing urged Japan to “take seriously both international and domestic concerns, stop forcibly proceeding with its ocean discharge plan” and “subject itself to rigorous international oversight”. Japan’s foreign ministry has said that it made multiple and repeated attempts to explain the science behind Tokyo’s stance to Beijing officials, but that its offers had been ignored. Local Japanese fishing communities have also objected to the plan, saying it would destroy more than a decade of work rebuilding their industry, with shoppers likely to shun their catch and send prices plummeting. Fukushima authorities have introduced some of the world’s strictest radiation testing regimes, but many consumers are yet to be reassured that fish and other produce from the region are safe. The government and Tepco claim the environmental and health impacts from the water release will be negligible because the treated water will be released gradually after it has been diluted by large amounts of seawater. Tritium is considered to be relatively harmless because it does not emit enough energy to penetrate human skin. But when ingested – via seafood, for example – it can raise cancer risks, a Scientific American article said in 2014. The IAEA says nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. After visiting Fukushima Daichi on Wednesday, Grossi will travel to South Korea, where some people have been panic-buying sea salt over fears of contamination after the discharge begins. Grossi is also expected to visit New Zealand and the Cook Islands in an effort to ease concerns over the plan, according to media reports. • Reuters contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-27T05:38:03Z","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un daughter inspects another ICBM as leader hails North Korea’s nuclear power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/27/kim-jong-un-daughter-inspects-another-icbm-as-leader-hails-north-koreas-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"Kim Jong-un daughter inspects another ICBM as leader hails North Korea’s nuclear power","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Kim Jong-un has said North Korea intends to have the world’s most powerful nuclear force as the leader was again pictured with his daughter while inspecting troops and an intercontinental ballistic missile. North Korea’s “ultimate goal is to possess the world’s most powerful strategic force, the absolute force unprecedented in the century”, Kim said in an order promoting dozens of military officers involved in the launch last weekend of a new ballistic missile, state media reported on Sunday. He described the Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) as the “world’s strongest strategic weapon” and said it demonstrated North Korea’s resolve and ability to eventually build the world’s strongest army, which would reliably protect the dignity and sovereignty of the state and the people. State media also showed Kim being accompanied on a military review by his daughter, whose existence had never been publicly confirmed before last weekend’s Hwasong-17 test. Ju Ae is estimated to be about 12 or 13 years of age, which means that in about four to five years she will be preparing to attend university or go into military service, Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre in Washington, said last week. State media news agency KCNA described her as Kim’s “most beloved” or “precious” child, a more honorific title than her previous description of Kim’s “beloved” child on its dispatch the previous week. Her second appearance will raise the prospect that leadership of the totalitarian state could pass to a fourth generation of Kims. Kim is believed to have as many as three children – two girls and a boy, experts said. Some observers believed one of those children was seen in footage of celebrations for a national holiday in September. In Sunday’s report, Kim was also quoted as saying North Korean scientists had made a “wonderful leap forward in the development of the technology of mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles” and were expected to expand and strengthen the country’s nuclear deterrent at an extraordinarily rapid pace. Kim was pictured in photos posing with scientists, engineers and military officials involved in the test. According to state media, those workers pledged to defend the “absolute authority” of the party and Kim, and vowed that “our missiles will fly vigorously only in the direction indicated” by Kim. Capable of reaching the US mainland, the launch of the Hwasong-17 on 19 November prompted the US to call for a United Nations security council presidential statement to hold North Korea accountable for its missile tests, which are banned by security council resolutions. North Korea’s powerful standing committee of the Supreme People’s Assembly awarded the Hwasong-17 missile the title of “DPRK hero and gold star medal and order of national flag 1st class”, state news agency KCNA reported in another statement, using the initials of the country’s official name, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “[The missile] clearly proved before the world that the DPRK is a full-fledged nuclear power capable of standing against the nuclear supremacy of the US imperialists and fully demonstrated its might as the most powerful ICBM state,” KCNA said.

So far, so typical for a rural community in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. However, this settlement of 4,200 residents has one defining characteristic: it is located right next to one of Germany’s three remaining nuclear power stations. The challenges facing this picturesque village illustrate how the energy crisis is affecting Europe’s largest economy, as Russia’s weaponisation of the gas supply has complicated Germany’s planned transition away from nuclear. On a crisp, clear autumn day, clouds of steam rise from the Neckarwestheim nuclear plant’s pressurised water reactor, pale against the hill at whose feet it stands. For those prepared to live with a reactor as a neighbour, its arrival in the mid-70s heralded a golden age. The site’s first reactor stopped producing power in 2011, while the second has been operational since 1989. “Everyone’s dreams came true,” says Jochen Winkler, the mayor of Neckarwestheim, from his office overlooking the main square of the village, which will celebrate its 900th birthday in 2023. In more recent times, the village has flourished; its population has doubled over the four decades the power station has been there. Winkler reels off a list of the amenities enjoyed by residents, from a sports hall and a cultural centre to subsidised childcare and even, once upon a time, “welcome money” paid to the parents of newborns, all thanks to local business taxes collected from the power station. Its owner is EnBW – a majority state-owned and publicly traded energy company, whose name stands for Energy Baden-Württemberg. “We had an income equivalent to that of communities which are three or four times our size,” says Winkler. But this is coming to an end, and Neckarwestheim II is living on borrowed time, limiting the local authority’s largesse. Along with Germany’s two other remaining nuclear power stations, it was supposed to be turned off by the end of the year, undergoing the final stage of an 11-year phase-out process initiated by Angela Merkel’s government after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. However, the urgent need to ensure winter energy supply as Russia throttled flows of gas into Europe led the federal government in Berlin to grant a stay of execution. All three operating nuclear reactors – Neckarwestheim, Isar II in neighbouring Bavaria, and Emsland in the north-west close to the Dutch border – are now permitted to run until the middle of April next year. Neckarwestheim’s contribution to Germany’s electricity is not insignificant: it generated 11bn kWh of electricity in 2021. The reactor provides a sixth of the total electricity consumption in the industry-heavy state – home to significant manufacturing operations including several car plants – or two-thirds of the total electricity demand of the state’s 5m households. “People who are afraid of or have a problem with nuclear power don’t live here. New citizens who have a problem with it don’t move here,” says Winkler. That statement certainly holds for Melita Marinkovic, out walking her puppy with her 12-year-old son, who has just moved here from Ludwigsburg, 15 miles south. “If there was a problem with the reactor, they would also be affected in Ludwigsburg,” she says. Like many of her neighbours, she thinks it’s a shame the power plant is being turned off: “It’s a good source of clean energy.” Residents’ views contrast with prevailing public opinion in Germany, where the existing anti-nuclear movement gained prominence after the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, as fears grew about the risks of nuclear power. Despite Germany’s temporary extension, opponents and environmental groups continue their demonstrations. Sporting an anti-nuclear badge on his jumper, Frank Wagner, from the mid-Neckar federation of citizens’ action groups, fears the current nuclear extension is just the thin end of the wedge. “This step shows us that the dam has been breached, which makes it quite easy to say in the coming months, ‘Oh, we’ve still got an energy shortage, we need the nuclear power plants for longer,’” Wagner says. He is also concerned that no location has yet been found for the permanent storage of Germany’s nuclear waste; the discussions are expected to last nearly 30 years. Dr Andre Baumann, Baden-Württemberg’s undersecretary of state for the environment, climate and energy, insists that the April extension will be the last. The Green politician, whose party returned last year to national government as part of a three-way coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) and the Free Democrats (FDP), is adamant that no new fuel rods will be bought for Neckarwestheim, which would be necessary to keeping it running beyond April. For some, April is too late. After a previous year’s safety check at the reactor revealed cracks in pressure generator heating pipes, two local people decided to take their complaint to court. Their case will be heard later this month. The reactor’s owner, EnBW, says the plant has a “very high level of safety, also in international comparisons”. It adds that a previous court ruling found there was no reason to intervene in the operations of the reactor. The state government, with responsibility for nuclear oversight, says it is also satisfied that the plant can run safely. Apologising for the cool temperature in his office – the environment ministry has set its thermostats to 19C – Baumann says: “We mustn’t forget what’s important. We have to continue saving energy. “We have to adapt our energy system for the future. That means renewables, renewables, renewables. The setup costs are considerably lower than for new nuclear, coal or gas plants.” But the Energiewende, or energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables, of which Germany was an early adopter, appears to have stalled in recent years. Many complain that plans to transport more wind power generated in the blustery north to the energy-hungry industrial south hit obstacles as far back as 2014. While the phase-out of nuclear and fossil fuels has been planned for years, the war has forced national energy policy to swerve in the other direction. Germany is racing to finish five terminals to receive liquid natural gas (LNG), and last week signed a 15-year deal with Qatar to receive new flows of LNG from 2026. Coal also continues to play a role. A recent lack of wind has prompted Germany to burn more of it, accounting for 45% of all energy generation. This was up from 31% in the first half of 2022, according to official statistics, when almost half (49%) came from renewable sources. Some analysts are concerned that the final shutdown of nuclear, which accounted for 6% of total electricity generation in the first six months of the year, will also leave a gap. In Neckarwestheim, the authorities have developed two solar installations, but Winkler says the process of obtaining permits for new developments is lengthy and time-consuming. Dr Gottfried Kazenwadel’s is the fourth generation in his family to farm crops and grow wine nearby. The chair of the local agricultural association is generally in favour of the nuclear switch-off, and like many Germans, would prefer the country to accelerate the development of renewable energy. He jokes that the village’s name was often left off the packaging for local agricultural produce. “Neckarwestheim was always in the news,” he says, “especially when the second reactor was built, which wasn’t necessarily good for marketing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/05/russia-has-planted-suspected-explosives-on-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-roofs-says-zelenskiy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-05T14:27:18Z","webTitle":"‘Objects resembling explosives’ planted at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, says Kyiv","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/russia-has-planted-suspected-explosives-on-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-roofs-says-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/05/russia-has-planted-suspected-explosives-on-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-roofs-says-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"‘Objects resembling explosives’ planted at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, says Kyiv","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has again claimed Russia may be planning to “simulate an attack” on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, claiming that Russian troops have placed “objects resembling explosives” on the roofs of buildings at the site. Citing Ukrainian intelligence, Zelenskiy said the objects had been positioned on the roof of several power units of the power plant that is currently held by Russia. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelenskiy briefed the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Russia’s “dangerous provocations” at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine. He said he and Macron had “agreed keep the situation under maximum control together with the IAEA”, the UN’s nuclear watchdog. On Wednesday, the IAEA said its experts based at the plant said they had not observed any indications of mines or explosives at the plant, but more access was needed to be sure. “The IAEA experts have requested additional access that is necessary to confirm the absence of mines or explosives,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a statement. “In particular, access to the rooftops of reactor units 3 and 4 is essential, as well as access to parts of the turbine halls and some parts of the cooling system at the plant.” Zelenskiy’s warnings echo comments he made last week at a joint news conference in Kyiv with the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. “There is a serious threat because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the station, which could lead to a [radiation] release,” Zelenskiy said at the time. Russian troops seized the station, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, in February 2022. Each side has since regularly accused the other of shelling around the plant and risking a major nuclear mishap. Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the head of Rosenergoatom, which operates Russia’s nuclear network, said Ukraine planned to drop ammunition laced with nuclear waste transported from another of the country’s five nuclear stations on the plant. “Under cover of darkness overnight on 5 July the Ukrainian military will try to attack the Zaporizhzhia station using long-range precision equipment and kamikaze attack drones,” Russian news agencies quoted Karchaa as telling Russian television. He offered no evidence in support of the allegation. A statement issued by the Ukrainian armed forces on Tuesday, quoted “operational data” as saying that “explosive devices” had been placed on the roof of the station’s third and fourth reactors and an attack was possible “in the near future”. “If detonated, they would not damage the reactors but would create an image of shelling from the Ukrainian side,” the statement on Telegram said. It said the Ukrainian army stood “ready to act under any circumstances”. In his nightly video message, Zelenskiy said Russia was planning to “simulate an attack” on the plant. “But in any case, the world sees – and cannot fail to see – that the only source of danger to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Russia. And no one else.” Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian military provided no evidence for their assertions. On Friday Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) claimed Moscow had approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four of the six power units, as well as a cooling pond. It also said that Russian troops were reducing their presence at the plant and that Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom had been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea. While the reactors would be difficult to damage, according to former plant workers who spoke to the Guardian, the small cooling pond is vulnerable to an explosion, which could cause partial nuclear meltdown comparable to the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the US. Oleksiy Kovynyev, a former senior engineer, said that in this scenario, most radiation would be contained, but that if ventilation channels were opened, radiation could be released.

The agency’s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has alleged Moscow has approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four out of six power units, as well as a cooling pond. Last week Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Russia was plotting a “terrorist attack”. According to the GUR, several representatives of Russia’s state nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, have already left. Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom had been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea, it said. The intelligence agency named three senior individuals – the plant’s chief inspector, the head of the legal department and the deputy in charge of supplies – who had already departed. It said the number of Russian soldiers at the station and in the nearby town of Enerhodar had been reduced. Since seizing the plant last year, the Russian army has turned it into a military base. It moved hardware into the turbine halls, including armoured vehicles and ammunition. Soldiers used the territory to bombard Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro reservoir. This has mostly dried up after the Kakhovka dam downstream was blown up this month. Western governments and Kyiv say Russia deliberately sabotaged the dam to impede Ukraine’s counteroffensive. Former plant workers told the Guardian it would be difficult to damage the reactors, which were protected by thick steel and concrete. But they said the small cooling pond – which the Russians have allegedly mined – was more vulnerable, as was a dry storage area used for spent nuclear fuel. An explosion in the cooling pond could lead to a partial nuclear meltdown similar to the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the US state of Pennsylvania, Oleksiy Kovynyev, a former senior engineer, said. In this scenario, most radiation would be contained. But he added: “Of course, if you are an absolute maniac and open the ventilation channels this would throw out radiation.” Kovynyev said the dry storage area at the plant contained 24 spent “fuel assemblies”, sealed in 120 “hermetic” steel casks. “In a normal situation, they are absolutely safe. If you wanted, you could destroy them. You could shell several times. This could cause a nuclear accident with radiation release.” He said he remained optimistic no disaster would take place. Before the full-scale invasion, the plant employed 11,500 workers. An estimated 2,500 remain. Some, including the plant’s Ukrainian director, have signed contracts with Rosatom. Others have refused and have had their security passes revoked. Staff currently receive salaries from both Russia and Ukraine. The GUR said on Friday that personnel remaining at the station had been instructed to “blame Ukraine in case of any emergencies”. Russia has claimed Kyiv has endangered the station by shelling it. Ukraine has urged the international community to pay attention to the situation at the plant and to put pressure on Moscow to step back from the brink. Officials point out that Zelenskiy warned last year the Kremlin was preparing to blow up the Kakhovka dam – something that happened seven months later. The chief rabbi of Ukraine, Moshe Azman, warned the “entire world community” to do everything in its power to stop a possible catastrophe. This week Russia told the UN security council it had no plans to blow up the plant. It previously assured the council it would not invade Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/10/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-09T20:00:02Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam destroyed, flooding the frontline Southern Ukraine’s Kakhovka dam and hydroelectric station were largely destroyed on Tuesday, flooding a swathe of the war’s frontline. Ukraine blamed Russia for the destruction of the dam wall that forced thousands to evacuate. If Kremlin-installed “governor” Vladimir Saldo was trying to project a sense of calm among the deluged frontline towns and villages of Russian-occupied Kherson region, he was failing miserably, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer wrote. Saldo, dressed in camouflage and helmet and sitting in front of the flooded remains of the town centre of Nova Kakhovka, claimed that the city was “alive”. But the reality of the catastrophe was playing out around him: people stranded on the roofs of their houses and flats, begging for those with boats to come and save them. Dozens missing and whole towns downriver washed away. Satellite images would later reveal the extent of the disaster, while a Guardian team created a visual guide to the disaster on the hours after it unfolded. Russia’s UN envoy was accused of floundering in a “mud of lies” after he claimed at an emergency session of the security council that Ukraine destroyed the dam in a “war crime”, Patrick Wintour reported. At first, even as the waters were rising, Viktor Ivankhnenko hoped the one-storey home he had built on a Russian-occupied island in the Dnipro River would be safe. But as day wore into night, it became clear his optimism was misplaced. By 3am on Wednesday, Viktor, 66, and his wife, Nadiia, knew it was time to leave. Packing up what possessions they could, they got into a boat and paddled desperately to a neighbour’s two-storey house as the waters enveloped their own. Rescuers had brought the couple to Kherson by boat on Wednesday lunchtime, delivering them to a makeshift port that before the flooding was a nondescript urban crossroads. On Monday it had been 500 metres from the banks of the river, Dan Sabbagh reported, but then the dam upstream at Nova Kakhovka had burst. As the country’s agrarian and food ministry warned that the fields of southern Ukraine could “turn into deserts” by next year, Julian Borger wrote that the devastation could take decades to heal. Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant at risk, report says The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in danger of collapse, Julian Borger reports, as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dyke around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. The loss of the pool would not necessarily be catastrophic as other sources of water could be brought in, such as pumping trucks, to prevent a meltdown of the plant’s nuclear fuel, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns at the plant. The UN’s nuclear watchdog also confirmed that plant can rely on a large cooling pond above the reservoir with several months’ worth of water. The counteroffensive appears to enter its preliminary stages The current fog of war in Ukraine is in large part artificially generated: “Plans love silence,” Kyiv observed in a typically well-executed video released on social media on Sunday, showing its soldiers holding fingers to their lips. After months of speculation, and amid perceptible impatience in some foreign capitals, its long-awaited counteroffensive appears at last to be in its preliminary stages, the Guardian wrote in its editorial. For weeks now the Ukrainian army has been carrying out “shaping” or tactical operations around a vast 600-mile frontline, stretching from the south to the north-east. The goal is to wipe out Russia’s military potential, Luke Harding reported. Ukrainian units have used attack drones to destroy enemy tanks and positions in night-time missions. There have been longer-range strikes against weapons depots and fuel dumps. Kyiv has used British Storm Shadow missiles to target eastern cities such as Luhansk, taken over by Russia in 2014, and the occupied ports of Mariupol and Berdiansk. By Thursday, there was intense fighting south of Zaporizhzhia and Zelenskiy was hailing “results” in Donetsk. Nato members may send troops to Ukraine, warns former alliance chief A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states including the US do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliance’s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said. Rasmussen, who has been acting as official adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Ukraine’s place in a future European security architecture, has been touring Europe and Washington to gauge the shifting mood before the critical summit starts on 11 July. He also warned that even if a group of states did provide Ukraine with security guarantees, others would not allow the issue of Ukraine’s future Nato membership to be kept off the agenda at Vilnius. Patrick Wintour reported this story. Wagner captures Russian commander Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner group of mercenaries has captured a Russian commander, Pjotr Sauer reported, as the notorious leader further escalates his feud with the regular army. In a video posted on Prigozhin’s social media channels, Lt Col Roman Venevitin, the commander of Russia’s 72nd Brigade, tells an interrogator that, while drunk, he had ordered his troops to fire on a Wagner convoy. In the footage, which resembled clips of prisoner of war soldiers, Venevitin said he acted because of his “personal dislike” for Wagner and then apologised. Last week, Prigozhin accused the Russian army of trying to blow up his men as they were pulling back from the eastern Ukrainian town of Bakhmut. Two-year-old girl killed in Russian missile attack on Dnipro A two-year-old girl was found dead under the rubble of a house near the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro as recriminations continued about the availability of air raid shelters in the capital. Serhiy Lysak, the governor of the Dnipro region, said another 22 people were injured, including five children, in an attack that destroyed or damaged several buildings. “Overnight, the body of a girl who had just turned two was pulled from under the rubble of a house,” said the governor. The girl was called Lisa and was with her mother when the missile struck in the yard of the house, he said. Three boys aged 15, 11 and six were in intensive care after the missile strike, suffering from concussions and multiple fractures. All three had to be operated on to help their recovery, the governor said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/02/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-494-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-02T00:27:53Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 494 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/02/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-494-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/02/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-494-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 494 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin’s admission that the Wagner group had been “fully funded” by the Russian state could make it easier for an international court to prosecute him for war crimes, experts in international law have said. In the year to May 2023 alone, Wagner reportedly received more than 86bn roubles from the state budget, or over a billion dollars. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that a “serious threat” remains at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and that Russia is “technically ready” to provoke a localised explosion at the facility. Zelenskiy cited Ukrainian intelligence as the source of his information and called for greater international attention to the situation at the facility, the largest nuclear plant in Europe. Air defence systems were engaged early on Sunday in repelling a Russian air attack on Kyiv, Ukraine’s air force said. Witnesses heard blasts resembling the sound of air defence systems hitting targets, but there was no immediate information about potential damage. A 51-year-old man has been killed and two others injured by shelling in Mala Tokmachka, a village near the frontline in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhia, local officials said. The head of the local military administration, Yuriy Malashko, described the site as a “frontline community under merciless enemy fire”. US president Joe Biden will host Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson next week to talk about transatlantic security cooperation and the war in Ukraine, the White House said. The two leaders “will review our growing security cooperation and reaffirm their view that Sweden should join Nato as soon as possible”. Austria, a neutral country, announced its intention to join the European Sky Shield initiative, launched in 2022 by Germany against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine. Austrian chancellor Karl Nehammer said the decision did not call into question the neutrality of the country but cited “a threat that has considerably worsened”. “We must and will take precautions to protect our country against the risk of drone or missile attacks,” he said. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez pledged the EU’s “unequivocal” support for Ukraine during a visit to Kyiv on the first day of Spain assuming presidency of the bloc. Sanchez said his visit “demonstrates a clear and unequivocal political commitment” to Ukraine’s bid to join the EU. Ukrainian president Zelenskiy has expressed frustration over the slow deliveries of weapons and lack of clarity over pilot training by “some” western nations. “There is no schedule of training missions. I believe that some partners are dragging their feet. Why are they doing it? I don’t know,” Zelenskiy said. Two children have been injured in the Russian shelling of a residential area in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to the regional governor. A nine-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy were injured and are receiving medical treatment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/04/it-looks-like-mars-nikopol-locals-on-life-without-water-after-dam-explosion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-04T04:00:52Z","webTitle":"‘It looks like Mars’: Nikopol locals on life without water after dam explosion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/04/it-looks-like-mars-nikopol-locals-on-life-without-water-after-dam-explosion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/04/it-looks-like-mars-nikopol-locals-on-life-without-water-after-dam-explosion","fields":{"headline":"‘It looks like Mars’: Nikopol locals on life without water after dam explosion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Anna Supranova stood in front of what was once a vast artificial sea. Her home – at no 7 Hetman Street – looks on to Kakhovka reservoir in southern Ukraine. Or at least it did. The water has recently vanished. Most of it disappeared in the space of three surreal days last month, after Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam farther downstream. Ever since, Supranova and other residents in the frontline town of Nikopol have been without water. At the bottom of her garden is an unearthly and desolate muddy plain. It stretches as far as the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, visible in the near haze. The civilian facility – occupied by Moscow since the beginning of its invasion – is 5km away. The Russians have transformed the nuclear plant into a full-blown military base. According to Ukrainian intelligence, they have mined its six reactors and a cooling pond. Armoured vehicles shelter in its halls. In an ominous development, staff who have signed contracts with Rosatom – the Kremlin’s nuclear agency – have been told to leave. Three senior figures have gone to Crimea, with routine patrols scaled back. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that Vladimir Putin is plotting a “terrorist attack”, and has urged the international community to act. “We have been saying for a long time that there is a serious threat. Because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the plant, which could lead to the release of dangerous substances into the air. We communicate this very clearly,” he said on Saturday. The town of Nikopol – current population 50,000 – and other nearby cities are taking the threat seriously. Last week for the first time they carried out radiation drills, a rehearsal for what locals should do in case of a repeat of the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, when contamination blew from Ukraine to Belarus, and across Europe to Scandinavia. It was the world’s worst ever civil nuclear incident. “The Zaporizhzhia plant is on my doorstep. You can see it,” Supranova said. “If there is a nuclear leak we will fetch the dog, go inside and close the windows and doors. Unfortunately we don’t have a car. We won’t get far on foot.” She, her husband, Serhiy, and 15-year-old daughter, Angelina, would wait for rescue. “I’m not sure who exactly would come,” she admitted. Speaking on Monday, the Nikopol military district chief Yevhen Yevtushenko said the situation was under control. Radiation levels were normal. There was no sign that the Russians were leaving the plant in big numbers, he said. The authorities were not planning a forced evacuation – for now. Since Russia’s all-out attack in February 2022 about half of the town’s population had moved to safer areas, he said. Asked what the west might do to mitigate the situation, he answered wryly: “Make the Russians disappear. The safety issues with the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant only started when they showed up. If we can get rid of them the problems will go as well.” Thus far, the response from EU nations and the US to the developing crisis was unimpressive and “lethargic”. “An explosion would be a catastrophe for the Black Sea region, for Europe and humanity,” he stressed. Russia’s reckless sabotage of the dam left 200,000 people in the district without drinking water, he added. Levels at the reservoir continued to fall. The town was delivering water in fire trucks, and distributing it free of charge. It briefly reappeared in domestic taps, only to stop flowing half an hour later. In addition to a growing nuclear threat, Nikopol has for the past year come under regular Russian bombardment. Soldiers based in the plant and in the next-door village of Vodiane shell the town most days or hit it with Grad missiles. On 26 June two civilians were killed and one injured. The Russians are so close that there is no warning when a strike might occur or where a projectile will land. Outside Nikopol’s shrapnel-pitted palace of culture, pensioner Oleksandr Sherban described the Russians as “idiots”. “Nobody knows what’s going to happen, or what they are capable of doing. They’ve mined everything,” he said. “Their bombing is completely unpredictable. It can happen any time of the day: morning or night. I think they do it whenever they’ve had a good meal.” Sherban said Vladimir Putin was trying to use the nuclear plant for blackmail. The move was connected to Ukraine’s counter-offensive and its attempt to liberate the Zaporizhzhia region. He described the Russian-seized town of Enerhodar – adjacent to the plant and home to its atomic engineers – as “beautiful”. “I used to travel there by ferry. You could go across the reservoir in a boat,” he recalled. Olexiy Kovynyev, a former senior nuclear worker who fled from Enerhodar last year, said the situation at the plant was tense. About 2,500 from its original 11,500 Ukrainian staff remained, he estimated. Many of those who stayed had – under pressure – signed contracts to work with Rosatom. They included its Ukrainian chief engineer, Yuriy Chernichuk, whom the Russians promoted to director. “There are conflicts between those who collaborated, and those who didn’t,” he said. Kovynyev said that the plant’s reactors were impregnable, and encased in thick steel and concrete. More vulnerable was a dry storage area – home to spent radioactive fuel – and the cooling pond. “An explosion there would likely be contained. Of course if you are an absolute maniac and open the ventilation channels radiation would be thrown out,” he said. Kovynyev described the destruction of the Soviet-built reservoir as terrible. “It looks like Mars, an arid desert,” he said. “Before it was a sea. I would swim in it. Every summer I would go to Enerhodar’s beach, take my sleeping bag and bed down for the night under the stars. It was wonderful.” He said he remained optimistic that a Chornobyl-style catastrophe might be avoided. A billboard on the way into town reads: “Nikopol. Home to indomitable people.” The route in passes a snaking estuary – now entirely dried up, and devoid of life apart from a few gulls. The city was once a Cossack stronghold and the centre of a self-governing area known as the Zaporizhian Sich. Many of its modern factories are still working. Some people who left last year ran out of money, and came back, residents said. Acting headteacher Svitlana Karamushka said locals had got used to living in a war zone. Many families had stayed and children learned online, she said. She had prepared a suitcase in case she needed to evacuate, and had taken part in a training session on what to do in the event of a nuclear explosion. “You have to wash victims,” she said. Who was to blame for this horrible situation? “Putin. He’s a prick,” her friend Nataliya said. Back in Hetman Street, Supranova said the sudden disappearance of water was killing off her vegetable patch. The garden included apple trees, and a luscious trailing vine, which blanketed most of her cottage. “I’ve planted potatoes. I’m not sure if I’ll be able to harvest them,” she admitted. She added: “I’ve lived here my entire life, 36 years. I really don’t want to go. We hope for the best and prepare for the worst.” Luke Harding’s Invasion: Russia’s Bloody War and Ukraine’s Fight for Survival, shortlisted for the Orwell Prize, is now available in paperback from Guardian Faber"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-gmb-union-energy-policy-north-sea-oil-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T21:30:43Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer pledges ‘good, union jobs’ amid energy row with GMB","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-gmb-union-energy-policy-north-sea-oil-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-gmb-union-energy-policy-north-sea-oil-gas","fields":{"headline":"Keir Starmer pledges ‘good, union jobs’ amid energy row with GMB","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Keir Starmer will pledge to put “good, union jobs” at the heart of Labour’s energy policy during a speech to one of its biggest donor unions after its general secretary criticised a proposed ban on oil and gas expansion. He will speak at the GMB’s annual conference on Tuesday, a day after he tried to calm a growing rift with its leadership over Labour’s energy policy. In a speech pledging to put workers at the heart of the party’s planned transition to green energy, the Labour leader will also seek to portray the prime minister as London-centric and overly concerned with banking. “If the City of London races ahead while the rest of Britain stagnates, as long as there was a hint of growth on his spreadsheet, Rishi Sunak would think that’s fine. But it’s not,” Starmer will tell the GMB congress in Brighton. “If you leave this many people behind, a nation cannot grow fairly. We can’t do it with low wages. We can’t do it with insecure jobs and bad work, with a stand-aside state that doesn’t fight for the future, without a proper industrial strategy.” Starmer – who is likely to be challenged on his opposition towards Labour MPs joining picket lines – will also pledge that Labour in government will work with unions, strengthening their role in society and urging businesses such as Amazon to recognise them. “We can create a new business model for Britain, one which creates economic security and grows not just our productivity, but our hope and our optimism. Labour in government will work with unions. We will always see the fight for working people as our driving purpose.” His appearance comes amid discontent among Labour’s union base over a pledge to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power. The party is proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB, said on Sunday that Labour had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. In an apparent attempt to reassure union critics, Starmer stressed on Monday that “oil and gas will be part of our energy mix for many, many years to come”. Speaking during a visit to the Hinkley C nuclear power project in Somerset, he said: “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity now to seize the jobs of the future. Oil and gas will be part of that because, where there are existing licences, they will go on to the 2050s.” However, only a couple of hours later Smith used a speech to the Brighton conference to reiterate his criticism, urging Labour to focus on a “mix of energy sources” if it gains power, including oil and gas. He said that – while the union wanted a Labour government – he disagreed with its energy policy. “We have to fix and secure our energy supply if we are to face down threats from authoritarian regimes in the world and find a workable way to achieve net zero,” Smith said. The Unite union has also criticised Labour’s stance. Its general secretary, Sharon Graham, said last week that the UK needed a properly planned transition that would “guarantee jobs, pay and conditions for all the tens of thousands of workers in the North Sea and supporting industries”. Starmer’s plans have received significant support from a range of high-profile groups, including other trade unions, environmental campaigners and even the Women’s Institute. Last year, Unite and the GMB each gave Labour about £1.2m. Starmer said on Monday that Labour talks to the GMB “all the time”. Energy policy is expected to be a key battleground for Labour in the run-up to the next election. The energy crisis, provoked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has fuelled debate over Britain’s energy security and plans for green jobs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/12/number-of-nuclear-weapons-held-by-major-powers-rising-says-thinktank","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-11T23:01:04Z","webTitle":"Number of nuclear weapons held by major powers rising, says thinktank","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/number-of-nuclear-weapons-held-by-major-powers-rising-says-thinktank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/12/number-of-nuclear-weapons-held-by-major-powers-rising-says-thinktank","fields":{"headline":"Number of nuclear weapons held by major powers rising, says thinktank","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The number of operational nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the major military powers is on the rise again according to a leading thinktank, whose analysts warn the world is “drifting into one of the most dangerous periods in human history”. At a time of both deteriorating international relations and the escalation of nuclear sabre-rattling, there are now said to be an estimated 12,512 warheads globally, of which 9,576 are in military stockpiles ready for potential use, up 86 on a year ago. The rise brings to an end the period of gradual decline that followed the end of the cold war. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) suggested 60 of the new warheads were held by China. The other new weapons are attributed to Russia (12), Pakistan (five), North Korea (five) and India (four). The increase in battle-fit warheads comes despite a statement in 2021 from the UN’s five permanent security council members – the US, Russia, China, the UK and France – that “nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. Russia and the US together possess almost 90% of all the nuclear weapons globally. In addition to their usable nuclear weapons, the two powers each hold more than 1,000 warheads previously retired from military service, which they are gradually dismantling. Of the total of 12,512 warheads in the world, which includes those that are retired and awaiting dismantlement, Sipri estimates that 3,844 are deployed with missiles and aircraft. Around 2,000 of those – nearly all of which belong to Russia or the US – are kept in a state of high operational alert, meaning that they are fitted to missiles or held at airbases hosting nuclear bombers. Sipri notes, however, that the full picture is difficult to judge as a number of countries, including Russia, the US and the UK, have reduced their level of transparency since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China, the world’s third biggest nuclear power, is believed to have increased its number of warheads from 350 in January 2022 to 410 in January 2023. That arsenal is expected to keep growing but Sipri predicts it they will not surpass the arsenals of the US and Russia. The report adds that China has never declared the size of its nuclear arsenal and that many of its assessments rely on data from the US Department of Defense (DOD). In 2021, commercial satellite imagery revealed that China had started construction of hundreds of new missile silos across the north of its territory. Hans M Kristensen, an associate senior fellow with Sipri’s weapons of mass destruction programme, said: “China has started a significant expansion of its nuclear arsenal. It is increasingly difficult to square this trend with China’s declared aim of having only the minimum nuclear forces needed to maintain its national security.” France (290) and the UK (225) are the world’s next largest nuclear powers and British operational arsenal is expected to grow further following an announcement two years ago that it was raising its limit from 225 to 260 warheads. Of the 225 UK warheads, 120 of are said to be operationally available for delivery by Trident II D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), with about 40 being carried on a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) that is on patrol at all times. The UK government has said, however, that it will no longer publicly disclose its quantities of nuclear weapons, deployed warheads or deployed missiles amid increased global tensions. The new British policy is just one sign of a breakdown in cooperation over the future of nuclear weapons. The US suspended its bilateral strategic stability dialogue with Russia following the invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin announced it was suspending its participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty limiting the strategic nuclear forces of the two cold war foes. Meanwhile, Russia’s government has increasingly spoken of the risk of nuclear war since its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Putin has said that he has put Russia’s nuclear deterrent on high alert. He also said in the immediate wake of his invasion that the consequences for those who stood in his country’s way would be “such as you have never seen in your entire history”. Since then, Nato’s arming of Ukraine’s military has provoked a constant stream of nuclear threats from figures close to the Kremlin. Dan Smith, a director at Sipri, said: “We are drifting into one of the most dangerous periods in human history. It is imperative that the world’s governments find ways to cooperate in order to calm geopolitical tensions, slow arms races and deal with the worsening consequences of environmental breakdown and rising world hunger.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-08T20:43:02Z","webTitle":"Ukraine: cooling pond at Zaporizhzhia plant at risk after dam collapse – report ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine: cooling pond at Zaporizhzhia plant at risk after dam collapse – report ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dyke around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. The loss of the pool would not necessarily be catastrophic as other sources of water could be brought in, such as pumping trucks, to prevent a meltdown of the plant’s nuclear fuel, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns at the plant. Officials at the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, said that any collapse of the dyke around the cooling pond would be partial even in a worst-case scenario and that there would still be sufficient water to keep reactor cores and spent fuel cool, but they warned of the dangers of sabotage by Russian forces who are occupying the plant. Since the collapse of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday, its reservoir has been draining into the Dnipro River and the Black Sea beyond, and will soon drop below the water intakes used to pump water into an array of spray ponds that are used to cool the reactor cores and spent fuel at the site and the much bigger cooling pool used as a water reserve. “We are reaching this dead zone, which is 12.70 [metres], after which there will not be any water intake either for the cooling ponds at the Zaporizhzhia station,” Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo, Ukraine’s hydro power corporation, said on Thursday. In the wake of the dam disaster, for which Ukraine, the UN, EU and other world leaders are holding Russia responsible, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned that “it is vital that this cooling pond remains intact”. “Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity,” he said. He later added that water from the Kakhovka reservoir was still being pumped to the power plant to cool reactors and other areas, though levels are at values earlier thought to make it impossible. The plant can also rely on a large cooling pond above the reservoir with several months’ worth of water, Grossi said. The IRSN report suggests that the integrity of the dyke around the pond could be in danger of collapse even without Russian sabotage. “A drop in the Dnipro’s water level could lead to basin leakage, or even to the collapse of the surrounding dyke, due to the pressure exerted by the water contained in the basin,” it said. It added that Energoatom had conducted stress tests after the Fukushima nuclear disaster following a tsunami in 2011. Those tests, it said, estimated that the dike can “withstand a Dnipro level of 10 metres in the vicinity of the power plant”. “This water level and the watertightness of the retention basin will be closely monitored over the coming days,” the report said. Karine Herviou, the IRSN’s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant’s cooling needs are limited and could be met by other means. “If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,” Herviou told the Guardian. Asked about the IRSN report, an Energoatom official said: “If the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir drops to less than 10 metres, the dam on the cooling pond may collapse, but not completely. Only the upper part may collapse. “But even then, the amount of water that will remain will be enough to keep the plant in a cold mode.” The president of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said on Thursday that the current water supply at Zaporizhzhia is enough “to keep the nuclear power plant in a safe mode of operation”, but warned of the threat of Russian sabotage. “The very fact that the Russians blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station demonstrates that the Russians have no qualms about creating man-made disasters on earth,” Kotin said in an interview on Ukrainian television. “They can do the same on the territory of Zaporizhzhya NPP [nuclear power plant]. The consequences will be very bad.” “The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined – both the interior and the access roads to it,” he said. “We currently have no information about whether the Russians have mined the plant’s equipment. This will become known after the plant is liberated.” Edwin Lyman, a physicist and director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said: “Anything that challenges the integrity of the cooling pond would cause complications and require alternate means of getting water to the spray ponds, as the paper points out. “My main concern at the moment is the increasing fragility of the site and the uncertainty regarding the ability of the reduced and stressed personnel to cope with a long-term emergency situation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-438-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-07T17:34:33Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 438 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-438-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/07/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-438-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 438 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The head of the Wagner group has said he has been promised as much ammunition and weaponry as he needs to continue his assault on the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

According to the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, the Russian military dropped the shells from a drone near a populated area on Saturday. Russia’s former president Dmitry Medvedev has threatened anyone convicted of carrying out Saturday’s attack on the nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin with life in prison. Writing on Telegram, Medvedev, who is now deputy chair of Russia’s security council, said that any suspects, “like other criminals, will be tried for the attack and sentenced to long prison terms”. The Russian nationalist writer Zakhar Prilepin, who was injured in a car explosion on Saturday, has been brought out of a medically induced coma, according to local officials. Air raid alerts sounded for several hours overnight into early Sunday over roughly two-thirds of Ukraine. Officials said air defence systems shot down a number of drones, including one over Kyiv’s airspace. Five people were injured in a strike on the city of Balaklia, local authorities said. Oleg Synegubov, the governor of eastern Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that a missile landed near a car park on Sunday. Russia has claimed that its defence systems shot down 22 Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea overnight on Saturday. Writing on Telegram, the ministry of defence said that “during the night, 22 Ukrainian strike unmanned aerial vehicles were detected over the Black Sea by means of air defence.” Ukraine launched more than 10 drones on the Crimean peninsula overnight, including three on the port of Sevastopol, a Russian-installed official said early on Sunday. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said the situation in the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was becoming “increasingly unpredictable and potentially dangerous”. Sixteen settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were hit by a total of 75 strikes over the past day, according to the local military administration. A 72-year-old woman was killed and two people were injured by shelling in the southern Dnipro region, local officials said. The number of Russian soldiers killed or wounded since the start of the war stands at 193,430, according to latest estimates from the Ukrainian military. A gas pipeline and power lines in the Russian border region of Belgorod were damaged in overnight shelling by the Ukrainian armed forces, according to the local governor.

Despite intensifying propaganda, even government data shows this military-backed technology to be, in reality, an expensive, slow, unreliable, risky and unpopular way to deliver affordable, secure, zero-carbon energy. The gap in efficacy and competitiveness between nuclear and other options is continually growing. Supporting nuclear, rather than energy efficiency, wind and solar, slows down climate action, bleeds taxpayers, forgoes jobs and forces unnecessarily large and regressive burdens on consumers. Yet firehosing scarce public resources at ailing nuclear initiatives proceeds unabated. The nuclear fuel fund announced by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on Tuesday is yet another among uncounted nozzles pointed variously at research, liability, insurance, training, finance, regulation, planning, non-proliferation, security, waste management, grid codes, etc. One notable feature of this most recent example of a worsening syndrome is that in the opening lines introducing this initiative, the BEIS says: “Nuclear is the only form of reliable, low-carbon generation which has been deployed at scale to date.” Whatever side is taken amid the complexities, the manifest falsity of this starkly unqualified statement is extraordinary. As the government’s own data also shows, the costs of managing variable supply are rapidly diminishing and are already far smaller than the competitiveness gap between nuclear and renewables. Current renewable contributions to UK electricity far surpass the peak achieved by nuclear. When did it become acceptable in British public life that a supposedly democratic government should so seriously misrepresent reality in a formal policy document? In a period when stakes are unprecedentedly high for climate, economy, energy security and hard-pressed households, it is time to renew reasoned scientific and democratic debate in this field and prevent this national self-harm by unaccountable special interests.

The decision by the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, which had been repeatedly delayed, was finally announced on Wednesday and went against the advice of the independent Planning Inspectorate. French energy company EDF wants to build the 3.2 GW, two-reactor plant next to its existing site at Sizewell B, which began operating in 1995. However, the proposals have faced fierce opposition from local campaigners, who have argued against the project because of the environmental impact and the cost to energy billpayers. Campaigners now have six weeks to decide whether to appeal against the decision. Planning permission was seen as a key hurdle for the project which remains subject to a further final investment decision, expected next year. It is hoped the plant can generate enough power for six million homes. The approval process for Sizewell C has so far included four rounds of public consultation which began in 2012 and has involved more than 10,000 East Suffolk residents. The Planning Inspectorate rejected the scheme because of concerns over the plant’s impact on protected species and habitats, and the long-term water supply at the site. EDF worked with Chinese state-backed nuclear specialist CGN on the first phase of the project. However, it is understood the UK government is keen to ease CGN out amid concerns over Chinese involvement with sensitive assets. Bankers at Barclays have been hired to secure new financial backing for the project alongside EDF and the UK government. Boris Johnson’s government put £100m of funding behind the project in January to support its development. Carly Vince, the project’s chief planning officer, said: “Sizewell C will be good for the region, creating thousands of opportunities for local people and businesses. It will boost local biodiversity and leave a legacy Suffolk can be proud of.” Julia Pyke, the director of financing for Sizewell C, said: “Energy costs will be lower with nuclear in the mix, so today’s decision is good news for billpayers. The tried and tested funding arrangement we are proposing means that, by paying a small amount during construction, consumers will benefit in the long-term. “Sizewell C will give a big boost to jobs and skills in nuclear supply chain companies across the country. It will strengthen the UK’s energy security and play a key role in our fight against climate change.” Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “The wrong decision has been made but it’s not the end of our campaign to Stop Sizewell C. Not only will we be looking closely at appealing this decision, we’ll continue to challenge every aspect of Sizewell C, because – whether it is the impact on consumers, the massive costs and delays, the outstanding technical questions or the environmental impacts – it remains a very bad risk.” Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: “The construction of the proposed development will be damaging and it has been granted with insufficient consideration for the effects on nature as described by the government’s own experts. This is a ludicrous decision for an interim government to make.” Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, called the project a “red herring energy solution” as the UK attempts to move towards a low-carbon energy system. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the decision “significantly strengthens the pipeline of new nuclear capacity in Britain”. Hinkley Point C in Somerset, also backed by EDF, has been beset by delays and cost over-runs. The French government said on Tuesday it was prepared to pay €10bn (£8.5bn) to fully nationalise EDF amid concerns over its finances. Ministers in France want to keep a handle on soaring energy bills. Johnson has set a target of making investment decisions on eight new nuclear projects by the end of the decade."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-13T09:38:50Z","webTitle":"Australia will have ‘unequivocal’ control over nuclear-powered submarines, insists chief adviser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/13/australia-will-have-unequivocal-control-over-nuclear-powered-submarines-insists-chief-advisor","fields":{"headline":"Australia will have ‘unequivocal’ control over nuclear-powered submarines, insists chief adviser","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The head of Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine taskforce insists Australia will retain full operational control over the submarines, while potentially having US or British engineers on board to provide technical advice. The comments follow renewed debate in recent weeks over whether the flagship project of the Aukus pact – which relies on support from the US and the UK – will lead to an erosion of Australian sovereignty. The former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has been calling on the government to answer whether the submarines could be “operated, sustained and maintained by Australia without the support or supervision of the US navy”, and whether that effectively meant “sovereignty would be shared with the US”. But the head of the taskforce advising the Australian government on the acquisition of at least eight submarines, Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, used an interview with ABC TV on Monday evening to assert Australian control. “When we take command of our first boat, we will have sovereign capability,” he told the 7.30 program. “We will be commanding and controlling, under the Australian government direction, that nuclear-powered submarine.” Mead allowed for the possibility Australia would need advice from foreign engineers – but said that would not limit Australian command and control. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “Yes, we may have US or UK seariders on board to assist,” he told the ABC’s Sarah Ferguson. “We would expect anyone, whether it be a foreign engineer or an Australian engineer, to provide advice. Ultimately the commanding officer of that submarine – the Australian – would have command and control over the reactor, over the submarine, unequivocal.” Mead continued to argue that the nuclear reactors powering the submarines – to be supplied from overseas – would be “welded shut” and would not need refuelling during the life of the boat, so Australia would not need to manufacture nuclear fuel. But Mead said the plan would require Australia to send personnel to US “design facilities”. That would enable Australia to understand “every element of detail of that reactor”, he said. Mead did not rule out the possibility that Australia might build its own nuclear reactors in the future, although that would be a decision for government. “We are not envisioning that at the moment, we haven’t gone into that at the moment,” he said. Like the defence minister, Richard Marles, Mead expressed confidence that the plan to be announced soon would ensure there was no capability gap between the retirement of Australia’s existing Collins class diesel-electric submarines and the entry into service of nuclear-powered boats. But he did not provide specifics. Mead also described the purpose of nuclear-powered submarines as being to “put the greatest question of doubt in the enemy’s mind” and “if necessary, respond with massive firepower”. Marles used a speech to parliament last week to declare that acquiring nuclear-powered submarines would “dramatically enhance” Australia’s sovereignty, rather than undermine it. Marles, who is also the deputy prime minister, said “the reality is that almost all of Australia’s high-end capability is developed in cooperation with our partners”. Marles said Australia would “always make sovereign, independent decisions on how our capabilities are employed”. In the wake of that speech, Turnbull tweeted that it was “quite a different thing to have a major platform that cannot be operated without the supervision/support of another country”. Turnbull said on Monday evening: “I think the question which has not been answered is: could the submarines be operated if US technical advice/support were withdrawn? The entire resources of the Australian news media have been unable to pin the government or the navy down on that.” Paul Keating, the former Labor prime minister has previously raised concerns about increased reliance on US support and suggested Australia’s sovereignty was being “wilfully suborned”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/18/energy-fears-weaken-german-taboos-over-nuclear-power-and-speed-limits","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-18T14:55:32Z","webTitle":"Energy fears weaken German taboos over nuclear power and speed limits","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/18/energy-fears-weaken-german-taboos-over-nuclear-power-and-speed-limits","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/18/energy-fears-weaken-german-taboos-over-nuclear-power-and-speed-limits","fields":{"headline":"Energy fears weaken German taboos over nuclear power and speed limits","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Germany’s energy crisis has led the coalition government to toy with ideas that have long been seen as politically taboo, such as extending the life of unpopular nuclear power plants and – perhaps even more divisive – imposing a speed limit on the autobahn in the hope it will reduce fuel usage. As the country braces for a winter of uncertainty amid fears that Russian gas could be cut off completely and electricity may be in short supply, the three-way coalition of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business FDP are looking for ways to ease the situation. Central to the debate is also how Germany hopes to maintain its climate goals, particularly after a recent decision – backed by the Green economics minister – to reignite highly polluting coal-fired power plants for a limited time. The proposal gaining ever more traction and making its mark in newspaper editorials and late-night television debates is for the country’s remaining three nuclear power plants, which are due to close at the end of the year, to be kept running, a move staunchly opposed by the Green party since it came into existence in the 1980s. Meanwhile, the FDP has not publicly signalled that it is ready to give up its enduring opposition to a speed limit on the autobahns, but the opposition Christian Democrats, under pressure from their close allies, have hinted they may be prepared to consider backing a temporary limit. Germany’s last three remaining nuclear power stations generate enough electricity to heat about 7m homes, or to cover just under 6% of the country’s electricity needs. Talk of keeping them open remains speculative, but comments from both sides of the debate suggest they might move towards a compromise. The Greens’ co-leader, Ricarda Lang, said on Sunday that it was not the right time to think of prolonging the life of the plants, but she said that owing to the energy crisis and the impact it was having on lower-income families, her party had to be ready to consider all options. “At every moment in this crisis we need to react according to the current situation and to examine every measure. That’s what we’ve done in the past … and that’s what we’ll continue to do,” she said on German television. She said the Greens’ main concern was the impact of higher energy bills. “We have to prevent a wave of poverty,” she said. In response, Jens Spahn, a parliamentary deputy of the Christian Democrats, which along with the FDP has long opposed a speed limit, said: “If the Greens said they would let nuclear power run for another half a year, then I believe we should also be ready to talk about the speed limit.” He told Germany’s breakfast TV programme Morgenmagazin that at a time of national emergency, “everyone has to be prepared to jump over their own shadows”. Experts have said the flippant way in which the two issues are being discussed does not reflect the complexities behind them. The two issues are said to be to Germans the equivalent of what gun ownership is to Americans. The phase-out of nuclear power plants in Germany was triggered by the Fukishima accident in Japan in 2011, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to renewed debate. A government report concluded that prolonging their use was not advisable as it would “only make a small contribution to energy security” and would “increase costs elsewhere”. It said the challenge of refuelling them would mean they would not deliver electricity until autumn 2023, and they would have to run between three and five years longer in order to make investments in staff and infrastructure pay off. It also said security measures to protect the plants, including from air attack, meant it was not feasible to consider them as a short-term solution. And all that is before any likely legal challenges are taken into account. Introducing a speed limit on the parts of the motorway that have none would be easier, in theory. Advocates say it would increase safety and reduce emissions. A 130 km/h (80 mph) limit could decrease CO2 emissions by 1.9m tonnes a year, according to the German environment agency. Opponents argue it would not make the roads safer – most deaths occur on country roads, not motorways – and insist the freedom to speed has to be clung to as it is one of the few areas of German life which remain relatively unregulated. FDP voters are among the strongest supporters of no speed limit and keeping nuclear power, while Green voters are almost equally in favour of a speed limit and ditching nuclear power. And just as the Greens argue that a speed limit would reduce emissions, FDP members are liable to argue that keeping open the three nuclear plants would save about 30m tonnes of CO2 annually. ADAC, which represents about 21 million German drivers, has said about 50% of its members are in favour of the introduction of a limit and 45% are against."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-20T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"UK nuclear power stations’ decommissioning cost soars to £23.5bn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/20/uk-nuclear-power-stations-decommissioning-cost","fields":{"headline":"UK nuclear power stations’ decommissioning cost soars to £23.5bn","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The cost of decommissioning the UK’s seven ageing nuclear power stations has nearly doubled to £23.5bn and is likely to rise further, the public accounts committee has said. The soaring costs of safely decommissioning the advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs), including Dungeness B, Hunterston B and Hinkley B, are being loaded on to the taxpayer, their report said. Failures in the government’s investment strategy for the fund, which was set up to pay for the decommissioning, have led to the taxpayer topping it up by an additional £10.7bn in just two years. The nuclear power stations are owned by EDF Energy and provide much of the UK’s nuclear power-generated electricity, which makes up 16% of the energy mix. But the stations are nearing the end of their lives and are scheduled to stop generating electricity during this decade. The government has recently agreed that once the stations have been defuelled by EDF, which involves the removal of all the spent fuel from the reactor core and cooling ponds, ownership of the stations will be transferred to the government’s Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) to complete decommissioning. “The pace at which the stations can be defuelled could have a big impact on the costs, between £3.1bn and £8bn depending on the time taken,” the inquiry report said. “Successful defuelling will depend on all parties being ready and working together, including the NDA being ready to receive and dismantle the volume of fuel arriving at Sellafield. Any delays in the defuelling process could result in costs increasing substantially. “The handover agreement does not appear to sufficiently ‘incentivise cost efficiency and ensure a smooth transfer of defuelled stations to the NDA’.” The public accounts committee also said it had concerns over whether the NDA had the capacity to take on the seven AGR stations in addition to its other responsibilities, which includes decommissioning the older Magnox reactors. It will cost the UK taxpayer £132bn to decommission all the UK’s civil nuclear sites and the work will not be completed for another 120 years, according to latest estimates. Boris Johnson has pledged to build eight nuclear power stations in eight years. But the UK has no facility for permanently and safely storing the waste from past, present or future nuclear power stations. Most is currently stored at Sellafield, one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world. Nuclear Waste Services, an arm of the government, is seeking a site to build a geological deposit facility deep underground for all the UK’s nuclear waste. MPs on the public accounts committee said in their report on Friday the government must learn lessons from the rising costs of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors and be clear how the decommissioning of proposed new nuclear stations would be funded. The seven stations were sold by the government to EDF in 2009, with the later agreement that the French company would remove the fuel from the stations when they closed, and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority would take on the decommissioning of the sites. But the cost of decommissioning the seven AGR reactors that began to close last year, plus Sizewell B, has more than doubled from £12.6bn in 2004-05 to £23.5bn in 2020-21, the public accounts committee report said. “There remain significant uncertainties that will need to be managed to prevent further increases in costs and ease pressures on the fund,” the report said. “The cost of defuelling will depend on the stations not closing significantly earlier than planned and how quickly they can be defuelled once electricity generation ceases.” There was significant risk that the cost of decommissioning the seven AGRs would rise further, the report said. The public accounts committee, in a previous report, said the cost of decommissioning the older Magnox reactors – which were the first generation of UK nuclear stations – had increased by billions of pounds because of uncertainty over the condition of the sites and how to tackle the decommissioning. The PAC report said the closure of seven nuclear stations by 2028 would have a significant impact on energy production, but EDF has said there can be no extensions to the life of the reactors while the UK waits for new generating capacity to come online. • This article was amended on 20 May 2022 to refer correctly to Hunterston B power station, not “Hunstanton B”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-492-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-30T09:33:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 492 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-492-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/30/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-492-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 492 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Ukrainian senior defence official has repeated that its troops are advancing in all directions of their counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces. “If we talk about the entire frontline, both east and south, we have seized the strategic initiative and are advancing in all directions,” deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar told Ukrainian television. Russia is gradually reducing the number of personnel at the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in southern Ukraine, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency said on Friday. The GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. It said Ukrainian employees who have signed a contract with Rosatom had also been advised to depart. Employees should leave by 5 July, it said, and have been told to preferably head for the Crimea peninsula. Overnight the Russian army attacked military infrastructure facilities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s air force claimed four S-300 missiles and 13 “Shahed” drones were fired, and air defence forces shot down ten drones. Ukraine’s general staff has claimed that it struck the headquarters and storage depots of Russian troops in the suburbs of Berdiansk. Local Russian-imposed officials said that air defence had repelled the attack. Video distributed on social media appeared to show smoke rising over the occupied city. In Kramatorsk, a makeshift memorial has been set up carrying pictures of some of the people killed in a missile strike on a restaurant earlier this week. Twelve people died and at least 56 people were injured, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia claimed the strike was on a military target. Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Friday that he believes the west is aiming to freeze the conflict in Ukraine to buy time to pump more arms into the country. He also accused the west of having a “schizophrenic” approach to the conflict, saying they first wanted to see Russia lose on the battlefield and for its leaders to go on trial – and only then to press for peace in Ukraine. Lavrov also described the west’s attitude to the Black Sea grain deal as “outrageous” and lamented the fact that grain was not being exported to the world’s poorest countries. Wagner mercenaries will no longer fight in Ukraine after their leader refused to sign contracts with the Kremlin. Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to sign the contracts, according to the head of the Duma defence committee, Andrei Kartapolov. Overnight, the BBC has been reporting that recruitment continues at Wagner mercenary offices across Russia, despite the fallout from the weekend’s armed mutiny. Sweden’s prime minister said on Friday his Hungarian counterpart had assured him that Budapest would not delay the Nordic country’s Nato accession, following reports that Hungary’s parliament would delay a ratification of the membership. Hungary rejects the European Commission’s plans to grant more money to Ukraine and is not willing to contribute additional money to finance the EU’s increased debt service costs, prime minister Viktor Orbán told state radio on Friday. Poland has detained a Russian ice-hockey player playing for a first division Polish team on spying charges, prosecutors said on Friday, describing him as the 14th person that had been arrested from one espionage network. The Kremlin has declined to answer questions about the whereabouts of Sergei Surovikin amid unconfirmed reports that the Russian army general had been detained and was being questioned by the security services. US intelligence has claimed that Surovikin, who previously led the invasion force in Ukraine, had prior knowledge of Prigozhin’s uprising, in which Wagner mercenaries captured the city of Rostov-on-Don and moved on Moscow before striking an amnesty deal. Surovikin has not been seen in public since Saturday. Asked if the Kremlin could clarify the situation with Surovikin, Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “No, unfortunately not. So I recommend that you contact the defence ministry. This is its prerogative.” Former US President Donald Trump has said now is the time for the US to try to broker a negotiated peace settlement between Russia and Ukraine and that Vladimir Putin has been “somewhat weakened” by Wagner’s aborted mutiny. “I want people to stop dying over this ridiculous war,” Trump told Reuters in an interview. Trump said everything would be “subject to negotiation” if he were president. Mike Pence met Volodymyr Zelenskiy Thursday during surprise Ukraine trip. Pence is the first Republican presidential candidate to meet the Ukrainian president during the US campaign. Pence told NBC News: “Coming here just as a private citizen … just steels my resolve to do my part, to continue to call for strong American support for our Ukrainian friends and allies.” The Russian-imposed acting governor of the occupied Kherson region on Thursday denied claims that Ukrainian troops had succeeded in establishing any kind of bridgehead over the Dnipro river at the location of the Antonivskyi Bridge. He has also claimed that Russian forces repelled multiple landing attempts in the area. Russia said it was opening criminal cases against what it claimed to be 160 mercenaries from 33 different countries who were operating on behalf of Ukrainian forces in the country."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-19T18:06:22Z","webTitle":"Russian strike at Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant but reactors not damaged – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/19/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-ukrainian-military-says-russian-attacks-repelled-in-kharkiv-and-kherson","fields":{"headline":"Russian strike at Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant but reactors not damaged – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We are now closing this live blog. Here is a summary of today’s events: Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region – one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Ukraine’s first lady Olena Zelenska said it was a “great honour” to be present at the Queen’s state funeral, “on behalf of all Ukrainians”. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions, a study finds. Russia’s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said. The Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said during a visit to China. Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. Germany’s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to around 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the UK’s ministry of defence said. Russia was one of a small group of countries excluded from the Queen’s state funeral in London today that included Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia’s president Vladimir Putin is “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia’s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. Ukrainian military said on Sunday its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region, while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, has criticised Russia after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. Denis Pushilin, head of the Russia-backed separatist Donetsk region of Ukraine, has called on his fellow separatist leader of Luhansk province to combine efforts aimed at preparing a referendum on joining Russia. Reuters reports that in a video posted on social media, he told Luhansk People’s Republic leader Leonid Pasechnik in a phone call that “our actions should be synchronised”. Germany’s defence minister Christine Lambrecht said her country will provide Ukraine with four additional self-propelled howitzers and ammunition. Lambrecht said the 10 howitzers already supplied by Germany and eight from the Netherlands “have proven themselves in battle.” She said: Ukraine is full of praise of the system and has expressed a desire for more howitzers. In order to further support Ukraine in its brave fight against the brutal Russian attack, Germany will grant this request.” Lambrecht said the Panzerhaubitze 2000 model howitzers recently underwent refurbishment. Ukraine has recaptured a village close to the eastern city of Lysychansk, in a small but symbolic victory that means Russia no longer has full control of the Luhansk region, one of Vladimir Putin’s key war aims. Luhansk’s governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukraine’s armed forces were in “complete control” of Bilohorivka. “It’s a suburb of Lysychansk. Soon we will drive these scumbags out of there with a broom,” he said, adding: “Step by step, centimetre by centimetre, we will liberate our entire land from the invaders.” Video footage shared on Telegram showed Ukrainian soldiers patrolling on foot down a ruined street. Russian forces have occupied all of Luhansk province for the past two-and-a-half months. After a long and grinding battle Ukraine’s general staff decided to retreat in July from the cities of Sievierdonetsk and Lysychansk. Over the past 12 days Ukrainian regiments in the north-east have mounted a stunning counteroffensive, liberating more than 300 settlements across the Kharkiv region, and forcing Russian units to flee in disarray. The reclaimed area is half the size of Wales, and goes right up to the Russian border. There were unconfirmed reports on Monday of Ukrainian troops advancing into Lysychansk. There now seems little prospect that the Kremlin will be able to take control of the whole of the Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. In March, Putin said this was the goal of his “special military operation” in Ukraine, after his failed attempt to seize the capital Kyiv. Over the weekend Russian troops shelled the city of Kupiansk from new, hastily constructed defensive positions just east of the Oskil River. Hundreds of people were evacuated. Ukraine said it took control of all of the city on Friday, crossing in amphibious vehicles over a pontoon bridge to the river’s left bank. Ukrainian officials say 200 Russian soldiers died in a strike on Sunday when a missile hit a former bus shelter where they were based, in the frontline city of Svatove. According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia has failed to send reinforcements. It is now under pressure and vulnerable to a further counter-offensive, the thinktank said. Governor Haidai said the leaders of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic were beginning to panic. There have been numerous reports of snatch squads detaining men on the street and drafting them into the army. Mobile communications and the internet have been jammed, to prevent people learning about Moscow’s military setbacks, he claimed. On Monday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of reckless behaviour after a shell landed 300 metres from a nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region. The missile damaged buildings and blew out windows. Three power lines were temporarily knocked out at the Pivdennoukrainsk facility. You can read the full report here. More on the mass grave in Izium. Reuters reports that Ukrainian forensic experts have so far exhumed 146 bodies, mostly civilians at the mass burial site in eastern Ukraine, the regional governor said on Monday. Oleh Synehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said the exhumed bodies included two children. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said around 450 bodies are believed to have been buried at the site in a forest on the outskirts of Izium, which was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces during a counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region. A hearing in Moscow to decide on the future of the Jewish Agency’s activities in Russia has been postponed for four weeks after lawyers for the charity, which facilitates immigration of Jewish people to Israel, asked for time to submit amendments to the agency’s scope of operations. Russia’s justice ministry first recommended in June that the Jewish Agency - a quasi-governmental body - be shut down for violating Russian privacy laws. A hearing in August was delayed by the Basmanny city court to 19 September, and delayed again today for another four weeks. Israel has been caught in a delicate balancing act since Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February: the country relies on Moscow to facilitate its military operations next-door in Syria, but has also faced pressure from its western allies to impose sanctions and forceful diplomatic action. Israel’s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, has warned that closing the Jewish Agency’s offices would be a severe blow to bilateral relations. About 24,000 Russians have arrived in Israel since the start of the war, and another 35,000 are waiting for paperwork to be processed, according to the Jewish Agency. Around 165,000 people with Jewish heritage were estimated to live in Russia at the beginning of 2022. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may cause long-term grain prices to rise by 7% and how expanded production elsewhere would lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions. Russia and Ukraine together export about 28% of the world’s wheat supply. Researchers in the United States and Uruguay modelled the likely impact of the conflict on wheat and maize prices over the coming 12 months, looking at a variety of scenarios for the study published in Nature Food. One model found that if Russian grain exports were halved and Ukrainian exports significantly reduced during that time, maize would be 4.6% more expensive and wheat 7.2% more expensive - even assuming that other exporters could step in and plug the gap. The researchers said the price increase would persist as long as exports remained restricted, Agence France-Press reports. To close the supply shortfall, the study found that other major producers would need to expand their grain-growing areas significantly. Were all grain exports from Ukraine to cease, Australia would need to expand its wheat area by 1%, China by 1.5%, the European Union by 1.9% and India by 1.2%, according to the model. This land-use change would lead to just over a billion tonnes of additional carbon dioxide equivalent added to the atmosphere, the study said. Lead author Jerome Dumortier, a researcher at the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs in Indianapolis in the US, said: The cropland expansion resulting from the war in Ukraine is occurring at the expense of more carbon emissions,” said United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned in July that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had combined with the lingering trade impacts of Covid-19 to create an “unprecedented global hunger crisis”. Figures from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization show food prices are currently more than 10% higher than they were a year ago. Although Moscow and Kyiv reached an agreement in July to resume some grain exports, there are fears that the conflict could lead to years of elevated food prices. Dumortier said that it was not currently clear whether other grain producers were able to meet global demand, meaning prices could rise even further than predicted in the models. “There are drought conditions in South America, Europe, and China, and export restrictions from various countries,” he told AFP. “Given those hindrances to full adjustment, commodity prices may be higher than what is estimated in the paper.” Ukraine’s first lady said it was a “great honour” to be present at the Queen’s state funeral, “on behalf of all Ukrainians”. Olena Zelenska, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s wife, was among hundreds of heads of state and dignitaries from around the world gathered in Westminster Abbey for the service on Monday. She represented her nation at the ceremony on behalf of her husband, as he continues to organise the fightback against Russian invaders, PA News reports. Zelenska said the Queen’s attention to Ukraine “was an important signal of support”. She wrote on Twitter: She wished us better times and shared our desire for freedom. We will always remember it with deep gratitude.” On Sunday, Zelenska visited Westminster Hall for the Queen’s lying in state to pay her respects to the Queen. She was pictured bowing her head as she stood alongside Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal and Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK Vadym Prystaiko. Earlier she met the Princess of Wales at Buckingham Palace. Zelenska travelled to the UK after her husband last week signed a book of condolence for the Queen. The UK’s ambassador in Kyiv, Melinda Simmons, said she was “deeply honoured” by the president’s gesture. She added: Grateful to the president for taking the time to do this given all else that is happening in (Ukraine) at this time.” Ukrainian troops have been taking part in a major counter-offensive against Russia’s forces. Zelenskiy appeared to be a fan of the Queen, having been given a biography of the Queen by Boris Johnson during the then-prime minister’s visit to Kyiv in June. Russia’s foreign ministry has summoned the Canadian ambassador and issued a protest over attacks on the Russian embassy in Ottawa, it said on Monday. Reuters reports that the ministry said an unknown person threw a Molotov cocktail on to the grounds of the Russian embassy in Ottawa. The ministry also said “aggressive” demonstrators had blocked an entrance to the consular section of the embassy. Here is a summary of events so far: The Kremlin has said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian has revealed. The US president, Joe Biden, has warned Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the small group of countries excluded from the Queen’s funeral in London today including Belarus, Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia’s president Vladimir Putin is “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia’s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let-up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. A selection of recent pictures from the agencies My colleagues Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report on the Ukrainian recapture of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region, with liberated Ukrainians telling of life under occupation. Until last week, a portrait of Vladimir Putin hung on the wall of the mayor’s office in the town of Shevchenkove, Kharkiv region. There was a Russian flag. Around a cabinet table, a pro-Kremlin “leader”, Andrey Strezhko, held meetings with colleagues. There was a lot to discuss. One topic: a referendum on joining Russia. Another: a new autumn curriculum for Shevchenkove’s two schools, minus anything Ukrainian. Strezhko’s ambitious plans were never realised. On 8 September, Ukraine’s armed forces launched a surprise counteroffensive. They swiftly recaptured a swathe of territory in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, including Shevchenkove. Most residents greeted the soldiers with hugs and kisses. Strezhko disappeared. He is believed to have fled across the Russian border, along with other collaborators. Shevchenkove’s acting military administrator, Andrii Konashavych, pointed to the chair where the pseudo-mayor had sat in the council building. On the wall was a portrait of Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine’s national poet who gives his name to the town. What happened to the Putin photo? “We tore it up,” Konashavych said. Why was there no picture of President Zelenskiy? “Presidents come and go. Shevchenko is eternal,” he replied. Read the full report here. The Kremlin said beefing up ties with Beijing is a top policy goal, a Russian security official said on Monday during a visit to China. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the national security council chaired by Russian president Vladimir Putin, described the “strengthening of comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation with Beijing as an unconditional priority of Russia’s foreign policy.” During a meeting with Guo Shengkun, a top official of China’s Communist party, Patrushev said: In the current conditions, our countries must show even greater readiness for mutual support and development of cooperation.” After the talks in the Chinese city of Nanping, Patrushev’s office said in a statement that the parties agreed to: …expand information exchanges on countering extremism and foreign attempts to undermine the constitutional order of both countries in order to derail independent policies of Russia and China serving their national interests.” The Chinese and Russian officials also emphasized a need to expand cooperation on cybersecurity and bolster contacts between their law enforcement agencies on fighting terrorism. The statement didn’t offer any further details of prospective cooperation. Putin met with Chinese president Xi Jinping last week in Uzbekistan, their first encounter since the Russian leader invaded Ukraine in February. A Chinese government statement issued after the meeting said Xi promised “strong support” for Russia’s “core interests.” Germany’s Die Linke could split into two parties over the Ukraine war, as the ailing leftwing outfit’s indecisive stance over economic sanctions against Russia triggered a series of high-profile resignations this week. The German Left party’s future has hung in a precarious balance since it snuck into the national parliament last autumn under a special provision for parties that win three or more constituency seats. Should three of its 39 delegates resign from the party, Die Linke would lose its status as a parliamentary group and attached privileges over speaking times and committee memberships. Party insiders say such resignations are a matter of when, not if, after a week of vicious public in-fighting over a speech in which the former co-leader Sahra Wagenknecht accused the German government of “launching an unprecedented economic war against our most important energy supplier”. Read the full report here. The Associated Press has a preview of this week’s meeting of the UN general assembly: Facing a complex set of challenges that try humanity as never before, world leaders convene at the United Nations this week under the shadow of Europe’s first major war since World War II — a conflict that has unleashed a global food crisis and divided major powers in a way not seen since the Cold War. The many facets of the Ukraine war are expected to dominate the annual meeting, which convenes as many countries and peoples confront growing inequality, an escalating climate crisis, the threat of multiple famines and an internet-fuelled tide of misinformation and hate speech — all atop a coronavirus pandemic that is halfway through its third year. For the first time since the United Nations was founded atop the ashes of World War II, European nations are witnessing war in their midst waged by nuclear-armed neighbouring Russia. Its invasion not only threatens Ukraine‘s survival as an independent democratic nation but has leaders in many countries worrying about trying to preserve regional and international peace and prevent a wider war. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said the strategic divides — with the west on one side and Russia and increasingly China on the other — are “paralysing the global response to the dramatic challenges we face”. He pointed not only to the devastation in Ukraine from nearly seven months of fighting but to the war’s impact on the global economy. Escalating food and energy prices are hitting the world’s poorest people hardest, and nations are “being devoured by the acids of nationalism and self-interest” instead of working together and resolving disputes peacefully, two principles that lie at the heart of the UN charter and underpin everything the United Nations tries to do. German chancellor Olaf Scholz will visit Saudi Arabia and meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as part of a Gulf trip, his spokesman said on Monday, as Germany rushes to secure energy supplies. Scholz, whose two-day trip will also take him to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, will become the latest Western leader to meet with the crown prince. Bin Salman has been regarded as a pariah in the West due to his suspected role in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. But he is being courted again as Europe and its allies urgently seek fresh sources of fossil fuels after Russia cut gas supplies amid soaring tensions over its invasion of Ukraine. Agence France-Press reports: Scholz, accompanied by a business delegation, will visit Saudi Arabia on Saturday, where he will meet with the crown prince and - if his health permits it - King Salman, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said. He did not go into detail about the reasons for Scholz’s Gulf visit but said he would be “very surprised” if the topic of energy was not discussed. The spokesman also offered assurances that “the murder of Mr Khashoggi will certainly figure in discussions”. It is the latest sign of bin Salman’s international rehabilitation - in July, French President Emmanuel Macron held talks with him in Paris, and US President Joe Biden visited the kingdom. On Sunday, Scholz will head to the UAE and meet with President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and in the afternoon will hold talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani. German economy minister Robert Habeck already visited Qatar and the UAE in March in an effort to find alternatives to Russian gas, which Germany has traditionally depended on heavily. Russia’s decision to cut off supplies has triggered an energy crisis in Europe, with consumers and businesses facing soaring bills as winter approaches. Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have sentenced an employee of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) - the world’s largest regional security organisation - to 13 years in jail on treason charges, Russian news agencies reported Monday. “A panel of judges found Dmitry Pavlovich Shabanov guilty … and sentenced him to 13 years in prison,” the RIA Novosti news agency reported, quoting the supreme court of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic (LNR). Shabanov, who was detained in April, is accused of passing confidential information to foreign intelligence services, Agence France-Presse reports. According to separatist authorities, Shabanov was recruited in 2016 by a former officer of Ukraine’s SBU security service and an agent in Ukraine of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Between August 2021 and April 2022, he collected “information on the movements of military equipment as well as units of the Lugansk People’s Army” and “sent them to the CIA agent”, the separatists said. The OSCE has “unequivocally” condemned the charges against Shabanov and Mikhail Petrov, another OSCE staffer detailed in April, describing the allegations as “totally unacceptable so-called ‘legal proceedings’”. The OSCE mission, which has been deployed in the conflict zone since 2014, left the separatist regions of Donetsk and Lugansk in the wake of Russia’s offensive in Ukraine earlier this year. Here is what we know so far regarding the more than 440 graves that have been uncovered in a forest near Izium in eastern Ukraine. According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), some of the bodies recovered had their hands tied. Others showed signs of having suffered violence. Last week, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, announced the discovery of a mass grave in Izium after it was recaptured from the Russians. At one burial site, more than 440 graves dating between March and September 2022 were discovered. Investigators have exhumed the bodies of at least 17 Ukrainian soldiers from one site. A cross over the grave bore the inscription: “Ukrainian army, 17 people. Izium morgue.” The authorities say there are more than 440 tombs because the last number entered on the crosses is 445. Some of the crosses are made from varnished wood and also carry names and dates. Investigators say about 100 bodies have been exhumed. Ukrainian officials suspect that some of the dead were tortured by Russian forces during their occupation of the north-east Kharkiv region. At least two of the bodies recovered were found with their hands tied, AFP journalists said. One of the two “had their hands tied, their jaw broken and two stab wounds in the back”, a member of the Kharkiv prosecutor’s office told AFP on condition of anonymity. The remains have been identified as that of a pro-Ukrainian volunteer fighter, the official added. Civilians who died during fighting in March for control of the city have also been exhumed. Around 10 teams – each of around four people, including representatives of the prosecutor’s office – have been at work investigating following the discovery of the graves. Emergency service workers in white overalls were handling the exhumations. Kharkiv prosecutor Yevgen Sokolov, who is leading the investigation, said he did not have an exact number for those thought to have suffered violent deaths. Of the bodies so far exhumed, he said “most have wounds from shelling and explosions”. Others had suffered “injuries from sharp objects and showed signs of violent death”, he said. Sokolov said one combatant had had “his hands tied behind his back” and another was found with “rope around the neck and broken limbs”. He also said a body was exhumed “with multiple stab wounds”. “At this point, we don’t have bodies with bullets in their skulls but there is still a lot of work to be done,” he said. If the weather remained mild, he estimated it would take another week to finish exhuming the bodies. Europe’s imports of thermal coal in 2022 could be the highest in at least four years and may rise further next year, analysts said on Monday, highlighting the extent of the energy crisis following sanctions on Russia, Reuters reports. European imports of thermal coal this year could rise to about 100m tonnes, the most since 2017, according to Noble Resources International Pte Ltd, while commodities pricing agency Argus expects shipments to reach a four-year high. “Europe is going back in time,” Rodrigo Echeverri, head of research at Noble, told a conference. European governments have outlined new measures on how they will cope with potential energy shortages this winter, with Russian gas flows still running at severely reduced rates amid the Ukraine war. Reuters reports that Spain has drawn up plans that could force energy-intensive industries to shut at peak demand times. France said it was preparing to send gas to Germany from October, while Berlin said Europe’s powerhouse was still in talks on state aid for ailing utility Uniper. Russia, which had supplied about 40% of the European Union’s gas before its February invasion of Ukraine, has said it closed the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – once one of Europe’s major gas supply routes – because western sanctions hindered operations. European gas prices have more than doubled from the start of the year amid a decline in Russian supplies. The sharp drop in Russian fuel exports has left governments scrambling to find energy resources, but also to warn that power cuts could happen, amid fears of recession. In France, exports of natural gas to Germany could start around 10 October, the head of France’s CRE energy regulator said, following an announcement by president Emmanuel Macron that the two EU neighbours would help each other with electricity and gas flows amid the crisis. CRE chief Emmanuelle Wargon told FranceInfo radio: Gas was (until now) only flowing from Germany to France, so we did not have the technical tools to reverse the flows and we did not even have a method to regulate prices.” Wargon added that “exceptional” measures this winter could include localised electricity cuts if the winter is cold and EDF’s plans to repair corrosion-hit nuclear reactors are delayed. “But there will be no gas cuts for households. Never,” she said. Spanish industry minister Reyes Maroto said that obliging energy-intensive companies to close down during consumption peaks is an option on the table this winter if required. The companies would be compensated financially, she said adding there is no need to impose such closures now. And Finns were warned they should be prepared for power outages. National grid operator Fingrid said: As a result of great uncertainties, Finns should be prepared for power outages caused by a possible power shortage in the coming winter.” Finnish power retailer Karhu Voima Oy said it had filed for bankruptcy due to a sharp rise in electricity price rises. German finance minister Christian Lindner said on Monday that he was still looking at ways to ensure gas prices remained affordable for people while awaiting recommendations from a group of experts. When asked about a possible cap on gas prices Lindner said: We have developed this commission, but proposals within the federal government are also being considered further, so it has not been completely outsourced.” The German central bank said on Monday it was increasingly likely that Europe’s largest economy would shrink for a “prolonged” period as Russia throttled energy supplies to the continent. In its monthly report, the Bundesbank said: The signs of a recession for the German economy are multiplying.” It also warned of a “broad-based and prolonged decline in economic output”. The likely slump was above all down to “supply-side constraints”, namely reduced deliveries of energy in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. Moscow has drastically reduced it supplies of gas to Europe and kept the Nord Stream pipeline shut since the end of August, heaping pressure on Germany’s economy. Germany had been highly reliant on Russian energy imports with 55% of its gas coming from Russia before the outbreak of the war. The economy would likely shrink “slightly” in the third quarter of the year, the Bundesbank said, before a “marked” drop over the last three months of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. The Russian gas supply stop meant that the situation regarding gas markets was “very tense”, it said. Germany could “avoid formal rationing” of the fuel, but necessary reductions in consumption would lead companies to limit or pause production, the central bank predicted. Thirteen people were killed in artillery shelling on Monday in the east Ukrainian separatist-held city of Donetsk, the city’s Russian-backed mayor said. Reuters reports that in a statement posted on the Telegram messenger app, Donetsk’s separatist mayor Alexei Kulemzin said that 13 civilians including two children had been killed in the strike on Donetsk’s Kuybyshevsky district. He said that the number of wounded was being confirmed. Donetsk city has been controlled by the Russian-backed Donetsk People’s Republic since 2014. The Ukrainian army continues to hold positions on Donetsk’s outskirts, and the city has come under artillery fire repeatedly in recent months. The Guardian is unable to verify battlefield reports. The Kremlin has rejected allegations that Russian forces had committed war crimes in Ukraine’s Kharkiv province as a “lie”. About 450 bodies, most of which Ukraine says are those of civilians, have been found in mass graves near Izium after Russian troops were this month forced out of the Kharkiv region, much of which they had controlled since the first weeks of their military campaign in Ukraine. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said investigators at the site had found evidence of torture, including bodies with hands tied, and accused Russian troops of committing war crimes. Asked on Monday about Zelenskiy’s statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: “It’s the same scenario as in Bucha. It’s a lie, and of course we will defend the truth in this story.” Russia previously rejected claims that its troops had committed war crimes in Bucha, outside Kyiv, after evidence of civilians being killed while the town was controlled by Russian troops came to light after Russia’s withdrawal at the end of March. (Via Reuters) Last week, Zelenskiy accused Russia of “leaving death everywhere” after the discovery of the Izium site. Men in white overalls began digging out bodies last Friday as part of a mass exhumation at the site, reporters with the Reuters news agency said, and 20 white bodybags could be seen. Reuters reported that several bodies had rope tied around their necks and hands. Ukraine’s atomic energy operator, Energoatom, has described the Russian missile strike on the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant – see earlier post here – as an act of “nuclear terrorism”. (Via AP) Russia is urging Uefa to ban the manager of the Ukraine men’s national team after he expressed a wish to fight Vladimir Putin’s invading forces, the Guardian can reveal. The Football Union of Russia has written to the governing body accusing Oleksandr Petrakov of discriminating against Russians and failing to remain politically neutral. Denis Rogachev, the deputy secretary general of the FUR, cited comments carried in two newspapers – Italy’s Corriere dello Sport and Russia’s Sport Express – as evidence of Petrakov’s guilt. In a letter to Uefa’s control, ethics and disciplinary body, Petrakov is accused of breaching codes of conduct by calling for Russians to be banned from international sport and talking about his hopes of joining the armed forces. Full story here. The US president, Joe Biden, used an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes programme on Sunday night to warn Vladimir Putin that the use of nuclear or other non-conventional weapons against Ukraine would prompt a “consequential” response from the US. When asked what he would tell Putin if the Russian leader was mulling such a move, he said: “Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.” Biden praised the Ukrainians for their gritty fight against the Russian invasion and said: “They’re defeating Russia”. Asked how to define victory for Kyiv, he said: “Winning the war in Ukraine is to get Russia out of Ukraine completely.” But given the scale of human suffering and destruction inflicted in resisting the Russian onslaught, “it’s awful hard to count that as winning”, he added. Reuters has more information on the Russian strike on the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in the early hours of Monday: Russian troops struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in Ukraine’s southern Mykolaiv region early on Monday but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said. A blast took place 300 metres away from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings shortly after midnight, Energoatom said in a statement. The attack has also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Energoatom said: Currently, all three power units of the PNPP (Pivdennoukrainsk Nuclear Power Plant) are operating normally. Fortunately, there were no casualties among the station staff It published two photographs showing a crater it said was caused by the blast. In one of the pictures a man stood in the crater to give a sense of its size. Commenting on the strike on the Telegram messaging app, Ukraine‘s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said: The invaders wanted to shoot again, but they forgot what a nuclear power plant is. Russia endangers the whole world. We have to stop it before it’s too late. There was no immediate Russian reaction to Ukraine’s accusations. The Mykolaiv region has been under constant rocket attack by Russian forces in recent weeks. Another Ukrainian nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia - which is Europe’s largest and lies about 250km (155 miles) east of the Mykolaiv site - was shut down earlier this month due to Russian shelling, prompting concerns about a possible nuclear disaster. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is held by Russian forces but operated by Ukrainian staff. The shelling has damaged buildings and disrupted power lines. The UN nuclear watchdog said this weekend one of the four main power lines at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility had been repaired and was once again supplying the plant with electricity from the Ukrainian grid. Russian troops have struck the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant in the southern Mykolaiv region, but its reactors have not been damaged and are working normally, Reuters reports. According to Ukraine’s state nuclear company, Energoatom, a blast early on Monday took place 300 metres from the reactors and damaged power plant buildings. The attack has also damaged a nearby hydroelectric power plant and transmission lines. Russia is highly likely to have lost at least four combat jets in Ukraine within the last 10 days, taking its attrition to about 55 since the beginning of its invasion, the British military said on Monday. There is a realistic possibility that the increase in losses was partially a result of the Russian air force accepting greater risk in a move to provide close air support to Russian ground forces under pressure from Ukrainian advances, the defence ministry said in its daily intelligence on Twitter. Russian pilots’ situational awareness is often poor, it said. “There is a realistic possibility that some aircraft have strayed over enemy territory and into denser air defence zones as the frontlines have moved rapidly.” (Via Reuters) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the small group of countries excluded from the Queen’s funeral in London today, as AFP reports: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin – under a travel ban to the UK due to sanctions – had already said he would not attend. But not inviting any Russian representative to the Queen’s funeral was “particularly blasphemous towards Elizabeth II’s memory” and “deeply immoral”, the foreign ministry spokeswoman in Moscow said on Thursday. Russia and Belarus have embassies in London and their presidents sent King Charles III messages of condolences. Other countries with no invitations are Myanmar, Syria, Venezuela and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Good morning. This is Sam Jones taking over now from my colleague Virginia. Ukrainians flee shelling of Kupiansk as Russian forces try to slow advances On Sunday, Ukrainian civilians were fleeing heavy fighting as Russia’s armed forces tried to hold off a further dramatic advance by Ukrainian troops in the north-east of the country. As Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw report, cars packed with families streamed out of the city of Kupiansk, which Ukraine recaptured just over a week ago as part of a stunning counter-offensive. Kupiansk, a strategic railway junction, sits on either side of the river. It is on the new frontline after Ukrainian forces on Friday crossed to the right bank. They are now poised to push further into Luhansk province, which the Kremlin and its local proxies have controlled entirely since June, and partly since 2014. Here’s the full story. Russian pop star speaks out against war in Ukraine The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in Russia, has publicly criticised the conflict. Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.” Read more here. Milley: “Not going too well for Russia” The top US general on Sunday said it was still unclear how Russia might react to the latest battlefield setbacks in Ukraine and called for vigilance among US troops as he visited a base in Poland aiding Ukraine’s war effort, Reuters reported. “The war is not going too well for Russia right now. So it’s incumbent upon all of us to maintain high states of readiness, alert,” US Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Warsaw. Milley said he was not suggesting US troops in Europe were at any increased threat, but said they had to be ready. “In the conduct of war, you just don’t know with a high degree of certainty what will happen next.” Some recent images from Kharkiv, Ukraine. Russian attacks in east and south repelled, says Ukraine military Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the areas of the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in south where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east, Reuters reports. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. “From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram. Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the neighbouring Luhansk region, said this meant the “de-occupation” of his region was “not far away”. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) says Russia president Vladimir Putin is “increasingly relying on irregular volunteer and proxy forces rather than conventional units,” in its latest update on the Russian campaign. “Putin’s souring relationship with the military command and the Russian (MoD) may explain in part the Kremlin’s increasing focus on recruiting ill-prepared volunteers into ad-hoc irregular units rather than attempting to draw them into reserve or replacement pools for regular Russian combat units,” the ISW said. Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Virginia Harrison and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. It’s just after 8am in Kyiv and these are the main developments: The Ukrainian military said on Sunday that its forces repelled attacks by Russian troops in the Kharkiv region in the east and Kherson in the south, where Ukraine launched counteroffensives this month, as well as in parts of Donetsk in the south-east. It said Ukrainian troops had advanced to the eastern bank of the Oskil River in Kharkiv region. “From yesterday, Ukraine controls the east bank,” it said on Telegram. Five civilians were killed in Russian attacks in the eastern Donetsk region over the past day while in Nikopol, further west, several dozen residential buildings, gas pipelines and power lines were hit, regional governors said on Sunday. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, vowed there would be no let up in fighting to regain territory lost to Russia. “Perhaps it seems to some of you that after a series of victories we now have a lull of sorts,” he said in his nightly address on Sunday. “But there will be no lull. There is preparation for the next series ... For Ukraine must be free. All of it.” In an intelligence update, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure, including a power grid and a dam, had intensified. “As it faces setbacks on the front lines, Russia has likely extended the locations it is prepared to strike in an attempt to directly undermine the morale of the Ukrainian people and government,” it said on Sunday. Ukrainian forces are refusing to discard worn-out US-provided arms, with many reverse-engineering spare parts to continue the counteroffensive against Russia’s invasion. “They’re not willing to scrap it,” one soldier said, recalling artillery with shrapnel damage and sometimes completely worn out from firing round after round against Russian troops. The Ukrainian military said Russia has deployed Iranian attack drones, the New York Times reported on Sunday. According to a Ukrainian military official who spoke to the New York Times, remnants of the Shahed-136 attack drones have been discovered on the ground during the counteroffensive that Ukraine launched in the north-eastern regions of the country this month. The Ukrainian military has carried out 20 airstrikes in the past 24 hours against Russian strongholds, according to the general staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The Kyiv Independent reported on Sunday that Ukraine’s Air Force had successfully targeted 15 Russian strongholds and four sites, as well as seven control points. The Russian singer Alla Pugacheva has spoken out against the war in Ukraine and the “death of our boys for illusory goals”. The remarks are the first time that the pop star, an icon in Russia, has publicly criticised the conflict. Addressing the Russian justice ministry, Pugacheva told her 3.4 million Instagram followers: “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country.” The Georgian president, Salome Zourabichvili, levelled heavy criticism against Russia on Sunday after the discovery of mass graves in Izium last week. Zourabichvili condemned “in the strongest terms the atrocities committed by Russia in Izium”, adding that “these war crimes must be answered by justice”, the Kyiv Independent reported. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Sunday that the mass graves discovered in Izium were evidence of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine. “Obviously the UK and Canada have been two of the strongest countries in standing up in support of Ukraine and pushing back against Russia’s illegal actions,” Trudeau told reporters in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T04:32:55Z","webTitle":"Japan eyes return to nuclear power more than a decade after Fukushima disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/japan-eyes-return-to-nuclear-power-more-than-a-decade-after-fukushima-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Japan eyes return to nuclear power more than a decade after Fukushima disaster","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Japan is considering building next-generation nuclear reactors and restarting idled plants in a major policy shift, 11 years after the triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant rocked the country’s dependence on atomic energy. The prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said he had directed a government panel to look into how “next-generation nuclear reactors equipped with new safety mechanisms” could be used to help Japan achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. His “green transformation” council is expected to report back by the end of the year, he said on Wednesday. The change of direction, which could include extending the lifespan of existing reactors, have highlighted Japan’s struggle to secure a stable energy supply as a result of the war in Ukraine and soaring energy costs. Successive governments have been forced to lower Japan’s dependence on nuclear since the March 2011 disaster, when a powerful tsunami destroyed Fukushima Daiichi’s backup electricity supply, causing three of its six reactors to suffer meltdowns. Most of Japan’s nuclear plants have remained idle ever since, while the government said it would not build new reactors or replace ageing reactors, fearing a public backlash. If realised, Kishida’s plans would mark a dramatic reversal of that stance. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has vastly transformed the world’s energy landscape … Japan needs to bear in mind potential crisis scenarios,” he said at an energy policy meeting this week. “To overcome an imminent crisis caused of a power supply crunch, we must take the utmost steps to mobilise all possible policies in the coming years and prepare for any emergency.” The economy and industry minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said it was “extremely important to secure all options to redesign a stable energy supply for our country. From that perspective, we will also consider all options regarding nuclear power.” Kishida conceded that the government would have to win support from the public, which turned against nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima meltdown. Officials believe voters have become more receptive to nuclear power due to rising fuel costs and after an energy crunch in Tokyo during a recent heatwave. The country is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels. “It is the first step towards the normalisation of Japan’s energy policy,” said Jun Arima, a project professor at the Tokyo University’s graduate school of public policy. Seven reactors are currently in operation, with three others offline for regular safety inspections. Dozens of others are still going through a relicensing process under stricter safety standards introduced after the 2011 disaster, which some experts blamed on the “nuclear village” of operators, politicians and regulators. A bigger role for nuclear in Japan’s energy mix could see seven additional reactors being restarted after next summer, including two at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, the biggest nuclear plant in the world. Restarting the plant would be particularly controversial, since it is run by Tokyo Electric Power, the same company that operates Fukushima Daiichi. The 2011 disaster sent huge quantities of radiation into the atmosphere and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Some areas near the plant remain off-limits, while others have only recently reopened to residents. The government will also consider extending the lifespan of existing reactors beyond the legal limit by excluding the period they remained shut down – in some cases several years – when calculating their operating time. Plants can operate for up to 40 years in principle, but can continue generating electricity for another 20 years if they undergo safety upgrades and pass screenings conducted by regulators. Japan has set a target for nuclear power generation to account for 20-22% of its electricity supply in 2030. Before the Fukushima meltdowns, about a third of its power generation came from nuclear, but in 2020 the figure was less than 5%.

Two separate legal challenges are being lodged on Tuesday at the European Union’s general court in Luxembourg – one by Greenpeace and another by a coalition including Client Earth and WWF – after the classification of fuels in the so-called taxonomy, a guide for investors intended to channel billions into green technologies. The EU executive, argues Greenpeace, acted unlawfully when it designated gas and nuclear as bridge technologies in the taxonomy, which is intended to help meet the bloc’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Client Earth, along with three other NGOs, is challenging the inclusion of gas, which it says breaks the EU climate law that sets a legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by the middle of the century. The cases are the latest legal action against the EU’s “taxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities”. Last year a lawsuit was launched by Austria and supported by Luxembourg. Eight national and regional Greenpeace organisations including France, Germany and EU office in Brussels are asking the court to rule the inclusion of gas and nuclear invalid. Nina Treu, the executive director of Greenpeace Germany, said: “The taxonomy was meant to be a tool to meet the 1.5C target [on global heating] and make the European Union climate neutral, fostering social and economic restructuring for the European economy by shifting funds. Instead of hindering greenwashing, it has become a tool for greenwashing.” Gas and nuclear had been included because of “politically motivated lobbying”, Treu said. Greenpeace will tell the court that gas cannot be considered a “transition fuel” because any gas-powered plant that comes online today will still be running beyond 2050. The environment group will also say the construction of new nuclear plants – which usually take one to two decades to build in Europe – will delay the move away from coal power, hinder development of renewables, risk accidents and create pollution. “Nuclear is dangerous, expensive, vulnerable to climate change and too slow to stop the climate breakdown,” Treu said. Greenpeace has hired the lawyer Roda Verheyen, who acted for the group in a landmark case that resulted in Germany’s climate protection laws being ruled inadequate by the country’s constitutional court in 2021. Verheyen said the inclusion of gas and nuclear was not in line with the EU’s original taxonomy law. “The European Commission has violated the very idea of the taxonomy regulation. This is especially obvious as including nuclear activities does pose significant harm to the environment, which is expressly prohibited by the regulation.” The lawsuit was “essentially an enforcement claim”, she said. “Observe your own law. Actually carry through with the European green deal,” she said, referring to the EU’s flagship climate plan. The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts – secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight. The campaign groups are challenging one of the delegated acts. The separate legal challenge by the coalition including Client Earth and WWF covers the inclusion of gas but not nuclear. Anaïs Berthier at Client Earth said the European Commission had violated a requirement to make science-based policy and broken the EU climate law that required policymakers to carry out checks to ensure all actions by the bloc were consistent with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050. “Labelling fossil gas as ‘sustainable’ is as absurd as it is unlawful,” said the coalition, which also includes the NGOs Transport &amp; Environment and Bund. “It goes against the EU’s own scientific advice and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the EU’s climate action. Fossil gas is not clean, not cheap and not a secure source of energy.” A judgment is expected in 2025, although participants expressed the hope the court would act faster. “There is confusion in the market, because the current law infringes European law,” Verheyen said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/feb/04/us-hails-progress-in-getting-australia-nuclear-powered-submarines-at-the-earliest-possible-date","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-04T07:50:01Z","webTitle":"US hails progress in getting Australia nuclear-powered submarines ‘at the earliest possible date’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/04/us-hails-progress-in-getting-australia-nuclear-powered-submarines-at-the-earliest-possible-date","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/feb/04/us-hails-progress-in-getting-australia-nuclear-powered-submarines-at-the-earliest-possible-date","fields":{"headline":"US hails progress in getting Australia nuclear-powered submarines ‘at the earliest possible date’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia and the US have made “significant progress” towards getting Australia a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines “at the earliest possible date”, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said on Saturday. The federal government is set to announce its Aukus submarine plans by the end of March, amid mounting concerns that the US could struggle to provide them, and a push for President Joe Biden to fast-track research into submarines that use non-weapons grade uranium. Austin met the defence minister, Richard Marles, in Washington on Saturday (Australian time) to discuss the Aukus pact between Australia, the US and the UK, as well as regional security and other issues. They also talked about the upcoming public release of the defence strategic review during a bilateral meeting at the Pentagon. Austin said that, at a December meeting last year, he and Marles had agreed to deeper defence cooperation, to strengthening coordination on regional priorities, and to increasing climate change resilience. “We also pledged to find new ways to work closely with Japan, as we pursue a common vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific, as a region where all countries can chart their own course and all states respect international rules and norms and where all disputes are resolved peacefully,” Austin said. “All of this is yet another reminder that our unbreakable alliance is capable of great things. It has, indeed, endured for generations, and it remains vital to regional peace and security.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Before the meeting, he said the discussion would help the nations “make further progress in our alliances and trilateral reach with Aukus”. “We’ve already made significant progress on developing the optimal pathway for Australia to acquire a conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarine capability at the earliest possible date,” he said. Marles called it an “excellent meeting”. He also conceded building up the nuclear workforce was “one of the real challenges we face”, according to the Nine newspapers. Another challenge was America’s bureaucracy around exports, which could delay the transfer of technology. The US and UK would benefit from the Aukus deal as well as Australia, he said, calling it a “three-way ecosystem”. The meeting took place just before a second Chinese spy balloon was spotted. The Pentagon tracked the first as it flew over the US mainland, then confirmed a second one had been seen over Latin America. US officials made it clear they did not believe China’s claim it was a weather balloon that had blown off course, and there was immediate diplomatic fallout, with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, delaying an imminent trip to China. Marles said China had questions to answer over the intrusion. According to the Australian Financial Review, Marles said he did not know more about the balloon than what was already public, and that he was unaware of anything similar ever flying over Australia. “There are a lot of questions associated with it, which I think everyone has. We all want the answers to those questions from China,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-condemns-energy-terror-at-un-meeting-after-10-die-in-latest-mass-strikes","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-24T18:47:13Z","webTitle":"Russian strikes risked ‘nuclear catastrophe’, says Ukraine energy chief; Moscow says 50 PoWs freed – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-condemns-energy-terror-at-un-meeting-after-10-die-in-latest-mass-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/24/russia-ukraine-war-live-zelenskiy-condemns-energy-terror-at-un-meeting-after-10-die-in-latest-mass-strikes","fields":{"headline":"Russian strikes risked ‘nuclear catastrophe’, says Ukraine energy chief; Moscow says 50 PoWs freed – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here are all the key developments in the Ukraine war from today: In a interview with the Financial Times, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict as a “war of strength and resilience” and pushing back against western fears of escalation. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official at the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) said. European Union governments remained split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with further talks expected on Friday. Six of the EU’s 27 countries are said to be opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7, which will come into force on 5 December. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Hungary’s parliament will ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow confirmed Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. He said that similar to relations with Germany following the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief said. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Ukraine expects the three nuclear power plants will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. She said the EU would “hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine”. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyiv’s biggest outages in nine months of war. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014. Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. I’m closing the blog now for the day but it will reopen again tomorrow morning. Thanks again for following. The Financial Times has an interview with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he said Russia’s new strategy to destroy Ukraine’s infrastructure and plunge it into darkness would not weaken the country’s resolve to liberate all occupied land, describing the conflict as a “war of strength and resilience”. Pushing back against western fears of escalation, Ukraine’s president insisted there would be no lasting resolution to the war unless Russia withdrew from all the territories it was occupying. Moscow has stepped up a bombing campaign against Ukraine’s critical infrastructure since last month, hoping to force Kyiv to make concessions despite its advances on the battlefield. Zelenskyy said: We must return all lands . . . because I believe that the battlefield is the way when there is no diplomacy. If you can’t get your land back entirely, the war is simply frozen. It’s a question of time before it resumes. On Wednesday, Russia launched 70 missiles against infrastructure targets across Ukraine, leaving about 80 per cent of the country in the dark and without water. All 15 of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors were taken offline because electricity became unstable. Speaking in the presidential office, which was also out of water supply, Zelenskyy said: It was the kind of incident that hasn’t happened for I don’t know how many years, maybe 80, 90 years: a country on the European continent where there was totally no light. The state superbly fought back. Energy workers, the state emergencies’ ministry, deminers, everyone worked to fix and restore power and provide at least a bit of water. This is a war about strength, about resilience, it is about who stands stronger. Zelenskyy also appealed to Ukraine’s western partners to provide more air defence equipment to help protect critical infrastructure, as well as diesel supplies for emergency generators and additional gas to help offset power shortages. The president said the attacks targeting civilian infrastructure showed Moscow had no intention of negotiating an end to the war. Kyiv has been pushing back at perceived pressure to show its openness to an eventual negotiated solution to the war. Some western partners are concerned that any attempt by Ukraine to take back Crimea — annexed by Russia in 2014 and which it deems crucial for its security — could lead to a dangerous escalation by Moscow, possibly even the use of nuclear weapons. As Ukrainian forces have made advances against Russian troops in the south and east, Ukraine’s military aims have hardened: it is seeking the return of territory occupied since February and land occupied in the 2014 Russian assault. Zelenskyy acknowledged that the fate of Crimea was rising on the international agenda. I understand that everyone is confused by the situation and what will happen to Crimea. If someone is ready to offer us a way regarding the de-occupation of Crimea by non-military means, I will only be in favour. If the solution [does not involve] de-occupation and [Crimea] is part of the Russian Federation, no one should waste their time on this. It’s a waste of time. More than 15,000 people have gone missing during the war in Ukraine, an official at the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) has said. Reuters reports: The Hague-based organisation, created in the wake of the Balkan wars of the 1990s, opened an office in Kyiv in July to help Ukraine to document and track down missing people. The ICMP’s programme director for Europe, Matthew Holliday, said it was unclear how many people had been forcibly transferred, were being held in detention in Russia, were alive and separated from their family members, or had died and had been buried in makeshift graves. The process of investigating the missing in Ukraine will last years even after fighting stops, Holliday told Reuters in an interview. The 15,000 figure is conservative when considering that in the port city of Mariupol alone authorities estimate as many as 25,000 people are either dead or missing. He said: The numbers are huge and the challenges that Ukraine faces are vast. Besides which they’re fighting an ongoing war as well against the Russian Federation. What is key now is setting in place all the correct measures to ensure that as many persons can be identified. The vast majority of missing persons, those deceased, are victims of war crimes, and the perpetrators need to be held responsible. By storing DNA samples on a database and seeking matches with relatives, the ICMP accounted for more than 27,000 out of 40,000 persons reported missing during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. In Kyiv, the ICMP has started to collect DNA samples and is ramping up capacity for a multi-year process that will also help prosecutors build war crimes cases. The Guardian’s video team have published footage of medics at a hospital in the Ukrainian capital carrying out a cardiac operation on a child despite the city’s blackouts amid Russian missile strikes. According to Borys Todurov, the surgeon who filmed the operation, it was already under way when the electricity supply was suddenly cut. He said: This is how we perform heart surgery today. European Union governments remain split over what level to cap Russian oil prices at to curb Moscow’s ability to pay for its war in Ukraine without causing a global oil supply shock, with more talks possible on Friday if positions converge. Reuters reports: The EU states failed to reach a deal on the price level for Russian sea-borne oil on Wednesday because a Group of Seven nations (G7) proposal for a cap of $65-70 per barrel was seen as far to high by some and too low by others. The European Commission, the Czech EU presidency, the United States and G7 presidency Germany were all engaged in talks on Thursday to bridge differences and reach a deal before the price cap is due to come into force on 5 December. Diplomats said that six of the EU’s 27 countries opposed the price cap level proposed by the G7. Poland wants the cap to be set at $30, arguing that with Russian production costs that some estimate at $20 per barrel, the G7 proposal would allow Moscow too much profit. Lithuania and Estonia back Poland. Cyprus, Greece and Malta, countries with big shipping industries that stand to lose most if Russian oil cargoes are obstructed, argue the cap is too low and want compensation for the loss of business or more time to adjust. One EU diplomat said: There are a lot of bilateral talks going on now at very high levels. There will be a meeting of representatives of all EU countries once there is progress. There is no point in calling another meeting if there is no change. The first reactor of Ukraine’s Khmelnytskyi nuclear plant has been reconnected to the country’s power grid, regional governor Serhiy Hamaliy said. The Khmelnytskyi plant disconnected from Ukraine’s grid on Wednesday after Russian strikes on the country’s power system, Ukrainian officials said. Meanwhile, Russia’s Transneft said that pumping of oil through the Ukrainian section of the Druzhba pipeline had resumed at 6pm Moscow time, the TASS news agency reported, citing a company spokesperson. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has said that Hungary’s parliament will ratify Nato membership for Finland and Sweden early next year. Orban told a briefing after a meeting of the Visegrad Group in Slovakia that his government had already decided that Hungary would support Finland’s and Sweden’s Nato accession and that the country’s parliament would set this item on its agenda at its first session next year. Hungary and Turkey are the only members of the alliance who have not yet cleared the accession. US President Joe Biden has confirmed that a price cap on Russian oil being proposed by the United States and its western allies is “in play”, adding that he had spoken to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on the issue. He made his comments to reporters during a Thanksgiving holiday visit to a fire station on Nantucket Island. Reuters has the full detail on the prisoner of war swaps: Russia and Ukraine have carried out the latest in a series of prisoner of war exchanges, with both sides handing over 50 people, officials in Kyiv and Moscow have confirmed. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had released 50 Russian soldiers who had been captured. Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian presidential administration, said on Telegram that Ukraine received 48 soldiers and two officers, among them marines, infantrymen, border guards and members of the territorial defence. He said: We have managed to bring back 19 defenders of Mariupol ... as well as 15 prisoners (of war) from the Chornobyl nuclear power plant and seven from Zmiiny Island. Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-backed head of the part of Ukraine’s Donetsk region that is under Russian control, said earlier that a prisoner swap with Kyiv was taking place, involving 50 prisoners on each side. Kyiv and Moscow have so far swapped over 1,000 prisoners of war since the beginning of the conflict in Ukraine in February. The Ukraine Solidarity Project, a group of European and Ukrainian activists who target brands with ties to Russia, has unfurled a 400m2 banner outside energy drink company Red Bull’s headquarters in Salzburg depicting Vladimir Putin riding the company’s famous bull logo. The banner reads “Red Bull gives Putin wings” in reference to the company’s decision not to pull its products from Russian supermarkets. Red Bull was given a failing D grade by the Yale School of Management’s Russia business policy ranking for having postponed future planned investment and marketing while continuing “substantive business” in Russia. The Ukraine Solidarity Project said: It really matters that Red Bull is still on sale in Russia. It’s one of the world’s biggest brands and its decision to stick with Putin’s Russia is highly significant. Companies that sell their products there are paying taxes to the Kremlin and signalling that they’re comfortable with the illegal invasion of Ukraine. They need to pull out. As things stand, Red Bull gives Putin wings. Russia’s defence ministry has announced that Ukraine has released 50 Russian soldiers who had been captured, in the latest prisoner exchange between the two sides. Earlier today, the Russian-installed head of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said Russia would also release 50 captured Ukrainians. Romania is willing to continue supplying neighbouring Moldova with electricity as Russian shelling in Ukraine hits its energy supply, but insufficient interconnections are a challenge, Romanian president Klaus Iohannis has said. “Up until now we have delivered everything we were asked for,” Iohannis told reporters after meeting Lithuania’s president in Vilnius. “But outages happen because … Romanian-Moldovan interconnections are completely insufficient. Most of the power Romania is offering passes through Ukraine.” Romanian power producers started selling electricity to Moldova at a capped price in October, Reuters reported. Romania’s foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, said earlier this week the EU state was providing between 80% and 90% of Moldova’s electricity needs. Foreign ministers from the G7 will discuss how to further support Ukraine in ensuring its energy supply during a meeting in Bucharest next week, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said. “Russia’s attacks on civilian infrastructure are an intolerable, inhumane crime. Putin may plunge the people of Ukraine into cold and darkness with his missiles. He will never break their will for freedom and our support,” she added. A meeting of Nato foreign ministers is scheduled to take place in Bucharest on Tuesday and Wednesday, Reuters reported. A G7 foreign ministers meeting held in Germany earlier this month on Baerbock’s initiative focused on how to support Ukraine through the winter in the face of Russian attacks on its power grid. Ukrainian cities were plunged into darkness this week after a barrage of Russian missiles triggered one of the worst nationwide power outages of the war yet. Former German chancellor Angela Merkel said she had aimed to convene European talks with Vladimir Putin the year before his invasion of Ukraine but in the end did not see any possibility of influencing the Russian president at the end of her term. Merkel told the Spiegel news magazine in an interview published on Thursday that she and French president Emmanuel Macron had planned to hold an independent talk format with Putin within the European Council in 2021, her last summer in office. “But I no longer had the strength to push through because, after all, everyone knew: she’s leaving in autumn,” she said. Merkel, who retired from politics after 16 years in power following Germany’s September 2021 election, officially handed over the reins to Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats in December that year, Reuters reported. US president Joe Biden met the Russian leader in June 2021. Referring to her farewell visit to Moscow in August 2021, Merkel, who speaks fluent Russian, told Spiegel: The feeling was very clear: ‘In terms of power politics, you’re through.’ For Putin, only power counts. The leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic have publicly criticised Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, over the war in Ukraine. Reuters reports: Unity within the Visegrad Group, set up in 1991 as the region emerged from decades of communist rule, has been sorely tested by the war, with Orbán opposing harsher European sanctions on Russia including on energy supplies. By contrast, Hungary’s three Visegrad neighbours – which also include Slovakia – are among the EU’s toughest critics of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine. The Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, said as he headed for a meeting of Visegrad leaders in Slovakia on Thursday: This is not the best of times for the (Visegrad) format, and Hungary’s different attitudes are significantly influencing and complicating the situation. I make no secret of the fact that the views of the Hungarian prime minister, some of which can even be described as provocative, do not help this cooperation to proceed as well as in the past. This week Orbán further annoyed his neighbours by wearing a scarf to a soccer match that depicted some Ukrainian territory as part of Hungary, prompting Kyiv to summon the Hungarian ambassador to lodge a protest. Fiala said on Wednesday the “Greater Hungary” scarf – which also showed territory now in Austria, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Serbia as part of Hungary – would be discussed at Thursday’s summit gathering in the Slovak city of Kosice. Poland, an ally of Hungary in their past disputes with the EU over the rule of law and human rights, has also turned more critical of Orbán because of his stance on Ukraine. The Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, criticised Hungary’s failure so far to ratify Sweden and Finland’s application to join Nato. He said: I will tell (Orbán) directly that for Poland this is one of the most important changes in international law, that is the accession of Finland and Sweden. We can’t allow the Visegrad Group to fall apart. It is a structure which protects the interests of our countries against other interest groups from western Europe. Russia risked causing a “nuclear and radioactive catastrophe” by launching attacks in which all Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from the power grid for the first time in 40 years, Ukraine’s nuclear energy chief has said. Reuters reports that Petro Kotin, head of nuclear power company Energoatom, said the vast nuclear power station in the Zaporizhzhia region of southern Ukraine, which has been out of commission since September, had also been disconnected from the grid on Wednesday and became reliant on backup diesel generators. He added that the Zaporizhzhia plant, which has been occupied by Russian forces since soon after Russia invaded Ukraine nine months ago, had been reconnected to the grid by Thursday morning and that the backup generators were turned off. He said in a written statement: There is a real danger of a nuclear and radiation catastrophe being caused by firing on the entire territory of Ukraine with Russian cruise and ballistic missiles, and a huge risk of damage to nuclear plants. Russia must answer for this shameful crime. Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday that three nuclear power plants on territory held by Ukrainian forces had been switched off after the latest wave of Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian energy facilities. Each side has blamed the other for shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant complex. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko has provoked ire in Ukraine by suggesting that the end of the war is Ukraine’s responsibility, and that if it does not “stop”, it will end in the “complete destruction” of the country. In a broadcast clip circulating on social media for its controversial comments, Lukashenko said that “everything is in Ukraine’s hands now if they don’t want a huge number of people to die”. He said that similar to relations with Germany following the second world war, once the Ukraine war has concluded “we will make it all up”. Advisor to Ukraine’s minister of internal affairs, Anton Gerashchenko, tweeted that this was “theatre of [the] absurd”. Hungary has obtained an exemption from the EU’s proposed Russian oil price cap during talks in Brussels, according to the country’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó. Szijjarto said at a briefing in Brussels broadcast on his Facebook page that the European Union’s current proposal says that oil deliveries though pipelines would be exempt from the price cap, which means it would not affect Hungary if the proposed cap is adopted later. A snap from Reuters suggests that Russia and Ukraine will each exchange 50 prisoners of war today, according to the Russian-installed leader in Ukraine’s Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, who posted on the Telegram messaging service. More details to follow. Russia does not plan to supply oil to countries supporting a price cap on Russian oil, the Kremlin has said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said that Ukraine’s leadership could “end suffering” in Ukraine by meeting Russia’s demands to resolve the conflict. Peskov was asked whether Russia was worried about the effect on the civilian population of its strikes on energy infrastructure, which have caused repeated mass blackouts. Peskov said Russia attacked targets of military, not “social”, relevance. Rachel Hall here taking over the blog for the next few hours. If there’s anything we’ve missed, do drop me a line at rachel.hall@theguardian.com. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: Ukraine expects three nuclear power plants that were switched off because of Russian missile strikes on Wednesday will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. “We expect that by evening the nuclear power plants will start working, providing energy to the network, and this will significantly reduce the [energy] deficit,” he said in comments broadcast on national television. More than two-thirds of the Ukrainian capital was still without power on Thursday morning and a number of residents had no running water, a day after Russian missile strikes caused Kyiv’s biggest outages in nine months of war. The capital was one of the main targets of the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities that cut power in many regions and made emergency blackouts necessary in others to conserve energy and enable repairs as winter sets in. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in the United Arab Emirates last week to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-of-war swap, according to a Reuters report. Any swap would be linked to a resumption of Russian ammonia exports, which go to Asia and Africa, via a Ukrainian pipeline, three sources with knowledge of the meeting told the news agency. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said contacts with the UN nuclear watchdog over safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine were “constructive” and showed some promise. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling last weekend, prompting renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. Russia is not planning contact with the United States and did not initiate contact with Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Thursday. He added that contacts with Washington happen over the phone but take place through diplomatic channels and not at a presidential level. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces tried again to make advances on their main targets in the Donetsk region - Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said. Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream. Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to Ukraine to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Poland’s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Prime minister Viktor Orbán’s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EU’s joint borrowing, Reuters reported. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations security council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that have again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. Neighbouring Moldova said it was suffering massive blackouts caused by the missile barrage and its EU-friendly president, Maia Sandu, accused Russia of leaving her country “in the dark”. European Union governments failed to reach a deal on Wednesday on the level at which to cap prices for Russian sea-borne oil under the G7 scheme and will resume talks, EU diplomats said. Earlier on Thursday, EU representatives met in Brussels. The move is part of sanctions intended to slash Moscow’s revenue from its oil exports so it has less money to finance the invasion of Ukraine. The resignation of Russia’s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP. The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unesco’s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for now. My colleague Rachel Hall will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s war on Ukraine. Polish leaders say that an air defence system which Germany offered Poland would be best given to Ukraine to help it protect itself against Russian strikes. Germany said earlier this week that it has offered Warsaw Eurofighter planes and Patriot defence systems to help defend Poland’s airspace after two men were killed when an apparently stray Ukrainian defence projectile fell in Poland near the border with Ukraine, the Associated Press reported. Poland’s defence minister, Mariusz Błaszczak, initially said he received Germany’s offer with “satisfaction”. But following Russia’s heavy barrage of Ukraine on Wednesday, Polish leaders said it would be better if the defence systems were placed in western Ukraine. The head of Poland’s ruling party, Jarosław Kaczyński, called Germany’s offer “interesting” but said he believed “it would be best for Poland’s security if Germany handed the equipment to the Ukrainians, trained Ukrainian teams, with the caveat that the batteries would be placed in Ukraine’s west”. Ukraine’s ambassador to Warsaw, Vasyl Zvarych, thanked Błaszczak, saying on Twitter that Ukraine needs as many air defence weapons as it can get. The European Union is pressing ahead with a ninth sanctions package on Russia in response to Moscow’s attack on Ukraine, the European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a visit to Finland. “We are working hard to hit Russia where it hurts to blunt even further its capacity to wage war on Ukraine and I can announce today that we are working full speed on a 9th sanctions package,” von der Leyen told a news conference. “And I’m confident that we will very soon approve a global price cap on Russian oil with the G7 and other major partners. We will not rest until Ukraine has prevailed over Putin and his unlawful and barbaric war,” she said. Russia is not planning contact with the United States and did not initiate contact with Washington at the G20 summit in Indonesia, the deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Thursday. He added that contacts with Washington happen over the phone but take place through diplomatic channels and not at a presidential level. Meanwhile, Russia’s federal security service (FSB) claimed it has prevented Ukrainian special services from carrying out what it said was sabotage on the “South Stream” gas pipeline, Russian news agencies reported. The pipeline was a project intended to transport Russian gas through the Black Sea to Bulgaria, although was later cancelled in favour of TurkStream. Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in the United Arab Emirates last week to discuss the possibility of a prisoner-of-war swap, according to a Reuters report. Any swap would be linked to a resumption of Russian ammonia exports, which go to Asia and Africa, via a Ukrainian pipeline, three sources with knowledge of the meeting told the news agency. Reuters reported: The sources said the talks were being mediated by the Gulf Arab state and did not include the United Nations despite the UN’s central role in negotiating the ongoing initiative to export agricultural products from three Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Ammonia is used to make fertiliser. However, the talks aim to remove remaining obstacles in the initiative extended last week and ease global food shortages by unblocking Ukrainian and Russian exports, they added. The sources asked not to be named in order to freely discuss sensitive matters. The Russian and Ukrainian representatives travelled to the UAE capital Abu Dhabi on 17 November where they discussed allowing Russia to resume ammonia exports in exchange for a prisoner swap that would release a large number of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners, the sources said. Reuters could not immediately establish what progress was made at the talks. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, has said contacts with the UN nuclear watchdog over safety at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine were “constructive” and showed some promise. The Zaporizhzhia plant, which Russia seized shortly after its invasion, was again rocked by shelling last weekend, prompting renewed calls from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to create a protection zone around it to prevent a nuclear disaster. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog met a Russian delegation in Istanbul on Wednesday to discuss safety at the plant, which both Ukraine and Moscow have accused each other of shelling, Reuters reported. Hungary will provide €187m ($195m) in financial aid to Ukraine as its contribution to a planned EU support package worth up to €18bn in 2023, according to a government decree. Prime minister Viktor Orbán’s government has said it was willing to pay its share of support for Ukraine but would rather pay it bilaterally than through the EU’s joint borrowing, Reuters reported. “The government continues to be committed to take part in financial support to war-gripped Ukraine,” the government said in the decree. “So it calls on the finance minister to make sure to provide the €187m that would be Hungary’s share in the €18bn EU loan to be granted to Ukraine.” The decree, signed by Orbán, also says that the Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, should start talks with Ukraine to work out an agreement needed for the financial assistance. To secure the funds for the loans, which Ukraine will have to repay within 35 years, the European Commission would borrow on the capital markets. However, proposals for the package will need to be approved by the European parliament and the EU’s 27 member states and Hungary said it would not take part in joint borrowing. Ukraine expects three nuclear power plants that were switched off because of Russian missile strikes on Wednesday will be operating again by Thursday evening, energy minister German Galushchenko said. “We expect that by evening the nuclear power plants will start working, providing energy to the network, and this will significantly reduce the [energy] deficit,” he said in comments broadcast on national television.

The capital was one of the main targets of the latest wave of attacks on energy facilities that cut power in many regions and made emergency blackouts necessary in others to conserve energy and enable repairs as winter sets in. The temperature plunged below zero degrees Celsius overnight in a city that had 2.8 million residents before the war and where it is already snowing and the streets are icy, Reuters reported. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said electricians and repair workers were doing everything to get the power back on “as fast as possible” but the recovery would depend largely on the overall energy “balance” of the nationwide grid. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy chief of president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s staff, said power supplies had been restored in the Kirovohrad and Vinnytsia regions. In the south, the Mykolaiv region’s governor, Vitaliy Kim, appealed to Ukrainians to be as frugal as possible in their use of power. “Consumption has been growing this morning [which is logical], there isn’t enough capacity in the system to switch it on for more consumers!!,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “The energy system is united like we all are! If you’ve turned off a few unneeded lights, that’s really important!!!” Ukrainian servicemen shoot towards Russian positions on the frontline near Kherson, southern Ukraine. Ground battles continue to rage in eastern Ukraine, where Russia is pressing an offensive along a stretch of frontline west of the city of Donetsk, which has been held by its proxies since 2014, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s general staff said Russian forces tried again to make advances on their main targets in the Donetsk region - Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Russian forces shelled both areas and used incendiary devices to set Ukrainian positions ablaze with only limited success, the general staff said. Among those fighting the Russians in Bakhmut are a unit of Chechen fighters, who hope a Ukrainian victory could spark political crisis in Russia and bring down the powerful pro-Moscow leader of Chechnya. Further south, Russian forces were digging in on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, the general staff said, shelling areas on the west bank including the town of Kherson, which was recently reclaimed by Ukrainian forces. Reuters was not able to immediately verify the battlefield accounts. The resignation of Russia’s ambassador to Unesco will end the deadlock in a key group he chaired that is charged with preserving cultural sites around the world, a diplomatic source told AFP. The World Heritage Committee, responsible for adding properties to Unesco’s list of world heritage sites, had been unable to function for months after the international backlash against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “I have the honor to inform you of the end of my mission as permanent delegate of the Russian Federation to Unesco,” Russian ambassador Alexander Kuznetsov said on Tuesday in a letter to the members of the World Heritage Committee obtained by AFP. The resignation will allow the committee to “quickly appoint a new president” and resume its activities, a UN diplomat told AFP. Russia’s position as chair of the committee had sparked an outcry among other members following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February. The committee had been due to meet in June in the Russian city of Kazan, but 46 countries, including France and the UK, boycotted the event. The meeting was supposed to update the landscapes, monuments and cities included in the body’s list of heritage sites. Unesco regulations dictate that replacements for a resigning committee chair are to be appointed by the country that follows in alphabetical order in English. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said Russian forces had fired about 70 cruise missiles at targets across the country and also deployed attack drones. The strikes killed 10 people and disconnected three nuclear power stations from the grid, officials said. The country’s energy ministry said supplies were cut to “the vast majority of electricity consumers”. All of Kyiv lost water, the capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said. The city’s administration said water and heating would return to residential buildings on Thursday morning. Late Wednesday, the deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential office said that Kyiv and over a dozen regions, including Lviv and Odesa in the south, had been reconnected to the power grid. Klitschko said 21 out of 31 missiles targeting Kyiv were shot down before they reached their targets. One of the 10 that evaded the defences hit an apartment block in Vyshgorod, a northern suburb of the city, killing three people and wounding 15. There was a kindergarten in the lower ground floor of the building, but it was evacuated after air raid sirens went off. The blast left a three-metre crater in front of the building, destroyed apartments around it, blew the tops off nearby trees and ruined a children’s playground. Earlier in the day, a newborn baby was killed when a Russian rocket struck a hospital maternity ward in southern Ukraine. Ukraine’s state emergency service said a woman with her two-day-old baby and a doctor were in the facility in the town of Vilniansk, close to the city of Zaporizhzhia, when it was hit. The mother and the doctor were pulled alive from the rubble by rescue workers but the baby died, it said on the Telegram messaging app. Lorenzo Tondo and Julian Borger report from Kyiv: Fresh Russian strikes battered Ukraine’s already failing electricity grid, causing blackouts across the country and in neighbouring Moldova, in attacks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the UN were “an obvious crime against humanity”. Addressing an urgent meeting of the UN security council late on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine would put forward a resolution condemning “any forms of energy terror”. Referring to Russia’s likely veto, he said: “It’s nonsense that the veto right is secured for the party that wages this war. “We cannot be hostage to one international terrorist,” Zelenskiy said. He also invited the UN to send experts to examine and evaluate Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. “When we have the temperature below zero, and scores of millions of people without energy supplies, without heating, without water, this is an obvious crime against humanity,” Zelenskiy told the security council via video link: Hello, my name is Helen Sullivan and you’re reading the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday night, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the United Nations Security Council to act against Russia over air strikes on civilian infrastructure that again plunged Ukrainian cities into darkness and cold as winter sets in. Russia unleashed a missile barrage across Ukraine on Wednesday, killing 10 people, forcing shutdowns of nuclear power plants and cutting water and electricity supply in many places. “Today is just one day, but we have received 70 missiles. That’s the Russian formula of terror. This is all against our energy infrastructure... Hospitals, schools, transport, residential districts all suffered,” Zelenskiy said via video link to the council chamber. At least 10 people were killed in the strikes, Interior Minister Denys Monastyrsky said, including a two-day-old infant.

UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the UN security council on Wednesday that an exchange of 35 Russian and 36 Ukrainian prisoners was a positive development amid the “dark news” of Russian strikes on Ukraine. DiCarlo encouraged the parties to continue prisoner releases and follow international humanitarian law in relation to prisoners of war, Reuters reports. A Russian court on Wednesday extended by six months the detention of opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who risks being jailed for 10 years for denouncing president Vladimir Putin’s assault on Ukraine. The 39-year-old Moscow city councillor is in the dock as part of an unprecedented crackdown on dissent in Russia, with most opposition activists either in jail or in exile. He faces up to 10 years behind bars, if convicted. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it had faith in the “success” of its offensive in Ukraine. “The future and the success of the special operation are beyond doubt,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on a visit to Armenia, using the official Moscow term to describe Russia’s assault, Agence France-Presse reports. European cities were urged to send spare generators to Ukraine to help the country through the winter in the face of Russia’s attacks on electricity infrastructure. Ukraine’s power grid came under bombardment again as the European parliament president, Roberta Metsola, launched an appeal to get generators to Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-03T14:37:36Z","webTitle":"EDF cuts output at nuclear power plants as French rivers get too warm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/03/edf-to-reduce-nuclear-power-output-as-french-river-temperatures-rise","fields":{"headline":"EDF cuts output at nuclear power plants as French rivers get too warm","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The French energy supplier EDF is temporarily reducing output at its nuclear power stations on the Rhône and Garonne rivers as heatwaves push up river temperatures, restricting its ability to use river water to cool the plants. The majority-state-owned company, Europe’s biggest producer of nuclear energy, said it would extend output cuts at several power stations on the two rivers as the hot spell continues – but that a minimum level of output would be maintained to keep the grid steady. EDF warned of potential output cuts at its nuclear power plants Tricastin, St Alban and Golfech in coming days due to high temperatures in the Rhône and Garonne rivers. It started imposing production restrictions in mid-July at Tricastin, St Alban and Bugey on the Rhône and Blayais at the mouth of the Garonne amid sweltering temperatures. A spokesperson told the Guardian that the company was lowering production “for a few hours” where possible but not shutting the reactors completely. After the 2003 heatwave, France’s nuclear safety authority (ASN) set temperature and river flow limits beyond which power stations must reduce their production, to ensure the water used to cool the plants will not harm wildlife when it is released back into the rivers. Temperatures in southern France are expected to reach 40C over the next two days, according to the forecaster Météo-France. Since 2000, production losses due to high river temperatures and low river flows have represented an average of 0.3% of annual production. However, half of EDF’s 56 nuclear reactors are offline due to planned maintenance and work to repair corrosion which was delayed by the pandemic, just as Europe faces an energy crunch following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a result of the maintenance work, EDF estimates its power output this year will be the lowest in more than three decades. The company issued its fourth profit warning of the year last Thursday when it reported a first-half loss of €5.3bn. The French government, which owns 84% of EDF, is in the process of buying out minority shareholders to take full control of the business. The production cuts mean that France, traditionally an energy exporter, is relying on imports from countries such as Spain, Switzerland, Germany and the UK. EDF is buying electricity at high market prices, after Russia’s war in Ukraine sparked an energy crisis, leaving European countries scrambling to find alternative supplies. Another strain on EDF’s finances comes from a power tariff cap imposed by the government to shield consumers from soaring energy prices. The latest power cuts threaten to push energy prices even higher after they were sent spiralling by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-399-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T14:03:30Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 399 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-399-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/29/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-399-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 399 of the invasion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russian president Vladimir Putin is an “informationally isolated person” who had “lost everything” over the last year of war. “He doesn’t have allies,” Zelenskiy said, adding that it was clear to him that even China was no longer willing to back Russia, despite Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Moscow. Zelenskiy suggested that Putin’s announcement shortly after Xi’s visit that he would move tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, closer to Nato territory, was meant to deflect from the fact that the Chinese leader’s visit did not go well. Putin said the move was a counter to Britain’s decision to provide more depleted uranium ammunition to Ukraine. Belarus has pinned the move as being a response to Nato aggression on its borders. Zelenskiy said Ukraine needed 20 Patriot batteries to protect against Russian missiles, and even that may not be enough “as no country in the world was attacked with so many ballistic rockets”. He added that a European nation sent another air defence system to Ukraine, but it didn’t work and they “had to change it again and again”. He did not name the country. Zelenskiy extended an invitation to his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to visit his country. “We are ready to see him here. I want to speak with him. I had contact with him before full-scale war. But during all this year, more than one year, I didn’t have,” he said. The Kremlin said it was not up to Moscow to advise the Chinese leader on whether he should visit Ukraine or not. Ukrainian forces have reportedly shelled the Russian-controlled Ukrainian city of Melitopol, south of the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian media reported on Wednesday that as a result, the city’s power supply had been cut. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of Melitopol, which has been occupied by Russian forces since March last year, said on the Telegram messaging app that several explosions had gone off in the city. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that on 28 March five residents of Donetsk – three in Bakhmut and two in Chasiv Yar – were injured. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of Russia’s mercenary Wagner group has said the battle for the eastern city of Bakhmut has “practically destroyed” the Ukrainian army but admitted that his forces had also been “badly damaged”. The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, arrived at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine on Wednesday. He has described the situation there as very dangerous, and told Russian media outlets during the visit that “the situation is not improving, on the contrary, hostilities around this territory are intensifying. All possible measures must be taken to protect the station from any attack.” The Danish energy agency says that an object found near the Nord Stream 2 pipeline does not pose a safety risk, and is an empty maritime smoke buoy, which is used for visual marking. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation, has restated that Russia intends to achieve all the aims of what it terms its “special military operation”, despite, he said, “the steadily increasing military assistance to Ukraine from the US and other western states.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has urged Russians not to adopt children who she said were “stolen” from her country during the war and deported to Russia. Vereshchuk, posting to Telegram, said orphans had been “stolen in Ukraine” and allegedly given up for adoption in Russia. Russia has stopped informing the US about its nuclear activities, including missile test launches, after Moscow suspended its participation in the New Start arms control treaty last month, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said on Wednesday. The White House on Tuesday said the US had told Russia it would cease exchanging some data on its nuclear forces after Moscow’s refusal to do so. Russia began exercises with the Yars intercontinental ballistic missile system and several thousand of troops, its defence ministry said on Wednesday, in what is likely to be seen as another attempt by Moscow to show off its nuclear strength. Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts. French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland, the Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyber weapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages. Global commodities trader Cargill has told Russia’s agriculture ministry that it will stop exporting Russian grain from the start of the next exporting season, which begins on 1 July, the ministry said on Wednesday. Sweden’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Russia’s Stockholm ambassador to complain about a statement on the Russian embassy’s website that said joining Nato made the Nordic nation a “legitimate target”. Sweden’s admission to Nato faces challenges as Hungary has grievances about criticism it has received from the Nordic state, and bridging this gap will require significant efforts on both sides, the Hungarian government’s spokesperson tweeted on Wednesday. After months of foot-dragging Hungary’s parliament approved a bill on Monday to allow Finland to join Nato but the Swedish bill is still stranded in parliament. Hungary’s foreign minister held telephone talks with the Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, about gas and oil shipments as well as nuclear cooperation, the Hungarian minister said late on Tuesday. In a statement, Péter Szijjártó said Novak had reassured him that despite international sanctions, the Russian party would be able to do maintenance work on the Turkstream pipeline. The US has not seen any indications that Vladimir Putin is getting closer to using tactical nuclear weapons in his war on Ukraine, after the Russian leader said he was moving such weapons into Belarus. Belarus confirmed it would host Russian tactical nuclear weapons, saying the decision was a response to years of western pressure. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Belarus would face further EU sanctions. Russia said it shot down a US-supplied GLSDB guided smart bomb fired by Ukrainian forces, the first time Moscow has claimed to have intercepted one of the weapons that could double Ukraine’s battlefield firing range. Spain will send six Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine after the Easter holiday, according to Spanish defence minister Margarita Robles."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T18:00:06Z","webTitle":"UN urges Moscow not to take nuclear power plant off grid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/19/russia-ukraine-war-putin-is-losing-information-war-in-ukraine-uk-spy-chief-says-live","fields":{"headline":"UN urges Moscow not to take nuclear power plant off grid – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is 9pm in Ukraine. Here are some things you might’ve missed: Putin has agreed for inspectors to visit Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, Putin had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. The UN secretary-general has asked Russia not take Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant off grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraine’s electrical grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so, saying the plant used “Ukrainian electricity”. Western officials say that there are growing concerns over concerns over water cooling at Russian-held nuclear power plant. The existing reactor cooling system at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is critical to the safety of the site and relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation – but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid. More than half of Russia Black Sea naval aviation has been knocked out, according to a western official in Ukraine. Western officials have said that the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. The US has announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. Russia’s media watchdog said it was taking punitive measures against TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites - including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined U.S.-based live streaming service Twitch 2 million roubles (£28,635) and messenger service Telegram 11 million roubles (£158,291) for violating military censorship laws. A former Russian mayor has been appointed head of Russian-occupied Kharkiv. It is the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Ukraine’s economy minister has said the country’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year. Hit by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. The Kyiv Independent reported that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” he told the news agency. As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. That is all for today. Thank you for reading along. We will be back bringing you the latest Ukraine news tomorrow. Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed that a team of independent inspectors can travel to the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine, the French presidency said on Friday. According to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, Putin had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”. It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres has urged Moscow’s forces occupying the Zaporizhzhia plant in south Ukraine not to disconnect the facility from the grid and potentially cut supplies to millions of Ukrainians. The United States Defence Department on Friday announced a new $775m (£655m) package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, drones, artillery and mine-clearing systems. “We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that’s what we’re doing with this package,” a senior US defence official told reporters. The official said Ukraine’s forces have made good use of the now 19 packages of arms the United States has provided since Moscow invaded on February 24. Swiss prosecutors have been asked by an Ukrainian NGO to investigate an alleged attack on a Swiss photojournalist by Russian troops in Ukraine earlier this year, AFP reported on Friday. The NGO Truth Hounds asked Switzerland’s Office of the Attorney General (OAG) to probe an attack on Swiss freelance journalist Guillaume Briquet in southern Ukraine in March as a possible war crime, according to the Swiss-based Civitas Maxima group that helped it file the complaint. In a statement to AFP, the OAG confirmed that it had received the complaint and said it would “now be examined according to usual procedure”, stressing that a complaint did not automatically mean it would launch an investigation. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us over the newswires from Kramatorsk, which is in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. Russia has submitted a letter to the United Nations Security Council warning of planned “provocations” by Ukraine at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Friday, citing a diplomat. The letter repeated Russia’s previous claim that Kyiv was planning a “provocation” at the plant on Friday, TASS reported. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear reactor complex, the largest in Europe, was captured by Russia in March but is still run by Ukrainian technicians. The plant has come under repeated shelling, with both Moscow and Kyiv trading blame. The United States is poised to announce it will provide Ukraine with nearly $800m (£678m) in new military aid on Friday, including at least a dozen surveillance drones, according to several U.S. officials. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity with the Associated Press to discuss the aid ahead of its public release. They said the bulk of the aid package will be additional Howitzers (long-range weapons) and ammunition. Two officials confirmed the new inclusion of portable, long-endurance drones which are launched by a catapult and can be retrieved. The U.S. has previously sent Ukraine more than $9bn (£7.6bn) in weapons systems, ammunition and other equipment. France has now released a statement on Macron’s call with Putin. It says the French president “once again underlined his concern at the risks posed by the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant” and argued for the IAEA experts to attend the plant “as soon as possible”. Putin, the Élysée says, supported this idea. The statement continued: The two presidents will talk to each other again in the coming days on this subject, after discussions between the technical teams and before the deployment of the mission. Russian president Vladimir Putin and French counterpart Emmanuel Macron have just finished a phone call about the situation in Ukraine, Moscow has said. In a Kremlin readout of the call, reported by Reuters, Putin said shelling of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, which he blamed on Kyiv, created the risk of “large-scale catastrophe”. Reuters adds: Both presidents agree on the need to send a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency to the plant. According to the Kremlin, Putin told Macron about continuing obstacles to supplying Russian food and fertiliser products to world markets. The UN, Ukraine and western officials have all expressed concerns about Russia’s maintenance of the nuclear plant. The Kyiv Independent reports that it is the first time Macron and Putin have spoken since May. Russia’s state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said on Friday that it was taking punitive measures against a string of foreign IT companies, including TikTok, Telegram, Zoom, Discord and Pinterest. In a statement, Roskomnadzor said the measures were in response to the companies’ failure to remove content that it had flagged as illegal, and would remain in place until they complied. It did not specify what measures would be taken. Russia has repeatedly threatened to fine sites – including Google, that violate harsh new laws criminalising the spreading of “false information” about the Russian army. On Tuesday, Russian courts fined the US-based live streaming service Twitch 2m roubles (£28,635) and the messenger service Telegram 11m roubles (£158,291) for violating military censorship laws. On 29 July, the media watchdog targeted Novaya Gazeta, one of Russia’s last remaining independent news outlets, and demanded that its website and print edition be stripped of its licence. Ukraine’s economy could contract 35-40% by the end of the year, the economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said on Friday. Hit by Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion, the economy contracted 15.1% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2022. Western officials said on Friday they were concerned whether water cooling can be maintained at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is currently held by the Russians, amid accusations that the invaders are not properly maintaining the site. The existing reactor cooling system, critical to the safety of the site, relies on the maintenance of the electricity supply to ensure operation – but officials are anxious that Russia may disconnect the supply if it tries to cut off the plant from the Ukrainian grid. One Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said “the issue we are concerned about is water cooling of the nuclear reactors” and that it was “a situation we should all be watching very closely”. But they added that there were back-up diesel generators to maintain electricity supply and a Ukrainian workforce at the site “able to operate and mitigate against this”. A loss of electricity supply led to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Main power was lost after an earthquake and a tsunami overwhelmed the back-up generators on site. The loss of cooling was enough to lead to a partial reactor meltdown. The western official said that fighting around the plant was considered a far lesser risk because nuclear reactors are designed to withstand relatively heavy impacts with thick walling. “They are built to be able to cope with a civilian airline crashing into them,” the official said, and added that “direct fires” such as artillery was “not our immediate concern”. But they would not comment on whether they believed Russia was deliberately staging forces at the site, or was preparing a false flag operation, other than to note that “both sides are contesting the information environment”. Social media videos appeare to show Russian forces basing themselves on the site. Olexander, a former worker at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station wrote an account of living in Enerhodar, a satellite city for the plant, for the Guardian. I dedicated my life to nuclear power and have always been proud to be part of it. For many people like me, the Zaporizhzhia plant is our pride and destiny. There are six powerful units, about half of the capacity of all Ukrainian nuclear plants and a quarter of the country’s entire energy sector. Before the war, 11,000 people worked here. More than 50,000 people live in Enerhodar. We have been living under occupation for almost six months. It’s like a double occupation – the city and the nuclear plant have been captured. Our faith is constantly being tested. Ten days ago, we were sure that the city and the inhabitants would not suffer. But they are already wounded from the shelling at the station. There are already victims in the city. Read the rest of the piece here: The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh reported on Friday that “significant efforts” are being made “to understand if Ukraine can mount a successful counter attack in the south”. Tweeting from a “western officials” briefing, Sabbagh added that “such attacks are not without risk”. The UN secretary general has asked Russia not to cut the nuclear plant from Ukraine’s grid. António Guterres asked on Friday that the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station not be cut off from Ukraine’s grid after Ukrainian reports that Moscow is planning to do so. “Obviously the electricity from Zaporizhzhia is Ukrainian electricity … This principle must be fully respected,” said the UN secretary general during a visit to the port of Odesa in southern Ukraine. The Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, tweeting live from a briefing on Friday, said the Ukrainian raid on the Saky airbase in occupied Crimea last week knocked out “more than half” of Russia’s combat naval aviation in the Black Sea. However, overall “combat stasis” remains. He added, from the briefing, that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “should be able to withstand most direct military fire. Built strong enough to resist impact of a civilian airliner. Concerns focused around whether the plant suffers a loss of cooling due to the loss of back-up electricity.” Concerns around shelling near the plant, the largest in Europe, have been growing since it was taken over by Russian forces in March. It is still being run by Ukrainians. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. A former mayor of a Russian city has been appointed to head a Russian-installed government in north-east Ukraine, the latest in a string of such appointments which Kyiv says are part of attempts to annexe its territory. Andrei Alekseyenko resigned as mayor of Krasnodar on Thursday. He will now head a new Russian-appointed council of ministers in the Kharkiv province, Russian state-owned news agency TASS reported on Friday, citing a decree by the local Russian-installed administration. Russian officials have previously said that occupied areas of Ukraine will never return to Kyiv’s control, and that referendums on their accession to Russia may be held in the autumn. Ukraine has called them “pseudo-referendums” and vowed to prevent them. Italian newspapers have issued front-page warnings of alleged Russian interference in the upcoming election on Friday. This comes as a response to comments from Russia’s former president urging Europeans to “punish” their “stupid” governments, AFP reports. The former president and current deputy chair of Russia’s security council, Dmitry Medvedev, on Thursday called for Europeans to be “not only outraged at the actions of their governments ... but to hold them to account and punish them for their obvious stupidity”. “Act, European neighbours! Don’t remain silent! Demand accountability!” he said on Telegram. Following Medvedev’s comments, la Repubblica and il Messaggero front pages on Friday wrote of Russian “interference”, while the Corriere della Sera said Russia was “agitating” political waters ahead of the vote due to be held on 25 September. Rishi Sunak has called on the G20 to bar the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from its summit until Moscow halts the war in Ukraine, his spokesperson told Reuters on Friday. Putin and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, are said to be attending G20, which will be held on the island of Bali in November, according to earlier reports from Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo. “Our G20 partners and allies have a collective responsibility to call Putin’s abhorrent behaviour out. Sitting round a table with him isn’t good enough when he is responsible for children being killed in their beds as they sleep,” a spokesperson for the former chancellor told Reuters. They added: “We need to send a strong message to Putin that he doesn’t have a seat at the table unless and until he stops his illegal war in Ukraine.” Sunak is currently trailing behind the foreign secretary, Liz Truss , in polls in the contest to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. In a televised debate on 25 July, Truss said it would be important to confront Putin in front of Russia’s allies. She said:, “I would go there, and I would call Putin out.” As hosts of this year’s summit, Indonesia has faced pressure from western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin. The country has also invited the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. It’s 11am in the UK and 1pm in Ukraine. Here is everything that’s happened so far today: The Kyiv Independent reports that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases, after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. According to Ukraine’s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine, the Kyiv Independent reports. There were “no claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine on August 18, 2022 for the first time since July 6, 2022”, a report by the Institute for the Study of War, has found. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. “President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,” Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in the Economist on Friday. “Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.” Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. The Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. The Kyiv Independent reports that rescuers are searching for people and bodies under the rubble of a dormitory destroyed in attacks on the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. The head of Kharkiv Oblast police, Volodymyr Tymoshko, said there are currently 19 people confirmed dead, including a child, and 20 injured, with the death toll expected to rise after Russian rockets struck two hostel dormitories. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, will participate online in the second summit of the Crimea Platform, an international platform for work and cooperation on the liberation of Crimea. The summit, initiated by Ukraine, will be available to watch live on Nato’s website. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Ukrainians to stay away from enemy command posts and logistics bases. “Do not approach the military objects of the Russian army,” he said after reports of explosions overnight in Russian-occupied Crimea. Speaking on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Russians have realised that Crimea is “not a place for them” and hinted more attacks could lie ahead. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. “An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo”, less than 50km from the border, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. According to the Kyiv Independent, Oleg Kryuchkov, an advisor to the head of the Russian occupation government in Ukraine’s Crimea, posted on the social media app Telegram that the Russian military had destroyed a target in the city of Kerch, which is linked to Russia’s Krasnodar Krai via the strategic Crimean Bridge. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office, said on 17 August that the Crimean Bridge should be destroyed. The Kyiv Independent reports that according to Ukraine’s General Staff, Russia has lost 44,700 troops in Ukraine as well as 1,899 tanks, 4,195 armoured fighting vehicles, 1,016 artillery systems, 266 multiple launch rocket systems, 141 air defence systems, 197 helicopters, 234 airplanes, 795 drones, and 15 boats. A new report from the The Institute for the Study of War, a non-profit research organisation in the US has found there were “no claimed or assessed Russian territorial gains in Ukraine on August 18, 2022 for the first time since July 6, 2022”. The report suggests Russian propaganda has been intensified as tensions continue to build around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as the chief of Russia’s radiation, chemical and biological defence forces, Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, claimed on 18 August in a briefing that “Ukrainian forces are preparing for a provocation at the Zaporizhzhia NPP and that the provocation is meant to coincide with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres’s visit to Ukraine”. It is 9am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. “President Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west,” Jeremy Fleming said in an op-ed in The Economist on Friday. “Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short.” Multiple unconfirmed reports are claiming Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been struck again this morning. The Kyiv Independent cited Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, as saying Russian forces fired on three of the city’s districts at around 5.44am. Terekhov said a residential building was damaged and another building caught fire. If confirmed, the attack would be the third to hit city in three days. Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate recent Russian attacks on the city. Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting around 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from the site. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: “We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chornobyl,” the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, added. Four explosions hit an area near a major Russian military airport in Crimea on Thursday, local sources reported, but a pro-Moscow official said no damage had been done. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said Russian anti-aircraft forces had downed a Ukrainian drone. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a fire broke out at an ammunition depot near the border with Ukraine on Thursday, local authorities said. An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, less than 50km (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. President Joe Biden would authorise the assistance using his presidential drawdown authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of excess weapons from US stocks. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been one of the most consistently shelled since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to British intelligence. Sitting about 15km from the Russian front line, Kharkiv has suffered because it remains within range of most types of Russian artillery, the latest report from the UK’s ministry of defence reads. Multiple rocket launchers and generally inaccurate area weapons have caused devastation across large parts of the city. Russian forces continue to conduct local raids and probing attacks against Ukrainian forces, the ministry added. They are probably trying to force Ukraine to maintain significant forces on this front, to prevent them from being employed as a counter-attack force elsewhere.” Studying in Kryvyi Rih in the 1990s, Ukraine’s wartime leader often skipped class to focus on his standup, our correspondent Luke Harding reports from Zelenskiy’s hometown. “Volodymyr Zelenskiy was special. He was bright, hard-working and wanted to be the best of the best,” Andrii Shaikan, rector of the state university in Zelenskiy’s home town of Kryvyi Rih, said. Read the full story below. Chinese and Russian leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin will attend the G20 summit in Bali in November, Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, told Bloomberg News on Thursday. “Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come,” Jokowi, as he is popularly known, told the news agency. Indonesia is chairing the Group of 20 major economies and has faced pressure from Western countries to withdraw its invitation to Putin over his country’s invasion on Ukraine, which his government calls a “special military operation”. Jokowi has sought to position himself as mediator between the warring countries, and has travelled to meet both Ukraine’s and Russia’s presidents. This week, Jokowi said both countries have accepted Indonesia as a “bridge of peace”. Leaders of major countries, including US president Joe Biden, are set to meet in Indonesia’s resort island of Bali in November. Indonesia has also invited Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Guardian correspondent Luke Harding came upon a mural of outgoing UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, while reporting in the southern Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, the home town of the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The design – created by a collective from Odesa – shows a mop-haired Johnson giving a thumbs up. The mural’s artist, Anastasia Scherba, said she was grateful to Johnson for supporting Ukraine and giving it weapons. “He’s cool,” she said Multiple unconfirmed reports are claiming Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv has been struck again this morning. The Kyiv Independent newspaper cited Kharkiv mayor, Ihor Terekhov, as saying Russian forces fired on three of the city’s districts at around 5.44am. Terekhov reported that Kharkiv’s Kyivskyi, Osnovyanskyi, and Nemyshlianskyi districts were affected. A residential building was damaged and another unspecified building caught fire as a result of the shelling. One person has been reported injured so far. If confirmed, the attack would be the third to have hit city in three days. Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate recent Russian attacks on the city. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded in a pre-dawn rocket strike on Thursday, after an attack from Russia the day before. “As of now, 17 people have died in Kharkiv … and 42 people have been injured,” Synehubov said, describing the attacks as “an act of terrorism”. Fires and explosions have been reported at military targets inside Russia and Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, in the latest of a string of apparent sabotage missions deep into Russian-held territory. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a blaze at a munitions depot near the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province. “An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo”, less than 50km from the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement, adding that no casualties were reported. At least four explosions hit near the major Belbek airbase, north of Sevastopol in the occupied Crimean peninsula. The pro-Russia governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said: “There is no damage. No one was hurt.” Air defences were also activated near Kerch, the city at the Crimean end of a bridge to mainland Russia, which is a strategically vital supply route that many in Ukraine would like to see destroyed. Local media said a Ukrainian drone was shot down. Amid fears that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, world leaders have called to urgently secure the site. The UN secretary general called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” “The facility must not be used as part of any military operation. Instead, agreement is urgently needed to re-establish Zaporizhzhia’s purely civilian infrastructure and to ensure the safety of the area,” Guterres said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, added: We are worried. We don’t want another Chornobyl.” Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant they control. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. Russian state media had already accused Ukraine of planning a “provocation” at the plant to coincide with the UN secretary general’s visit to Ukraine, raising fears that Russia’s military could be planning a “false-flag attack”. When António Guterres travelled to Kyiv in April, Moscow carried out an airstrike on the city. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrsky, said Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios”, during a drill for emergency workers in Zaporizhzhia. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also warned Russia’s seizure of the plant had “raised the risk of a nuclear accident or incident” and accused Moscow of being “reckless” by using the area as a staging platform to launch artillery attacks on Ukrainian forces. Russia said it may shut down the plant, claiming backup support systems had been damaged in strikes. Igor Kirillov, the head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force, said if there was an accident at the site, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine almost six months after its invasion of the country, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. Jeremy Fleming, the intelligence head, said both countries have been using their cyber capabilities in the war in Ukraine. In an op-ed in The Economist on Friday, he wrote: So far, president Putin has comprehensively lost the information war in Ukraine and in the west. Although that’s cause for celebration, we should not underestimate how Russian disinformation is playing out elsewhere in the world. Just as with its land invasion, Russia’s initial online plans appear to have fallen short. The country’s use of offensive cyber tools has been irresponsible and indiscriminate.” Fleming said Russia had deployed WhisperGate malware to destroy and deface Ukrainian government systems. He also said Russia has used the same playbook before on Syria and the Balkans and said online disinformation is a major part of Russia’s strategy. However, the GCHQ has been able to intercept and to provide warnings in time, he said. Without going into much detail, Fleming said the UK’s National Cyber Force could respond to Russia by deploying a UK military unit that employs offensive cyber tools. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Russia has failed to gain ground in cyberspace against Ukraine almost six months after its invasion of the country, the head of Britain’s GCHQ intelligence service has said. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the site and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: “We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” It is 7am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Russian forces may be preparing to stage a “provocation” at the Moscow-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said it was concerned that Russia had plans to stage an incident at the plant on Friday, and had information that staff with Russia’s Rosatom nuclear company had left the site. The UN secretary general has called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces from the site. António Guterres said he was “gravely concerned” about the situation at the plant and said it had to be demilitarised, adding: “We must tell it like it is – any potential damage to Zaporizhzhia is suicide.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the power plant. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chornobyl,” the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, added. At least 17 people were killed and 42 injured in two separate Russian attacks on Kharkiv, according to its regional governor. Three civilians were killed and 17 wounded in a pre-dawn rocket strike on Thursday, after an attack from Russia the day before. “As of now, 17 people have died in Kharkiv … and 42 people have been injured,” Oleh Synehubov said, describing the attacks as “an act of terrorism”. Four explosions hit an area near a major Russian military airport in Crimea on Thursday, local sources reported, but a pro-Moscow official said no damage had been done. The governor of Sevastopol, Mikhail Razvozhayev, said Russian anti-aircraft forces had downed a Ukrainian drone. Two Russian villages were evacuated after a fire broke out at an ammunition depot near the border with Ukraine on Thursday, local authorities said. An ammunition depot caught fire near the village of Timonovo, less than 50km (30 miles) from the Ukrainian border in Belgorod province, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said in a statement. The US is readying about $800m of additional military aid to Ukraine and could announce it as soon as Friday, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. President Joe Biden would authorise the assistance using his presidential drawdown authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of excess weapons from US stocks. The Russian military announced that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy took over a major news conference after becoming irked by a interpreter’s failure to translate his comments properly into English. Zelenskiy acted after the interpreter cut short his remarks during an event with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and United Nations secretary general António Guterres. Zelenskiy confirmed that Ukraine has not changed its position on peace negotiations, saying talks with Russia are only possible if Russian forces leave illegally occupied territory in Ukraine. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russians, its government said. Estonia’s foreign minister also defended his country’s decision to bar Russian tourists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/17/uk-arm-of-edf-returns-to-profit-as-household-electricity-prices-soar","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-17T11:15:43Z","webTitle":"UK arm of EDF returns to profit as household electricity prices soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/17/uk-arm-of-edf-returns-to-profit-as-household-electricity-prices-soar","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/17/uk-arm-of-edf-returns-to-profit-as-household-electricity-prices-soar","fields":{"headline":"UK arm of EDF returns to profit as household electricity prices soar","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UK arm of the French energy company EDF bounced back to profit last year, making more than £1bn, as it was boosted by the rising cost of wholesale energy, which allowed it to sell the electricity it generated at a higher price. The firm made a pre-tax profit of £1.1bn in the UK last year, before one-off items, a recovery from a loss of £21m a year earlier. EDF, which runs Britain’s nuclear power stations, said the profit was related to stronger operational performance of its nuclear fleet, and higher energy prices. The company is building Britain’s newest nuclear reactor, Hinkley Point C in Somerset, which has been hit by delays and climbing costs. The cost of the project was originally set at £18bn, before it was later put at £25bn to £26bn. On Friday, EDF said that £25bn to £26bn remained the estimated cost based on 2015 calculations but “the estimated nominal cost at completion could reach £32.7bn” because of inflation. The company, which is mostly state-owned but is being fully nationalised in France, is the UK’s fourth-largest energy supplier, providing gas and electricity to more than 5m UK households. EDF said Britain’s cap on energy bills hit earnings at its energy supply business, which made a loss of £200m. The company said this was because it cost it more to buy energy to supply to its residential customers than the price it was allowed to charge them under the energy price cap. The UK profit was a rare bright spot for EDF in its annual results, which reported a record net loss of €17.9bn (£16bn) for the whole group in 2022, as its nuclear output plunged to a 34-year low after a record number of outages at its reactors in France. Stress corrosion cracks were found in pipes in the cooling systems of some reactors. The group’s net debt rose to almost €65bn last year, up from €43bn a year earlier. EDF’s chief executive, Luc Rémont, who was appointed by the French government last November to turn the company around, said: “Today, our priority is to put EDF back on track.” EDF said it invested £2.6bn in the UK in 2022 in its nuclear, renewables and customer businesses. The company said it was investing more than £13bn in the UK between 2023 and 2025, largely in the Hinkley Point scheme. It is also planning to invest about £2bn in its existing nuclear fleet and renewables projects this year. It welcomed the UK government’s decision last November confirming that the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk would go ahead, and which will be developed by EDF. The government has taken a 50% stake in the project, which will be the second of a new generation of UK nuclear power reactors, after Hinkley Point C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T17:15:30Z","webTitle":"We need more honesty on nuclear power’s long legacy of hazardous waste | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/22/we-need-more-honesty-on-nuclear-powers-long-legacy-of-hazardous-waste","fields":{"headline":"We need more honesty on nuclear power’s long legacy of hazardous waste","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Samanth Subramanian captures perfectly the vast scale and longevity of the effort needed to clean up Sellafield (The long read, 15 December). As Britain and other states with nuclear power industries grapple with how to go about an effective, safe and economical nuclear clean-up, it might be better to explain the challenges with less reliance on suggestions that in its early days the nuclear industry never thought about decommissioning (though the point has validity). Instead, we need more honesty about the fact that nuclear power inescapably generates large quantities of hazardous human-made waste, the worst of which will remain hazardous probably beyond Homo sapiens’ time on the planet. The industry’s solution to this is a network of deep disposal facilities. But none have yet been created, their cost is enormous and there is no certainty that they will perform the long-term task required of them. These are considerations that sadly receive little attention in current debates about the need for new nuclear-generation capacity. Coincidentally, you published a letter (14 December) suggesting that nuclear radiation is less dangerous than emissions from a wood-burning stove, a curious comparison to make. Wood-burning stoves are pollutants, no question, but they could never lead to a Windscale, Three Mile Island, Chornobyl or Fukushima. Nor will decommissioning them cost billions and take decades. Tom Smith Chair, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, 2017-20 • In 1993, a government official told me that “it was sometimes right to do the wrong thing”. For reasons of political expediency, it was right to give political consent for the operation of the thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) at Sellafield. This huge facility, not mentioned in Samanth Subramanian’s fine long read, had been built over the previous decade to reprocess British and foreign, especially Japanese, spent nuclear fuels. Abandoning it would be too embarrassing for the many politicians and their parties that had backed it, expensive in terms of compensation for broken contracts, and damaging to Britain’s and the nuclear industry’s international reputation. It was wrong to proceed, as the government well knew, because the primary justification for its construction – supply of plutonium for fast breeder reactors (FBRs) – had been swept away by the abandonment of FBRs in the 1980s (none were built anywhere). Because returning Thorp’s separated plutonium and radwaste to Japan would be difficult and risky. Because decommissioning Thorp would become much more costly after its radioactive contamination. Because there was a known win-win solution, favoured by most utilities – store the spent fuel safely at Sellafield prior to its return to senders, avoiding the many troubles that lay ahead. Thorp operated fitfully until its closure in 2018. The 30 tonnes of plutonium that it separated remains at Sellafield – another waste to trouble generations to come. William Walker Edinburgh • Anton van der Merwe makes the compelling point that lack of investment in nuclear power over the last 40 years has had a disastrous impact on carbon emissions and therefore has exacerbated the climate emergency (Letters, 14 December). However, in the same issue, the long read discusses plans for new nuclear without mentioning the huge beneficial impact that low-carbon nuclear will need to have if we are to avoid climate catastrophe. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on 1.5C temperature rises published in 2018 presented mitigation scenarios in which nuclear generation would grow on average 2.5 times from today’s level by 2050. Without this, the chances of meeting climate targets are much reduced. Neil Smith Solihull, West Midlands • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Zelenskiy cited Ukrainian intelligence as the source of his information and called for greater international attention to the situation at the facility, the largest nuclear plant in Europe. Since seizing it last year, Moscow has turned it into a military base from which it has bombarded Ukrainian towns across the Dnipro reservoir. “There is a serious threat because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the station, which could lead to a [radiation] release,” Zelenskiy told a joint news conference in Kyiv with the visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Earlier on Friday, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) claimed that Russian troops were reducing their presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with staff told to relocate to Crimea and military patrols scaled back. The agency’s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, has alleged that Moscow has approved a plan to blow up the station and has mined four of the six power units, as well as a cooling pond. According to the GUR, several representatives of Russia’s state nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, have already left. Ukrainian employees who stayed at the plant and signed contracts with Rosatom had been told to evacuate by Monday, preferably to Crimea, it said. On Thursday Ukraine conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the power station, regional officials said. Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, replied saying that he had written to the UN security council and secretary general, António Guterres, to state: “We do not intend to blow up this NPP [nuclear power plant], we have no intention of doing so.” In a separate development, the US army general, Mark Milley, told the National Press Club in Washington that Ukraine’s counteroffensive could take up to “10 weeks” and be “very, very bloody”. “War on paper and real war are different,” Milley said. “In real war, real people die. Real people are on those frontlines and real people are in those vehicles. Real bodies are being shredded by high explosives.” Milley said the counteroffensive was “advancing steadily, deliberately working its way through very difficult minefields … 500 metres a day, 1,000 metres a day, 2,000 metres” – and that he was not surprised progress was slower than some people and computers had predicted. “What I had said was, this is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks. It’s going to be very difficult,” he added. “It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody. And no one should have any illusions about any of that.” The US is also considering approving the transfer of controversial cluster munition warheads to Ukraine to boost Kyiv’s counteroffensive, CNN reported. Officials told CNN that “a final decision is expected soon from the White House, and that if approved, the weapons could be included in a new military aid package to Ukraine as soon as next month”. Cluster bombs are designed to release dozens of smaller bombs, called submunitions, over a wide area, but the smaller munitions do not always explode, posing a future risk to civilians. The bombs were banned under international law by a treaty that has been signed by more than 100 countries – but not Russia, the US or Ukraine. Meanwhile, according to the Washington Post, the CIA director, William Burns, made a secret trip to Ukraine, where officials outlined a strategy to take back control of Russian-occupied territories and bring the war to an end. Overnight the Post reported that Burns had recently travelled to Ukraine to meet Zelenskiy and Ukrainian intelligence officials. During the trip, the officials revealed a Ukrainian strategy to recapture territories occupied by the Russians as well as their endgame to open peace talks with Moscow with a view to ending the war. According to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, Burns recently called the Russian spy chief, Sergei Naryshkin, after last week’s aborted mutiny in Russia, to reassure the Kremlin that the US had no role in it.

Since it lost power at last month’s election, the new federal opposition has begun a push for the longstanding ban on nuclear power to be lifted. Despite doing little to advance it as an energy source during its time in government, new Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has called for a “mature” conversation about the role of nuclear power in Australia. The new leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, has indicated that support for nuclear energy could be a part of the Coalition’s future policy platform, while former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has backed calls to overturn the moratorium. “I don’t think we should rule things out simply because it’s unfashionable to talk about them,” Dutton said on Monday. But amid a reduction in new nuclear projects globally, Kean poured cold water on the push by his Coalition colleagues in Canberra on Wednesday, saying pursuing nuclear energy generation in Australia was currently a “fantasy”. While conceding nuclear “may have a role to play in our energy system in the future”, Kean said he hoped for a role for emerging nuclear technologies – such as small modular reactors – but that they would not help address rising energy costs in the short to medium term. Kean referred to the UK government’s underwriting of the construction of the Hinkley Point C station to the tune of about $300 a megawatt-hour, which he said was “three times more expensive than the current electricity bills at the height that we’re paying right now”. He said the cost and timeline of new nuclear energy meant it was not realistic to consider it as an option. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Not only that, they started the build of [Hinkley Point C station] in around 2008,” he said. “It’s now 2022 and it still hasn’t been turned on, so we can’t wait 20 years to chase some fantasy, which is large-scale nuclear. “What we need to do is focus on things that are going to lower household bills today and set us up for more prosperity in the future.” In 2019 the former federal Coalition government held a parliamentary inquiry into the role of nuclear. Chaired by the new shadow climate change and energy minister, Ted O’Brien, it recommended the government consider small modular reactors, which produce less energy but, proponents say, would be easier to keep safe. But many small nuclear reactor proposals overseas have been beset by problems , and Kean said that two of the firms pushing the use of the technology – Rolls-Royce and US firm NuScale – wouldn’t have prototypes ready for construction until the next decade. “So people talking about nuclear as an asset to our energy challenges right now are literally chasing unicorns,” Kean said. “This is a fantasy, which is not ready at the moment. But who knows, at some time in the future, we may crack the code of small nuclear reactors and that could play a role in our energy mix. “But right now, we are focusing on the things that we know work [and] that we know are going to drive down household bills and that’s why we’ve got our energy roadmap here in NSW to roll out solar, wind [and] pumped hydro storage with transmission lines. Because we know that that’s the best way to lower household bills to keep the lights on and to deliver clean, reliable electricity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/15/fukushima-japan-insists-release-of-treated-water-is-safe-nuclear-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-15T01:00:02Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: Japan insists release of 1.3m tonnes of ‘treated’ water is safe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/15/fukushima-japan-insists-release-of-treated-water-is-safe-nuclear-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/15/fukushima-japan-insists-release-of-treated-water-is-safe-nuclear-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima: Japan insists release of 1.3m tonnes of ‘treated’ water is safe","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Almost 12 years have passed since the strongest earthquake in Japan’s recorded history resulted in a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along its north-east coast. As the country prepares to mark the 11 March anniversary, one of the disaster’s most troubling legacies is about to come into full view with the release of more than 1m tonnes of “treated” water from the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The tsunami knocked out the plant’s backup electricity supply, leading to meltdowns in three of its reactors, in the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl 25 years earlier. Much has changed since the Guardian’s first visit to the plant in 2012, when the cleanup had barely begun and visitors were required to wear protective clothing and full-face masks. Atmospheric radiation levels have dropped, damaged reactor buildings have been reinforced and robots have identified melted fuel in the basements. But as the Guardian learned on a recent visit, progress on decommissioning – a process that could take four decades – is being held up by the accumulation of huge quantities of water that is used to cool the damaged reactor cores. Now, 1.3m tonnes of water – enough to fill about 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools – is being stored in 1,000 tanks that cover huge swathes of the complex. And space is running out. Two steel pillars protruding from the sea a kilometre from the shore mark the spot where, later this year, the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power [Tepco], plans to begin releasing the water into the Pacific Ocean, in the most controversial step in the Fukushima Daiichi cleanup to date. The decision comes more than two years after Japan’s government approved the release of the water, which is treated using on-site technology to remove most radioactive materials. But the water still contains tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is technically difficult to separate from water. The discharge, which is due to begin in the spring or summer, will take place in defiance of local fishing communities, who say it will destroy more than a decade of work to rebuild their industry. Neighbouring countries have also voiced opposition. The government and Tepco claim the environmental and health impacts will be negligible because the treated water will be released gradually after it has been diluted by large amounts of seawater. The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. Tepco and government officials who guided a small group of journalists around Fukushima Daiichi this month insisted the science supports their plans to pump the “treated” water – they object to media reports describing it as contaminated – into the ocean. The water will be treated and, if necessary, treated again until the concentration of radionuclides other than tritium have fallen below government limits, said Hikaru Kuroda, a Tepco official overseeing the decontamination and decommissioning of Fukushima Daiichi. “By the time the liquid is diluted with seawater, tritium levels will be at less than 1,500 becquerels per litre, or 1/40th of the government standard for discharging water into the environment,” he said. “We will have contaminated water on the site for as long as we have to cool the reactor basements. And we will release the water very slowly to begin with, so we could be looking at something like 20 to 30 years to complete the process.” The fiercest opposition has come from Fukushima’s fishers, who say releasing the water risks destroying their livelihoods because consumers will shun their catch and send prices plummeting. “Even though it is safe, it could still harm sales of Fukushima seafood and lower prices, which is what happened 12 years ago,” conceded Junichi Matsumoto, Tepco’s chief officer for the management of treated water. “We know fishing communities are worried … that’s why we and the government are working on addressing the potential reputational damage.” The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its food safety standards are among the strictest in the world. The government-set upper limit for radioactive caesium in ordinary foodstuffs such as meat and vegetables is 100 becquerels a kilogram, compared with 1,250Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200Bq/kg in the US. While officials attempt to reassure the public and other countries that Fukushima produce is safe for consumers, Tepco and the government have embarked on a PR offensive, holding regular briefings on the water discharge for Tokyo-based diplomats and journalists, and running ads on TV, in newspapers and online. “We take other countries’ concerns seriously, which is why we are using every possible opportunity to explain the discharge plan to them,” said Ayako Ogino, a foreign ministry official. “We have made a commitment to discharge the water without harming the environment or human health. To describe the water as contaminated is erroneous, as it implies that it will harm the environment.” The campaign has had mixed results. South Korea and China have voiced opposition to the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) said recently it had “grave concerns”. Environmental groups have challenged the Japanese government’s claims that the water will not affect marine life or human health, while the US National Association of Marine Laboratories has pointed to a lack of adequate and accurate scientific data to support its reassurances on safety. The water release plan received a boost this month, however, when Micronesia, a member of the PIF, dropped its opposition to the water discharge. Its president, David Panuelo, said in Tokyo that his country was “no longer fearful or concerned about this issue now as we trust in Japan’s intention and technological capabilities in not harming our shared oceanic interests”. Japanese officials have ruled out other options, including long-term storage underground or evaporation, and insist nothing will stand in the way of the discharge plans. “The biggest obstacle to decommissioning Fukushima Daiichi is the debris [inside the reactors],” said Atsushi Wakui, a nuclear accident official at the economy, trade and industry ministry. “Securing the site so we can begin removing the melted fuel is absolutely essential, and that means urgently addressing the water problem. There are more than 1,000 tanks of water here, and they need to go.” • This article was amended on 20 February 2023 to clarify that concentrations of radionuclides other than tritium will be treated and, if necessary, retreated until they have fallen below government limits."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/14/uk-buys-option-to-take-20-stake-in-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-14T15:46:12Z","webTitle":"UK buys option to take 20% stake in Sizewell C nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/14/uk-buys-option-to-take-20-stake-in-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/14/uk-buys-option-to-take-20-stake-in-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"headline":"UK buys option to take 20% stake in Sizewell C nuclear power plant","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The government has bought an option to take a 20% stake in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in a move that could ease China’s state nuclear company out of the project. Ministers took a £100m option to invest in Sizewell C’s holding company in January and said on Tuesday it would convert that into equity if the project reaches a final investment decision. The venture on the Suffolk coast is jointly owned by EDF and China General Nuclear Power. The government is understood to be keen to remove CGN from the project amid concerns over China’s involvement in critical UK infrastructure. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, set out the taxpayer-funded financing model for Sizewell C and future projects on Tuesday. The strategy the government plans to use – a regulated asset base model – is commonplace in infrastructure projects and involves taxpayers taking on risk alongside private investors. The government is attempting to inject urgency into a notoriously slow-moving industry amid a drive to boost Britain’s domestic energy supplies. In April Boris Johnson set out plans to approve up to eight reactors by the end of the decade. A decision on whether to grant Sizewell C planning consent was last month delayed until 8 July. Research by the University of Greenwich Business School seen by the Guardian last month showed the project could cost UK taxpayers more than double government estimates and take five years longer to build. Details of the financing model released by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy failed to list the cost to consumers or the return on government investment. The government said Kwarteng was “satisfied” that the project would represent value for money. Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “It’s outrageous that ministers are hiding the cost to electricity bill payers and the public purse of Sizewell C, while claiming to be transparent. By redacting the finances, it is impossible to know if the secretary of state’s judgment on value for money is sound.” Sizewell C will sit in a new company that will qualify for a government bailout if it goes bust. EDF’s Hinkley Point C plant has had significant delays and rising costs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-02T00:01:00Z","webTitle":"£50m fund will boost UK nuclear fuel projects, ministers say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jan/02/50m-fund-will-boost-uk-nuclear-fuel-projects-ministers-say","fields":{"headline":"£50m fund will boost UK nuclear fuel projects, ministers say","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A £50m nuclear fuel fund to bolster production in the UK and support development of alternatives to Russian supply opens for applications on Monday, the business department has announced. The fund forms part of a nuclear fuel investment package of up to £75m, of which up to £13m has already been awarded to the nuclear fuel fabricators Westinghouse in Preston, helping the company develop conversion capability for reprocessed uranium and freshly mined uranium. Uranium conversion is an important stage in the nuclear fuel cycle. The funding is designed to create capability to convert recycled uranium in the UK that is not currently available outside Russia. As well as strengthening UK energy security, ministers hope it will also open up new export opportunities. G7 leaders agreed in June to take collective action to reduce reliance on civil nuclear and related goods from Russia, including diversifying their supplies of uranium and nuclear fuel production capability. Russia owns about 20% of global uranium conversion capacity and 40% of enrichment capacity. Graham Stuart, the energy and climate minister, said: “Record high global gas prices, caused by Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, have highlighted the need for more homegrown renewable energy, but also UK-generated nuclear power – building more plants, and developing domestic fuel capability. “This investment package will strengthen the UK’s energy security, by ensuring access to a safe and secure supply of UK-produced fuel to power the UK nuclear fleet of today and tomorrow – squeezing out Russian influence, while creating more UK jobs and export opportunities.” Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: “Having the sovereign capability to manufacture next-generation nuclear fuels for advanced reactors of the future is vital for energy security and net zero.” The £50m fund will support projects such as fuel supply options for light water reactors, including future small modular reactors. It will also look to support projects producing new fuel types that will be needed to supply advanced modular reactors, likely to be in operation from the 2030s, such as high-assay low-enriched uranium. The news comes after the government confirmed in late November that the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk will go ahead, backing the scheme with an investment of nearly £700m that will end China’s controversial involvement."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T19:15:02Z","webTitle":"Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: everything you need to know","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-everything-you-need-to-know","fields":{"headline":"Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: everything you need to know","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"What is the significance of this power plant? The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, built between 1984 and 1995, is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and the ninth largest in the world. It has six reactors, each generating 950MW, and a total output of 5,700MW, enough energy for roughly 4m homes. In normal times it produces one-fifth of Ukraine’s electricity and almost half the energy generated by the country’s nuclear power facilities. The plant is located in south-east Ukraine in Enerhodar on the banks of the Kakhovka reservoir on the Dnieper river. It is about 200km from the contested Donbas region and 550km south-east of Kyiv. What happened on Friday morning? A fire broke out in a training building outside the plant in the early hours of Friday, after being shelled by Russian forces, Ukrainian authorities said. The first report came from an employee at the plant, who posted on Telegram that Russian forces had fired on the facility and there was “a real threat of nuclear danger at the largest nuclear power plant in Europe”. Ukraine’s foreign minister confirmed the reports at 2.30am, tweeting that the Russian army was “firing from all sides upon Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. Fire has already broke out.” He called for an immediate ceasefire to allow firefighters to control the blaze. A short time later, the Ukrainian State Emergency Service reported that radiation at the plant was “within normal limits” and the fire conditions at the plant were “normal”. It reported that the fire was in a building outside the power plant. They later reported that the third power unit at the plant was disconnected at 2.26am, leaving just one of the plant’s six units, unit four, still operating. Early reports of the incident at the power plant sent financial markets in Asia spiralling, with stocks tumbling and oil prices surging further. Is there a radiation threat? Ukrainian authorities on Friday morning said the facility was secured and “nuclear safety is now guaranteed”. Earlier, the International Atomic Energy Agency said the Ukraine regulator told the agency that there was “no change reported in radiation levels at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant site”. The US also said their latest information showed no indication of elevated radiation levels at the plant. The US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said the reactors “are protected by robust containment structures and reactors are being safely shut down”. Russia has already captured the defunct Chernobyl plant, 100km north of Kyiv. Some analysts noted the Zaporizhzhia plant is of a different and safer type to Chernobyl, which was the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. The chances of explosion, nuclear meltdown or radioactive release are low, said Tony Irwin, an honorary associate professor at the Australian National University. Irwin, who operated nuclear power plants in the UK for three decades, is a former manager of the open-pool Australian lightwater (OPAL) reactor, Australia’s only nuclear reactor. He said the pressurised water reactors were “a lot safer” than the reactors at Chernobyl, and did not appear to be damaged yet. The reactors have large concrete containments and built-in fire protection systems, he said, adding: “Obviously, it’s not a good idea if you start shooting massive missiles at reactors,” he said. “The PWR type is a much safer sort of reactor, because it’s a two-circuit design reactor. The water that keeps the reactor cool is on a separate circuit to the second one, which actually supplies the power to the turbine and the outside.” “These reactors have back-up emergency cooling systems as well. In addition to the normal reactor cooling, they’ve got a passive system, they’ve got high-pressure injection systems, they’ve got low-pressure injection systems.” • This article was amended on 4 March 2022. Tony Irwin was referring to the concrete containments, not “contaminants” of the PWR reactors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-20T22:30:08Z","webTitle":"PM to chair roundtable on boosting UK’s nuclear power output","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/20/pm-to-chair-roundtable-on-boosting-uks-nuclear-power-output","fields":{"headline":"PM to chair roundtable on boosting UK’s nuclear power output","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson will chair a meeting on how to increase the UK’s nuclear power output on Monday, as he prepares to publish his energy security strategy this month amid soaring prices. The prime minister will discuss domestic nuclear projects with leaders from the nuclear industry at a roundtable meeting at Downing Street, No 10 said. Johnson is expected to publish the government’s energy security strategy later in March, against a backdrop of rocketing energy bills, which were already creating a cost of living crisis even before Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine led ministers to pledge to phase out Russian energy. The UK generated less than half (43%) of its electricity from renewable sources in 2020, and gas-fired power plants still play a significant role, with Britain reliant on gas for heating as well as electricity. Nuclear power plants currently provide about a sixth of the UK’s electricity. Johnson has previously announced that he intends to remove fossil fuels from UK electricity generation by 2035, and has also argued that the country should invest in more domestic nuclear and renewable energy in order to become more self-sufficient. No 10 officials said topics expected to be discussed at the roundtable meeting include how government and industry can work together to remove barriers and progress future nuclear projects in the UK more quickly and cheaply. Downing Street added that nuclear power is a “safe, clean and reliable energy source”. Last November, the government agreed to invest in a new generation of mini-nuclear reactors, being developed by engineering firm Rolls-Royce. Ministers hope that these small modular reactors, or SMRs, will be quicker and cheaper to build than traditional large-scale nuclear reactors – such as the Hinkley Point C project – which pose considerable construction risks and are often beset by spiralling costs and delays. Johnson told Conservative members at the party’s spring conference in Blackpool over the weekend that the government was going to place some “big bets on nuclear power”, including backing SMRs and larger projects. However, some environmental experts have raised concerns over how to safely dispose of nuclear waste after the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Labour has said it supports building more nuclear sites, and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves called on Sunday for ministers to “get on with the investment in new nuclear”, as well as renewable energy. Johnson is also due to meet executives from the wind sector in the coming days as he looks to bolster domestic energy sources from all available quarters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-18T06:40:08Z","webTitle":"Fukushima: court upholds acquittals of three Tepco executives over disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/18/fukushima-court-upholds-acquittals-of-three-tepco-executives-over-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima: court upholds acquittals of three Tepco executives over disaster","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Three former executives from the company that operates the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have had their not-guilty verdicts upheld by a court in Japan, dealing a blow to campaigners demanding the firm take legal responsibility for the disaster in March 2011. The Tokyo high court on Wednesday cleared Tsunehisa Katsumata, the former chairman of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), along with former vice-presidents Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, of professional negligence resulting in death. The court said the defendants could not have predicted the massive tsunami that crippled the power plant and triggered the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl in 1986. The three men were indicted in 2016 for allegedly failing to take measures to defend the plant against tsunamis, resulting in the deaths of 44 people, including elderly patients at a hospital, who had to be evacuated after the disaster. The Fukushima Daiichi plant, on Japan’s north-eastern coast, was hit by a massive tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the strongest in Japan’s recorded history. More than 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but no one was recorded as having been directly killed by the nuclear meltdowns, which caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby – some of whom have only recently been given permission to return to their homes. Wednesday’s ruling affirmed a similar verdict delivered by the Tokyo district court in September 2019. The trial focused on whether the former executives should have foreseen the massive tsunami and taken extra precautions, such as constructing a bigger seawall, to prevent a catastrophe. A government evaluation of earthquake risks published in 2002 estimated that tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres (51ft) in height could strike Fukushima Daiichi. The findings were passed on to Tepco in 2008 – three years before the disaster when a 14-metre wave struck, the Kyodo news agency said. Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck the plant almost 12 years ago, and that it had done everything possible to protect it. The original district court ruling, however, cast doubt on the credibility of the government’s evaluation, saying the defendants “could not have logically predicted tsunami waves over 10 metres in height”, Kyodo reported. Although they have twice been acquitted in the only criminal case against Tepco executives arising from the disaster, a separate verdict in July in a civil case against the same three men and Tepco’s former president, Masataka Shimizu, ordered them to pay ¥13.32tn (£80bn at the time) for failing to prevent the disaster. In contrast to Wednesday’s decision, the court said the government’s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures. While that ruling – the first to find Tepco executives liable for damage resulting from the disaster – carries symbolic significance, lawyers have said the defendants do not have the means to pay the sum, believed to be the largest ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan. Media reports said they would be expected to pay as much as their assets allowed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/jun/05/keir-starmer-local-communities-jamie-driscoll-north-tyne-mayor","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-05T16:11:40Z","webTitle":"Keir Starmer says he wants to empower local communities.

The Jamie Driscoll affair suggests otherwise","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"It’s what they do, not what they say. All opposition leaders are localists until it matters. Keir Starmer said in January he wanted to “take back control” for local communities. The Labour leader wants them to have more say over jobs, transport, energy, climate change, housing, culture, childcare and finance. He wants to liberate what is now recognised as the most centralised state in Europe. So why, now, has the Labour leader decided that the people of the North of Tyne area will not be permitted to reselect their current mayor, Jamie Driscoll, to stand for Labour at the next election? Why did he agree in March that his predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, should not be reselected as MP for Islington North? Whatever the perceived misdeeds of these two politicians, surely these are matters for their respective communities to decide on. Come to that, I notice in the past few weeks that, despite his devolution speech, Starmer wants no devolution of power over council tax rises, local housing decisions or the siting of wind turbines, among other things. Nor will he tolerate any nonsense from Scottish people about “taking back control” of Scotland. He may want to move on “from slogans to solutions”, but whose solutions? Starmer, his advisers tell us, wants to show he is in charge. He wants to alter Labour’s chemistry, changing the party from a regional and ideological coalition that includes the left and the centre into a personal hegemony. He wants to cleanse it of any association with the eras of Ed Miliband or Jeremy Corbyn and restore the firm hand of Blairism. As Tony Blair saw off Militant and clause IV when he was party leader, so today Starmer is seeing off those with whom he disagrees by vetting candidates’ lists. Nothing in democratic politics is as wayward as the transition from opposition to power. The first requires making wild promises to an electorate, the second requires refashioning them in the harsh reality of high office. Starmer is right to see Blair’s leadership of Labour in the years 1995-97 as possibly the most successful example of a political opposition since the 1940s. He delivered a genuinely reformed Labour party, stripped of its old ideological baggage, “new” and fit for government. In power, Blair’s stance on localism was much the same as Starmer’s is now. He saw elected mayors as a way of sidestepping local Labour old guards and reviving democracy. But he allowed John Prescott to stall their modest introduction and Gordon Brown at the Treasury to limit their power. Blair then maintained Margaret Thatcher’s clampdown on local finance, in much the same way that David Cameron later took control of planning and housing targets. All power centralises, but when a constitution fails to protect local democracy, power centralises absolutely. Starmer’s January speech was certainly passionate. He promised a bill in his first term to instigate “a decade of national renewal”. He would “devolve sweeping powers to local communities” and grant a new “right to request powers” beyond even those he had listed. This was to be “no catchphrase interchange” but a recognition of the desire of communities “to stand on their own feet”. Those who have laboured long in this vineyard find such phrases desperately tired. Though Starmer was all for “communities” – a word that might imply Women’s Institutes, local fetes and Dad’s Army – he never mentioned local government or local councils, as if these were the bogey words of localism. In a democracy there should be no distinction between communities and democratic institutions, yet the Labour leader did not seem capable of admitting this. So could communities really regain control of their children’s education, as they did before Thatcher? Could they fix business rates and domestic taxes to meet their description of local need? Could they recover power over local development, so communities could decide how their area looked and changed? All these powers have passed from local councils to London in the past 30 years. Will Starmer really return them? In 2019 the Institute for Public Policy Research concluded its study of regional wealth across Europe. It found that Britain had the widest division between its capital and its regions of any comparable country. This disparity appeared in the amounts that people earned, the levels of economic productivity, the availability of local services – pretty much everything. A senior Treasury official admitted recently to the Institute for Government that this was probably “the most centralised government in the developed world”. It is two years since the all-party parliamentary group on devolution reported on lockdown. The report concluded that when lockdown decisions were delegated to devolved nations and local councils, they had proven “more flexible, effective and responsive” than those decided in Whitehall. The reason was simple: “the widest range of social and economic factors are often only visible to leaders rooted in the local community”. Big national challenges needed “place-based responses”. It apparently takes a parliamentary group to discover this. We might hope that Starmer got the point, and that he really does want to “stop power being hoarded by Westminster”. The trouble is that is what they all say, until they are doing the hoarding. Even before he finds himself in Downing Street, Starmer cannot bring himself to respect the local diversity that has long been Labour’s strength. He cannot allow his party to let the people of the north-east choose who it is they want to lead them. It is a very bad start.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant’s silhouette – with its two fat cooling towers and the row of six squat blocks – has become globally familiar since it was dubbed the most dangerous place on Earth: six nuclear reactors on the frontline of a catastrophic war. On a fairly typical night last week, the Russians on the left bank of the river fired 40 shells and rockets into Nikopol, a town on the Ukrainian-held right bank, falling on its rows of krushchevky, five-storey blocks of flats built for factory workers in the 1960s and named after the Soviet leader of the time. After 10 months of war, the blocks are half empty, so there are fewer people to kill. The only reported casualty on this particular night was a 65-year-old man who was taken to hospital, and whose flat now afforded such a comprehensive view of the power plant. By the next morning, the repairs had already begun. An electrician restored power to the rest of the building, and two men were in the remains of the apartment itself, sweeping up and putting chipboard in place of absent walls. There were four loud bangs as the Ukrainian army guns on the nearby riverbank opened fire on Russian positions and, a few minutes later, Nikopol’s air sirens sounded in anticipation of a Russian response, though none was forthcoming that morning. The basements of the krushchevky have been turned into shelters with beds and school desks but most of the remaining population are so inured to bombardment, they just carry on with their day. The Ukrainians insist they are extremely careful about what they shoot at, even when they receive fire from the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia plant. On Thursday, the Ukrainian nuclear power company, Energoatom, accused Russia of bringing Grad multiple launch rocket systems near reactor number 6, which is near the area of where spent nuclear fuel is kept. The likely aim, Energoatom alleged, was to shell Nikopol and the nearby town of Marzanets, using their position as cover. The walls of the reactors are thick enough to withstand artillery fire, but a direct hit on the spent fuel containers could well lead to the release of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Since seizing control of the power station in March, the Russians have begun building a concrete shelter over the spent fuel, but Ukrainian officials say it is being done without following the normal international safety protocols. Earlier in the week, Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine of “nuclear terrorism”, saying its armed forces had fired 33 large calibre shells at the Zaporizhzhia plant over the previous two weeks. The most recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has four inspectors at the Russian-occupied site, said last Friday there had been no shelling of the plant since 20 November, although artillery fire had landed in the vicinity. Petro Kotin, Energoatom’s president, claims that the bombardments of the area around the nuclear reactors are false flag attacks carried out by Russian occupation forces. “They have two special trucks, which we know have mortars inside, which go into the forest and each time they go there, there is shelling around the plant,” Kotin told the Guardian. Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Enerhodar, the town next to the nuclear plant that is home to its workers, claimed there was additional evidence that the shelling was coming from the Russian side. “You can hear the outgoing bang of the shooting and then the two or three seconds later the shell lands, so it is coming from very close and there aren’t any Ukrainian forces that close,” Orlov said in an interview on the Ukrainian side of the lines in the city of Zaporizhzhia where he continues his duties in exile. “My personal opinion is that this is to scare the local population so the Russians can tell them: “You see – we’re protecting you and it’s the Ukrainians who are shelling you.” It was not possible to verify Kotin and Orlov’s accounts of the shelling, or the counter-claims from Moscow. Satellite imagery however, has confirmed that the Russian army is storing military equipment inside the plant. The IAEA inspectors on site could theoretically determine the trajectory of incoming rockets or shells but such detective work is not within their mandate. The agency is negotiating the creation of a security no-fire zone around the reactors, but Kyiv is insisting Russia must first withdraw all its weapons and armour from the power station, something Moscow has not so far agreed to. Meanwhile there is a parallel safety threat from within the plant itself: the steady attrition of its workforce over the 10 months of the conflict. Many key workers have left because of the danger to their families or because they refused to work for the Russians. Of the 11,000-strong workforce before the full-scale invasion, just 4,000 are left. In an attempt to stop the exodus, the Russians have circulated lists of plant staff to all military checkpoints in the region with orders they are not be allowed to leave, but it has been too late to stop a major outflow. “In some cases, there’s only three people to cover a seven or eight-person shift,” Orlov said. “People don’t have enough rest. It causes exhaustion.” Operating under armed occupation adds to the stress. The workers still at the plant are under constant pressure to sign contracts with Rosatom, the Russian energy company, signifying acceptance of Moscow’s control. “They take the workers aside one at a time, and the first question they ask is about the whereabouts of their families. They put pressure on through their family. One worker was questioned for eight hours,” Oleksii Melynchuk, a former worker at the nuclear power plant, said. Despite that pressure, he said, only about 10% of the staff at the plant have signed Rosatom contracts. In recent days, the Russians have deactivated the electronic passes of some of the workers who have refused to sign, reducing the pool of available reactor operators even further. Melynchuk said there were just enough staff left to maintain the plant in its current state of suspended animation, with all the reactors shut down, and two of them deliberately kept hot, to provide heating for Enerhodar. But keeping reactors in this hot standby mode is a difficult and delicate process, adding to the burden on the operators. The situation could get worse still. The Zaporizhzhia plant is currently connected to the Ukrainian grid, but there have been times the transmission lines have been brought down by shelling, forcing the power station to fall back on diesel generators to keep the cooling system running and prevent the reactor vessel from meltdown. If the connection to the grid was severed again, it would add to the pressure on the overstretched workforce and on the generators, which were only designed as a temporary backup. They will need maintenance and no one knows how much diesel fuel the plant has left. Once the diesel generators failed, meltdown would begin in a matter of hours. “Those remaining at their posts are doing impossible things to keep the plant safe. They have proved their professionalism to the entire world,” Melynchuk said. “Even without the occupation, it would be very hard physically and psychologically to operate the station with the current staffing levels. But if you add the pressure from the occupiers, then it just gets harder.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-325-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-14T06:24:44Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 325 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-325-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-325-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 325 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The United Nations’ nuclear watchdog announced it would boost its presence in Ukraine to help prevent a nuclear accident during the conflict. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it would soon have a permanent presence at all five of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Currently, only the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia plant, which is near the frontline, has a permanent IAEA presence. Ukraine has denied Russia’s claim that Putin’s forces have captured Soledar. On Friday, Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had taken full control of the salt mining town. Ukrainian officials denied the Russian claim, suggesting they were still holding on and counterattacking, with the Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi reporting “ongoing battles”. Soledar is ‘Verdun for 21st century’ according to a top Ukraine official. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president of Ukraine, likened the fight for the town to the longest and bloodiest battle in the first world war. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday that Ukrainian forces defending Bakhmut and Soledar in the east would be armed with everything they need to keep Russian troops at bay in some of the bloodiest fighting of the war. Hundreds of civilians remain trapped in Soledar, Ukraine has said. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk, told Ukrainian state TV that 559 civilians remained in Soledar, including 15 children, and could not be evacuated. Satellite images taken by Maxar Technologies show the destruction inflicted upon Soledar. The Guardian has a series of striking images from inside the eastern Ukrainian town. Ukraine is confident Britain will announce it plans to send about 10 Challenger 2 tanks to Kyiv shortly, a move it hopes will help Germany finally allow its Leopard 2s to be re-exported to the embattled country. A formal announcement is anticipated on Monday but Ukrainian sources indicated they understood that Britain had already decided in favour. Germany will continue to “weigh every step carefully” and consult with its allies on further weapons deliveries to Ukraine, chancellor Olaf Scholz has said. The German leader is facing mounting pressure to approve German-made battle tanks for Kyiv. Scholz said Berlin would keep its “leading position” as one of Kyiv’s top supporters but said he had no intention of being rushed on “such serious things that have to do with peace and war, with the security of our country and of Europe”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T14:07:46Z","webTitle":"How safe are Ukraine’s nuclear power plants amid Russian attacks?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia","fields":{"headline":"How safe are Ukraine’s nuclear power plants amid Russian attacks?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The attack of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – has triggered international concern about the safety of the country’s facilities. Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy – it has four main power plants, with 15 reactors, generating about half its electricity. On Friday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said artillery fire at the plant could have caused destruction equal to “six Chernobyls”. For now, say experts, the immediate danger from the attack appears to be low, with Russia having as much to lose as anyone. “If there’s going to be a major nuclear incident it’s because something deliberately is being done,” said Tom Scott, professor in materials at the University of Bristol. “Surely nobody is going to be that stupid. It doesn’t benefit anyone. The wind is blowing towards Russia at the moment.” Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the IAEA UN nuclear watchdog, confirmed on Friday that radiation levels at the site had remained normal, that all safety systems at the plant were unaffected and that the reactors themselves had not been breached. The projectile had hit an administrative building some distance away within the site. Of the six reactors at the site, five are in safety mode, with one unit operating at 60% capacity. Reports from the site suggest that staff have continued to control operations. While Zelenskiy was quick to highlight the potential for a Chernobyl-scale incident, the technology at Zaporizhzhia is quite different. The Chernobyl reactor used graphite to keep the nuclear reaction under control and the disaster was caused by a graphite fire. The Zaporizhzhia plant – and those at Ukraine’s other main plants, Khmelnitski, Rovno and South Ukraine – has pressurised water reactors, a more modern type that do not involve graphite. So a fire such as the one at Chernobyl will not occur. Pressurised water reactors have a steel vessel at their centre, like a giant pressure cooker with 20cm-thick walls. This contains the nuclear fuel and radioactive products from the nuclear reaction and is designed to withstand damage from events such as earthquakes and aeroplane crashes, although not specifically artillery shells. The inner vessel is surrounded by a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building – Chernobyl did not have this. For a Chernobyl-level event, both the pressure vessel and concrete bioshield would need to be breached and this would probably require intentional targeting with huge explosives. Nevertheless, there is deep concern that any attack aimed at taking control of a facility could still lead to a nuclear incident. Experts are especially alarmed that an internationally recognised principle – ensuring the physical integrity of civil nuclear plants – has been disregarded. “It’s very clear that this is against the Geneva conventions,” said Scott. “It is a flagrant breach of international laws and agreements to do this.” Grossi, who says the situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging”, said on Friday that he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, with the aim of agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. A concerning worst-case scenario, Scott said, was damage to the cooling capability at Zaporizhzhia or one of Ukraine’s other facilities. Even after reactors are switched off, they need continual cooling for several weeks in order to remove residual heat from the core. The cooling systems rely on diesel generators, so any damage to these – or if fuel was siphoned off for other purposes – could cause an incident similar to that at Fukushima, where the plant’s power failed after a tsunami. That could result in the reactors overheating and residual water turning into steam, which could melt the fuel inside the reactor and cause the release of radiation into the atmosphere. There is also a concern about spent fuel storage facilities being disturbed. After fuel is taken out of a reactor core, it is put into spent pool ponds for a year or more to physically cool down before being transferred to long-term, more secure storage."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-02T14:21:08Z","webTitle":"Nuclear is not the answer to the UK’s energy requirements | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/02/nuclear-is-not-the-answer-to-the-uks-energy-requirements","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear is not the answer to the UK’s energy requirements","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"In his letter (22 December), Tom Smith describes the problems of storing the radioactive waste that is being produced by the UK nuclear reactors, and says that we need more honesty about these issues. The latter is also true of other problems with “new nuclear build”. Take, for example, the proposed Sizewell C reactor on the east coast. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has estimated that extreme “sea level events” could occur “at least once per year at many locations by 2050”. Sizewell C will be built near the sea on marshland. One engineer has estimated that the land where the reactor would be built will turn into a promontory encircled by the sea. Clearly the reactor site could be flooded. Then there is the problem of obtaining uranium, which is currently the fuel for the nuclear reactors. The UK has to import uranium from across the world. It is mainly mined on the land of Indigenous people – in the US, in Canada, in Australia and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The miners and their families have suffered years of ill health and even death from proximity to uranium. At the same time, having to import uranium means that this is not an independent source of energy for the UK. The government and the opposition have completely ignored all warnings; they go doggedly on, supporting the construction of the new nuclear reactor at Sizewell and considering plans to build others. But nuclear is not the answer to the UK’s energy requirements. Apart from anything else, it is vastly expensive. The money it swallows should be put into developing genuine sustainable energy: tidal, wind and solar.

Amid deep divisions among senior Conservatives, the strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net-zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The prime minister will launch the plan on Thursday, after a period of intense political wrangling set against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has convulsed energy markets and sent home energy bills rocketing. Whitehall sources said rows over the strategy between No 10, the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) continued right up until the eve of publication, with an insider describing the process as “chaos”. The cabinet eventually agreed that atomic energy would form the backbone of the strategy, and up to eight new reactors are planned. Targets for offshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic low-carbon energy sources by 2030. But the plans risk infuriating environmental campaigners, after the opportunity to remove barriers to more onshore wind farms appeared to fall victim to Tory in-fighting, new North Sea drilling won the government’s blessing, and ministers appeared to open the door to fracking. Opposition parties were scathing about the strategy. Two former energy secretaries from Labour and the Liberal Democrats branded it “ludicrous” and “hopeless” for failing to expand onshore wind power or tackle energy efficiency. Ed Miliband, the Labour climate change secretary, said the energy relaunch was “in disarray” and would do nothing to help the millions of families facing an energy crisis now. “Boris Johnson has completely caved to his own backbenchers and now, ludicrously, his own energy strategy has failed on the sprint we needed on onshore wind and solar – the cheapest, cleanest forms of homegrown power,” he said. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and another former energy secretary, added: “The Conservatives’ failure to help people cut their bills with an urgent energy insulation programme, the failure to back super-cheap onshore wind and the failure to back properly new technologies like tidal power and hydrogen is a total betrayal of families and pensioners across the UK.” The energy strategy outlines a wide-ranging plan to boost domestic energy production through a range of power sources. They include: Increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW Offshore wind target raised from 40GW to 50GW (from 11GW today) Solar could grow five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035 An “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe Up to 10GW of hydrogen power by 2030 Johnson said the plan will “reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills”. “This plan comes in light of rising global energy prices, provoked by surging demand after the pandemic as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This will be central to weaning Britain off expensive fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile gas prices set by international markets we are unable to control, and boosting our diverse sources of homegrown energy for greater energy security in the long term.” While some renewable domestic energy sources won backing, the wind industry’s hopes of getting the green light to double onshore capacity to 30GW appeared to have fallen victim to opposition from within the Conservative party to new projects, particularly in England. Communities who live near planned new projects could be offered incentives, such as guaranteed lower energy bills, but the plan does not include targets for increased generation. Cabinet colleagues have been at odds over whether to reform planning laws to spur faster development of onshore windfarms, which can take as little as a year to build and start contributing to the grid, but were described by transport secretary Grant Shapps as an “eyesore” at the weekend. Shapps and chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris, a longstanding opponent of onshore wind, are among a group of MPs who have sought to thwart a major rollout in England, with Michael Gove and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng – whose brief includes energy – among those to have pushed back. The business department is also understood to have been thwarted by the Treasury in a plan to channel £300m of budget underspend into a rapid rollout of energy efficiency upgrades that could aid homeowners in bringing down their bills. Solar won significant backing from the government, which said planning rules could be relaxed to favour development on non-protected land, enabling capacity to increase up to fivefold, from 14GW to 70GW. The target for hydrogen power will be doubled to 10GW by 2030 “subject to affordability and value for money”. Overall, “clean” energy sources could provide up to 40,000 new jobs, reaching a total of 480,000 by 2030, the government will say. But alongside the push for renewables sit plans that will alarm opponents of further oil and gas exploitation. The British Geological Survey will conduct an “impartial” review of whether fracking for shale gas can proceed safely, a move likely to spark fury among environmental campaigners about the controversial technology, particularly after a moratorium was imposed on the process in 2019. New North Sea oil and gas projects are also likely to be accelerated, although the strategy sets out proposals to limit emissions as much as possible. Nuclear power forms the centrepiece of the energy strategy. Ministers expect to begin a competitive selection process as early as next year for a new round of nuclear projects, although tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury over the cost of new projects, which are expected to require government investment, have yet to be resolved. The target of producing 25% of Britain’s electricity from atomic energy is likely to require tens of billions of pounds of new investment from private companies, with the state providing guarantees under a new “regulated asset base” funding model. A £120m “Future Nuclear Enabling Fund” will be launched this month in the hope of kickstarting projects, while a new body called Great British Nuclear will oversee the plans. National Grid has predicted that peak electricity demand will hit 85GW by 2050, up from 60GW today, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. The government said it could approve up to eight new reactors to help reach a target of generating 24GW of the total from nuclear power plants, which typically have more than one reactor. Some of the increase can be achieved by extending the life of the Sizewell B reactor, while the Hinkley Point C project is due for completion in 2027 and Rolls-Royce has the government’s blessing for small reactors nicknamed “mini-nukes”. Major projects that have already been through some form of planning, such as Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey, have been singled out by the government as among the first to win support. The target also implies new plants at sites whose locations have already been approved but where no plans are under way, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire or Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted global discussion on how to reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled oil and gas, it appears to have cooled the government’s resolve to limit the UK’s own fossil fuel production. Drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea is at odds with the government’s own net-zero targets. The government will justify the plans by saying that local exploitation of hydrocarbons emits less carbon than importing supplies from elsewhere. Ministers have also commissioned a new study to examine safety concerns about fracking, which polls have shown is deeply unpopular with the public. • This article was amended on 7 April 2022. An earlier version said “targets for onshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030”. That should have referred to offshore wind and domestic low-carbon energy sources."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:20:57Z","webTitle":"Shelling of Zaporizhzhia is playing with fire, says UN nuclear chief, as blasts reported","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/20/shelling-of-zaporizhzhia-is-playing-with-fire-says-un-nuclear-chief-ukraine","fields":{"headline":"Shelling of Zaporizhzhia is playing with fire, says UN nuclear chief, as blasts reported","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UN nuclear energy watchdog has said the forces behind the shelling of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant are “playing with fire”, after a series of explosions shook the facility. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has experts based at Zaporizhzhia, reported on Sunday that powerful explosions had shaken the area on Saturday night and Sunday. It said its on-site experts saw some of the explosions from their windows. It reported more than a dozen blasts from apparent shelling, with damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but “none so far critical for nuclear safety”. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said the news was extremely disturbing and he called the explosions completely unacceptable. “Whoever is behind this, it must stop immediately. As I have said many times before, you’re playing with fire,” he said. According to the IAEA Twitter account, Grossi renewed his appeal to Ukraine and Russia to agree and implement a nuclear safety and security zone around the plant as soon as possible. Zaporizhzhia, in south-east Ukraine, is Europe’s largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since March, although its Ukrainian staff remain in place to run the facility. It has faced repeated shelling, raising fears of a nuclear disaster. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks. The plant’s six Soviet-designed water-cooled reactors are currently shut down, but there is a risk that nuclear fuel could overheat if the power that drives the cooling systems is shut. Shelling has frequently damaged the plant’s power supply. Russian officials claimed that Ukrainian forces were behind the latest attacks. “They are shelling not only yesterday but also today, they are shelling even now,” an adviser to the head of Russia’s nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom, Renat Karchaa, told the Russian state news agency Tass. He said there had been 15 aerial strikes, including one that hit a storage facility. Soon after the Russian accusations, Ukraine’s nuclear energy agency, Energoatom, said Russia was responsible for the shelling, which it said had resulted in 12 hits to Zaporizhzhia’s infrastructure. The company said on Telegram that the list of damaged equipment indicated that the attackers “targeted and disabled exactly the infrastructure that was necessary for the restart of 5th and 6th power units” and the restoration of power production for Ukrainian needs. Ukraine faces a collapse in its electricity supply after a relentless Russian bombing campaign targeted at power infrastructure. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has previously called for all troops to leave the plant so that it is under full control of Ukrainian nuclear workers. His government has called the attacks on the plant false-flag operations by Russia. Elsewhere in the Zaporizhzhia region, Russian forces shelled civilian infrastructure in about a dozen communities, destroying 30 homes, the Ukrainian presidential office said on Sunday. Ukraine’s defence ministry published figures claiming that 84,210 Russian soldiers had been “eliminated” since the war began, including 330 in the last 24 hours. Ukraine also claimed Russia had lost 2,886 tanks, 5,817 armoured vehicles and 278 military jets. Separately, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children have been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. Ukraine and Russia decline to publish their own military casualty figures, but earlier this month a senior US general estimated there had been “well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded”, and a similar number on the Ukrainian side. Meanwhile, Ukraine promised to investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops. Moscow has said videos circulating on social media show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said Ukrainian authorities would investigate the footage but that it was “very unlikely” the clips showed what Russia claimed, Associated Press reported. The UN’s human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has called for further investigation, which Stefanishyna said Ukraine had “no problem” with. On Sunday, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency said negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”. Mykhailo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given the series of major military victories achieved by Kyiv. “Any conspiracy theories about ‘surrender’ or west’s secret negotiations with Putin do not take into account ‘small detail’. Ukrainians,” he tweeted. “Ukraine will not kneel to Russians. It is not a matter of politics. It is a matter of our existence.” His statement follows recent US media reports that some senior US officials have privately told Kyiv to be open to negotiations with Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russia-launched-400-strikes-on-sunday-zelenskiy-says-un-to-inspect-zaporizhzhia-plant","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-21T18:48:34Z","webTitle":"Zelenskiy urges Nato to protect nuclear sites from ‘sabotage’ as Russia warns of risk of accident – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russia-launched-400-strikes-on-sunday-zelenskiy-says-un-to-inspect-zaporizhzhia-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russia-launched-400-strikes-on-sunday-zelenskiy-says-un-to-inspect-zaporizhzhia-plant","fields":{"headline":"Zelenskiy urges Nato to protect nuclear sites from ‘sabotage’ as Russia warns of risk of accident – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s nearly 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. Residents of the two southern regions have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed to be repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control, was rocked by shelling over the weekend, drawing condemnation from the UN nuclear watchdog which said such attacks risked a major disaster. The head of Russia’s state-run atomic energy agency, Rosatom, warned of the risk of a nuclear accident at the Zaporizhzhia plant. Alexei Likhachev accused Ukraine of being willing to “accept” a “small nuclear incident”, adding that “everything must be done so that no one has in their minds to encroach on the safety of the nuclear power plant.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to Nato members to guarantee the protection of his country’s nuclear power plants from “Russian sabotage”. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister, said the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant was a Russian tactic that aimed to disrupt power supplies and “freeze Ukrainians to death”. The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia plant on Monday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said the forces behind the shelling of the plant were “playing with fire”. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. WHO regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said its officials have identified four locations where Russian forces tortured detainees in Kherson city. It said Russian forces “set up pseudo-law enforcement agencies” in pre-trial detention centres and a police station before troops withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city earlier this month. Russian troops have been accused of burning bodies at a landfill on the edge of Kherson during their occupation of the region. Residents and workers at the site told the Guardian they saw Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a stench of burning flesh. The Kremlin said that it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. Ukraine denies the claims. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said there were no plans to call up more Russian soldiers to fight in Ukraine through a second round of mobilisation. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,” Zelenskiy said. Russian forces are constructing defensive positions partially staffed by poorly trained mobilised reservists around the Svatove sector in the Luhansk region in north-eastern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well as an influx of thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thank you for following, I’ll be back tomorrow. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has condemned the shelling of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In a statement after the call, Macron said other nuclear plants at Rovno and Khmelnitski as well as the Nova Kakhovka dam had also been targeted. He added that President Zelenskiy had thanked France for its continuous support for the Ukrainian army. The Ukrainian leader said he “stressed the need of demilitarisation” at the Zaporizhzhia facility, and said the pair “discussed cooperation on ensuring Ukraine’s energy stability, in particular, protecting the system from air attacks”. Here are some of the latest images we have received from the recently liberated city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine. Luxembourg has said it will send additional armoured vehicles to Ukraine, according to its defence minister, François Bausch. Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. Residents of the two southern regions, which were shelled regularly by Russian forces in the past months, have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, said Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk. The government would provide transportation, accommodation and medical care, she added. The evacuations come just over a week after Ukraine retook the city of Kherson – which remains close to the frontline – and areas around it. The liberation marked a major battlefield gain, while the evacuations highlight the difficulties Ukraine is facing after heavy Russian shelling of its power infrastructure as winter sets in. The war’s southern front has been the recent focus of efforts for both Russian and Ukrainian forces before Russia’s retreat from Kherson. More recently, however, Moscow appears to be building up forces and increasing its military efforts on the eastern Donbas front where the two sides have been locked in a bitter and inconclusive struggle for months, not least around the key town of Bakhmut. Read the full story here: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far” and called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to allow crucial supplies to be sent to all areas of Ukraine. The WHO has documented 703 attacks on health infrastructure since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, said the organisation’s regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge. In a speech in Kyiv, Kluge described such attacks as a “breach of international humanitarian law and the rules of war”. The attacks on health and energy infrastructure have left hundreds of hospitals and healthcare facilities “no longer fully operational, lacking fuel, water and electricity to meet basic needs”, he said. He said: This winter will be life-threatening for millions of people in Ukraine. The devastating energy crisis, the deepening mental health emergency, constraints on humanitarian access and the risk of viral infections will make this winter a formidable test for the Ukrainian health system and the Ukrainian people, but also for the world and its commitment to support Ukraine. He warned “cold weather can kill” as 10 million in Ukraine are without power in temperatures that are expected to drop to -20C in parts of the country. Ukraine’s health system is facing its darkest days in the war so far. Having endured more than 700 attacks, it is now also a victim of the energy crisis. He also called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. The WHO and its partners would be “ready to mobilise at a moment’s notice” to create routes to allow crucial supplies to be sent to areas that are hard to reach. He expressed particular concern for 17,000 patients in Donetsk, who he said may soon run out of critical antiretroviral drugs that keep them alive. Kluge added: This war must end, before the health system and the health of the Ukrainian nation are compromised any further. It’s 6pm in Kyiv.

The southern Ukrainian city of Nikopol was hit by Russian shelling overnight, according to city officials. The shelling reportedly hit a residential area injuring a 78-year-old man, the Kyiv Independent reports city governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, as saying.

Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong still here with all the latest developments from Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has appealed to Nato members to guarantee the protection of his country’s nuclear power plants from “Russian sabotage”. In a video address to Nato’s parliamentary assembly in Madrid, he said: All our nations are interested in not having any dangerous incidents at our nuclear facilities. He added: We all need guaranteed protection from Russian sabotage at nuclear facilities. Zelenskiy also called for new EU sanctions against Russia over what he said was its “policy of genocide” as its forces bomb civilian infrastructure. An interesting dispatch from Reuters news agency’s Gleb Garanich and Yuriy Kovalenko, reporting from the village of Horenka, near Kyiv. The piece reads: As they head into a cold winter, residents of a bombed-out Ukrainian village say they appreciate a warm bath in a mural painted by graffiti artist Banksy. The mural, showing a man scrubbing his back in a bathtub, is on the ground floor of what remains of an apartment block hit in a Russian attack in March in Horenka, northwest of Kyiv, once on the front line where Russia’s assault on the capital was halted. “For me, it means washing off all the dirt. The dirt of the Russian Federation ...,” Tetiana Reznychenko, 43, told Reuters as snow fell around her. “And this drawing makes me feel as if I have cleansed myself of the dirt that descended on us.” The mural is one of one of seven that Banksy has confirmed painting in Ukraine. Reznychenko said she had given Banksy’s team a mug of instant coffee in her apartment, as it was cold when the artist came to paint the mural. She has a wood stove in her apartment but no electricity, heating or running water as winter sets in. “Winter has begun, and we don’t know what will happen next. Firemen brought us non-drinking water ... but it will freeze unless we move it inside,” she said. Despite the problems, she and her neighbours remain defiant. “Ukrainians adapt to everything. No light? No problem. There are candles, there are alternative sources of electricity, there are power banks,” said neighbour Olena Kulynovich. “When the neighbours have electricity, we go to them, charge the phones and the power banks. No water? That’s OK. Even if the government doesn’t help, we managed to organise the delivery of water.” A Ukrainian serviceman kneels in front of a memorial dedicated to people who died in clashes with security forces, at the Independent Square in Kyiv, Ukraine, today. The landfill site on the edge of Kherson offers some visible hints here and there, among the piles of rubbish, to what locals and workers say happened in its recent past. Russian flags, uniforms and helmets emerge from the putrid mud, while hundreds of seagulls and dozens of stray dogs scavenge around. As the Russian occupation of the region was on its last legs over the summer, the site, once a mundane place where residents disposed of their rubbish, became a no-go area, according to Kherson’s inhabitants, fiercely sealed off by the invading forces from presumed prying eyes. The reason for the jittery secrecy, several residents and workers at the site told the Guardian, was that the occupying forces had a gruesome new purpose there: dumping the bodies of their fallen brethren, and then burning them. The residents report seeing Russian open trucks arriving to the site carrying black bags that were then set on fire, filling the air with a large cloud of smoke and a terrifying stench of burning flesh. They believe the Russians were disposing of the bodies of its soldiers killed during the heavy fighting of those summer days. “Every time our army shelled the Russians there, they moved the remains to the landfill and burned them,” says Iryna, 40, a Kherson resident. Read the full story here: Norway has said it will assist Ukraine with gas procurement for the coming winter, providing funding amounting to 2bn Norwegian crowns (£166m). The funds, part of a previously announced aid package of 10bn crowns, will go via the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In a statement, Norway’s finance minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum said: It is important to channel the support through an established, internationally recognised organisation, which will ensure effective and transparent use of the funding. The head of Russia’s state-run atomic energy agency, Rosatom, has warned of the risk of a nuclear accident at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Rosatom CEO, Alexei Likhachev, was cited by Interfax news agency as saying: The plant is at risk of a nuclear accident. We were in negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) all night. Rosatom has controlled the nuclear facility, Europe’s largest, since President Vladimir Putin ordered the formal seizure of the plant. Likhachev’s warning came amid renewed shelling of the Zaporizhzhia plant, following reports from the IAEA that powerful explosions had shaken the area on Saturday night and Sunday. More than a dozen blasts have been reported from apparent shelling, with damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but “none so far critical for nuclear safety”, the IAEA said. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks. Likhachev accused Ukraine of being willing to “accept” a “small nuclear incident”, adding: This will be a precedent that will forever change the course of history. Therefore, everything must be done so that no one has in their minds to encroach on the safety of the nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s prosecutor general office has said its officials have identified four locations where Russian forces tortured detainees in Kherson city before its troops withdrew from the southern Ukrainian city earlier this month. In an update posted on Facebook, it said officials had inspected “four premises” where Russian troops “illegally detained people and brutally tortured them”. It said Russian forces “set up pseudo-law enforcement agencies” in pre-trial detention centres and a police station in the captured city. The statement continued: Parts of rubber batons, a wooden bat, a device used by the Russians to torture civilians with electric shocks, an incandescent lamp and bullets from the walls were recovered. People in cells and basements were subjected to various methods of torture, physical and psychological violence. Inside the basement of one of the sites, officials “discovered part of a metal-plastic pipe, handcuffs”, it said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said Ukraine was in a “much better condition” than Russia to keep fighting through the winter. Speaking during a press conference in Indonesia, Austin said: We’ve done a lot to try to prepare the Ukrainians to be prepared for a fight in the winter, and enable them to continue to keep pressure on our adversaries throughout the winter months. He added that it was “hard to predict how things will evolve and on what timeline, but we’re in this in support of Ukraine for as long as it takes”. The Kremlin has said there are no plans to call up more Russian soldiers to fight in Ukraine through a second round of mobilisation. Asked about the potential for a new round of mobilisation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: I can’t speak for the defence ministry, but there are no discussions in the Kremlin about this. President Vladimir Putin announced plans to draft 300,000 men to fight in Ukraine in September, marking Russia’s first mobilisation since the second world war following a string of military defeats. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, announced the end to the “partial mobilisation” in October. A Ukrainian official has said the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is a Russian tactic that aims to disrupt power supplies and “freeze Ukrainians to death”. Strikes on the plane on Saturday and Sunday amount to a “genocidal campaign to freeze Ukrainians to death, to deprive Ukrainians of electricity”, said Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine’s defence minister. Russia is trying to “freeze the front” because they “are not achieving anything on the battlefield and they’re desperately looking for a way to achieve what they call an operational pause on the front”, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme this morning. He said there would be “no pause from our side” and that Ukraine will continue its recent counter-offensive. Moscow and Kyiv have blamed each other for the attacks on the Zaporizhzhia facility in south-east Ukraine, which is Europe’s largest nuclear power station and has been under Russian control since March. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his wife, Olena, have been pictured attending a commemoration ceremony in Kyiv at a monument to the so-called “Heavenly Hundred” for the people killed during the Ukrainian pro-EU mass demonstrations in 2013/2014. The time in Kyiv is 1pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines so far: The southern Ukrainian city of Nikopol was hit by Russian shelling overnight, according to city officials. The shelling reportedly hit a residential area injuring a 78-year-old man, the Kyiv Independent reports city governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, as saying. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed was repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It called on global powers to ensure that Kyiv ceased attacks on Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control, was rocked by shelling on Sunday, drawing condemnation from the UN nuclear watchdog which said such attacks risked a major disaster. The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Monday after the site was shelled more than a dozen times over the weekend. The blasts damaged buildings and equipment, though none had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Russia also said that it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine and that it would do everything possible to draw attention to what it has claimed is a war crime. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. Ukraine denies the claims. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,” Zelenskiy said. Russian forces are constructing defensive positions partially staffed by poorly trained mobilised reservists around the Svatove sector in the Luhansk region in north-eastern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. A new training centre for Ukrainian troops in the central Spanish city of Toledo will start operating at the end of November, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told the Nato parliamentary assembly. Spanish police will also be deployed in Ukraine over the coming weeks to help investigate alleged Russian war crimes, Sanchez added. A video purportedly showing the detention of two Russian servicemen who refused to fight against Ukraine has appeared across multiple Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels. The video shows two men – each dressed in military uniform – called to appear in front of their commander. Italy’s government will ask parliament to pass a new law on military and civilian supplies to Ukraine throughout 2023, defence minister Guido Crosetto said in an interview. The Rome government can send aid to Ukraine without seeking parliamentary authorisation each time on the basis of a decree that expires at the end of the year. Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine, according to a Reuters report. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well as an influx of thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people. Ukraine has exported almost 16.2m tonnes of grain so far in the 2022-23 season, down 31.7% from the 23.8m tonnes exported by the same stage of the previous season, agriculture ministry data showed. The volume included almost 6.3m tonnes of wheat, 8.6m tonnes of corn and 1.3m tonnes of barley, Reuters reported. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. The first Ukrainian supermarket has opened in Kherson since the city was liberated earlier this month. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. Kherson remains without electricity, running water or heating, but residents found some relief in being able to purchase Ukrainian pickled gherkins, dumplings, horseradish and other favourites. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Emmanuel Macron has accused Russia of feeding disinformation to further its “predatory project” in Africa, where France has had military setbacks. In an interview with TV5 Monde on the sidelines of a conference of Francophone nations in Tunisia, the French president said there was a “predatory project” pushing disinformation into African countries, which was “a political project financed by Russia, sometimes others”. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. My colleague Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to continue bringing you all the latest news from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy marked Ukraine’s annual Day of Dignity and Freedom on Monday by celebrating the sacrifices made by Ukrainian people since Russia’s invasion and said his country would endure and prevail. In a video address to the nation, Zelenskiy hailed the contributions made by Ukrainians, from soldiers, firefighters and medics to teachers giving online lessons, villagers cooking for the military, tailors sewing uniforms and farmers ploughing their fields despite the risk. He hailed their defiance despite frequent missile strikes, widescale destruction, shortages and rolling blackouts as winter sets in, almost exactly nine months since Russia’s invasion, Reuters reported. “We can be left without money. Without gasoline. Without hot water. Without light. But not without freedom,” Zelenskiy said in an address that he delivered standing in an ornate room in the presidential palace in the capital, Kyiv. The Kremlin also said that it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine and that it would do everything possible to draw attention to what it has claimed is a war crime. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. “There is no doubt that Russia itself will be looking for the perpetrators of this crime. They must be found and punished,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European integration was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that Kyiv would investigate the video but that it was “very unlikely” it showed what Moscow claimed. A spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office told Reuters it was looking into the footage and called for allegations to be investigated promptly and in full. The Kremlin has said it was concerned by what it claimed was repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It called on global powers to ensure that Kyiv ceased attacks on Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is under Russian control, was rocked by shelling on Sunday, drawing condemnation from the UN nuclear watchdog which said such attacks risked a major disaster. “This cannot but cause our concern,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. “We call on all countries of the world to use their influence so that the Ukrainian armed forces stop doing this.” Ukraine says it was Russia that shelled the plant. Reuters was unable to independently verify which side was responsible. A new training centre for Ukrainian troops in the central Spanish city of Toledo will start operating at the end of November, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told the Nato parliamentary assembly. Spanish police will also be deployed in Ukraine over the coming weeks to help investigate alleged Russian war crimes, Sanchez added. Ukraine has exported almost 16.2m tonnes of grain so far in the 2022-23 season, down 31.7% from the 23.8m tonnes exported by the same stage of the previous season, agriculture ministry data showed. The volume included almost 6.3m tonnes of wheat, 8.6m tonnes of corn and 1.3m tonnes of barley, Reuters reported. After an almost six-month blockade caused by the Russian invasion, three Ukrainian Black Sea ports were unblocked at the end of July under a deal between Moscow and Kyiv brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Ministry data showed that 3m tonnes of various grains were exported in the first 20 days of November, 29.7% less than in the same period of November 2021. The government has said Ukraine could harvest between 50m and 52m tonnes of grain this year, down from a record 86m tonnes in 2021 because of the loss of land to Russian forces and lower yields. Ukrainians living in the capital, Kyiv, are preparing for the “worst winter of their lives” with temperatures set to plummet and the nation’s power grid a target for Russian attacks. Here is an extract from an Associated Press article today: When the power is out, as it so often is, the high-rise apartment overlooking Ukraine’s war-torn capital feels like a deathtrap. No lights, no water, no way to cook food. And no elevator by which to escape from the 21st floor should a Russian missile strike. Even when electricity comes back, it’s never on for long. “Russian strikes are plunging Ukraine into the Stone Age,” says Anastasia Pyrozhenko. In a recent 24-hour spell, her 26-story high-rise only had power for half an hour. She says the “military living conditions” have driven her and husband from their apartment. “Our building is the highest in the area and is a great target for Russian missiles, so we left our apartment for our parents’ place and are preparing for the worst winter of our lives,” said the 25-year-old. The situation in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and other major cities has deteriorated drastically following the largest missile attack on the country’s power grid on Tuesday. Ukrainian state-owned grid operator Ukrenergo reported that 40% of Ukrainians were experiencing difficulties, due to damage to at least 15 major energy hubs across the country. Warning that electricity outages could last anywhere from several hours to several days, the network said that “resilience and courage are what we need this winter.” Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, too, stressed the need to be ready and resilient in the face of a potential blackout: “Worst case scenario. Actually, I don’t like to talk about that, but I have to be prepared if we (do not) have electricity, blackout, no water, no heating, no services and no communication,” Klitschko told the AP on Friday. Ukrainian soldiers fire an artillery at Russian positions near Bakhmut, Donetsk region, Ukraine. Italy’s government will ask parliament to pass a new law on military and civilian supplies to Ukraine throughout 2023, defence minister Guido Crosetto said in an interview. The Rome government can send aid to Ukraine without seeking parliamentary authorisation each time on the basis of a decree that expires at the end of the year. “The defence [ministry] will shortly propose to renew that same measure, extending it to all of 2023,” Crosetto told Il Foglio newspaper. Crosetto said Italy would continue supplying arms, as it has done in the past, “in the times and ways that we will agree with our Atlantic allies and with Kyiv”. Crosetto belongs to Brothers of Italy, the right wing party of Italy’s new prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, who is a staunch supporter of Ukraine. The southern Ukrainian city of Nikopol was hit by Russian shelling overnight, according to city officials. The shelling reportedly hit a residential area injuring a 78-year-old man, the Kyiv Independent reports city governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, as saying. Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine, according to a Reuters report. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well as an influx of thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people. Moldova is believed to have taken more refugees per head than any other country. Largely dependent on Russia energy supplies, Moldova is facing more difficulties with winter arriving and Moscow cutting natural gas supplies by about 40%, hurting its ability to supply enough electricity to its population. “Moldova is directly impacted because it’s dependent on Russian energy supplies and is a country which has a part of its territory controlled by Russian soldiers so it’s especially vulnerable,” a French diplomat told reporters in a briefing. Aid would be used to support Moldova’s budget and electricity supplies as well as the costs for hosting thousands of Ukrainian refugees. Russian forces are constructing defensive positions partially staffed by poorly trained mobilised reservists around the Svatove sector in the Luhansk region in north-eastern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. Russian leaders will highly likely see retaining control of Svatove as a political priority though their commanders are likely struggling with the military realities of maintaining a credible defence, while also attempting to resource offensive operations further south in Donetsk. “Both Russian defensive and offensive capability continues to be hampered by severe shortages of munitions and skilled personnel,” the report adds. A video purportedly showing the detention of two Russian servicemen who refused to fight against Ukraine has appeared across multiple Russian and Ukrainian Telegram channels. The video shows two men – each dressed in military uniform – called to appear in front of their commander. According to Meduza, an independent Russian news outlet based abroad, who shared the video published by the Military Ombudsman Telegram channel on Sunday, the incident occurred in Russia’s Belgorod region. The outlet states: The investigator informs the privates that on 16 November a criminal case was opened against them for failure to comply with the order (Part 2.1 of Article 332 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). This article implies a punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of two to three years. The convoy then detains the soldiers.” Human rights activists believe that this video was filmed “as a warning to others”. Residents of Kherson waved Ukrainian flags to celebrate the arrival of the first train to arrive in the southern city since the start of the Russian invasion. Images published over the newswires today show a train carrying passengers from Kyiv roll into Kherson on Saturday for the first time in more than eight months. The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Monday after the site was shelled more than a dozen times over the weekend. The blasts damaged buildings and equipment, though none had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Its head, Rafael Grossi, said the forces behind the shelling were “playing with fire”, adding that “it must stop immediately”. A statement published by the IAEA late on Sunday read: Repeated shelling at the site of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) yesterday evening and this morning damaged buildings, systems and equipment, with some of the explosions occurring near the reactors.” The agency said the plant was hit with “more than a dozen blasts within 40 minutes” though radiation levels at the site remained normal and there were no reports of casualties. The ZNPP’s external power supplies, which have been knocked out several times during the conflict, were also not affected. According to the IAEA experts, site management reported damage in several places, including a radioactive waste and storage building, cooling pond sprinkler systems, an electrical cable to one of the reactors, condensate storage tanks, and to a bridge between another reactor and its auxiliary buildings. Rafael Grossi added: Even though there was no direct impact on key nuclear safety and security systems at the plant, the shelling came dangerously close to them. We are talking metres, not kilometres. Whoever is shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, is taking huge risks and gambling with many people’s lives.” The IAEA team of experts plan to conduct an assessment on Monday of the shelling impact on the site. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there are fewer attacks today due to the deterioration of the weather, the number of Russian shelling occasions remains, unfortunately, extremely high. Luhansk region - little by little we are moving forward with battles. As of now, there have been almost 400 shelling occasions in the east since the beginning of the day.” Russia has moved troops to reinforce positions in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions after withdrawing from the southern city of Kherson. Referring to Ukrainian positions in the south, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s forces “are holding the line, consistently and very calculatedly destroying the potential of the occupiers.” Russia’s surge in missile strikes in Ukraine is partly designed to exhaust Kyiv’s supplies of air defences and achieve dominance of the skies, a senior Pentagon official said on Saturday. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address.

If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,” Zelenskiy said. “In the Luhansk region, we are slowly moving forward while fighting. As of now, there have been almost 400 artillery attacks in the east since the start of the day.” Russia has moved troops to reinforce positions in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions after withdrawing from Kherson.

Its head, Rafael Grossi, said the forces behind the shelling were “playing with fire”, adding that “it must stop immediately”. Germany has offered Poland the Patriot missile defence system to help it to secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in the country last week, the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. “We have offered Poland support in securing airspace – with our Eurofighters and with Patriot air defence systems,” Lambrecht told the Rheinische Post and General Anzeiger. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon’s Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles. Ukraine has denied its forces executed Russian prisoners of war, arguing its soldiers were defending themselves against Russians who feigned surrender. The Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights responded on Sunday to videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian servicemen killed after surrendering to Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said “excerpts” of a video showed that Russians “using a staged capture ... committed a war crime by opening fire on the Ukrainian armed forces”. This means the soldiers “cannot be considered prisoners of war”, he said. A UN spokesperson told AFP it was “aware of the videos” and was “looking into them”. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv.

The latest update, though, contained a genuine sign of seriousness: the Chinese are being paid to go away. China General Nuclear (CGN), a state-backed firm, owned a 20% stake in the fledgling project and had, in effect, a right to subscribe to maintain its holding through the various funding rounds – just as it did at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. In practice, any form of Chinese involvement in Sizewell has been impossible for at least a year. First, because David Cameron’s misguided “golden era” of coziness with Beijing is over, as Rishi Sunak said earlier this week. Second, because the mere presence of a Chinese firm would scare away many of the private investors, especially US ones, that the government is relying upon to fund Sizewell’s construction phase; in turn, the costs of funding for the project might have ballooned. In its usual less-than-straightforward way, the government declined to say how much of its £679m fresh funding for Sizewell (giving the UK state a 50% stake now) will be directed at buying out CGN. But, if £100m-ish is correct, the negotiating outcome could be called reasonable – or, at least, pragmatic. We have no idea what CGN has spent so far, but a 20% stake in an unbuilt Sizewell clearly has some value. The bottom line is that CGN had to be cleared out to get beyond the planning stage. The point at which the project will be truly “confirmed” is when other investors have committed the hard equity capital to fund construction. That moment is still a year away and the job probably involves finding £8bn-ish to allow an even greater sum to be borrowed on top. It is not a small task. And the cost of equity and cost of borrowing will be the critical numbers in terms of value for money for bill-payers. But Sizewell – for better or worse – is starting to look credible. EasyJet not quite out of the turbulence There’s nothing like a strong summer to excite easyJet’s management and, sure enough, chief executive Johan Lundgren was dancing down the aisle as he unveiled numbers for the last financial year. “EasyJet has achieved a record bounce back this summer with a performance which underlines that our transformation is delivering,” he declared. The July-September period, in which profits were £674m on a flattering operating measure, delivered “the highest-ever earnings for a single quarter”. Very good, but one good quarter followed about 10 rotten ones. EasyJet still produced a headline loss for the year of £178m – its third loss-making year in a row. The pandemic is to blame, obviously, but there is a lesson here in not chalking up a turnaround before it has become permanent. Lundgren was guilty of premature optimism in the spring; weeks of airport chaos and cancelled flights followed. There is a stronger case now that a corner has been turned, but you can’t blame the stock market for being wary; easyJet’s shares were 550p as recently as late April but are now 383p. Cost of living pressures will bite properly next year and all airlines are now facing a period of higher prices for aviation fuel. While peak holiday weeks such as Christmas are reported to be back to normal levels of demand, Lundgren also said that “visibility over bookings in the second half [post-April] remains low”. EasyJet is improving, but it hasn’t reached comfortable cruising altitude. Shining a light on the mini-budget It’s ancient history now, but Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini-budget was even more chaotic than we knew already. That, at least, was the gist of the testimony of Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, to a House of Lords select committee on Tuesday. Normal form requires the Treasury to brief the Bank about the contents of a big fiscal announcement, but Bailey clearly didn’t get a full picture. “I’m afraid there were parts of it we had no idea what was in it,” he said. Why? “I don’t think Treasury officials were clear what was going to be in it.” The timing of these interactions with Threadneedle Street, note, was the day before Kwarteng’s big announcement. One gets an impression of the former chancellor wavering until the 11th hour about whether to adopt radical measures such as scrapping the 45p additional rate of income tax. One could say it is almost unbelievable – except that it is an entirely plausible version of events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/26/fears-for-all-ukraines-nuclear-plants-after-emergency-shutdowns","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-26T18:19:00Z","webTitle":"Fears for all Ukraine’s nuclear plants after emergency shutdowns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/26/fears-for-all-ukraines-nuclear-plants-after-emergency-shutdowns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/26/fears-for-all-ukraines-nuclear-plants-after-emergency-shutdowns","fields":{"headline":"Fears for all Ukraine’s nuclear plants after emergency shutdowns","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"There are growing fears that Russia’s relentless targeting of Ukraine’s electricity grid will threaten the safety of the country’s nuclear power plants, in the wake of an unprecedented emergency shutdown on Wednesday. Petro Kotin, the president of Ukraine’s nuclear power company, Energoatom, said that all safety mechanisms had worked as intended on Wednesday, but two generators were damaged in the process, delaying the restart of two reactors. Kotin said repeated shutdowns caused by more Russian missile attacks could cause extensive damage, with a potentially severe impact on Ukraine’s power supply and possibly on nuclear safety. Russia kept up its onslaught on Ukrainian cities on Saturday with an attack on a residential area in the city of Dnipro which injured six people and destroyed seven houses, according to the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, Valentyn Reznichenko. The Ministry of Defence in the UK said Russia had resorted to removing the nuclear warheads from cruise missiles and launching them with just ballast in their nosecones, with the aim of diverting Ukraine’s air defences and doing some damage just from the sheer force of their impact on targets. “Whatever Russia’s intent, this improvisation highlights the level of depletion in Russia’s stock of long-range missiles,” the ministry said in one of its daily assessments of the invasion. Ukrainian intelligence believes Russia could carry out another mass missile attack on infrastructure in the middle of this week. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, was seized by Russian forces in March and it has been off the grid since September, amid frequent shelling of the area around it. Ukraine’s three other nuclear power plants – Rivne, South Ukraine and Khmelnytskyi – have not been directly targeted in recent Russian missile strikes, but their safety could be threatened by further attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. Missile attacks last Wednesday on high voltage cables, transformers and substations triggered the first ever simultaneous emergency shutdown, or “scram”, of all four plants. “The complete and simultaneous loss of off-site power for Ukraine’s nuclear power plants shows that the situation for nuclear safety and security in the country is becoming increasingly precarious, challenging and potentially dangerous,” Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said in a statement. Kotin said: “In all the 40 years of operation of the Ukrainian nuclear industry, nothing like that has ever happened.” He emphasised that the plants were designed with multiple levels of protection against the kind of disastrous meltdown and explosion at Chornobyl in 1986. When the power grid failed under Wednesday’s attack, the reactors immediately scrammed to isolate themselves and diesel-powered generators started working to power the water circulation through cooling pools where spent fuel is kept. However, repeated attacks leading to more emergency shutdowns would impose enormous strain on all the components of the plants, from the core to the steam turbines to the generators, as result of rapid contraction and then expansion again when a plant is restarted. Kotin likened the process to driving a car at 200 km/h and then coming to an emergency stop. “You have all kinds of consequences, like your valves will warp – and there are a huge amount of valves between the reactor and the turbine,” he said. Ultimately, he added, the damage could have an impact on nuclear safety. Oleh Korikov, Ukraine’s chief inspector for nuclear safety, said each time there was an emergency shutdown, the risks multiplied. “Any use of the scram system may cause an accident,” Korikov told the Observer. “With this shutting-down process, it increases the probability of some malfunction of equipment or some mistake by personnel.” The diesel generators can keep the cooling and other safety systems going, but they do not produce enough power to restart a power plant. After an entire electric power system has shut down, that process is called a “black start” and it gets progressively harder the longer the shutdown lasts. A complicating factor is that the shutdown of a nuclear reactor produces an isotope of xenon in the fuel rods that absorbs neutrons, slowing down fission and adding to the difficulty in booting it back up. The stopping and restarting all requires substantial skill on the part of the plants’ Ukrainian staff, and the pressure on them is considerable, particularly the workers at the Zaporizhzhia plant, who are operating under armed Russian surveillance. In early October, Moscow declared the plant was part of Russian territory and therefore was under the supervision of Rosatom, the Russian nuclear power company. Staff at the plant have been put under pressure to sign documents acknowledging they were working for a Rosatom subsidiary. “Some people signed it but not many,” Kotin told the Observer. “There was a huge push from the beginning but right now it has stopped. The occupiers just stopped all the rhetoric they used before, like ‘this is Russia for ever under Rosatom’.” Some observers see this change in attitude as a sign that the Russian occupiers of the plant may be intending to withdraw. Kotin added that a second signthey may making contingency plans to leave was systematic looting. “They are starting to steal everything they can see, and they have packed their bags to get out from there,” he said, while emphasising there was no clarity over the Russians’ intentions. A former Zaporizhzhia worker who has been in contact with current employees said they had seen no signs of Russian departure. On the contrary, they said, soldiers at the plant were making preparations for a long winter, moving their sleeping quarters to the canteen. Grossi has been trying for months to negotiate the creation of a “safety and security protection zone” around the nuclear plant where shelling would be prohibited, but Ukraine is insisting that such a zone should be completely demilitarised. “It is illegal for heavy weaponry to be within a civilian nuclear object. They actually use it like a military base for the protection of their heavy weaponry, which they have put in the turbine halls of units [reactors] one and two,” Kotin said. “This is a completely awful situation for fire safety. If there is a fire emergency, then you can’t mitigate it, because you just cannot get access – because all the free space in the turbine halls is packed with all these vehicles.” He said it was unclear whether there were any explosive materials stored in the turbine halls. The militarisation of the Zaporizhzhia plant is adding to the constant pressure on the staff, who are faced with the task of keeping two of the reactors in “hot shutdown” mode – a delicate operation – to provide some power and heating to the plant and the next-door town of Enerhodar, where the workforce lives. “If you have armed people breathing down your neck in the control room, it’s just an incredibly dangerous situation,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a senior research associate at Harvard University’s project on managing the atom. “If you have the three other nuclear power plants without any off-site power, and you can’t restart them because the grid is down, it’s like three enormous ticking timebombs,” Budjeryn added. “All of this combined means we’re talking about the most dangerous moment for nuclear security so far.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-25T05:00:13Z","webTitle":"Invasion of Ukraine ‘has fuelled funding boom for clean energy’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/may/25/invasion-of-ukraine-has-fuelled-funding-boom-for-clean-energy","fields":{"headline":"Invasion of Ukraine ‘has fuelled funding boom for clean energy’","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has helped ignite a boom in clean energy investment which will significantly outpace spending on fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. At the same time investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Clean energy investment has climbed steadily in recent years as governments and investors have sought to take advantage of the low cost of renewables such as wind and solar power. In contrast, investment in fossil fuels plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic when severe travel restrictions caused demand for transport fuels to plummet, leading to a collapse in energy commodity prices. The IEA report showed that clean energy investment has accelerated well beyond spending on gas, coal and oil as governments become increasingly concerned about developing secure, homegrown energy sources. However, the IEA report warned that Russia’s war in Ukraine has also prompted increased investment in upstream oil and gas, which is expected to rise by 7% in 2023 in a return to 2019 levels. At the same time global coal demand reached an all-time high in 2022, in part owing to record high gas prices, which has spurred estimated coal investment for this year to nearly six times the levels that are aligned with global 2030 climate targets. Birol said the single most important barrier facing the expansion of renewable energy remains problems with projects being able to connect to electricity grids. “We are seeing a pipeline of projects in Europe, US and Asia and Africa where the grid is the main problem. If you cannot reduce permitting time we will not be able to see the rapid expansion of renewables,” he said. In the UK, developers of renewable energy projects have complained that they have been forced to wait for more than a decade to connect to the electricity grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T11:17:23Z","webTitle":"Ukraine faces ‘winter humanitarian crisis’ with energy grid on the brink","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/01/ukraine-faces-winter-humanitarian-crisis-with-energy-grid-on-the-brink","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine faces ‘winter humanitarian crisis’ with energy grid on the brink","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukraine faces a winter humanitarian crisis unless it can prevent a collapse in its electricity supply caused by the relentless campaign of Russian bombing, the chief executive of the country’s national grid has said. Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the chief executive of Ukrenergo, said “virtually all” large non-nuclear power stations in the country had been hit, as well as more than 30% of the network’s routing substations. Describing the position as critical, the energy boss said Ukraine had asked western countries for badly needed spare parts last week – and repeated calls for more missile defence systems to help prevent damaging attacks. “This is the biggest missile attack on electricity infrastructure in history. Therefore, the impact is huge. Unfortunately the situation is critical. They are trying to specifically destroy the Ukrainian power system, and this supplies tens of millions of the population,” he said. If the Russian attacks continued, “power cuts in Ukraine will become longer and longer”, Kudrytskyi warned, adding that despite Ukrenergo’s efforts, it was not possible to repair the grid as fast as it was being destroyed. “It’s much easier obviously to launch missiles than to restore substations,” he said. The focus now is on keeping the lights on. “Before these missile attacks, the main goal was to supply as much energy as our customers need. However, now we’re speaking about the survival of the system,” Kudrytskyi told the Guardian during an air raid warning in Kyiv. Electricity was also necessary to sustain gas supplies, the chief executive said. “If the customers will spend too much time without electricity, and if heating systems have no connection to electricity, that will create big, social humanitarian problems.” He said Russia wanted to create “a humanitarian catastrophe” in Ukraine. Power cuts lasting several hours have become increasingly frequent in most areas of the country after a sustained Russian bombing campaign aimed at the electricity network that began last month. For now Ukrainians appear to be coping with the additional uncertainty and hardship without much complaint, accepting it as an unavoidable challenge they must overcome. Under the heading “No Power?”, a co-working space in Kyiv, Kooperativ Kyiv, has advertised that it has two electricity supplies and two internet suppliers so that people can work uninterrupted by the outages. “We’ll get through these times together,” read the advert. Ihor Sudakov, who lives next to a power station in east Kyiv that has been repeatedly hit, said he had attempted to prepare for further outages. “We’ve bought power banks – we keep at least three charged at a time,” he said. “We’ve also ordered this type of charging station that can charge a fridge and stove. Our building only has electricity so if the electricity goes we need to be able to cook.” As a double backup, he said, he had bought a propane camping stove. “I’m not worried that Russia will try to hit the [Kyjv] power station again – I know they will. It’s part of their terrorist tactics … so it’s about trying to be as autonomous as possible.” An attack involving 55 cruise missiles and five drones took place on Monday, aimed at the country’s hydro plants for the first time. Russian missiles targeted the electric infrastructure of the hydro plants, Kudrytskyi said, but not the dams themselves, which are considered more resilient. Although 44 of the missiles were said to have been intercepted by Ukraine, the damage caused on Monday was significant, the chief executive said. “It was in line with the scale of the attack, which was very big. This was a massive attack; massive damage [was] inflicted.” On Monday, 350,000 homes lost power in Kyiv and 80% of the water supply was disrupted after the attack, although both had been restored on Tuesday. Another 20,000 remained without supply in the Kyiv region, said the governor, Oleksiy Kuleba. In Kharkiv, where the main power station was damaged on Monday, Kharkiv hospital number 4 has been running on a reduced voltage – 180W instead of 220W – and there were concerns that this may damage the hospital equipment, said Oleksandr Dukhovsky, the head of paediatric surgery at the hospital. He said the hospital had fewer than five days’ worth of diesel to supply its backup generators. “We are not scared but we understand we need to be careful,” said Dukhovsky, adding that hospital staff were not losing faith and were willing to do what was necessary to win against Russia. Ukrainian officials do not release pictures of the damage to power plants and substations because they do not want Russia to precisely see what impact the attacks are having, but some facilities are acknowledged to have been destroyed. In Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, which is now less than 50% controlled by Russian forces and their proxies after recent Ukrainian advances, utilities have been intermittent or absent for months. Dmytro Myshenin of the NGO Vostok SOS, based in Kramatorsk, said that supplies had improved in a few towns but were still absent in places deemed too close to fighting, or very damaged. Towns such as Kramatorsk and Sloviansk had had their water and gas supplies reconnected after the frontline was pushed back and people had returned, he said. But in areas closer to the frontline, people have now spent months living in dire conditions without running water and gas and some also without electricity. “There are many people surviving with portable wood-fired stoves and there aren’t enough of them,” said Myshenin. “We need more of everything.” A week ago, Ukraine sent out lists of replacement parts it needed to the US, UK, EU, and other western countries because “we need a lot of this equipment now”, Kudrytskyi said. He added that there was an urgent need for “western defence systems, which have proven to be very efficient against Russian missiles”. But the chief executive rejected claims that Ukraine could have better prepared. “We’re asking for defence systems all the time. I mean, this is not something new,” he said. “It’s not about our military needs. It’s about humanitarian catastrophe that has to be prevented for tens of millions of people in Europe.” Kudrytskyi said it would be possible for Ukraine – which used to be energy self-sufficient before the Russian attacks – to purchase electricity from Europe. But this would only be a partial help because of the damage to the country’s grid, which would make it harder to route electricity across the country, he said. “We can buy some energy from the EU because the Ukrainian power system is connected to the European power grid,” Kudrytskyi said. “However, we might be unable to deliver this important energy to certain regions, if the grid is damaged.” He also warned there was a danger of transmission bottlenecks. Large cities were at particular risk, he said, because of their huge energy demand. Among these, he listed the country’s main urban centres of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Lviv, Odesa, Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/12/finland-opens-nuclear-power-plant-amid-concerns-of-europe-energy-war","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-12T14:39:56Z","webTitle":"Finland opens nuclear power plant amid concerns of European energy war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/12/finland-opens-nuclear-power-plant-amid-concerns-of-europe-energy-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/12/finland-opens-nuclear-power-plant-amid-concerns-of-europe-energy-war","fields":{"headline":"Finland opens nuclear power plant amid concerns of European energy war","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Europe’s first nuclear power plant to open in 15 years began production in Finland on Saturday, at a crucial moment for energy supply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The much-delayed Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor started test production, delivering power to the national grid, which over time is expected to reduce the need for electricity imports and lead to lower prices. It comes amid growing fears of an energy war in Europe, after Moscow threatened to close a major gas pipeline to Germany if European countries ban Russian oil imports. Once fully operational Olkiluoto 3, operated by TVO (Teollisuuden Voima), is expected to meet 14% of Finland’s electricity demand, reducing the need for imports from Russia, Sweden and Norway. “Olkiluoto 3 will decrease Finland’s import dependency and it will become a cheaper price zone,” Aurora Energy Research economist Alexander Esser told Reuters. Finland’s first new nuclear plant in four decades, Olkiluoto 3 had originally been due to open in 2009 but was plagued by technological problems that became the subject of lawsuits. The plant started test production at just over 0.1 gigawatt, a small fraction of its capacity, with increase to full, regular electricity output planned by the end of July. Finland’s net imports of power averaged 13 terawatt hours (TWh) over the last few years, which should drop to 5 to 8 TWh by 2025 with Olkiluoto 3 in operation. TVO said in a statement: “OL3 significantly improves Finland’s electricity self-sufficiency and helps in achieving carbon neutrality goals.” The invasion of Ukraine has forced European governments to reconsider their reliance on Russian energy. Russia supplies about 40% of Europe’s gas and over a quarter of its crude oil. Germany’s economy minister says his country wants to virtually end the importation of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year. Germany currently gets about half of its coal and oil from Russia. The German government last month halted the Nord Stream 2 project intended to bring additional natural gas from Russia to Germany. The Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, threatened to impose an embargo on the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Germany this week, after the US pushed its European allies to consider banning Russian oil imports entirely. The European Commission has proposed plans to diversify Europe’s fossil fuel supplies away from Russia and move faster to renewable energy. British and European gas prices both hit record highs earlier this month, as the war continued to wreak havoc on energy markets, threatening to worsen the cost-of-living crisis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-environmental-goals-conservative-party-out-of-tune-with-voters","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T13:59:04Z","webTitle":"Hunt’s modest environmental goals show party is out of tune with voters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-environmental-goals-conservative-party-out-of-tune-with-voters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/nov/17/jeremy-hunt-environmental-goals-conservative-party-out-of-tune-with-voters","fields":{"headline":"Hunt’s modest environmental goals show party is out of tune with voters","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ramping up energy efficiency is a no-brainer when it comes to cutting energy bills, ensuring security of supply and reducing climate-heating emissions. In Jeremy Hunt, the Conservatives appear to have found a brain. In the autumn statement, he pledged to double annual energy efficiency investment with new funding of £6bn. That is the good news. The bad news is that doubling does not happen until 2025, when the energy bills crisis may be over and the climate crisis will be even worse. Hunt is the fourth chancellor of 2022 and the chaos in the Tory party has meant unnecessary delays in making people’s homes warmer and cheaper to heat. The trouble goes back almost a decade in fact, when David Cameron’s ditching of “green crap” saw insulation rates fall by 95%, a decision that has cost bill payers billions. Details of the new efficiency plans are yet to be published but will include a new “energy efficiency taskforce”. Its goal will be to reduce the UK’s energy use in buildings and industry by 15% by 2030, a fairly modest ambition. On the supply of low-carbon energy, Hunt backed expensive nuclear power as well as offshore wind, but said nothing on the fastest and by far the cheapest sources: onshore wind and solar. With blocks on the latter, the Tories continue to be wildly out of tune with voters. Hunt increased the windfall tax on soaring oil and gas profits from 25% to 35%, making the total tax rate 75%. That may look high, but remember that the oil and gas belongs to the nation – you and me – not the fossil fuel companies, and other nations like Norway have higher rates. A windfall tax on electricity producers of 45%, including wind, solar and nuclear, was also announced by Hunt. Depending on how that is implemented, the green energy companies could end up being taxed more than the fossil fuel producers. That would be mad when green energy is the solution to the energy and climate crisis, and while oil and gas firms can get 91% tax rebates by investing in more oil and gas. Electric car sales are in the fast lane and Hunt announced that from 2025, owners will need to start paying vehicle excise duty, sometimes misleadingly referred to as “road tax”. That is a disincentive to go electric but by that date electric cars will not only be cheaper to run, as they already are, but also very probably cheaper to buy than petrol or diesel models. On the climate crisis, Hunt said: “With the existential vulnerability we face, now would be the wrong time to step back from our international climate responsibilities. So I can confirm that, despite the economic pressures, we remain fully committed to the historic Glasgow climate pact agreed at Cop26, including a 68% reduction in our own emissions by 2030.” The government is not currently on track to meet this target. The autumn statement’s purpose was to find £55bn in tax rises and spending cuts to stabilise the UK economy. To put that in context, that’s about 18 days’ worth of the pure profit the global oil and gas industry has been banking for the past 50 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/13/fukushima-water-to-be-released-into-ocean-in-next-few-months-says-japan","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-13T05:50:20Z","webTitle":"Fukushima water to be released into ocean in next few months, says Japan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/13/fukushima-water-to-be-released-into-ocean-in-next-few-months-says-japan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/13/fukushima-water-to-be-released-into-ocean-in-next-few-months-says-japan","fields":{"headline":"Fukushima water to be released into ocean in next few months, says Japan","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The controversial release of more than a million tonnes of water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant will begin in the northern spring or summer, Japan’s government has said – a move that has sparked anger among local fishing communities and countries in the region. The decision comes more than two years after the government approved the release of the water, which will be treated to remove most radioactive materials but will still contain tritium, a naturally occurring radioactive form of hydrogen that is technically difficult to separate from water. Japanese officials insist the “treated” water will not pose a threat to human health or the marine environment, but the plans face opposition from fishermen who say it risks destroying their livelihoods, almost 12 years after a magnitude-9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. Tsunami waves crashed into Fukushima Daiichi, knocking out its backup electricity supply, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors and sending large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere in the most serious nuclear accident since Chornobyl a quarter of a century earlier. The wastewater in Fukushima is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks that officials say need to be removed so the plant can be decommissioned – a process expected to take 30 to 40 years. Japan’s foreign ministry said in July that regulators had deemed it safe to release the water, which will be gradually discharged into the Pacific ocean via a tunnel after being treated and diluted. The plan’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has said its water treatment technology – known as Alps – can remove all radioactive materials from water except tritium, which it says is harmless in small amounts. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed out that nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides. South Korea and China have voiced concern about the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum said recently it had “grave concerns” about the proposed release. Writing in the Guardian, the forum’s secretary general, Henry Puna, said Japan “should hold off on any such release until we are certain about the implications of this proposal on the environment and on human health, especially recognising that the majority of our Pacific peoples are coastal peoples, and that the ocean continues to be an integral part of their subsistence living”. The South Korean government, which has yet to lift its ban on Fukushima seafood, has said that releasing the water would pose a “grave threat” to marine life. Fishing unions in the area oppose the release, warning it would cause alarm among consumers and derail more than a decade of efforts to reassure the public that Fukushima seafood is safe to eat. Under the plan approved by Japan’s cabinet on Friday, fishermen who fear that the release will impact their livelihoods will be able to access a new ¥50bn ($385m) fund, the Kyodo news agency said. “We would like to thoroughly explain these measures to fishing communities and other relevant parties while listening to their concerns,” the chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said at the meeting, according to Kyodo. The liquid, which Japanese officials claim is “treated” rather than “contaminated”, comprises water used to cool the damaged reactors, and rain and groundwater that seeps into the area. Kyodo said the IAEA had conducted several safety reviews of the plan and would issue a report based on its findings, as well as providing support before, during and after the discharge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jul/27/nuclear-power-station-sizewell-c-water-suffolk","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-27T14:17:41Z","webTitle":"A new nuclear power station needs a vast supply of water.

But where will Sizewell C get it from?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Last week, the government gave the go-ahead for a new nuclear power station to be developed on the Suffolk coast. Providing low-carbon electricity for about 6m homes, Sizewell C will stand alongside two existing stations, Sizewell B and the decommissioned Sizewell A. I live close enough to see the 60-metre tall, white dome of Sizewell B almost every day. When I want to torture myself, I look at developer EDF’s “construction phase visualisations” of the 1,380-acre building site, with its towering spoil heaps and forest of cranes, and wonder if this is what it will take to save the planet. What might not have been immediately obvious in the coverage of the government’s decision was that the Planning Inspectorate, tasked with assessing such projects, had recommended that permission be refused. The problem, the examiners explained, was fairly simple: EDF couldn’t say exactly where it would obtain one of the main substances needed to make a nuclear power station work, that substance being water. As well as uranium, a reactor of the kind EDF plans to build needs water in very great volumes. Saltwater will do for part of the process, which is one reason why nuclear power stations are usually built beside the sea. But fresh or “potable” water will also be needed – first, to cool the two reactors, and then, just as importantly, to cool the irradiated fuel once it has been removed from the reactors. For this, absolutely pure water is essential. Sizewell B uses about 800,000 litres of potable water per day; Sizewell C, with its twin reactors, will need more than 2m litres per day, and as much as 3.5m litres per day during construction. Last September, during the closing hearings of the six-month public planning examination, the question of just where the developer was going to get the water to run Sizewell C, let alone build it, was becoming urgent. Those who had raised concerns about precisely this issue more than 10 years earlier would have been forgiven for feeling frustrated. As one of the driest parts of the country, Suffolk is described by the Environment Agency as “seriously water stressed”. By 2043, eight years into Sizewell C’s 60-year operating life, the agency anticipates a water deficit in the county of more than 7m litres a day. Northumbrian Water, which operates locally as Essex and Suffolk Water, had made it clear to EDF that there was not enough local groundwater for either construction or operation. EDF’s plan, therefore, was to build a pipeline to bring water from the River Waveney, 18 miles away on the Norfolk border. During at least the first two years of construction, while the pipeline was being built, EDF planned to install a temporary desalination plant on the site to turn saltwater from the sea into fresh. Then, in August, the water company broke the news that its abstraction licenses dictating how much water it could extract from the Waveney, granted by the Environment Agency, were likely to be reduced by up to 60% to safeguard downstream levels. It subsequently confirmed that the Waveney did not, after all, have the capacity to supply water for for any of the 10-year construction phase. Desalination, opponents of the project noted, was a solution EDF itself had discounted in January 2021 “due to concerns with power consumption, sustainability, cost and wastewater discharge”. And yet, desalination, with all the problems it had set out (including discharging millions of litres a day of saline concentrate and phosphorus into the North Sea), remains EDF’s “fallback” solution for running the station, as well as building it, if another source can’t be found. Northumbrian Water has since confirmed that: “Existing water resources (including the River Waveney) will not be sufficient to meet forecast mains water demand, including the operational demand of Sizewell C.” For his part, the secretary of state, Kwasi Kwarteng, has a “reasonable level of certainty” that 2m litres of water a day will be found from elsewhere by the time the reactors are ready to be switched on. Perhaps, as Northumbrian Water has suggested, by piping it in from Essex (though Essex isn’t overburdened with water); or by reducing household wastage; or by reusing effluent. It will be for the Environment Agency, the Water Services Regulation Authority, Natural England and the Office for Nuclear Regulation to ensure that everything is done properly at such time as a water source – some kind of source – is settled upon. The more I look at those mock-ups of the building site, the more they seem like a metaphor for another kind of despoilment. Given the government’s stated intention to build a fleet of new nuclear power stations across the country, it’s not just people who live in Suffolk who have reason to wonder what the secretary of state’s decision to wash his hands of Sizewell C’s water problem says about the resilience of the systems we entrust with safeguarding our environment. Still, the foundations will be laid, I suppose, and the cranes will rise, and after 10 years and £20bn (by EDF’s reckoning), Sizewell C will be built. And when the time comes for its reactors to go critical, there will be water, because if there isn’t, Suffolk will have a new tourist attraction to rival Framlingham Castle: the most expensive white elephant in human history. What this fait accompli means for Suffolk’s rivers and seawater, let alone for the county’s householders and farmers, are not questions that will be answered before building begins. It’s enlightening, in this context, to consider that the past six months have been the driest in Suffolk for more than a quarter of a century, and the driest in England since 1976. “The secretary of state disagrees with the examining authority’s conclusions on this matter,” Wednesday’s decision letter states, “and considers that the uncertainty over the permanent water supply strategy is not a barrier to granting consent to the proposed development.” During last year’s planning hearings, two stories kept coming back to me: the biblical account of Moses in the desert, making water gush from a rock by striking it with his staff; and the Brothers Grimm tale in which a giant clasps a stone in his fist, and crushes it until, finally, water is forced out. • William Atkins is the author of The Immeasurable World: Journeys in Desert Places and The Moor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-271of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-21T15:01:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 271 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-271of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/21/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-271of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 271 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine is to evacuate civilians from recently liberated areas of the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions. Residents of the two southern regions have been advised to move to safer areas in the central and western parts of the country, amid fears that the damage to infrastructure caused by the war is too severe for people to endure the winter. Russian forces launched almost 400 strikes on Sunday in Ukraine’s east as part of a campaign of artillery fire, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Sunday night address. “The fiercest battles, as before, are in the Donetsk region. Although there were fewer attacks today due to worsening weather, the amount of Russian shelling unfortunately remains extremely high,” the Ukraine president said. “In the Luhansk region, we are slowly moving forward while fighting. As of now, there have been almost 400 artillery attacks in the east since the start of the day.” Russia has moved troops to reinforce positions in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions after withdrawing from Kherson. The southern Ukrainian city of Nikopol was hit by Russian shelling overnight, according to city officials. The shelling reportedly hit a residential area injuring a 78-year-old man, the Kyiv Independent reports the city governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, as saying. The UN nuclear watchdog will conduct an assessment of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Monday after the site was shelled more than a dozen times over the weekend. The blasts damaged buildings and equipment, though none had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security, the International Atomic Energy Agency said. Its head, Rafael Grossi, said the forces behind the shelling were “playing with fire”, adding that “it must stop immediately”. The Kremlin said it was concerned by what it claimed was repeated Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It called on global powers to ensure that Kyiv ceased attacks on Europe’s largest nuclear power station. Russia also said that it would bring to justice those responsible for the alleged execution of Russian prisoners of war in Ukraine and that it would do everything possible to draw attention to what it has claimed is a war crime. Russia has accused Ukrainian soldiers of executing more than 10 Russian prisoners of war, citing a video circulating on Russian social media. Ukraine denies the claims, arguing its soldiers were defending themselves against Russians who feigned surrender. The Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights responded on Sunday to videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian soldiers killed after surrendering to Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said “excerpts” of a video showed that Russians “using a staged capture ... committed a war crime by opening fire on the Ukrainian armed forces”. This means the soldiers “cannot be considered prisoners of war”, he said. A UN spokesperson told AFP it was “aware of the videos” and was “looking into them”. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Ukraine’s health system is “facing its darkest days in the war so far”. WHO regional director for Europe, Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, called for a “humanitarian health corridor” to be created to all areas of Ukraine newly recaptured by Kyiv, as well as those occupied by Russian forces. Germany has offered Poland the Patriot missile defence system to help it to secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in the country last week, the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. “We have offered Poland support in securing airspace – with our Eurofighters and with Patriot air defence systems,” Lambrecht told the Rheinische Post and General Anzeiger. Ground-based air defence systems such as Raytheon’s Patriot are built to intercept incoming missiles. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. Russian forces are constructing defensive positions partially staffed by poorly trained mobilised reservists around the Svatove sector in the Luhansk region in north-eastern Ukraine, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. With Russia’s south-western frontline now more readily defendable along the east bank of the Dnipro River, the Svatove sector is likely now a more vulnerable operational flank of the Russian force, the latest British intelligence report reads. A new training centre for Ukrainian troops in the central Spanish city of Toledo will start operating at the end of November, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, told the Nato parliamentary assembly. Spanish police will also be deployed in Ukraine over the coming weeks to help investigate alleged Russian war crimes, Sanchez added. The first Ukrainian supermarket has opened in Kherson since the city was liberated earlier this month. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. Kherson remains without electricity, running water or heating, but residents found some relief in being able to purchase Ukrainian pickled gherkins, dumplings, horseradish and other favourites. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Emmanuel Macron has accused Russia of feeding disinformation to further its “predatory project” in Africa, where France has had military setbacks. In an interview with TV5 Monde on the sidelines of a conference of Francophone nations in Tunisia, the French president said there was a “predatory project” pushing disinformation into African countries, which was “a political project financed by Russia, sometimes others”. Macron said: “A number of powers, who want to spread their influence in Africa, are doing this to hurt France, hurt its language, sow doubts, but above all pursue certain interests.” Forty-five countries and institutions will meet in Paris on Monday to pledge millions of euros of aid for Moldova, as fears mount that it could be further destabilised by the conflict in Ukraine, according to a Reuters report. Moldova, which lies between Ukraine and Romania, has felt the effects of rising food and energy prices as well as an influx of thousands of refugees arriving in the country of about 2.5 million people."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-10T09:00:04Z","webTitle":"Japan’s climate policy ‘failed to build on the legacy of Kyoto’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/10/japan-climate-policy-failed-to-build-on-the-legacy-of-kyoto","fields":{"headline":"Japan’s climate policy ‘failed to build on the legacy of Kyoto’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Apart from the distant buzz of a gardener’s strimmer, all is quiet at the Kyoto International Conference Center, its grey concrete walls matched by the sky on an afternoon in early December. Autumn leaves still cling to branches in the nearby forest, where groups of hikers plot their course in light trousers and T-shirts, as if to remind passersby of why Japan’s ancient capital became synonymous with the climate crisis. The venue – best known for its appearance in the 1974 Robert Mitchum film The Yakuza – is deserted. Its doors are locked and signs dotting its lawns warn non-authorised personnel to keep out. It is a far cry from the frantic activity of 25 years ago, when hundreds of journalists and campaigners, fuelled by coffee and takeaway bento boxes, awaited news of a breakthrough at Cop3 – the world’s first serious attempt to wean itself off fossil fuels. On 11 December 1997, after negotiations that ran through the night, the Kyoto protocol was born, committing 160 parties – later 192 – to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% between 2008 and 2012. The summit’s Japanese hosts hailed the agreement as a major breakthrough – the first time developed and developing countries had signed up to legally binding CO2 reduction targets. “Cop3 was a good start, because it showed that the world had to change,” said Kenro Taura, executive director of Kiko Network, a Kyoto-based NGO. “Until then, most countries were determined to pursue economic growth based around the use of fossil fuels, but Kyoto convinced them that was not the right approach.” The protocol was also an important step towards the Paris climate agreement. Derided by some as a failure because of the US refusal to ratify it, the agreement had some notable successes. It set out a global system of carbon trading, and in establishing many of the technical aspects of carbon accounting that are still in use, in modified forms, today. The “top-down” system of setting countries’ emissions-cutting targets has since been abandoned in favour of “bottom-up” commitments known as nationally determined contributions, but the understanding that rich countries must take responsibility for their historic role in the climate crisis endures, and was one of the flashpoints at last month’s Cop27 UN climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. “The Kyoto protocol is regarded as an important milestone in climate action, as it was the first opportunity for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Japan’s environment ministry said. “In response to the Kyoto protocol, Japan will drive emission reductions not only in Japan but also in developing countries where emissions have increased significantly, thus contributing to the global emission reductions.” The anniversary of the protocol, which came into force in 2005 – minus the US – passed almost unnoticed in its host city this week. Yet the absence of fanfare is misleading. In the quarter of a century since the summit, Kyoto city has positioned itself at the forefront of efforts to address climate change, even if Japan’s government has been found wanting. In 2019, Kyoto became the first Japanese city to announce a net zero target by 2050, and, in March 2021, the first to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, an international campaign to move away from coal-fired power generation. In the two decades after Cop3, Kyoto halved the amount of waste it generated and cut energy consumption by 31%, according to Sayoko Matsumoto, manager of the city’s Do You Kyoto?project – named in honour of former German chancellor Angela Merkel, who used those words during a visit to the city in 2007 as a way of asking people if they were taking action to save the planet. Kyoto was one of four Japanese cities to be named to CDP’s A-List for 2022 in recognition of its “bold action” on climate change. On the 16th of every month, – the date in February 2005 when the protocol went into effect – outdoor lighting is dimmed or turned off, commuters are encouraged to swap their cars for public transport and diners eat in restaurants lit by candles and lamps. “The city feels a responsibility to lead on climate change, and that’s part of the legacy of Cop3,” Matsumoto said. “A lot of people in Kyoto may be too young to remember the actual summit, but they are aware of the climate crisis and the need to cooperate to help Kyoto achieve its net zero target.” Japan’s government, by contrast, has struggled to build on the Cop3 legacy. As of last year, renewables accounted for just over 20% of Japan’s energy generation – significantly lower than Germany (49% in the first half of 2022) and Britain (39%). Nuclear accounts for just under 7%, with coal, oil and liquefied natural gas dominating Japan’s energy generation with a 74% share. Its role in financing major oil, gas and coal projects earned Japan – the world’s fifth-biggest emitter of greenhouses gases – a “fossil award” from the Climate Action Network at the Cop27 summit. More than a decade after the Fukushima crisis forced Japan to close reactors and increase fossil fuel imports, the government is again turning to nuclear to help it achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, to the dismay of environmental campaigners who believe the focus should be on renewables. “The Japanese government is using the ‘we will do it with nuclear’ mantra as a way of delaying real work on climate change,” said Aileen Smith, executive director of Green Action. “Nuclear power is expensive,” Smith said, citing plans by Kansai Electric Power, which serves the region where Kyoto is located, to spend over ¥1tn (£5.9bn) over the next five years on climate change, with 70% of that investment earmarked for the nuclear sector. “It means money will be spent on a less effective, more expensive way of reducing CO2 emissions. And it won’t be that long-lasting, since the nuclear plants are old.” There was little evidence of any desire to burnish Kyoto’s legacy among the Japanese delegation at Cop27. Japan played a low-key role during the two-week conference, supporting moves to reaffirm the global target of limiting greenhouse gas emissions to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, but without taking a significant public stance on the issue. The country’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, did not attend the summit, putting him out of step with more than 100 world leaders who did. Taura said Japan’s enthusiasm for nuclear restarts and cautious embrace of renewables showed that Japan had “learned nothing” from the Kyoto protocol or the triple meltdown in Fukushima. “I think Europe has done more to take action that matches the spirit of the Kyoto protocol,” he said. “But Japan has consistently made the wrong choices. The decision to put increased nuclear power generation at the centre of its climate change policy is another setback to energy conservation and the promotion of renewable energy. Unfortunately, Japan has failed to build on the legacy of Kyoto.” • This article was amended on 12 December 2022. An earlier version referred to an “energy mix”.

Johnson on Monday met executives from major nuclear utilities and technology companies including the UK’s Rolls-Royce, France’s EDF, and the US’s Westinghouse and Bechtel to discuss ways of helping to speed up the development of new nuclear power stations. The UK generates about 16% of its power from nuclear power stations, but several reactors are slated for closure, while electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade. That would mean large investments in new power stations would be required just to keep the share of nuclear constant, let alone increase it to a record level of just over a quarter of electricity use. Also present at the meeting were a series of big pension companies and insurers, including Aviva, Legal &amp; General and Rothesay Life, alongside major foreign investors including Australia’s Macquarie and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Ministers have wrestled for years with how to attract private capital to invest in nuclear – but companies have balked at putting pension and insurance cash at risk. The government is considering changes to insurance rules set by the EU and copied by the UK to make it easier for insurers and pensions to invest. The UK is switching to a “regulated asset base” model, which it hopes will give long-term investors more certainty on returns, a change it hopes will address limitations to the current rules, known as Solvency II. The government wanted to show the nuclear and investment industries that it had a “clear ambition for more nuclear” in part to balance out intermittent renewable power sources, according to a government source briefed on the discussion. Scrutiny of the government’s energy policies has increased in recent months after unprecedented increases in fossil fuel prices. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added to the pressure, with oil and gas prices surging and western allies considering restricting energy exports as they try to isolate president Vladimir Putin’s regime. The prime minister last week met oil and gas executives to discuss increasing investments in the North Sea, and it is understood that he will next week meet executives from the offshore wind industry to discuss plans for further expansion of renewables. According to an aide who was present at the meeting, Johnson told industry heads and financiers that there had been a “chronic absence” of leadership by successive British governments on nuclear energy and that the country was “being left for dead” by other nations, such as France, on the issue. Speaking after the meeting, Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA), said: “Accelerating nuclear projects is absolutely essential to keep energy costs down, cut expensive gas imports and strengthen our energy security as we move towards net zero. “That means urgently investing in a fleet of large and small nuclear stations, alongside renewable investment, to deliver the clean, sovereign power we need.” The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and geopolitical tensions making the government less keen on attracting Chinese investment to Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast. Meanwhile the existing nuclear fleet has been in steady decline, with Hunterston B in Scotland retiring earlier this year, Hinkley Point B in Somerset due to follow suit in the summer, and Heysham I and Hartlepool I due to shut down in 2024. At that point, nuclear capacity is expected to fall as low as 3.6GW. A cross-party group of MPs that campaigns on nuclear issues has called for the government to increase its annual nuclear power capacity to 15GW by 2030 and 30GW by 2050, far above the 12.7GW installed at nuclear power’s peak in 1995. Major obstacles include difficulty in securing funding from private investors and a ban on new nuclear projects in Scotland, imposed by the devolved government, which prevents Hunterston B being replaced. The government is examining a plan to revise the financing model for major projects, which was among the factors that scuppered the Wylfa project in north Wales. Under plans for Sizewell being discussed by Whitehall officials and EDF, the government could take a stake in a development company that will push it through various stages of planning and bureaucracy, sharing the costs with EDF. Private sector investors such as the insurance funds L&amp;G and Aviva would then be lured in at a later stage in return for a government-backed funding model called the regulated asset base (Rab), diluting the taxpayer and EDF. Legislation on Rab funding – the same model used to fund airports such as Heathrow and water companies – is due to progress through parliament next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-493-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-01T00:24:15Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 493 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-493-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-493-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 493 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The top US military officer, Army General Mark Milley, said he was unsurprised that progress in Ukraine’s counteroffensive was slower than some people and computers might have predicted. “This is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks, it’s going to be very difficult. It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody. And no one should have any illusions about any of that,” he said. Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said in an interview published on Friday. CIA director William Burns called Russian spy chief Sergei Naryshkin after last week’s aborted mutiny in Russia to assure the Kremlin that the United States had no role in it, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. The call was the highest-level contact between the two governments since the attempted mutiny, the Wall Street Journal said. Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday he was certain Russian tactical nuclear weapons deployed in his country would never be used. Lukashenko and Russian president Vladimir Putin have acknowledged that some tactical weapons have arrived in Belarus and the remainder would be put in place by the end of the year. “As we move along, we become more and more convinced that they [the weapons] must be stationed here, in Belarus, in a reliable place,” Lukashenko said. A teacher and another employee of a school in the Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. Pope Francis said there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow. Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate (GUR) has claimed. GUR said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. Ukrainian prosecutors charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson, some of them as young as one, Reuters reported. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to several news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-27T00:01:16Z","webTitle":"Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jan/27/ministers-invest-100m-in-edfs-20bn-sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Ministers invest £100m in EDF’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ministers have thrown further support behind EDF Energy’s £20bn Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk with a £100m investment to help develop the project while the company courts private investors. The government’s cash injection is designed to “maximise investor confidence” in the project while French state-owned EDF works towards setting out a funding plan which satisfies investors and UK ministers. In return the government will have rights to an equity stake in the development company behind the project and over the land on which EDF plans to build it. If EDF is able to secure enough investor backing to make a final investment decision on Sizewell it would reimburse the government with a stake in the project or in cash. The UK government reignited talks with EDF over the nuclear project in late 2020, focusing on whether the company could prove it had learned lessons from its Hinkley Point nuclear project in Somerset, and that a successor plant would offer the public value for money. EDF has since embarked on a hunt for investors to help to drive down the cost for bill-payers. It is understood that EDF and the UK government also hope to secure enough new investment to replace Chinese state-controlled CGN, which has a 20% stake in the critical national infrastructure project. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would power 6 million homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary, said the government’s funding would add support to the development of Sizewell C “during this important phase of negotiations as we seek to maximise investor confidence in this nationally significant project”. “In light of high global gas prices, we need to ensure Britain’s future energy supply is bolstered by reliable, affordable, low carbon power that is generated in this country,” he said. “New nuclear is not only an important part of our plans to ensure greater energy independence, but to create high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.” The fresh support has emerged months after the government put forward legislation to create a new funding model to help the project attract investment at a lower cost than the Hinkley Point C project which could add between £10 and £15 a year to the average energy bill for 35 years, making it one of the most expensive energy projects undertaken. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, described the funding as “another big step forward for Sizewell C and a big vote of confidence” which “sends a clear signal from government to investors that it sees projects like Sizewell C as essential to our clean energy transition”. Simone Rossi, the chief executive of EDF Energy, said the company is pleased that the government is “showing its confidence in Sizewell C” which would “allow us to continue to move the project towards a financial investment decision”. Rossi claimed that Sizewell C, if approved, would lower energy costs for consumers and help to insulate the UK from global gas prices while providing a “huge economic boost to east Suffolk” and “bring new opportunities for thousands of nuclear supply chain companies up and down the country”. Alison Downes, from Suffolk campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: “We fail to understand why the UK is bailing out crisis-hit EDF, and why the government is so committed to poor value large scale nuclear when there are other, better options.” EDF’s share price has slumped by almost half in the last three years to about €8.28 a share as technical trouble within its global nuclear fleet has caused its costs to spiral. It warned investors earlier this month that its French nuclear reactors would produce 10% less electricity than expected this year. Separately, the French government expects the company to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households from rocketing energy costs by limiting bill hikes to 4% this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-338-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-27T14:58:08Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 338 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-338-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/27/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-338-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 338 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine’s army claims to have killed 109 Russian soldiers and wounded a further 188 in one day during fighting around the village of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk oblast. Serhii Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for the eastern operational command of the Ukrainian armed forces, said the bloody death toll was recorded on Thursday, adding “Fierce fighting is ongoing. The enemy is indeed trying to achieve an intermediate success there, but thanks to the efforts of our defenders, they are unsuccessful.” Poland will send an additional 60 tanks to Ukraine on top of the 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks it has already pledged, the former’s prime minister has said. Mateusz Morawiecki has told CTV News “we are ready to send 60 of our modernised tanks, 30 of them PT-91. And on top of those tanks, 14 tanks, Leopard 2 tanks, from in our possession.” Belgium has announced a package of an additional €93.6m (£84.5m / $104.7m) in military aid for Ukraine. Federal prime minister Alexander De Croo said that, taking into account previous spending, it amounted to the biggest ever military aid package given to another country by Belgium. The package will include surface-to-air missiles, anti-tank weapons, machine guns, grenades and munition. Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who visited Ukraine last week, said IAEA monitors reported powerful explosions near Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Thursday and renewed calls for a security zone around the plant. Ukrainian civilians had raced for cover on Thursday as Russia fired a barrage of missiles and drones across the country, killing at least 11 people, a day after Kyiv won pledges of battlefield tanks to combat Moscow’s invasion from western countries. Ukraine’s state broadcaster reported that ten regions of Ukraine are using emergency power outages due to a power shortage in the network after Thursday’s Russian attacks, and the restoration of damaged facilities is ongoing. The Kremlin said on Friday that US President Joe Biden had the key to end the conflict in Ukraine by directing Kyiv to settle, but that Washington had so far not been willing to use it. “The key to the Kyiv regime is largely in the hands of Washington,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in his usual daily briefing. “Now we see that the current White House leader ... does not want to use this key. On the contrary, he chooses the path of further pumping weapons into Ukraine,” he added. Lynne Tracy, the new US ambassador to Russia, will not improve ties between Washington and Moscow because the former is engaging in a “hybrid war” against the latter, the Russian foreign ministry’s spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Friday. The ambassador’s appointment comes as relations between Russia and the US are at historical lows. Zakharova said Tracy’s room for manoeuvre would be limited due to what she said was fierce anti-Russian bipartisan feeling in the United States. The European Union wants swift accountability for “horrific” crimes in Ukraine, EU justice ministers have said. But the member states differ over the methods in a debate about how to bring prosecutions, seek evidence or fund war damage repairs, Reuters reports. The bloc’s 27 justice ministers met in Stockholm, where they discussed collecting evidence as well as setting up a new international tribunal to prosecute Moscow’s aggression. Gunnar Strommer, Sweden’s justice minister, said “Nobody doing this kind of war crimes shall go free. It’s very, very important that we will find a way to hold responsible people accountable.” Ukrainian government officials who shirk their duties during wartime will be quickly removed, a top aide to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday amid a crack down on corruption. More than a dozen officials have been removed this week after a series of scandals and graft allegations. Political analysts said Zelenskiy needs to show western partners and war-weary Ukrainians that he is serious about punishing misrule. Russia is violating the “fundamental principles of child protection” in wartime by giving Ukrainian children Russian passports and putting them up for adoption, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) chief Filippo Grandi has said. “Giving them nationality or having them adopted goes against the fundamental principles of child protection in situations of war,” Grandi said. Grandi said his agency was unable to estimate the number of children who had been given passports or put up for adoption, as access in Russia was extremely limited. Russia has said accusations Ukrainian children have been abducted are false. A 74-year-old Spanish man arrested over a spate of letter bombs sent to institutions including the prime minister’s office and the Ukrainian Embassy in Madrid in late 2022 was trying to pressure Spain to drop its support for Ukraine, an investigating magistrate said on Friday. The man was remanded in custody as he was considered a flight risk to Russia. Tass is reporting that the occupied Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are to be ordered to use Moscow time instead of Kyiv time. Hungary will veto any European Union sanctions against Russia affecting nuclear energy, the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, told state radio on Friday. Ukraine has called on the 27-nation EU to include Russian state nuclear energy company Rosatom in sanctions but Hungary, which has a Russian-built nuclear plant it plans to expand with Rosatom, has blocked that. Reuters reports that Orbán reiterated in an interview that sanctions on nuclear energy “must obviously be vetoed”. “We will not allow the plan to include nuclear energy into the sanctions be implemented,” the Hungarian premier said. “This is out of the question.” The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has met the Eritrean president, Isaias Afwerki, during a tour of African nations to shore up support for Russia, focusing on the “dynamics of the war in Ukraine”, Eritrea’s information minister has said. Ukraine would not rule out boycotting the Olympic Games if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete in the Paris 2024 Games, its sports minister said. Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese on Friday reiterated Australian support for Ukraine and criticised supporters of Russia’s invasion after a video emerged showing Novak Djokovic’s father posing at the Australian Open with fans holding Russian flags, Reuters reports. Police questioned four fans seen with “inappropriate flags and symbols” after a quarter-final match on Wednesday between Russia’s Andrey Rublev and favourite Djokovic, organisers Tennis Australia said. Russia’s communications regulator Roskomnadzor says it has blocked the websites of the CIA and FBI, accusing the two US government agencies of spreading false information. Russian authorities designated the independent news outlet Meduza an “undesirable organisation” on Thursday, effectively outlawing the site from operating in Russia and banning any Russian from cooperating with Meduza or its journalists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/17/chancellor-extends-energy-windfall-tax-low-carbon-generators","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T15:24:17Z","webTitle":"Chancellor extends energy windfall tax to ‘low carbon’ generators","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/17/chancellor-extends-energy-windfall-tax-low-carbon-generators","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/17/chancellor-extends-energy-windfall-tax-low-carbon-generators","fields":{"headline":"Chancellor extends energy windfall tax to ‘low carbon’ generators","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Jeremy Hunt hopes to raise £14bn next year after increasing the windfall tax on oil and gas companies and reining in the profits of low carbon electricity generators. The chancellor also confirmed that the existing windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators, the energy profits levy (EPL), will be raised from 25% to 35% and extended by two years, until March 2028. From 1 January, a tax will also apply to “low carbon electricity generators”, including wind, solar and nuclear, levied at 45%. This is higher than the 40% rate trailed before the budget. Hunt said he expected the two taxes to raise £14bn next year. Treasury officials will meet energy bosses on Friday to discuss the proposals. Shares in the power station owners Centrica, Drax and SSE initially fell sharply moments after Hunt’s announcement, but later rallied as it emerged that the energy generator levy would be less onerous than feared. Oil and gas stocks were broadly unmoved. The chancellor said that most countries were still paying for the consequences of the pandemic and that this had been worsened “by a made-in-Russia energy crisis”. He had “no objection to windfall taxes if they are genuinely about windfall profits caused by unexpected increases in energy prices. But any such tax should be temporary, not deter investment and recognise the cyclical nature of energy businesses”. The surge in gas prices, in part fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has handed a surprise lift in profits to oil and gas companies, and generators including nuclear and biomass power stations and windfarms. The changes mean the EPL will raise a further £20bn over the next six years, to £40bn in total. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that oil and gas tax receipts, including the energy profits levy, will reach £14.9bn this financial year, double its March forecast. It said estimates for 2023-24 had quadrupled, to £20.7bn including £10.8bn. “The latter would be an all-time high for oil and gas revenues in cash terms, and the highest as a share of GDP since 1985-86,” it said, adding that volatility in energy prices meant these revenues are “particularly uncertain”. However, the energy profits levy has been criticised as it does not extend to the excess cash generated by oil and gas giants’ trading, refining and forecourts divisions. Hunt did not alter the levy to reach these windfalls. Alice Harrison, fossil fuels campaign leader at Global Witness, said: “This so called windfall tax and budget doesn’t go anywhere near what’s needed to protect UK citizens that are being dragged into poverty, and barely touches the sides of the immense profits that energy companies have been amassing.” The OBR said onshore corporation tax, including the electricity generator levy, should raise £9.9bn next year. The levy is forecast to raise £14.4bn from 2022 to 2028. The generator levy was not as onerous as companies and investors had feared. The tax will be levied on “extraordinary profits”, made on electricity sold above £75 per megawatt hour. Power currently trades around £260 per MWh. Energy consultancy Aurora said future UK power prices are trading around £350/MWh and are forecast to remain above £225/MWh, making the levy more generous than the EU’s €180/MWh revenue cap. The government resisted calls to levy the tax on gas-fired power plants, which have also seen a rise in profits, arguing they were seeing higher costs and were exposed to “unique market risks”. Hydroelectric and battery storage facilities, oil and coal power stations were also omitted. The move to restrict profits on electricity generators represents a departure from the former prime minister Liz Truss’s plan to cap the revenues of renewable and nuclear power producers from next year, which would have been in line with the EU’s “revenue cap”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/2023/mar/03/walter-murgatroyd-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-03T20:10:08Z","webTitle":"Walter Murgatroyd obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2023/mar/03/walter-murgatroyd-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2023/mar/03/walter-murgatroyd-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Walter Murgatroyd obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"My father, Walter Murgatroyd, who has died aged 101, worked for many years as a researcher in the field of civilian nuclear engineering before becoming disillusioned with the industry’s inability to properly deal with its waste. He then switched to working on thermal power, exploring how to use energy more efficiently and to generate it in new ways. Walter was born in Bradford to Harry, who worked in textile manufacturing, and Martha (nee Strachan), a housewife. He was educated at Blackpool grammar school, after which the second world war interrupted his engineering studies at Cambridge University; he was sent to work on designing engines for fighter jets, first with Hawker Siddeley and then with Rolls-Royce. After the war Walter resumed his studies, staying on at Cambridge to research and design pumps for liquid metals, using electromagnetism rather than moving parts in contact with the dangerous and corrosive fluids. In austerity Britain he required great ingenuity to obtain the necessary materials and craftsmanship for his work. In 1954 he joined the newly formed Atomic Energy Research Establishment as principal scientific officer, responsible for assessment of the various types of nuclear reactor then in development and tasked with working out what resources would be needed. Two years later he was appointed head of nuclear engineering at Queen Mary College in east London (now Queen Mary University of London) – the first such chair in Europe. While there he helped to build an experimental reactor in the Lea valley in London on what many years later was to become part of the 2012 Olympic park. When work began on the site, no trace was found of any radiation, making it one of the safest parts of the otherwise heavily polluted area. By 1968 he had become frustrated with the politics and vested interests of nuclear power generation, in particular the lack of progress on waste disposal, and decided to move away from the sector by becoming chair in thermal power at Imperial College London. There he foresaw the end of the era of cheap fossil fuels, recognising the need to reduce demand for energy – whether by curtailing economic growth, or by using energy more efficiently. He remained at Imperial College until retirement in the early 1980s, and over that period was often called on (via the United Nations or British Council) to advise on energy matters abroad. He was also asked to provide expertise to the energy select committee of the House of Commons. Walter was a good judge of character, and always knew the right questions to ask. Music was hugely important to him, and he could also be great fun. His strong regard for truth and personal integrity gained him wide respect, though it did not always make life easy. He married Denise Schlumberger in 1952; she died in 2014, and their son Alan died in a car crash in 1980. Walter is survived by two other children, Linda and Francis, and three grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T18:33:26Z","webTitle":"US will soon need to deter two major nuclear powers for first time, White House says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/12/nuclear-weapons-russia-china-us-national-security-strategy","fields":{"headline":"US will soon need to deter two major nuclear powers for first time, White House says","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Within a decade, the US will need to deter two major nuclear weapons powers for the first time, the Biden administration has warned, pointing to the Russian arsenal that is increasingly being brandished by Moscow and an expanding Chinese stockpile. The president’s new national security strategy (NSS) depicts China as the most capable long-term competitor, but Russia as the more immediate, disruptive threat, pointing to its nuclear posturing over Ukraine. It warns that threat could grow as Russian forces continue to suffer defeats on the battlefield. “Russia’s conventional military will have been weakened, which will likely increase Moscow’s reliance on nuclear weapons in its military planning,” the strategy blueprint says. Its publication was scheduled in the spring but was postponed because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin has threatened to use “all means” to defend Russian territory, in which he included Crimea, annexed in 2014, and four Ukrainian regions he now claims. The NSS pledges US support for Ukrainian resistance would not be affected by such threats. “The United States will not allow Russia, or any power, to achieve its objectives through using, or threatening to use, nuclear weapons,” the document says. In a foreword, Biden makes a distinction between the types of threats posed by Moscow and Beijing. “Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open international system, recklessly flouting the basic laws of the international order today, as its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine has shown,” the president writes. He describes China, on the other hand as “the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military and technological power to advance that objective”. The policy document portrays Beijing as “America’s most consequential geopolitical challenge”. “The People’s Republic of China harbors the intention and, increasingly, the capacity to reshape the international order in favor of one that tilts the global playing field to its benefit, even as the United States remains committed to managing the competition between our countries responsibly,” it says. China has an estimated 350 nuclear warheads, according to an assessment by the Federation of American Scientists, compared with 5,977 in Russia’s stockpile, against the US inventory of 5,428. However, the Pentagon believes the Chinese force will grow to more than 1,000 warheads by 2030, making it a third major nuclear power. Under the last remaining major arms control agreement in place, the New Start treaty, the US and Russia observe a ceiling of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads, referring to those warheads mounted on land or sea-launched missiles, or ready for loading on to long-range bombers. Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association, expressed concern over whether the new language in the strategy document could herald a rethink about the size of the US arsenal. “If we have to worry about two near-peer nuclear rivals by the year 2030, what does that mean for the number of targets in Russia and China that the president believes we need to hold at risk to deter those nuclear threats? And how does that affect that total number of strategic nuclear weapons the United States and the president believes he needs to deploy?” Kimball asked. “They’re basically looking at issues and questions that could lead to a larger number calculation,” he said, adding: “It’s not hard science. It could be more; it could be less. I would argue that even if China has twice the number of nuclear weapons, we still can and should reduce the total number of strategic nuclear weapons because what we have is excessive of any reasonable calculation of what it takes to deter a nuclear attack.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T13:25:05Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant plans have not been scrapped, says No 10","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/nov/04/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-plan-under-review-as-uk-seeks-spending-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Sizewell C nuclear plant plans have not been scrapped, says No 10","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Downing Street has said plans to build a new nuclear power plant in Suffolk have not been scrapped as part of a drive to make sweeping government spending cuts. Sizewell C, which would sit alongside the existing Sizewell B nuclear reactor on the Suffolk coast if built, was expected to provide up to 7% of the UK’s electricity needs and plug a looming gap in Britain’s nuclear capabilities. The BBC reported on Friday that the government had put the project under review and it could be delayed or even axed entirely. However, Rishi Sunak’s spokesperson told reporters: “Our position on Sizewell C has not changed. We hope to get a deal over the line as soon as possible. There are negotiations ongoing. I can’t get into detail of those, but negotiations have been constructive.” However, Grant Shapps, the business secretary, gave a firm indication that a pledge from Liz Truss, Sunak’s predecessor as prime minister, to eventually connect northern towns and cities from Hull to Liverpool through Bradford will at the very least be scaled back. “There wasn’t really much point in going and blasting new tunnels through the Pennines … It’s not true to say we’re not delivering on what we said we would do on levelling up the north,” he told the BBC. When complete, the reactor, which was estimated to cost £30bn, with taxpayers expected to foot about a fifth of that in partnership with private funding, was expected to generate electricity for 6m homes for up to 60 years. The BBC said a government official had told them: “We are reviewing every major project, including Sizewell C.” Plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail, a high-speed line across the north of England sometimes referred to unofficially as High Speed 3, are also under review. The review of major projects comes as Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, prepare to announce tax and spending plans on 17 November. The Sizewell C site is one of eight new nuclear reactors that the former prime minister Boris Johnson had planned to give the green light to over the next eight years. Last month Truss, who was then prime minister, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, pledged “full support” for Sizewell C, which is to be jointly developed by the French energy company EDF. Most UK nuclear power plants will be shut by 2030 – Sizewell B is due to close in 2035 – and the energy crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine has put the focus on national energy security solutions. While campaigning for the Conservative leadership in the summer, Sunak pledged to uphold Johnson’s plan to build eight new reactors. He also argued in favour of reforming licensing laws to allow the government to build more nuclear plants in an attempt to achieve energy independence by 2045. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: “If the government turns its back on [Sizewell C], they will be breaking all of the promises they have made, and undermining our vital nuclear industry.” But Alison Downes of the Stop Sizewell C campaign said: “Sizewell C can only offer short-term pain – with more money on our energy bills – for long-term pain, with huge uncertainty about cost and time, to deliver electricity that is far more expensive than renewables. There is no way Sizewell C offers the hard-stretched public purse value for money.” The government said that some major infrastructure projects were forging ahead, such as the rail line HS2, with one nuclear project set to be approved. “HS2 is under way, within budget, and supporting 28,000 jobs,” a spokesperson for the Treasury said. “We are also seeking to approve at least one large-scale nuclear project in the next few years and aim to speed up the delivery of about 100 major infrastructure projects across the UK.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:11:38Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 270 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-270-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 270 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “playing with fire”, the UN nuclear watchdog’s director general has said. It comes after a series of explosions in the area overnight, which damaged buildings and equipment. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) boss, Rafael Grossi, said none of the blasts had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security. But he said that whoever was behind the attacks, “it must stop immediately”, adding: “You’re playing with fire.” Ukraine and Russia blamed each other for the attacks The Ukrainian operator of the nuclear power plant said on Telegram that Russian forces were behind “targeted” shelling on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom had earlier accused Ukraine of shelling at the plant, which is under Russian occupation. Ukraine will investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops. Moscow has said videos circulating on social media show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said Ukrainian authorities would investigate the footage but it was “very unlikely” that the clips showed what Russia claims. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. Nearly 45,000 criminal proceedings have been initiated over crimes allegedly committed by Russian service personnel during the invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian national police have said. An update published on Sunday said 47 places had been identified where Russian forces are accused of illegally detaining and torturing Ukrainians. They include places in liberated regions including Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv. There are more signs of life starting to return to a modicum of normality in Kherson as supermarkets are reopening. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. The city was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces after a Russian retreat. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Rishi Sunak made an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Saturday to meet Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy – Sunak’s first visit to the country since taking office. Sunak announced that Britain would provide a £50m air defence package for Ukraine, including anti-aircraft guns and technology to counter Iranian-supplied drones. Zelenskiy thanked Sunak, for his support and tweeted: “With friends like you by our side, we are confident in our victory. Both of our nations know what it means to stand up for freedom.” Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children have been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. Five people were injured in a Russian strike on a humanitarian station in southern Ukraine, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior aide to Zelenskiy. Nine people, including four children, died in a suspected gas explosion in a residential building in Russia’s Sakhalin island, the local governor said. About 60 Russian soldiers were killed in a long-range Ukrainian artillery attack this week, Kyiv said on Saturday. In a Facebook post, the armed forces general staff said Russia sustained the losses on Thursday when Ukrainian forces shelled the town of Mykhailkva, 40km to the south of Kherson. Russian forces abandoned the city earlier this month. Kyiv is in a “critical situation” with power shortages and faces hours-long blackouts, officials say, amid Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. But the energy ministry said on Saturday that Ukrainian electricity supplies were under control and there was no need to panic. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the supply problems were worst in and around Kyiv as well as in six other regions. “We are working throughout the country to stabilise the situation,” he said in a video address. Ukrainian forces could be in Crimea by the end of December, the country’s deputy defence minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, has said. The UK Ministry of Defence released its latest intelligence update on the war Ukraine. Russia made its largest single-day issuance of debt in history on Wednesday, it said. The first passenger train to the recently liberated Kherson city arrived from Kyiv for the first time since Russian troops occupied the southern Ukrainian city. The funeral took place on Saturday of a Polish man who was one of two people killed when a missile crashed into a grain storage facility in the Polish village of Przewodow. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said China and Russia were seeking a world where force is used to resolve disputes, and he vowed that the United States would continue to defend humanitarian principles and international law. Asia-Pacific leaders added their voices on Saturday to international pressure on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, issuing a summit statement saying “most” of them condemned the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-27T00:05:10Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is back in the game, but remains a distant prospect for UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power is back in the game, but remains a distant prospect for UK","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Compared to some of his pet projects – the bridge across the Irish Sea or a floating airport in the Thames – Boris Johnson’s plan to get 25% of UK electricity from nuclear power plants by 2050 isn’t all that fanciful. The same mark was reached within living memory, after the commissioning of Sizewell B in 1995. If the climate crisis weren’t reason enough, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has crystallised the case for any energy technology that allows us to eschew fossil fuels supplied by foreign despots. This week, the prime minister is expected to outline his plan to make the UK more energy self-sufficient, with nuclear likely to be a key component. Charging at full pelt towards a nuclear future is far from straightforward, though, if history is anything to go by. Even when the UK did produce a quarter of its electricity from nukes, the journey there was long and bumpy. Sizewell B was hooked up to the national grid in 1995, but it was first announced in 1969, with spades only breaking ground in 1986. More recently, the industry has been in steady decline. Since that mid-90s peak, capacity has fallen from nearly 13GW to 6.8GW, about 16-18% of the electricity mix. Hunterston B retired this year, Hinkley Point B bows out this summer and by the time Hartlepool I and Heysham I come off grid in 2024, nuclear capacity will have fallen to a paltry 3.6GW, a mere 5-6% of what you’d need at 6pm on a cold weekday in winter. Hinkley Point C is due to recoup 3.2GW of lost ground but only by 2027, assuming no fresh delays. It is not nearly enough to get close to Johnson’s target. That will require the successful execution of nearly every nuclear project to have been mooted in recent years, including some that have struggled to get going so far. It would probably mean extending the life of Sizewell B and giving the go-ahead for Sizewell C, which stalled when the government got cold feet about Chinese involvement. Wylfa on Anglesey, paused after Japanese firm Hitachi pulled out in 2020 citing lack of government investment, would need to be thrown into the mix. Factor in, too, Rolls-Royce’s “mini-nuke” small reactors, which have state backing but carry the risk of novelty. Some of the GE Hitachi partnership’s own small reactors might need to be included too. All of that gets you to about 15GW, likely to fall below 25% of demand in 2050, once you consider that the drive towards net zero will involve significant electrification, of home heating and vehicles, in order to decarbonise. Some in the nuclear industry are daring to breathe the names of semi-mythical locations such as Oldbury and Moorside, where large-scale nuclear projects were abandoned but could be raised from their slumber. The government, previously cordial but cool towards nuclear, appears to be warming to such ideas, minds focused by sky-high fossil fuel prices. As Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, says: “It has reminded people why a significant reliance on something traded internationally [oil and gas] isn’t a good place to be.” There are fences to jump. Financing problems have put paid to major projects in the past. The Treasury still hasn’t rubber-stamped proposals for a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model, which could spur private investment by transferring some of the risk of multibillion-pound projects to the taxpayer. The UK must also resolve the “taxonomy” issue, already sorted in the EU, which determines whether nuclear is suitable for investment funds using environmental and social criteria. There is also a question mark over the number of skilled engineers available, particularly if the nuclear push is replicated across Europe. But George Borovas, head of the nuclear practice at global law firm Hunton Andrew’s Kurth, believes the UK is among the best-placed countries in the world to go nuclear. “The UK has done the preliminary work, it’s done the site evaluation, it has a sophisticated regulator, good heavy industry and an existing fleet. I’ve always thought the UK was a great place for new nuclear.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2022/feb/14/nine-days-in-one-year-review-enduringly-powerful-soviet-drama","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-14T10:00:14Z","webTitle":"Nine Days in One Year review – enduringly powerful Soviet nuclear power drama","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/14/nine-days-in-one-year-review-enduringly-powerful-soviet-drama","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2022/feb/14/nine-days-in-one-year-review-enduringly-powerful-soviet-drama","fields":{"headline":"Nine Days in One Year review – enduringly powerful Soviet nuclear power drama","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the French New Wave was starting to crest, and with the Cuban missile crisis just under a year away, Soviet film-maker Mikhail Romm directed what might have been the nuclear physicists’ version of Jules et Jim. This was the very intriguing Nine Days in One Year, now restored for its 60th anniversary. It’s a poignant love triangle, a story of broken hearts represented, in a rather David Nicholls-ish device, by the events of nine separate days over one year in the romantic lives of those whose duty was to the Soviet motherland – and to the great cause of the USSR gaining nuclear power. Dmitri Gusev, played by Aleksey Batalov, is a dedicated scientist working on thermonuclear physics in Siberia, whose work has for years taken him away from his humble family in the country. His more playful and worldly scientist friend Ilya (Innokenty Smoktunovsky) is back in Moscow. They are both in love with the same woman: the passionate, focused, beautiful scientist Lyolya (Tatyana Lavrova). At the beginning of the story, Lyolya and Ilya are engaged to be married, but a visit to her former lover Dimitri reveals to Lyolya his heroic dedication and the fact that he has endangered his life with potentially fatal irradiation. Aware of a certain kind of patriotic and personal vocation, Lyolya nobly resolves to marry Dimitri instead, but Ilya, masking his feelings with a certain kind of cynical gaiety, remains in their lives, perhaps sensing Lyolya’s frustration and unhappiness in her marriage. There is a dark, shadowy expressionism in the film, an occult sense of mystery and danger in the underground corridors of the lab. Irradiation is maybe a metaphor for lovesickness, but perhaps the symbol only works if we understand love to mean love of science, or love of country. This is a story of people who unquestioningly sacrifice personal considerations for the Soviet nuclear cause, and yet this lost love looms alongside the Soviet Union’s nuclear destiny with equal potency. • Nine Days in One Year is screening on 15 February at the Institut Français in London."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-07T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Hunterston B nuclear power station retires after 46 years in service","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jan/07/hunterston-b-nuclear-power-station-retires-after-46-years-in-service","fields":{"headline":"Hunterston B nuclear power station retires after 46 years in service","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Hunterston B nuclear power station will shut down for ever at noon on Friday after 46 years of service, reducing the UK’s nuclear capacity by one-eighth and prompting calls from the industry for greater government backing for the sector. The plant, on the west coast of Scotland, provided one gigawatt of the UK’s 7.9GW nuclear capacity, enough to power to 1.7m homes. But Hunterston B has lasted 20 years beyond its initial planned shutdown date and is one of several nuclear power plants being taken out of commission within several years of each other. The rapid pace of the decommissioning schedule has raised concerns about maintaining electricity generation. About 20% of Britain’s supply is provided by nuclear power from 15 reactors, which help provide a constant baseload to make up for shortfalls when electricity generation from renewables drops on windless days or when the sun is not shining. Almost half of the country’s nuclear capacity is scheduled for retirement by 2025 with the closure of Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B, Hartlepool 1 and Heysham 1. While more renewable energy will have been brought online by then and other fuel sources such as gas can fill in the gaps, the remaining 3.6GW of nuclear capacity would only be able to meet 6% of peak demand forecast for this winter. At its peak between 1995 and 1999, nuclear capacity hit nearly 13GW, about a quarter of the UK’s electricity needs. EDF is due to finish its 3.2GW plant Hinkley Point C, Britain’s first new nuclear power station in 20 years, by 2027. The first of its two reactors is scheduled to come online a year before that. The Nuclear Industry Association, which represents companies across the civil nuclear supply chain, estimates that the national capacity could reach 14.25GW by 2035, depending on whether £1.7bn in funding for the proposed Sizewell C plant is confirmed and the Wylfa Newydd project on Anglesey can attract investors. Development is likely to hinge upon government plans for a new financial framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, which would lock in higher returns for institutions funding nuclear plants and transfer risk to taxpayers. The NIA’s projection for the growth of nuclear also depends on the scale of the rollout of Rolls-Royce’s small modular reactors (SMRs), which have received £210m of government funds and £280m from private capital. The association criticised a decision by the Scottish government to bar new nuclear projects in Scotland, saying the gap left by Hunterston B would have to be filled in part with imported gas sourced from volatile global markets. This would drive up consumer bills, hamper emissions reduction plans and threaten Scotland’s energy security, it added. Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the NIA, said: “Hunterston B has shown the best of what nuclear can provide for Scotland – clean, reliable power to keep the lights on and save our planet, and long-term, skilled jobs on which people can build a life and a family. “The dedicated staff who have helped keep Scottish homes warm and light for 46 years deserve our gratitude. As the current energy crisis demonstrates, without nuclear the cost of the electricity we rely on is higher, causes pollution and leaves us reliant on burning imported fossil fuels. That’s why we need new nuclear – to get to net zero and provide the reliable, secure and clean power to live our lives.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2021/nov/02/questions-remain-over-the-uks-nuclear-power-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-02T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"Questions remain over the UK’s nuclear power plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/nov/02/questions-remain-over-the-uks-nuclear-power-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/nov/02/questions-remain-over-the-uks-nuclear-power-plans","fields":{"headline":"Questions remain over the UK’s nuclear power plans","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In 2007, Vincent de Rivaz, the then EDF chief executive, said Britain would be “cooking our Christmas turkeys” with electricity from Hinkley Point C nuclear station by 2017. Instead the first concrete was poured that year and the turkey is now scheduled for late 2026. In the race against time to avert dangerous global heating, the UK government has decided to back an untried reactor from Rolls Royce. The first of these could be “plugged into the grid by 2031”, according to Nuclear Industry Association. Internationally average planning time for reactor proposals is 10 years, plus another decade for building, and that is for already proven designs. The 16 planned Rolls Royce reactors are still on the drawing board. The arguments about where they could be sited are beginning. Apart from other possible objections the favoured UK coastal locations are vulnerable to sea level rise, erosion and storms. Faced with the well-documented delays and drawbacks to nuclear programmes it is perhaps not surprising that there is no other country taking part in the Cop26 process in Glasgow relying on multiple new nuclear reactors to get to net zero carbon targets by 2050. Even without our plentiful opportunities to exploit wind, solar, wave and tidal power many countries feel they do not need nuclear power to reach their goals."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/31/is-it-time-to-abandon-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-31T17:19:13Z","webTitle":"Is it time to abandon the nuclear non-proliferation treaty? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/31/is-it-time-to-abandon-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/31/is-it-time-to-abandon-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty","fields":{"headline":"Is it time to abandon the nuclear non-proliferation treaty?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Last week, Jacinda Ardern wrote of growing scepticism about the intention of the nuclear weapon states to ever implement their nuclear disarmament commitments under article VI of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), despite the threat of nuclear catastrophe being greater than ever (The world stands on a nuclear precipice – we must avoid catastrophe, 24 August). That scepticism has been more than justified by the utter failure of the NPT review conference to agree even a weak final document, with fine words about their “unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals” but no commitment to physical steps towards that end. The primary blame has been laid on Russia, but it is shared by all of the nuclear-armed states. Russia was not alone in derailing this conference. It was fully aligned with the other NPT countries in actively preventing any meaningful commitment to advance nuclear disarmament, stop nuclear threats, or reduce nuclear risks from being included in the outcome document. For decades, those of us in the peace movement have pinned our hopes of averting Armageddon on article VI being implemented in “good faith”, but the latest setback is forcing a rethink. Should we abandon the NPT and go for direct action? Perhaps the only way to break the deadlock is for one of the major nuclear-armed powers to break ranks by declaring that nuclear weapons do not give security, but, on the contrary, their continued existence threatens all of us. Does anyone really believe that the immediate response from another nuclear weapon state would be: “Oh, good, now we can chuck a nuke at X with impunity; let’s do it”? The first global leader who makes that declaration, really means it, and implements the necessary practical steps, will go down in history as the greatest statesperson of all time. Who will rise to that challenge? Frank Jackson Former co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign • New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was correct to call for the elimination of all nuclear weapons, but made no mention of closing off the route to more nations obtaining such weapons, which will require the elimination of nuclear power too. The Ukraine war has shown how close we might be to the use of battlefield nuclear weapons in Europe, but has also made clear the danger inherent in ownership of nuclear power plants. The possibility of widespread radioactive pollution induced by the destruction of nuclear power stations during a war or act of terrorism was once seen as fanciful. However, events in Ukraine have shown that it is not (Revealed: Russian plan to disconnect Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from grid, 24 August). To tackle both these nuclear dangers requires two steps. Step one involves the reduction, then eventual elimination, of nuclear weapons, in a way that gives nuclear nations the confidence to do so. Jonathan Schell, in his book The Abolition, explained how to achieve this by what he termed “weaponless deterrence”. He proposed allowing nuclear states to keep the infrastructure to remake nuclear weapons should there be any verified threat of a new nation obtaining them. This approach will underpin global pressure to halt any aspiring nuclear nation, since such weapons are in the process of being negotiated away. The second step will be a parallel programme to eliminate nuclear power, since this is the likely source of such a spread.

Urgent measures are needed but, instead of taking action, the cabinet is absorbed in a pointless argument that wrongly pits the energy bill crisis against our climate commitments. In reality, the best way of bringing down bills is to get off gas for good. We can take immediate steps to stop using gas because the UK has clean energy sources that can get going quickly, and are cheap and popular – wind and solar in particular. But at a time when they should be powering up the UK with renewables, ministers have other ideas: suggesting deepening our reliance on fossils fuels by opening up more drilling in the UK; or labouring under the misapprehension that people would rather live near a nuclear power plant than a wind turbine. The government’s tug of war over onshore wind is particularly puzzling. Onshore wind is clean, cheap and extremely popular, with the government’s own polling showing support from four out of five people in the UK. Far from considering them an “eyesore” as some Tory MPs and ministers worry, a Survation poll last year found that people who live near existing windfarms are the most supportive of all. Yet a major cause of the past month’s delay in getting the energy strategy out appears to be the government’s utterly unfounded concern that people don’t like onshore wind, and their mistaken belief that removing the virtual ban on new wind projects in England would provoke huge resistance from Conservative voters. The government removed support for onshore wind in 2015 following pressure from a group of Conservative MPs, some of whom have since changed their minds, left parliament or moved on to other pet peeves. The dislike for visible renewable energy projects from a fraction of the Conservative backbenches has always been out of step with public opinion, which has been consistently behind renewable energy, including onshore wind. Even a decade ago, two-thirds of people supported onshore wind, with support steadily rising to the 80% at which it currently stands. The British public know that clean energy is the way out of this crisis but, as they watch their energy bills shoot up and face the dismal prospect of cold homes, all they can see is their government dithering and delaying on the clean energy sources that are the quickest and easiest solution. Instead of fixing this crisis with renewable energy, ministers are reportedly thinking of pursuing nuclear power. Ministers recently tried and failed to argue that onshore wind is too expensive, yet they seem quite happy to argue for bill payers to shoulder the cost of nuclear power, which is about twice as high per unit of electricity as onshore wind. Given the urgency with which we need to clean up our energy supply and cut energy bills, the sluggish timeframes for new nuclear power projects risk leaving people at the mercy of gas markets for far too long. Wind projects commissioned now can be up and running before the end of next year, while the most recent nuclear projects, announced in 2010, won’t produce any energy until 2026 at the earliest. It is hardly surprising that nuclear power is much less popular than onshore wind, with just a third of people thinking that nuclear power would be affordable and even fewer thinking it is safe. If the government believes that new nuclear plants will be an easier sell to people than onshore wind on cost or local impacts, they could be in for an unpleasant shock. Ministers who insist that the UK’s energy strategy must prioritise community consent are right. Now they must also recognise that any plan to rush forward with an unpopular, slow and expensive energy source, while keeping the brakes on clean, cheap and quick onshore wind, is unlikely to gain support. It is time for the government to start listening to what people actually want, which is appropriately placed renewable energy projects that support local people and the local environment and for communities to have a say on the infrastructure in their area. The energy strategy is a vital chance to make this a reality. If the government gets this wrong, we’ll be living in cold homes on a hot planet. If they get it right, this could be the last energy crisis we ever have.

Vladimir Putin has said Russia is ready to resume gas supplies via one link of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that remains operational. The ball was now in the EU’s court on whether it wanted gas supplied via it, the Russian president said in his address to the Russian Energy Week international forum. Eight people have been detained over the weekend’s attack on the Crimea bridge, and Russia’s security forces have named a senior figure from Ukraine as being behind them. A statement from the Federal Security Service (FSB) claimed “the organiser of the terrorist attack on the Crimean Bridge was the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defence Ministry, its head Kyrylo Budanov, employees and agents. Currently, five citizens of Russia, three citizens of Ukraine and Armenia, who participated in the preparation of the crime, have been detained within the framework of the criminal case.” A senior Ukrainian official dismissed the investigation as “nonsense”. “The whole activity of the FSB and Investigative Committee is nonsense,” Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne cited interior minister spokesman Andriy Yusov as saying. He described the FSB and Investigative Committee as “fake structures that serve the Putin regime, so we will definitely not comment on their next statements”. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has described developments at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which has lost off-site power again for a period of time, as “deeply worrying”. Energoatom, the Ukrainian state-owned company that manages the ZNPP accused Russian forces occupying it of refusing a convoy of company vehicles carrying diesel to refuel the plant’s generators after shelling of a substation in the Dnipropetrovsk region caused the plant to lose power. Ukraine’s ministry of reintegration has confirmed that 37 Ukrainian children who were illegally deported to Russia have now returned home. The children had been deported from the Russian-occupied territory of Kharkiv region in August, it said in a statement on Facebook. The European Commission wants at least €18bn (£15.8bn) in emergency aid to help Ukraine’s government stay afloat next year, as an economic crisis looms in the country. Officials in Brussels think the EU should provide at least half the €3bn-€3.5bn monthly running costs it estimates the Ukrainian state needs to function in 2023, the Guardian has learned. The Netherlands will deliver €15m worth of air defence missiles to Ukraine in reaction to Russian air raids on Ukraine earlier this week. Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned Russia’s “relentless bombings” of Ukrainian cities and appealed to “those who have the fate of the war in their hands” to stop. He was quoted as saying “My heart is always turned to the people of Ukraine, especially those living in places hit by the bombing”. The pontiff prayed for an intercession that “may change the hearts of those who have the fate of the war in their hands, so that they may cease this wave of violence and rebuild peaceful coexistence”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is a “rational actor who has miscalculated significantly,” US president Joe Biden said in a clip of a CNN interview broadcast late on Tuesday. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said rhetoric from western leaders on the potential use of nuclear weapons was “provocative”. Peskov added that there had been no attempt from either Washington or Moscow to discuss a potential meeting between Biden and President Vladimir Putin. A crowdfunding appeal that was launched after Russian attacks on cities across the country on Monday has raised $9.6m (£8.7m) in 24 hours for the purchase of kamikaze drones for the Ukrainian armed forces. An initial 50 Ram II drones, unmanned aerial vehicles with a 3kg explosive payload, designed and built by Ukrainian companies, will be bought with the money, along with three control stations. Russia continued to attack key infrastructure in Ukraine with missile strikes on Tuesday. Amid warnings from the UN and some Nato countries that Moscow may be committing a war crime with its continuing deadly blitz on civilian targets, Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its troops continued to launch long-range airstrikes on Ukraine’s energy and military infrastructure. The leaders of the G7 condemned Russia’s most recent missile attacks on cities across Ukraine “in the strongest possible terms” and vowed to stand “firmly” with Kyiv “for as long as it takes”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, asked G7 leaders to supply more air defence systems and for an international monitoring mission on the Belarusian border. Roughly 30% of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure has been hit by Russia since Monday, officials said. As millions in Ukraine are facing blackouts due to the attacks, the government has urged civilians to cut their electricity use and not use domestic appliances such as ovens and washing machines. Russian strikes have damaged hundreds of cultural sites, Zelenskiy said as he urged the UN cultural agency to expel Russia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the Unesco World Heritage Committee."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-14T05:48:53Z","webTitle":"Jellyfish have a proud history of ruining nuclear power plants all over the world | First Dog on the Moon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/jellyfish-have-a-proud-history-of-ruining-nuclear-power-plants-all-over-the-world","fields":{"headline":"Jellyfish have a proud history of ruining nuclear power plants all over the world","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T15:30:51Z","webTitle":"Energy support for businesses to cost ‘tens of billions’, Rees-Mogg says; firms and schools fear cliff edge – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/sep/21/uk-businesses-energy-support-public-borrowing-rees-mogg-ftse-sterling-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Energy support for businesses to cost ‘tens of billions’, Rees-Mogg says; firms and schools fear cliff edge – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Time to recap…. Britain is facing tens of billions of pounds of extra borrowing to cover the cost of protecting businesses, public sector organisations such as schools and hospitals, and charities from the full force of the energy crisis. The UK government announced it will cap wholesale electricity and gas costs for non-domestic users at less than half the market rate expected this winter from the start of October. The plan, two weeks after outlining protection for households, could avert a winter catastrophe for businesses. The package will only initially last for six months – with further help potentially to be offered to vulnerable firms and organisations that need more support beyond March. Under the plan, wholesale prices for electricity are expected to be capped at 21.1p/kWh, while gas would be capped at 7.5p/kWh – for those on existing fixed price contracts. Those on default, deemed or variable tariffs will receive a per-unit discount on energy costs, up to a maximum amount. Analysts at Cornwall Insight said the move would effectively reset the market back to last spring’s price levels, before the surge in wholesale energy prices this summer as Russia tightened the screw on Europe. They estimate it will cost £25bn. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng said the plan would “stop businesses collapsing, protect jobs and limit inflation,”. But the announcement, in a press release, meant MPs were not able to quiz ministers about the plan. Costing details could come in Friday’s mini-budget. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg told broadcasters that the final cost of the scheme would “unquestionably” run into “tens of billions” of pounds, but couldn’t give a precise amount – as it all depends how high electricity and gas prices rise this winter. Investec estimate the plan could cost up to £48bn. Business groups broadly welcomed the plan, saying it would help firms keep running through the winter. But several groups warned that further help will be needed; Make UK, the manufacturers’ trade body, warned prices could “remain high for many months to come”. Labour warned that the plan came too late for some businesses, saying the delay in providing support was ‘farcical’. The package has also been criticised for not being better targeted. As Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee Chair Darren Jones put it: “Capping the price for all businesses is a waste of taxpayers’ money, which should be targeted at those which need it the most. Why should British taxpayers collectively get into even more debt to hand over public funds to Amazon?” However, Resolution Foundation points out that companies on long-term contracts, paying less than the government’s new cap, won’t quality for savings – reducing the total cost. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said a six-month cap made it “impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially with any degree of confidence”. Hospitality firms, nurseries and breweries all warned that ministers are creating a cliff edge in March 2023, when the cap will end. Councils in England and Wales said they needed more help to get them though the cost of living crisis. Here’s the full story: And a detailed explainer: In other news… The UK borrowed almost twice as much as expected in August, at over £11.8bn, as soaring inflation pushed up the cost of index-linked debt. The pound has hit a new 37-year low against the US dollar, at just $1.1325. The foreign exchange markets were shaken by Vladimir Putin who has ordered Russia’s first military mobilisation since World War Two, and accused the West of nuclear blackmail. The government has been warned that cuts to stamp duty will hurt first-time buyers and stoke an inflationary bubble in the property market – following reports that Liz Truss is planning to lower the tax to encourage growth. Economists have called for a shake-up of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee…. … which is expected to announce another increase in UK interest rates tomorrow. Could we see the biggest rise since the late 1980s? The BoE is also been urged to condemn the government’s move to lift the cap on bankers’ bonuses – given its previous calls for wage restraint. The GMB union argued that governor Andrew Bailey should speak out, asking; “Will you denounce these plans for uncontrolled banker bonuses as a risk to inflation? Our members know that inflation is being driven by energy prices, profiteering and supply chain disruptions, not pay.” The energy crisis has forced Germany to nationalise its biggest gas importer, Uniper, to avert a crisis as it battles energy shortages resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. UK retailer Marks &amp; Spencer is increasing staff pay for the second time this year and providing 4,500 employees with a £250 shopping voucher as part of a £15m package to help with the rising cost of living. In a grim development, more than 5 million Britons have gone without food, according to new research that reveals people are skipping meals “just to keep the lights on”. Nearly 11 million people are now behind on their bills, the Money Advice Trust reported. Online gambling firm Betway has been fined more than £400,000 after its marketing material was found on the children’s section of the West Ham United website, including a page where young fans were invited to colour in a teddy bear. And French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel has acquired a 2.5% stake in Vodafone…which could herald a shake-up at the mobile giant. Over in New York, Liz Truss has told executives at a business roundtable in New York that boosting the City of London will help to level up the UK. Truss argued that promoting the financial sector (where the government controversially wants to lift the cap on bonuses) will actually help the rest of the country. She said: We want the City to be the most competitive place for financial services in the world, and we see that as a key part of the levelling up agenda, because when we unblock capital, that capital will be used across the UK to make every industry become more productive and competitive. Andy Sparrow’s Politics Live blog has all the details: Financial service group Investec have estimated that the non-domestic price cap could cost anywhere between £22bn and £48bn. Investec economist Sandra Horsfield explains: In the absence of official numbers, our utilities team tentatively suggest a range of £22bn-£48bn as a cost for the non-domestic energy support package over its initial six-month period. Adding this to what may be a price tag of close to £90bn for household energy bill support, as per our utilities analyst, it is clear that the government is prepared to commit substantial amounts of government funding to provide support with surging energy prices. To put these figures into context, furlough for employees and the self-employed cost £97bn, close to 4% of GDP. Thomas Pugh, economist at audit, tax and consulting firm RSM UK, warns that the UK still faces a recession, despite the government’s energy support. Pugh agrees that non-domestic customers face a cliff edge next spring, which will deter firms from investing. Energy prices for businesses were only frozen for six months at £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 MWh for natural gas. Given that electricity prices in April 2023 are currently around £360 per MWh, this could represent a cliff edge in spring after what will undoubtedly be an exceptionally tough winter. That risks productive investment being deferred or cancelled and otherwise viable firms going bust, making the economy permanently smaller. RSM estimates that the household energy bill freeze, announced a fortnight ago, means inflation will peak at 11% in October, not 15% in January as feared. That means a less severe recession: What’s more, the smaller impact on household incomes means that consumer spending will fall by less and the recession will be shallower. We’re now expecting a peak-to-trough drop of around 0.5% of GDP, down from 1.5%. Here’s a handy explanation about what today’s announcement means for business owners, and those running schools, hospitals and charities too: The plan to cap energy costs has also been welcomed by the steel industry, one of the energy-intensive sectors hit hard by soaring gas and electricity bills. Director General of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the cap will help industry get through the winter. “The Business Secretary’s announcement today demonstrates that this new Government understands the sheer scale of the issue and the need to deliver a significant solution swiftly. Setting a price cap for electricity at £211/MWh for six months gives foundation sectors, such as steel, the chance to get through the winter by giving us a competitive business landscape. The Government has clearly listened to sectors such as steel, estimated the enormity of the challenge that energy intensive sectors face, and today has delivered. The Resolution Foundation have given the energy package a fairly warm welcome – saying it’s well-targeted at tackling soaring bills. They argue it strikes the ‘right balance’ between tackling businesses’ soaring bills, while avoiding offering support for businesses who don’t need it [because their energy costs are still below the new price cap]. Emily Fry, Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Today’s welcome package of support for business strikes the right balance of preventing firms being hit with soaring bills this winter, while encouraging them to become more energy efficient, and avoiding giving support to firms on longer term energy contracts who frankly don’t need it. “Today’s package requires another large cheque from a government already grappling with higher borrowing. But, unlike with support for households, that cheque is not blank – reflecting limits on the size of the discount firms can receive. “Overall, the Government’s energy bills support package is welcome, but expensive, and could easily cost over £100 billion. The refusal to cover more of this cost with windfall and solidarity taxes will add pressure on the Bank of England to up the pace and scale of interest rate rises, which will start to be felt by mortgagors in the months ahead.” The Bank of England could hit borrowers with more financial pain tomorrow, when it announces its latest interest rate move (almost certainly a sharp rise). Trading in financial markets reflects an 80% probability of a 0.75 percentage point increase, which would mark the biggest single rate increase since 1989, when inflation was soaring during a consumer boom before the onset of the early 1990s recession. However, experts said the Bank pushing ahead with the biggest rate hike for more than three decades would mean an extra £3.1bn of interest payments for borrowers on standard variable rate and tracker mortgages. Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “For anyone who is already struggling with runaway price rises, the extra cost of the mortgage could be the final straw.” Our economics correspondent Richard Partington has the full story: After some choppy sessions recently, stocks have opened higher in New York ahead of tonight’s US interest rate decision. The S&amp;P 500 – a broad index of US companies – is 0.4% higher, up 15 points at 3,871. Investors are expecting another hefty rise in US interest rates from the Federal Reserve – quite possibly the third 75bp rise (three quarters of a percent) in a row, or even a full percentage point rise. Local councils are welcoming the six month energy price guarantee – but warning that they, too, need further help to get through the cost of living crisis. Cllr Andrew Western, chair of the resources board at the Local Government Association, says capping gas and electricity costs (at around half the expected levels this winter) is a ‘positive step’. The LGA says councils have been hit by soaring prices – pushing up the cost of running and repairing street lighting, filling potholes and building new roads Western explains: “Alongside energy bills, councils are also facing massive increases in costs due to spiralling inflation and National Living Wage increases both this year and in future years. This is forcing councils to reset budgets leading to cuts to local services just to meet their legal duty to balance the books. “Further government support will be needed by councils and residents to cope with these ongoing pressures and to protect the services that our communities rely on every day and will be vital to help residents cope through the cost-of-living crisis.” UK brewers are also concerned by the looming ‘cliff edge’ at the end of next March. Roy Allkin Chairman of the Society of Independent Brewers (SIBA) says the sector has suffered from soaring energy bills: Many independent brewers have been hit hard by the recent spikes in energy prices and today’s bold step will give them six months of headroom. However given the uncertainty in the energy markets, there is a danger that a cliff edge will be created next year and serious questions remain about the criteria being used to identify the most vulnerable businesses that will be eligible for further support. The debate on banker bonuses is heating up ahead of Friday’s mini-budget, with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey now under pressure to denounce plans to scrap the cap on bumper payouts. Kalyeena Makortoff, our banking correspondent explains… You’ll remember that Bailey was repeatedly criticised for suggesting workers should hold back from asking for pay rises, amid fears that it could further fuel inflation. He originally said in February: ‘We do need to see restraint in pay bargaining otherwise it will get out of control.’ But GMB union general secretary Gary Smith says Bailey risks setting a double-standard unless he takes a stance against scrapping the cap - a move which is widely expected to be confirmed on Friday. The current cap was part of post-financial crisis reforms introduced by the EU in 2016, and meant bankers were limited to bonuses worth two times their salaries. (More here for context) In a letter to Bailey, Smith says: “The Prime Minister has stated she supports plans to scrap the cap on bankers’ bonuses. To my mind, this will rightly be seen as a gratuitous insult to workers who are being told by you and others to tighten their belts.” Smith goes on to ask whether Bailey will stand by his comments about restraints in pay bargaining, adding: “Will you denounce these plans for uncontrolled banker bonuses as a risk to inflation? Our members know that inflation is being driven by energy prices, profiteering and supply chain disruptions, not pay.” The GMB boss also reiterates his offer for Bailey to shadow a low-paid care worker, saying that: “It would also be a good opportunity for you to explain directly, if this is your view, why the Bank of England thinks there should be one rule for bankers and another for care workers.” It remains to be seen whether Bailey chooses to take on the banker bonus battle, given he’s also facing a crisis of independence, with the government threatening to introduce powers that would allow politicians to intervene in regulatory matters. The Unite union has dubbed the energy support package a taxpayer funded ‘panic measure’. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “The government plans are a short term taxpayer funded panic measure. Although they will give business some respite on soaring energy bills in the short term, employers are crying out for long-term solutions in order to be able to plan with confidence for the future. “Yet again the taxpayer is being required to pick up the tab, with no check or penalty being placed on the excessive profits being generated by the energy companies who will be laughing all the way to the bank.” Andrew Sparrow’s Politics Live blog is also covering the political reaction to today’s support package – including warnings that it comes too late for some companies: The chair of parliament’s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, Darren Jones, has criticised the government for not targetting its support at businesses and organisations who most needed the help. Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West, says: “Capping the price for all businesses is a waste of taxpayers’ money, which should be targeted at those which need it the most. Why should British taxpayers collectively get into even more debt to hand over public funds to Amazon?” British manufacturers expect the biggest drop in production since the start of last year over the next three months, as economic storm clouds darken. The Confederation of British Industry’s regular healthcheck on the sector shows that factory bosses are increasingly pessimistic about the outlook – showing the urgent need for today’s energy support package. The difference between manufacturers who expect a rise in output over the next three months, and those who expect a fall dropped to -17% in September, from -2 in August. That’s the lowest since during the Covid lockdowns of January 2021. Anna Leach, CBI deputy chief economist, said the economic outlook has deteriorated: “It is clear that the downturn, which originated in consumer-facing services, has spread to manufacturing, with output falling for the second month running. When adding an uncertain demand environment to ongoing input and labour shortages, and a cost-of-doing-business crisis, the outlook looks increasingly challenging for the sector. “If the country is going to fulfil the government’s ambitious plans to supercharge economic growth, businesses need the confidence and the capital to invest. The announcement of support on energy bills is a good first step, and the CBI looks forward to working in lockstep with the Government going forward.” Meanwhile in the City….French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel has acquired a 2.5% stake in Vodafone, citing opportunities to accelerate a “streamlining” of the London-listed group’s business. Niel, who founded the telecoms company Iliad, has taken the stake through his investment vehicle Atlas Investissement. My colleague Mark Sweney has the full story: The big question is whether this marks the start of further stake building and what Niel plans to do with his increasing share of the company, explains Victoria Scholar of Interactive Investor: Niel is a veteran in the telecoms industry with vast experience through his majority shareholding in Iliad, which he took private last year. Vodafone shares are trading at depressed levels, down more than 20% since the February highs, providing an attractive entry point for Niel. Since 2015, investors have had a rough ride with the stock which is down by almost 60% from the peak and losses have accelerated over the last month. Vodafone has been struggling this year with the pressures from inflation, in particular with rising energy costs. There can be no starker contrast between how the two political parties are judged on economic policy than the way the past fortnight has played out for Liz Truss, our chief political correspondent Jessica Elgot writes: The astonishing scale of state spending to relieve the energy crisis and enable tax cuts has been announced with total omertà thus far on how much the proposals will cost the British taxpayer. One Labour shadow cabinet minister observed this week that they had been irritated by an interview with Rishi Sunak earlier in the leadership contest on how he would fund his own energy crisis package – costing a mere £15bn – where he had admitted at least £10bn would come from borrowing. “We’d have been crucified for that,” the shadow cabinet minister observed. “But since then we’ve had the new PM announce hundreds of billions and refused to say anything at all.” The energy package for business announced on Wednesday also has no detail on the anticipated costs of discounting wholesale power prices for companies, charities and public sector organisations, including schools…. Here’s the full analysis: The cost of living crisis has prompted Marks &amp; Spencer to raise its pay rates for the second time this year. M&amp;S will lift the hourly pay rate formore than 40,000 workers to a minimum of £10.20 from October 1st, as part of a £15m package. The additional autumn pay review, a first for M&amp;S, follows an initial pay increase in April to £10/hour, from £9.50. Combined, this represents an annual raise of 7.4% – while UK inflation was 9.9% in August. M&amp;S is also giving 4,500 salaried staff on pre-management levels a one-off £250 M&amp;S voucher, and offering a free meal per shift for staff at its Distribution Centre in Castle Donington. This month, M&amp;S also introduced free sanitary products to colleagues across all stores and sites. The government will set out the cost of capping energy prices for households and businesses in Friday’s mini-budget, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Liz Truss said. Reuters has the details: The government pledged on Wednesday to cap electricity and gas costs for businesses at less than half the market rate. The finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng plans to make a fiscal statement on Friday to explain his plans to support households and businesses through the coming winter. “Costs will be set out in the expected fiscal event on Friday,” Truss’s spokeswoman told reporters. The chancellor is expected to unveil tax cuts of £30bn to £50bn, according to some estimates, while the government’s intervention to freeze energy prices for consumers and businesses could cost more than £100bn. (although, as Jacob Rees-Mogg pointed out earlier, the final bill depends on the energy market). Kwarteng has also refused to let the government’s fiscal watchdog assess the economic impact of planned tax cuts: Here’s a clip of Jacob Rees-Mogg announcing today’s six-month support package via video – rather than to MPs in the House of Commons, where he’d be questioned about the details (incuding the cost!). He explains how the package will help businesses, charities, and public sector organisations including schools, nurseries, hospitals and care homes. Rees-Mogg says the package will help keep high streets ‘humming this winter, and beyond’ – although, as we flagged earlier, there’s a boarded-up shop next to the business secretary, out of shot…. Businesses have been given an emergency package of government support including a cap significantly reducing the price paid for energy from 1 October to help them get through the winter, our energy correspondent Alex Lawson explains: The UK government has stepped in to discount wholesale power prices for companies, charities and public sector organisations, including schools. Under the plan, they will be given support for six months to protect them from soaring bills. Further help will be offered to companies in vulnerable industries after that. The business department has announced a “supported wholesale price” expected to be £211 a megawatt hour for electricity and £75 a MWh for gas, which it said would be less than half the wholesale prices anticipated this winter. The cap means that electricity prices for business customers will still be about double what they were in October 2021, when the price per megawatt hour was £117, but more than half the forecast winter prices of about £540. The scheme limits the price suppliers can charge customers for units of gas and electricity. Businesses will not need to take any action, as the discounts will be automatically applied to their bills. The changes will apply to new contracts from 1 October, and to fixed contracts taken out since 1 April. Here’s Alex’s full story: This chart shows how the government’s price cap will protect businesses, public sector groups such as schools, and charities from the surge in electricity bills this winter: Asked about the impact on government borrowing, Jacob Rees-Mogg says the support package will reduce the interest bill on index-linked UK debt. That’s because it will lower inflation, which is used to set the repayment cost on gilts linked to the RPI measure of rising prices, he explains. [we learned this morning that interest payments on the national debt hit a record in August, due to high inflation]. Rees-Mogg agreees there will be a cost to today’s package, but argues this burden should be borne collectively on the balance sheet that can bear it. Rees-Mogg adds that today’s business support package only last for six months due to the complexity of the non-domestic energy market. Today’s package will give people confidence through the winter, he argues. The package will be reviewed in three months time to check the government is giving support in the right places, and to ensure that continued support “if that’s necessary’ is directed where it is needed, the business secretary adds. That sounds like a hint that some of the groups covered by today’s announcement, such as schools, hospitals and care homes as well as the hospitality sector, could get more support beyond next March. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg says the energy support package will cost ‘tens of billions’ of pounds, but can’t give a precise estimate – as it will depend on the wholesale energy market. Rees-Mogg has told Sky News that the caps on gas and electricity announced today will be a ‘huge support’ for businesses, to ensure they can cope with the rise in energy prices caused by Putin’s war in Ukraine. He adds: The difficulty with giving you a cost figure is that this will depend on where the price of energy goes over the winter, and that’s very difficult to forecast. I can’t give you an absolute cost, but we are talking about many billions of pounds. It will be into the tens of billions, unquestionably. Some businesses are looking for more support from the government – warning that the cost of living crisis could also hit takings. Paul Cook, 50, a director at the Angry Parrot pub, told PA Media that the energy cap won’t make a difference if people can’t afford to visit pubs, clubs and hospitality venues. He added: “VAT is always a killer, if we could reduce that that would be more than welcome. It’s all about cash flow for us. Any scrapping of business rates for the remainder of the year, that would be more than welcome. “This support’s only for six months, and I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but what’s going to happen after those six months? Will it be enough to turn it all around? We need to make sure the public has disposable income. Cook warned that business had already deteriorated: “Trade for us has already dropped off probably by about 40% in the past month. We’re looking towards the Christmas period and hoping this could help to kickstart things, but I don’t know.” The new cap applies to businesses on existing fixed price contracts signed since April 1st, and on any new fixed contracts taken out from 1st October. Firms on default, deemed or variable tariffs will receive a per-unit discount on energy costs – but that will be capped, so they could end up paying more if wholesale prices rise above the current expected levels. The early years sector also warned of the perils of a cliff edge in six months’ time and called for additional future support for nurseries which are closing “at an alarming rate”. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) said: “Although capping energy costs will help give certainty over what will be a very difficult winter, it cannot lead to a cliff edge in six months’ time. “Childcare businesses – which have been closing at an alarming rate - are absolutely fundamental both for children’s development and for parental employment. Due to their importance and the risks they face, they must be classed as vulnerable, so they get additional future support.” The UK Green Building Council is urging the government to produce a strategy to cut the vast costly energy waste from the sector’s poorly insulated buildings – including through tax incentives. Shifting from gas and oil heating to more efficient, low carbon options, will also help give firms energy security. UKGBC’s Head of Policy &amp; Public Affairs, Louise Hutchins, explains: Measures such as VAT and business rates cuts for businesses investing in decarbonising their buildings and requiring companies to measure and publish their energy performance will all be needed if we are to get off the hook of high and volatile gas bills year on year. Labour have criticised the government for failing to provide help to businesses and other non-domestic users sooner, given the energy crisis has been building for months. Jonathan Reynolds MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Business and Industrial Strategy, says some firms have already collapsed while waiting for support: “It is farcical that the Tories have been unable to tell businesses at the sharp end of the energy crisis what they plan to do to help them until now. Labour has been calling for support since the start of the year. “Businesses have been crying out for detail on these plans and, even now, there are still questions about how much this will cost and who will pay for it. “We have known a crisis of this scale has been coming for months and Conservative dither and delay has forced too many businesses to close, with the future still looking bleak. “While the Tories prioritise the profits of oil and gas producers, Labour will always be on the side of business and the jobs they create.” Today’s business energy support package to help firms through the winter will cost up to £25bn, the consultancy Cornwall Insight estimates. Robert Buckley, Cornwall’s head of relationship development, explains that the new caps on gas and electricity costs will mean substantial savings for non-domestic users. Effectively it takes the market back to the prices in spring this year, Buckley says (when the Ukraine war has already pushed up wholesale energy prices). “The reduction in energy costs will be substantial. As a proxy and noting the challenge of calculating a homogenous discount across so many contract types, this represents a 45% discount to closing wholesale energy prices as at the end of last week. The support effectively reverts the market back to where it was price wise in the Spring of 2022. Buckley adds: “Structuring this as fixed discounts on wholesale energy costs caps the cost of the scheme for government at around £25bn. There will also be a strong incentive for businesses to move from out of contract to negotiated contract terms, which acts to maintain the integrity of the market. This will be very important for what emerges after these six months have elapsed. The ICAEW, which represents chartered accountants, also fears a cliff-edge in six months time when the cap on non-domestic electricity and gas charges end. Businesses will need to know soon what happens when this support ends, and what to expect if there are energy shortages, warns Iain Wright, ICAEW’s managing director for reputation and influence: “Our members are playing a key role in both running companies facing increases in costs of doing business, as well as helping firms up and down the country deal with the fallout from the energy crisis but continued uncertainly makes it extremely difficult to plan. We hope the government continues to respond flexibly to provide support where needed, otherwise firms will face a cliff edge in six months’ time which can only mean price increases and real threats of company failures - feeding inflation, harming the economy and hurting consumers. The long term solution to Britain’s energy crisis include using less, says Jess Ralston, senior analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. With taxpayer support only set to last for six months under the current plan, the question is what happens after that? “Experts have said time and time again that the government’s approach to the gas crisis is missing a key component – conserving energy. While billions will be spent on bailing out bills, much less is targeted at the root of the problem, that we waste huge amounts of our energy.” The CBI, which represents UK businesses, is also concerned about what will happen when the package ends in six months time. Matthew Fell, CBI Chief Policy Director, says the cap on gas and electricity costs for non-domestic users announced today is ‘a substantial short-term fix to a long-term problem’. “The package will ease worries about otherwise viable businesses shutting-up shop and smaller companies especially will benefit from the discounted rate. “Businesses will also want to know more about the exit strategy and what happens when the six-month cap runs out. Working closely with business will be key to successful implementation. “The long-run solution is to double-down on energy security and to incentivise firms to push ahead with ambitious energy efficiency programmes to lower demand.” School leaders have welcomed the government’s new energy bill relief scheme, but warned that limiting it to six months would make it impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially at a time when already tight budgets are under additional strain from unfunded pay awards to teachers and support staff. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said without the cap schools and colleges were facing “absolutely massive hikes” in energy costs which would have caused an immediate financial meltdown in the sector, our energy correspondent Sally Weale writes. But, Barton added, “The glaring problem is the fact that the scheme is time-limited to six months”, meaning schools cannot plan for the future with any confidence. “The government says it will review the operation of the scheme in three months’ time to inform decisions on future support after March 2023. However, this uncertainty makes it impossible for schools and colleges to plan financially with any degree of confidence because they could be knocked off course at a later date by steep rises to energy bills if government support drops off. School and college budgets are incredibly tight and any financial ill-wind is potentially devastating. We will be pressing the government for a firmer commitment to the sector. Barton went on: “The other issue is the fact that pay awards for teachers and support staff have been agreed at a national level but there is no additional government funding for schools and colleges to be able to afford the cost of these awards. The pay awards are fully deserved and needed – and in fact do not go far enough – but the government’s expectation that this will be paid for out of existing budgets that are already very tight is completely unrealistic and unsustainable.” Although the government says today’s cap sets gas and electricity costs at just half the expected winter levels, the actual savings will depend when a firm signed its energy contract. BEIS have supplied an example of how the wholesale energy price cap will work for a pub which fixed its energy bill last month – when prices were surging. A pub uses 4 MWh of electricity and 16 MWh of gas a month. They signed a fixed contract in August 2022, giving them a current monthly energy bill of about £7,000. At the time they signed their contact, wholesale prices for the next 6 months were expected to be higher than the Government Supported Price of £211/MWh for electricity, and £75/MWh for gas, meaning they can receive support under this scheme. The difference between expected wholesale prices when they signed their contract and the Government Supported Price is worth £380/MWh for electricity and £100/MWh for gas, meaning they receive a discount of £3,100 per month, reducing their bill by over 40%. Kate Nicholls, CEO of UKHospitality, has warned that the government must avoid a ‘cliff edge’ when today’s six-month package of help finishes at the end of March 2023. Nicholls says: “This intervention is unprecedented and it is extremely welcome that Government has listened to hospitality businesses facing an uncertain winter. We particularly welcome its inclusiveness – from the smallest companies to the largest - all of which combine to provide a huge number of jobs, which are now much more secure. The Government has recognised the vulnerability of hospitality as a sector, and we will continue to work with the Government, to ensure that there is no cliff edge when these measures fall away.” Many pubs had warned that they faced collapse this winter without support through the energy crisis: The Government plans to publish a review its Energy Bill Relief Scheme in three months time. That will examine whether it could be extended beyond the end of March 2023, and further targeted – or replaced with other targeted support for these most vulnerable users. A parallel support package for non-domestic users will be established in Northern Ireland, the BEIS department says (Northern Ireland has a different energy market than the rest of the UK, and isn’t covered by Ofgem’s domestic price cap). The government will also provide equivalent support to non-domestic users who use heating oil or alternative fuels instead of gas, because they aren’t connected to either the gas or electricity grid (with details to follow….). Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg says the government’s plans will “increase growth, protect jobs and support families with their cost of living this winter”. Rees-Mogg explains: “We have seen an unprecedented rise in energy prices following Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine, which has affected consumers up and down the country and businesses of all sizes. “The help we are already putting in place will save families money off their bills, and the Government’s plans for businesses, charities and public sector organisations will give them the equivalent level of support. Worryingly, gas prices are rising this morning after Putin announced the partial mobilisation of Russian forces. The wholesale month-ahead UK gas price has risen 6% to 335p per therm – twice as much as a year ago (but only half its August peak). Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng says the package will prevent companies collapsing under the weight of soaring energy bills this winter: “We have stepped in to stop businesses collapsing, protect jobs, and limit inflation. “And with our plans to boost home-grown energy supply, we will bring security to the sector, growth to the economy and secure a better deal for consumers.” Liz Truss says the new scheme will provide certainty and peace of mind to businesses, charities and public sector organisations this winter, by keeping their energy bills down. The new package is ‘equivalent’ to the support for households announced almost two weeks ago, says BEIS (although it won’t last as long). It will cap gas and electricity prices at ‘less than half’ the wholesale prices expected this winter, the department explains: To administer support, the Government has set a Supported Wholesale Price – expected to be £211 per MWh for electricity and £75 per MWh for gas, less than half the wholesale prices anticipated this winter – which is a discounted price per unit of gas and electricity. This is equivalent to the wholesale element of the Energy Price Guarantee for households. It includes the removal of green levies paid by non-domestic customers who receive support under the scheme. Breaking: Gas and electricity costs for UK businesses, charities and public sector bodies are to be capped – the government has announced. The BEIS department says that electricity prices are expected to be capped at £211 per megawatt hour, while gas prices will be capped at £75 per MWh –- in line with what was reported overnight. [that’s 21.1p/kWh for electricity and 7.5p/kWh for gas] Suppliers are to apply the reduction automatically to all eligible non-domestic customers, BEIS adds, with the government compensating suppliers for the cost. The savings will apply to contracts signed since April 1st this year – and run from 1st October to 31st March 2023. More details to follow…. Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have urged the Chancellor not to pass the cost of an energy cap on to struggling families. Scotland’s Deputy First Minister John Swinney, Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans and Conor Murphy, Northern Ireland’s finance minister, have called for an extended and targeted support package for those worst hit by the cost-of-living crisis. In a joint letter to Kwasi Kwarteng, they say the UK government should impose a windfall tax to ensure the energy sector pays the price, “rather than passing on the cost through higher borrowing”. They say: “We are deeply concerned at who will bear the brunt of these costs. “Support should be funded by targeting the windfall gains in the energy sector rather than passing the cost to households through higher borrowing. “Looking ahead to your forthcoming fiscal statement, we urge you to focus efforts on those most impacted, not just relying on blanket interventions which do not recognise the scale of hardship particular households are facing. Business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg was spotted yesterday being filmed in Westminster – perhaps for an online video to outline today’s energy support package? Sam Coates of The Times has the details: The UK’s energy support packages for households and businesses are “something of almost a panic reaction.” That’s the verdict from Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this morning. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think something like this was inevitable. Some businesses were seeing their energy bills going up by five times - or certainly that was likely to happen from October. “Just as households were going to need some protection, so were businesses. Johnson adds that the government is right to be planning more targeted support for businesses in six months time. “I rather wish they had done the same for households because for households and for businesses this is something of almost a panic reaction. “You have got to do something and the only thing that they can do immediately is protect everybody, whereas in the medium term if this goes on we really want something that is more targeted.” The prospect of a cut in UK stamp duty has pushed up shares in UK housebuilders. Persimmon (+4.6%), Barratt (+3.6%), Taylor Wimpey (+3.3%) and Berkeley (+3%) are all among the top FTSE 100 risers, as traders anticipate changes to the property sales tax. Weapons manufacturer BAE Systems has jumped almost 4.5%, as defence stocks rally after the ‘partial mobilisation’ announced by Putin this morning. Today’s public finances report shows the UK government received £7.8bn of revenue from stamp duty so far this financial year, over a third more than in April-August 2021. VAT revenues are up 12% this financial year (to £73.1bn), while PAYE income tax receipts are 10.7% higher (at £81.8bn). According to The Times, the government will announce plans to cut stamp duty in the its mini-budget this week in an attempt to drive economic growth. Liz Truss, they explain, believes that cutting stamp duty will encourage economic growth by allowing more people to move and enabling first-time buyers to get on the property ladder. But cutting stamp duty could simply allow sellers to charge more for their properties (as stamp duty is paid by the buyer), pushing up prices… Over in Germany, the government has agreed to nationalize gas importer Uniper in a historic move to prevent its energy sector collapsing. Under today’s deal, Germany will take control of Uniper, buying the 78% owned by Fortum -- which is majority owned by the Finnish government -- for about €480m. The government in Berlin will also inject €8bn into Uniper, after the Dusseldorf-based utility ran up billions of euros of losses after Russia cut off supplies to Europe. That sent Uniper scambling to find alternative gas supplies, as prices soared as European countries tried to built up storage before winter. The pound has hit a new 37-year low against the US dollar, dropping below last week’s weakest point. Sterling dropped below $1.131, levels last seen in 1985, before recovering a little. It’s now down over 16% against the dollar this year. The euro also weakened, while safe-haven government bonds are rallying, after Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the partial mobilisation of forces in Russia, in a national address. Putin also accused the west of planning to destroy Russia and use nuclear blackmail, and said Russia would use “all means available to us”. Our liveblog on the Ukraine war has more details: Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has said the government is right to help families and businesses, after the UK borrowed £11.8bn last month. Kwarteng said in a statement: “I have pledged to get debt down in the medium term. However, in the face of a major economic shock, it is absolutely right that the government takes action now to help families and businesses,” “Our priority is to grow the economy and improve living standards for everyone - with strong economic growth and sustainable public finances going hand in hand.” The UK borrowed nearly twice as much in August as the Office for Budget Responsibility had predicted back in May, points out Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK: “Public sector borrowing came in at £11.8 billion in August, down by £2.6 billion from last year but £5.8 billion above the OBR’s forecast. This overshoot was driven by higher than expected inflation which pushed up debt interest costs, and the rollout of the first instalment of the £650 cost-of-living payment for households on means-tested benefits which began in July. A return of large-scale borrowing under Liz Truss’s government will be “a test for the bond markets”, Stelmach warns: “Since the start of the year, UK 10-year government bond yields have already risen by over 230 basis points. The expected increase in borrowing to fund the Energy Price Guarantee, coupled with a fall in the Bank of England’s gilt holdings, will be a test of whether private investors can absorb an outsized bond issuance without a further punitive increase in debt servicing costs.” Britain borrowed more than expected in August, as soaring inflation pushed up the UK deficit. Public sector borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, came in at £11.82bn last month, the Office for National Statistics reports this morning. This was £2.6bn less than in August 2021 but £6.5bn more than in August 2019, before the pandemic, when the UK borrowed £5.3bn to balance the books. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted the UK would borrow £8.45bn. The deficit was pushed up by the cost of repaying existing debt. The UK spent £8.2bn on interest payments on central government debt in August. That includes £4.7bn due to the impact of rising RPI inflation (which pushed up the cost of repaying index-linked government debt). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. UK businesses, charities and public sector bodies are finally going to learn what support they will receive to help them through the energy crisis – but will it be enough? The government is expected to announce a cap on wholesale gas and electricity costs for these groups today, in the second part of its energy price guarantee to cut soaring bills. The plan, to be announced by business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg, is expected to cut the rate for electricity and gas for non-domestic users by about 50% and 25% respectively, compared with current contracts. It’s likely to cost tens of billions of pounds, depending how high wholesale energy prices remain. Two weeks ago, Liz Truss promised ‘equivalent support’ for businesses and public sector organisations over the coming winter, when she announced the government would cap domestic bills at an average £2,500 a year But while those domestic cap runs for two years, the business support may only last six months for many firms. The discounts are set to apply to contracts signed since April 1 this year, and would last for six months starting from October 1, Bloomberg reported last night. That would help companies get through the winter crunch, but provide less certainty about the future. Yesterday, pub chain Fuller’s revealed its energy bill was due to more than double this year, from £8m to £18m, without government support. And business groups have warned that the UK faces a “lost generation” of traders, adding that a cap would not affect high standing charges imposed by suppliers. As my colleagues Rowena Mason and Alex Lawson explain: Suppliers would be able to impose their own charges on top and would be compensated for the wholesale price cap by the government. This would be about 21p per kilowatt-hour for electricity and 7.5p per kWh for gas. There would be a different cap for those paying variable rates. Government sources said this was the most likely model and scale of energy bill support for businesses, without saying how much the total package would cost the Treasury. Craig Beaumont, the chief of external affairs at the FSB, said: “If the government is going for a fixed wholesale price, tomorrow we need to understand how that will be applied to small businesses’ energy bills in practice. A small business will need to be told by their supplier, fast, what their new bill will be. “However, there may be no regulation of the other major element of small business energy bills – the standing charge. “While consumers will have their standing charge capped, small firms won’t, and that means energy providers could continue to hike standing charges, and so still mean small businesses seeing their energy bills spiral.” We’ll also be watching the financial markets today, where investors are bracing for another hefty rise in US interest rates tonight. Economists are predicting the US Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, the third such rise in a row, and signal plans to raise rates again in the coming months.

But it has been rebranded, apparently. The event, taking place in Aberdeen on 30 March, will no longer share a name with the California pop-punk band; ministers are understood to have plumped for the less lyrical “energy security day”. But climate campaigners fear it looks set to be, to quote Green Day’s 2004 hit, a Boulevard of Broken Dreams. Energy secretary Grant Shapps and chancellor Jeremy Hunt have come under pressure from industry to produce a meaningful response to US president Joe Biden’s $369bn in climate subsidies, granted through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which has seen major companies reallocate investment to the US. The pair will also be hoping to seize the initiative from Labour, which has made the switch to green energy a key battleground. Shapps and his newly formed Department for Energy and Net Zero certainly have a mandate to shake up a crucial industry. As the energy crisis has escalated over the past 18 months, it has exposed flaws across the sector – from tariffs and decarbonisation concerns to the link between wholesale gas and electricity prices. But the Guardian has revealed that the presentation will contain measures to please the fossil fuel industry, from new offshore drilling plans to a refusal to force oil and gas companies to stop flaring by 2025 – as recommended by Chris Skidmore in his net zero review. It may even give a licence to the huge, and so far undeveloped, Rosebank oil and gas field off Shetland. It is understood that Ofgem will not, as had been mooted, be given powers to include the net zero target in its regulation of the energy sector, and that the only measure aimed at improving Britain’s energy efficiency will be a consultation on improving insulation in the private rental sector. On the renewables side, there are concerns Britain’s prowess in offshore wind could be rapidly eroded if Biden’s IRA subsidy tempts investment away from the UK to the US. A windfall tax on some electricity generators has not helped investor confidence. Meanwhile, green campaigners hope Shapps will confirm a lifting of the effective ban on onshore wind developments, amid concerns it will persist. Industries expected to get particular attention in the presentation are nuclear, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Hunt made great fanfare of nuclear at this month’s budget, aiming to reclassify the technology as “sustainable” so as to attract environment-conscious investors, and kicking off a competition for small modular reactor (SMR) designs. However, it is unclear whether the reclassification will help in the hunt for co-investors alongside EDF and government in the Sizewell C project in Suffolk. And industry insiders say the SMR competition has merely delayed the decision on which projects to fund. The chancellor also announced £20bn of spending on carbon capture and storage projects over 20 years, with a promise to get “spades in the ground” from next year. The technology captures the CO2 emitted by big polluters and stores it underground. Backers of the projects hope Thursday will provide answers on which proposals will receive approval. Last week, power station owner Drax said it had paused investment in carbon capture until the government decides whether it will offer financial support. Hunt’s £20bn has been labelled a PR exercise and a “dangerous gamble” on unproven technology, as the £1bn-a-year spending primarily falls outside this parliament. Onlookers also hope to see firmer plans on supporting the green hydrogen industry – seen as important to decarbonising heavy industry – electric batteries and storage facilities, vehicles and the supply of critical minerals into that sector. Shadow climate secretary Ed Miliband is not getting his hopes up. He criticised the Conservatives’ “low ambition and chronic underfunding of green projects”, and added that Labour plans to create a “publicly owned national champion in clean power generation, and deliver a million good green jobs”. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, said: “This is the best opportunity for the government to stop us being left behind in the global race on green growth … [it] must put the budding UK industries of renewable energy, electric vehicles, batteries and green steel at the heart of the UK’s economic plan.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T17:15:06Z","webTitle":"Nuclear powers are on a deadly path to more conflict | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/apr/07/nuclear-powers-are-on-a-deadly-path-to-more-conflict","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear powers are on a deadly path to more conflict","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Truly, the human race has a death wish.

Cameras abruptly cut away from Erdoğan to one of his interviewers, Hasan Öztürk, who looked perturbed and began to rise from his chair before the broadcast cut entirely. In footage distributed by the president’s Justice and Development party (AKP), shot in the same location, Erdoğan explains that he contracted stomach flu following intense work on the campaign trail weeks before the pivotal election. He later tweeted: “Today I will rest at home upon the advice of my doctors … with God’s permission, we will continue our campaign from tomorrow onwards.” The vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said he would attend campaign events across central Turkey in his place. Turkey is holding parliamentary and presidential elections on 14 May, when Erdoğan faces a concerted challenge from a six-party opposition striving to unseat him after 20 years in power. Many polls give his main challenger, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu, a slight lead, amid discontent with an ongoing economic crisis and the government’s response to deadly earthquakes that killed more than 50,000 people in Turkey, and 8,000 in Syria. Erdoğan cancelled personal appearances at a number of high-profile campaign events due to his sudden illness, including attending the opening ceremony of part of a Russian-funded nuclear power plant in southern Turkey and a nearby rally. The nuclear plant is the latest flagship infrastructure project that Erdoğan and the AKP are hoping will sway voters at the upcoming election, despite concerns about the relationship between government-led construction projects and collapsed infrastructure following the earthquake. The AKP deputy chair, Erkan Kandemir, said Erdoğan would attend the ceremony at the nuclear power plant via video link. “Our president will attend the Akkuyu nuclear power plant ceremony, which is planned to be held tomorrow, online. Our Mersin rally is planned to be held at a later date,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine says it has pushed Russian forces back near Kramatorsk; last Zaporizhzhia reactor disconnected after Russian shelling – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/sep/05/russia-ukraine-war-gas-prices-expected-to-surge-in-europe-zelenskiy-claims-progress-in-counteroffensive-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine says it has pushed Russian forces back near Kramatorsk; last Zaporizhzhia reactor disconnected after Russian shelling – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has urged the EU to supply his country with more weapons and equipment to help in its fight against Russia’s invasion. He also suggested Ukraine could deliver gas to the EU to ease an energy crunch that has driven prices to record-high levels. In a joint press conference with Shmyhal, the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, promised the bloc’s continued support to Kyiv, no matter “whatever threat, whatever blackmail” may come from Russia. Russia will not resume its gas supplies to Europe in full until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, the Kremlin said. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, blamed western sanctions for Russia’s failure to deliver gas through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, adding that Russia’s full resumption of gas supplies via Nord Stream 1 was “undoubtedly” dependent on whether the west would lift its sanctions on Moscow. Concerns over Russian gas supplies continued to drive up energy prices, while the pound and euro slumped after Russia shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline indefinitely. The contract for gas delivery next month in the UK soared by 35%, to 550p a therm. Winter gas prices were also up sharply. On Monday, the euro hit a 20-year low against the US dollar, falling as low as $0.9879 in early trading. Ukraine’s armed forces have said its troops repelled Russian offensives in eastern Ukraine and were able to knock Russian positions near Kramatorsk. In a situational update, it also claimed that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. Despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk city and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counteroffensive, with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. Russia-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine say they are “pausing” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia because of attacks by Ukrainian forces. The Russian state news agency Tass reported that the head of Kherson’s authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said attacks on the Antonivskiy Bridge in Kherson city by Ukrainian forces had stopped traffic from crossing the Dnieper River, which links the two sides of the region. The final working reactor block of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been disconnected after Russian shelling disrupted power lines, according to Ukraine’s state energy operator. Energoatom told Reuters that the reactor was operating and providing the plant’s own electricity needs despite its disconnection from the grid. Four of the six International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said. The remaining two still stay on a permanent basis, it said. Ukraine and the EU have signed a deal to release a further €500m (£431m) in planned aid, aimed at supporting housing, education and agriculture. The European Commission announced the package as senior officials hosted a meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. The meeting was the first since Ukraine was accepted as a formal candidate to join the EU. The EU is running low on weapon stocks as member countries continue to send arms and ammunition to Ukraine, the bloc’s top diplomat has warned. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, urged member states to better coordinate their spending on military materiel during a debate with European lawmakers. Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s leading independent newspaper whose chief editor was last year co-awarded the Nobel peace prize, was stripped of its media licence today. The country’s media regular, Rozkomnadzor, had accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. The ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”, its editor-in-chief and Nobel Peace laureate, Dmitry Muratov, said outside court today. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of treason. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was arrested in 2020 and accused of disclosing classified information. Journalists were seen crying and hugging each other on the streets outside the courtroom after the verdict. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked the outgoing British prime minister, Boris Johnson, for his “personal bravery and principles” in response to Russia and said that he would remain “a great friend of Ukraine”. Johnson told the Ukrainian president that he was “convinced” Ukraine’s forces could “continue to succeed in pushing back Russian forces” and that the UK “remains steadfast in its support”, Downing Street said. The Kremlin has said diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia could worsen under the next British prime minister. Speaking to reporters before Liz Truss was declared the winner of the UK’s Conservative party leadership election, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he didn’t think “we can hope for anything positive” as the contest had been dominated by “anti-Russian rhetoric”. The Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Ben Stiller are among 25 Americans who have been targeted with sanctions by Russia due to their public criticism of Moscow’s war on Ukraine. Russia’s foreign ministry said the group, which also included business leaders, academics and government officials, would be banned permanently from entering Russia. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine blog today. As always, thank you for reading. I will be back tomorrow. Ukraine’s armed forces have said its troops repelled Russian offensives in eastern Ukraine and were able to destroy Russian positions near Kramatorsk. In a situational update, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said: Our defenders successfully repelled enemy offensive attempts in the areas of the settlements of Bilohorivka, Hryhorivka, Pokrovske, Bakhmutske, Lozove, Spartak, Soledar, Zaitseve and Semihiria. In the Kramatorsk direction, they had tactical success and knocked the enemy out of the positions he had previously occupied. It went on to say that Ukrainian troops had successes in disrupting Russian crossings near Kherson and in using long-range artillery in Kharkiv. It added: As a result of Ukraine’s successful fire attack on Kharkiv Region’s Kupiansk, Russian occupiers lost over 100 troops killed and wounded, and two combat vehicles were destroyed. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak has urged residents of temporarily occupied territories and Russian-occupied Crimea to prepare bomb shelters and stock up on drinking water. Podolyak wrote on Twitter: We ask residents of occupied territories, including the Crimean peninsula, to follow the officials’ recommendations during de-occupation measures. In particular, to prepare a bomb shelter, stock up on a sufficient amount of water and charge the powerbanks. Everything will be Ukraine. Russian officials have privately warned that the country may face a longer and deeper recession as the impact of western sanctions spreads in an internal report prepared for the government, Bloomberg reports. The confidential report, which was seen by the network, finds that sanctions by western allies could handicap sectors that Russia has relied on for years to power its economy. It paints a much bleaker picture of the true impact of Russia’s economic isolation as a result of its invasion of Ukraine than officials usually do in their public pronouncements. In two of the three scenarios in the report, Russia’s economy could return to prewar levels only at the end of the decade or later. All the scenarios see the pressure of sanctions intensifying, with more countries likely to join them. As many as 200,000 Russian IT specialists may leave the country by 2025, the report says, while also warning that the country faces a “blockade” that “has affected practically all forms of transport,” further cutting off its economy. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, has urged the EU to supply his country with more weapons and equipment to help in its fight against Russia’s invasion. Shmyhal told reporters after a meeting of the EU-Ukraine Association Council in Brussels: We need more modern weapons, such as air defence, missile defence and ship defence. Ukraine needed aircraft and more armoured vehicles as there were no signs Russia was willing to end its war, he added. Shmyhal also suggested Ukraine could deliver gas to the EU to ease an energy crunch that has driven prices to record-high levels. He said: We can replace to a large extent the Russian imports. 30bn cubic meters is what we have in our gas stores, and we can offer some of it to our European partners in order to replace the Russian Federation in the unstable market. In a joint press conference with the Ukrainian prime minister, the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, promised the bloc’s continued support to Kyiv, no matter “whatever threat, whatever blackmail” may come from Russia. Borrell said: We will provide our support politically, financially, humanitarian and militarily as long as it takes and as much as needed. The Hollywood stars Sean Penn and Ben Stiller are among 25 Americans who have been targeted with sanctions by Russia due to their public criticism of Moscow’s war on Ukraine. The US commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, was also on the sanctions list, as well as the US senators Mark Kelly and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Rick Scott of Florida and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Russia’s foreign ministry said the group, which also included business leaders, academics and government officials, would be banned permanently from entering Russia. Penn and Stiller have been outspoken critics of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and have both met Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in high-profile shows of support. It’s 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia will not resume its gas supplies to Europe in full until the west lifts its sanctions against Moscow, the Kremlin said.

The White House has accused Russia of using energy as a weapon after it stopped the supply of gas through Nord Stream 1. The US and Europe have been collaborating to ensure sufficient supplies are available and that European gas storage will be full by the critical winter heating season but “we have more work to do”, a US official said. Despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you today on the Russia-Ukraine war blog. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Russia had yet to achieve any of its strategic objectives in its war in Ukraine. Russia “continues to lose significant equipment and personnel”, Wallace told MPs in the Commons. He said: It is estimated to date that over 25,000 Russian soldiers have lost their lives, and in all if you include killed, casualties, captured, or the now reported tens of thousands of deserters, over 80,000 dead or injured and the other categories. This will have long-lasting impact on Russia’s army and its future combat effectiveness. Russia has yet to achieve any of its strategic objectives. And we are now on day 194 of what was envisaged in total to be a month-long campaign. Wallace likened the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to a drug dealer who gets European countries “hooked” on gas. He urged unity across the continent over the winter, adding: If we don’t stand together, we don’t deal with it now, these threats won’t go away on their own and to the people in Prague or Cologne, if you give in to the dealer – the drug dealer, or the guy that gets you hooked on heroin – he will be back for more in a good few years. The final working reactor block of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in south-east Ukraine has been disconnected after Russian shelling disrupted power lines, according to Ukraine’s state energy operator. In a Telegram statement, Energoatom said: Today, as a result of a fire caused by shelling, the [last working] transmission line was disconnected. As a result, [reactor] unit No 6, which currently supplies the [plant’s] own needs, was unloaded and disconnected from the grid. The company told Reuters that the reactor was operating and providing the plant’s own electricity needs, despite its disconnection from the grid. The plant’s backup diesel generators, which provide power for cooling in the event of a shutdown, have not been turned on, they added. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, warned that the world was “once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster” following the initial news. Galushchenko added that the only way to ensure nuclear safety was the de-occupation of the plant and the creation of a demilitarised zone around the facility. The Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, has been covering the sentencing of the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in prison for treason. Journalists were seen crying and hugging each other on the streets outside the courtroom following the verdict. Speaking outside the courtroom, Safronov’s lawyer, Dmitry Katchev, said he was almost lost for words at the ruling. Katchev told reporters: Safronov was given 22 years for his journalistic activity. I want each of you, who are looking at me now, to think whether it is worth staying in this profession. If somebody was given 22 years for doing his job. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was found guilty in the Moscow court of treason charges that have been prosecuted with secret evidence behind closed doors. Many will see today’s ruling as an enormous blow to media freedom in Russia, as it comes on the same day that a Moscow court stripped Novaya Gazeta of its print media licence, effectively banning the newspaper from operating inside the country. Boris Johnson thanked Volodymyr Zelenskiy for his “leadership and friendship” during a phone call this afternoon, Downing Street has said. A spokesperson for the prime minister said: The prime minister made clear that he believed President Zelenskiy and his people can and will win the war in Ukraine. President Zelenskiy thanked the prime minister for believing in Ukraine and his people and updated on the recent progress of his armed forces in the south of the country. Johnson said he was “convinced” Ukraine’s forces could “continue to succeed in pushing back Russian forces” and that the UK “remains steadfast in its support”, Downing Street said. The spokesperson added: The prime minister told President Zelenskiy it had been a privilege to work with him and support him and the leaders agreed to stay in close touch as friends. The White House has accused Russia of using energy as a weapon after it stopped the supply of gas through Nord Stream 1. “Russia is using energy as a weapon and it is choosing to shut down the pipeline,” a US official said. “The US and Europe have been collaborating to ensure sufficient supplies are available. As a result of these efforts, European gas storage will be full by the critical winter heating season. We have more work to do.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy has thanked outgoing British prime minister Boris Johnson for his “personal bravery and principles” in response to Russia and said that he would remain “a great friend of Ukraine”. The Ukrainian president had a “summing up conversation” with Johnson, he wrote on Twitter: Russian-appointed officials in the occupied Kherson region of Ukraine say they are “pausing” a planned referendum on whether to become part of Russia due to attacks by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine last week said it had launched offensives in several directions in the southern region but has since released few details and continues to insist on a “regime of silence” for strategic reasons. The Russian state news agency TASS reported that the head of Kherson’s authorities, Kirill Stremousov, said plans for a referendum on joining Russia had been “paused” due to the security situation. Stremousov told TASS that attacks on the Antonivskiy Bridge in Kherson city by Ukrainian forces had stopped traffic from crossing the Dneiper River, which links the two sides of the region. In the conference, Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, congratulated Liz Truss for her “clear victory” and wished her the best as Britain’s new leader – but said he was not expecting the UK to return to the EU any time soon. A press conference with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell is under way in Brussels. A Russian court has sentenced the journalist Ivan Safronov to 22 years in a penal colony after finding him guilty of treason, in one of the most significant prosecutions against a Russian journalist in decades. Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, was arrested in 2020 and accused of disclosing classified information. His lawyers told the RIA Novosti news agency they will appeal the verdict. My colleague Andrew Roth is in court covering Safronov’s ruling: French president, Emmanuel Macron, has spoken with Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a “substantive” phone call to discuss the situation on the frontline and to coordinate further defence support from France, the Ukrainian leader said. The talks between the two leaders took more than an hour and a half, according to Zelenskiy. Following the call, Macron said the only way to restore security at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine was via withdrawal of Russian troops, the Élysée palace said in a statement. The Kremlin has warned that Russia will not resume gas supplies to Europe until western sanctions are lifted, blaming the “collective west” for its decision to shut down flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was cited earlier today by the Interfax news agency as saying: The problems pumping gas came about because of the sanctions western countries introduced against our country and several companies. There are no other reasons that could have caused this pumping problem. Peskov’s comments mark Moscow’s clearest demand to date that the EU roll back its sanctions in exchange for Russia resuming gas deliveries to the continent. But the Guardian’s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, points out that Peskov did leave some wiggle room. China’s foreign ministry has voiced its opposition to the agreement by G7 countries to impose a price cap on Russian oil, and urged countries to ease the situation “through dialogue”. Oil is one of the global commodities and it is “crucial to ensure the security of global energy supply”, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, told reporters. Mao added: We hope that relevant countries will make constructive efforts to ease the situation through dialogue and consultation, not do the opposite. The EU is running low on weapons stocks as member countries continue to send arms and ammunition to Ukraine, the bloc’s top diplomat has warned. EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, urged member states to better coordinate their spending on military materiel during a debate with European lawmakers. Borrell said: The military stocks of most member states has been, I wouldn’t say exhausted, but depleted in a high proportion, because we have been providing a lot of capacity to the Ukrainians. He added: It has to be refilled. The best way of refilling is doing that together. It will be cheaper. If EU countries continue to expand their military capabilities in the same way, “the result will be a big waste of money, because this is not a way of cancelling our duplications – there are a lot of them – or filling our gaps”, he said. Borrell admitted that the EU should have begun to train Ukraine’s armed forces a year ago, months before Russia launched its invasion, after several member countries requested such an operation. Had the EU responded at the time, “we would be in a better situation”, he said, adding: Unhappily we didn’t, and today we regret. We regret that last August we were not following this request, fulfilling this request. Ukraine and the EU have signed a deal to release a further €500m (£431m) in planned aid, aimed at supporting housing, education and agriculture. The European Commission announced the package as senior officials hosted a meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. In addition to the latest aid package, Ukraine will also be able to apply to the EU digital economy fund to develop hi-tech training and industry. The meeting today in Brussels will be the first since Ukraine was accepted as a formal candidate to join the EU. It was chaired by the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, and enlargement commissioner Olivér Várhelyi. During the early days of the Russia-Ukraine war, the invading force was approaching the Irpin River and the gates of the Ukrainian capital. But the river waters suddenly rose, forcing the Russians to turn back and leaving a trail of abandoned tanks and military hardware. Kyiv breathed again and a wetland ecosystem was reflooded for the first time in more than 70 years. Miraculous as it might have seemed, it wasn’t the hand of God that helped save Ukraine. “That’s warWilding,” says Jasper Humphreys, the director of programmes for the Marjan Study Group in the department of war studies at King’s College London, which researches conflict and the environment. “I woke up in the middle of the night, a few days after reading the ‘hero river’ story in the Guardian about how the Ukrainian army reflooded the dying Irpin River and its former wetlands to save the Ukrainian capital,” says the academic, of how he came up with the word. “And I just sat up in bed and whispered to myself, ‘It’s warWilding’.” Read the full story: WarWilding: a new word to describe the startling effects of using nature as a weapon A Russian-installed official in Ukraine’s Kherson region said plans for a referendum on joining Russia have “taken a pause due to security considerations”, Russian state media reported. Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the Russian-installed administration in the occupied Kherson region, was cited by the Russian state-owned Tass news agency as saying: We have got prepared for voting. We wanted to organise the referendum in the near future, but because of the current developments, I think we will take a pause. It is quite explainable from the practical point of view. We are not running before the hounds and are focused on our key task - to feed people, to ensure their security. The Russian-imposed military-civilian administration in Kherson had previously said it had begun preparations for a referendum on joining Russia. The Guardian has spoken with people in the Russian-controlled region who said they were opposed to voting in a referendum or joining Russia. Stremousov was also quoted as saying that the vital Antonivskyi bridge, which crosses the Dnipro river near Kherson city, can no longer be crossed by car after weeks of Ukrainian shelling. Almost all of the Kherson region has been occupied by Russian forces since March. Last week, Ukraine announced it had begun its counteroffensive in an attempt to retake the southern region from occupying forces. Novaya Gazeta, Russia’s leading independent newspaper whose chief editor was last year co-awarded the Nobel peace prize, was stripped of its media licence today. The Basmanny district court in Moscow said it had invalidated the newspaper’s licence at the request of the country’s media regulator, Roskomnadzor. Rozkomnadzor had accused the publication of failing to provide documents related to a change of ownership in 2006. Novaya Gazeta’s lawyers insist that the changes did not require presenting the charter to the authorities. The ruling was “a political hit job, without the slightest legal basis”, editor-in-chief and Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov, said outside court today. Novaya Gazeta suspended operations in late March after being forced to remove material from its website on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The court verdict in effect bans the outlet from operating. Rozkomnadzor is also seeking to shut down Novaya Gazeta’s website and a print magazine that it launched in July. Two court hearings are scheduled for later this month. Today’s ruling comes less than a week after the death of the last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who helped in the founding of Novaya Gazeta in the early 1990s. Muratov led the procession at Gorbachev’s Moscow funeral on Saturday. Six of Novaya Gazeta’s reporters have been killed in assassinations that the newspaper and human rights groups say were connected with their work, including top investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya. Hello everyone. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, taking over the blog from Tobi Thomas to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far. The Kremlin has said they think there is little hope of anything positive in diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia from the next British prime minister. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also warned that Moscow would take “retaliatory measures” over a G7 proposal to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil. Despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region, according to the latest update from the UK ministry of defence. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk City and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said that four of the six IAEA mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory. The remaining two still stay on a permanent basis, it said. European gas prices rocketed as much as 30% on Monday after Russia said one of its main gas supply pipelines to Europe would stay shut indefinitely. The move has stoked renewed fears about shortages and gas rationing in the EU this winter. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said his government had planned a total halt in gas deliveries in December, promising measures to lower prices and tie social benefits to inflation. “Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” Scholz told a news conference in Berlin. Liz Truss, who is likely to be confirmed as the UK’s new prime minister on Tuesday, will be under pressure to follow suit in helping people with energy bills. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned Europe to expect a difficult winter after the pipeline shutdown. “Russia is preparing a decisive energy blow on all Europeans for this winter,” he said in his evening address on Sunday. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counter-offensive with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east, as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Zelenskiy added. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. The Kremlin has warned also warned that it would take “retaliatory measures” over a G7 proposal to impose a cap on the price of Russian oil. A group of seven finance ministers agreed the cap on Friday in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, but Moscow has vowed to halt sales to countries imposing it. The Kremlin said has that they think there was little hope of anything positive in diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia from the next British prime minister, as they think the leadership contest had been dominated by “anti-Russian rhetoric”. “I don’t think we can hope for anything positive,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked if Moscow expected any shift in relations with the UK. Peskov said: I wouldn’t like to say that things can change for the worse, because it’s hard to imagine anything worse. Asked if Vladimir Putin would send a congratulatory telegram to the next PM, he said: Let’s wait and see who becomes prime minister. Britain’s next prime minister is set to be announced later today, following a weeks-long party leadership contest between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. Energoatom, Ukraine’s state enterprise operating all four nuclear power stations in the country, has said that four of the six IAEA mission members at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant have left its territory, while the remaining two still stay on a permanent basis. You can read the Guardian’s previous reporting on the issue here: European gas prices rocketed as much as 30% on Monday after Russia said one of its main gas supply pipelines to Europe would stay shut indefinitely, stoking renewed fears about shortages and gas rationing in the EU this winter. Reuters reports: The benchmark gas price surged as high as 272 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) when the market opened after Russia said on Friday that a leak in Nord Stream 1 pipeline equipment meant it would stay shut beyond last week’s three-day maintenance halt. The Dutch TTF October gas contract had eased to 256 euros, up 23% on the day by 0723 GMT but almost 400% higher than a year ago. This year’s price surge has squeezed struggling already consumers and forced some industries to halt production. Europe has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Russia says the West has launched an economic war and sanctions have hampered pipeline operations. The Nord Stream pipeline, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany, historically supplied about a third of the gas Russia exported to Europe but it was already running at just 20% of capacity before flows were halted last week for maintenance. Russian gas being supplied via Ukraine, another major route, has also been reduced, leaving the EU racing to find alternative supplies to refill gas storage facilities for winter. Several states have trigger emergency plans that could lead to energy rationing and raising prospects for a recession. “Supply is hard to come by, and it becomes harder and harder to replace every bit of gas that doesn’t come from Russia,” said Jacob Mandel, senior associate for commodities at Aurora Energy Research. A suicide bomber detonated explosives near the entrance of the Russian embassy in Kabul, police said on Monday, adding the attacker was shot dead by armed guards as he approached the gate. The head of the police district, Mawlawi Sabir, told Reuters: “The suicide attacker before reaching the target, was recognised and shot by Russian embassy (Taliban) guards … there is no information about casualties yet”. Russia is one of the few countries to have maintained an embassy in Kabul after the Taliban took over the country more than a year ago. Myanmar’s junta leader has been on a visit to Russia, his second trip there in less than two months, as Myanmar’s ruling military tries to shore up one of its few diplomatic alliances as it comes under growing international pressure. Reuters reports: Min Aung Hlaing, the country’s senior general, has been barred from representing Myanmar at most international gatherings since leading a coup early last year against an elected government led by Noble laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. He first visited Moscow as leader in June last year, when both sides committed to strengthening military cooperation. He also visited in July on what Russia said was a private visit. Russia, a main source of military hardware for Myanmar, was one of the first countries to voice support for the junta after the coup, at a time when it was receiving international condemnation over its use of lethal force against opponents. Myanmar state media said he would attend an economic summit, visit landmarks, universities and factories and his ministers and senior military officials would meet counterparts and “cement friendly cooperation”. Russia has been providing Myanmar with COVID-19 vaccines and Myanmar is planning to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns, as Russia looks for new sources of business amid Western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Myanmar’s junta has been hit by a raft of sanctions targeting the generals and the extensive business network the military operates. The United Nations and activists have accused the Myanmar military of atrocities and crimes against humanity and have urged the international community to cut off arms sales, with Russia singled out for supplying drones, jets and air defence systems since the coup. Myanmar’s military says it is fighting “terrorists” and is seeking to restore peace and re-establish democratic rule after a 2020 election it said was marred by fraud. On Sunday night, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked his forces for taking two settlements in the south and a third, along with additional territory, in the east, citing “good reports” from his military commanders and intelligence head. Reuters reports: Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president’s office, earlier posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in the southern area that is the main focus of the counter-offensive. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote on Facebook over a photograph of three soldiers on rooftops, one of them fixing a Ukrainian flag to a post. Ukraine began the counter-offensive last week targeting the south, particularly the Kherson region, which Russia seized early in the conflict. After Ukrainian forces’ intense shelling of clusters of Russian troops in the region, the Russians have banned movement of residents, forbidding them to cross the Dnipro River, the Ukrainian general staff said on Monday. Russia has launched 25 missile strikes, and more than 22 air strikes, on military and civilian targets in Ukraine in the last 24 hours, the statement added, keeping up its focus on establishing full control over the Donetsk region. The prospect of higher natural gas prices raises the spectre of recession in Europe this winter and that is bad news for the euro which has fallen to a 20-year low against the US dollar this morning. The single currency dropped 0.7% in early trade on Monday taking it below 99c to US0.9880 – its lowest mark for more than 20 years. The pound is also being crushed by the grim economic outlook across Europe and has lost 0.6% to stand at $1.145. Liz Truss is likely to take power in the UK on Tuesday and has pledged to act in her first week of office to tackle the crisis caused by rising energy bills. Full report here: The UK Ministry of Defence says in its morning intelligence update that despite the Russian military’s efforts to contain the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, it is focused on conquering the Donbas region. Russia’s main “axes of advance remain at Avdiivka near Donetsk City and, 60km to the north, around Bakhmut”, the MoD said in a tweet on Monday morning, “… but its forces have still only been advancing around 1km per week towards Bakhmut.” “The political goal of the Donbas operation almost certainly remains to secure the whole of Donetsk Oblast, which would enable the Kremlin to announce the ‘liberation’ of the Donbas. Russian forces have highly likely repeatedly missed deadlines to achieve this aim. “The Ukrainian authorities have claimed that Russian forces are now under orders to complete this mission by 15 September 2022. The force is highly unlikely to achieve this, which will further complicate Russia’s plans to run referendums on the occupied areas joining the Russian Federation.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Sunday that progress was being made to “liberate all our lands, all our people” after the beginning of the counteroffensive against the Russians in the south. “The Armed Forces of Ukraine, our intelligence, special services are already taking the necessary steps for this,” Zelenskiy said in a speech posted on Facebook. “These steps can be heard. And everyone can see that the occupiers have already started fleeing Crimea. This is the right choice for all of them.” He also thanked the “warriors of the 63rd battalion of the 103rd territorial defense brigade” who liberated a settlement in the Donetsk region. The “54th brigade in the Lysychansk-Siversk direction also took good steps, advanced and regained certain heights”, while the “42nd separate motorized infantry battalion - thanks to its heroic actions, two settlements in the south of our country were liberated”. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote. The Kremlin has blamed European politicians for the closure of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, one of its main gas supply routes, saying their economic sanctions on Russia had hindered Gazprom’s maintenance of the pipeline, Reuters reports. “If the Europeans absolutely absurdly make a decision to refuse to service their equipment, or rather, equipment that belongs to Gazprom, but which they are contractually required to service, this is not Gazprom’s fault,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russia’s state television, according to the Interfax news agency. “It is the fault of those politicians who made decisions on sanctions.” Gas prices are tipped to rise sharply in Europe on Monday morning after Russian company Gazprom said it was closing the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline until further notice, citing maintenance issues. Prices have soared since the invasion of Ukraine led to western sanctions on Russia, with the Kremlin responding by cutting gas exports to Europe. Prices had begun to fall last week amid some optimism that Europe could make it through the forthcoming winter months without households and industry having their supplies cut off. But the Nord Stream closure has refeocused markets on the problem and seem certain to send prices up again. Here’s the state of play in the UK natural gas market on Monday morning – prices in pence per therm: Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Russia’s war against Ukraine. I’m Martin Farrer and I’ll be with you for the next hour or so. It’s a little bit after 8am in Ukraine and the main developments you need to know about are here: Gas prices in Europe are expected to surge to record highs this week after Russia shut down a key pipeline to Europe. Many commentators warned that European prices will further rise when markets open on Monday after Moscow scrapped a Saturday deadline for flows to resume through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, saying it had discovered a fault during maintenance. German chancellor Olaf Scholz said his government had been planning for a total halt in gas deliveries in December, promising measures to lower prices and tie social benefits to inflation. “Russia is no longer a reliable energy partner,” Scholz told a news conference in Berlin. Liz Truss, who is likely to be confirmed as the UK’s new prime minister on Tuesday, will be under poressure to follow suit in helping people with energy bills. Ukraine’s president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, warned Europe to expect a difficult winter after the pipeline shutdown. “Russia is preparing a decisive energy blow on all Europeans for this winter,” he said in his evening address on Sunday The pipeline shutdown pushed the pound lower by 0.37% on Monday morning to $1.147 amid concerns about the economy’s ability to withstand higher gas prices. The euro is also down 0.3% and looks likely to test the recent 20-year low of $0.99005 as traders priced in more risk of a European recession. Ukraine has made progress in its recently launched counter-offensive with its forces taking two settlements in the south, a third in the east, as well as additional territory in the east of the country, Zelenskiy claimed during his Sunday evening address. “The Ukrainian flags are returning to the places where they should be by right,” he added. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the president’s office, posted an image of soldiers raising the Ukrainian flag over a village he said was in Ukraine’s south. “Vysokopillya. Kherson region. Ukraine. Today,” Tymoshenko wrote. Russia said the situation around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine controlled by its troops was calm on Sunday, after UN inspectors said on Saturday it had again lost external power. The last remaining main external power line was cut off although a reserve line continued supplying electricity to the grid, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement. Only one of its six reactors remained in operation, it said. Thousands gathered in Prague on Sunday to protest at soaring energy bills and demand an end to sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine. About 70,000 far-right and extreme-left elements coalesced at a “Czech Republic First” rally to call for a new agreement with Moscow over gas supplies and a halt to the sending of arms to Ukraine on Sunday. A Russian journalist is facing a 24-year jail term for treason. Ivan Safronov, a former military correspondent for Kommersant and Vedomosti, is facing a “record” sentence on treason charges that have been prosecuted with secret evidence behind closed doors. A Russian judge is expected to deliver a verdict on Monday in one of the most significant prosecutions against a Russian journalist in decades. The Russian state should be tried for historical crimes committed by the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa said before the premiere of his new documentary, The Kiev Trial, at Venice. Speaking at a press conference, Loznitza said there needed to be contrition for the wrongs of the past. “History repeats itself when we don’t learn from history, when we didn’t study it and don’t want to know what happened with us,” he said. Sweden has said it is on “high alert” for outside intervention in its upcoming election amid increased tensions with Russia. The Scandinavian country’s recently re-established psychological defence agency said it had seen heightened activity from foreign sources after its application to join Nato and it was prepared for the possibility of “something exceptional” in the lead-up to polling day on 11 September. China’s top legislator, Li Zhanshu, will attend the seventh Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok this week, becoming the most senior Chinese official to visit Russia since the Ukraine war began. Li, chairman of the national people’s Congress Standing Committee, will pay official visits to Russia, Mongolia, Nepal and South Korea from Wednesday to 17 September, according to Xinhua news agency. He will attend the four-day forum, set to begin on Monday, during his stay in Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T18:00:25Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant temporarily disconnected from grid; death toll from Russian strike on rail station rises to 25 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-blasts-heard-in-kyiv-region-joe-biden-to-call-volodymyr-zelenskiy-live-news","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant temporarily disconnected from grid; death toll from Russian strike on rail station rises to 25 – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was temporarily disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant, the operator said earlier today. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later said the power line was restored and was “currently up again”. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the IAEA could travel on a mission to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the next '“coming days”. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, earlier said his team were “very, very close” to being able to do to the plant. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. At least 25 people have been confirmed dead after a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station on Wednesday. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. The deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had “a great conversation” with his US counterpart, Joe Biden, and thanked him for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment, the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine. The past six months had been “unimaginably terrifying months for the people of Ukraine”, she said in a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said she was “truly shocked” by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday. Russian troops have widely used cluster bombs during its war in Ukraine, causing hundreds of civilian casualties and damaging homes, schools and hospitals, according to a monitoring body. The hundreds of cluster munition attacks that have been documented, reported, or are alleged to have occurred show a “blatant disregard for human life, humanitarian principles and legal norms”, the Cluster Munition Coalition said. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia plant for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. Keir Starmer is planning a trip to Ukraine in the late autumn as he moves to cement his relations with the Kyiv government as it continues its fight against Russia. The Labour leader approached the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy this summer about the possibility of a visit as opposition leader, with the Labour party writing a letter seen by the Guardian. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, and the Russia-Ukraine war blog today. Thanks for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. Ukraine’s energy minister, German Galushchenko, said the UN nuclear watchdog could travel on a mission to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in the next coming days. Galushchenko told Reuters: A visit is planned. We are talking about the coming days - this is definitely no later than the beginning of September. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had “a great conversation” with his US counterpart, Joe Biden, and thanked him for his “unwavering” support. It comes a day after Biden announced nearly $3bn in new military assistance to Ukraine, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. The new package is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date, bringing to over $13bn the total the US has supplied or pledged to Kyiv under the Biden administration. The last regular power line supplying electricity to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine has been restored, according to the UN nuclear watchdog, citing Ukraine. It comes after Ukraine’s nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant, the operator said earlier today. Disconnecting the plant raises the risk of catastrophic failure of cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods, which run on electricity. In a statement, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said: Ukraine told the IAEA that the ZNPP, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, at least twice lost connection to the power line during the day but that it was currently up again. A Soviet-era monument in the Latvian capital, Riga, has been demolished after the memorial became a rallying point for supporters of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Demolition machinery was used to remove the 79-meter second world war memorial, built in 1985. Latvia’s parliament voted to remove all remaining Soviet statues, plaques and bas-reliefs by mid-November, despite protests from the country’s ethnic Russian minority to keep the memorial. The Hague in the Netherlands has said it will ask for a temporary exemption of EU sanctions against Russia, as it struggles to find a new gas supplier to replace the Russian supplier Gazprom. The city said it held an EU-wide tender in June and July, but failed to attract any bids from potential suppliers, Reuters reports. In a letter to the city council, alderman, Saskia Bruines, wrote: We will ask for an exemption for our current arrangement until 1 Jan. 2023 to guarantee the safety of supply and to facilitate negotiations. Keir Starmer is planning a trip to Ukraine in the late autumn as he moves to cement his relations with the Kyiv government as it continues its fight against Russia. The Labour leader approached the government of Volodymyr Zelenskiy this summer about the possibility of a visit as opposition leader, with the Labour party writing a letter seen by the Guardian. It affirms Starmer’s support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia and proposes he travels to Kyiv and hold talks with Zelenskiy. The proposed trip follows a previous visit by Starmer to the Polish border, and to visit British troops in Estonia to affirm Labour’s “unshakeable” commitment to Nato. The letter sets out Starmer’s previous meetings with prominent international figures. Sources in the Ukrainian government suggest a date for Starmer’s trip has not yet been agreed, despite what one said was a shortage in August of high-profile foreign guests. They expressed some reservations about not wanting to antagonise the Conservative party after having received strong support from Boris Johnson and his likely successor Liz Truss. However, it is understood the principle of the trip has been agreed and organisational planning is under way, with Starmer looking likely to undertake the journey later this year.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid on Thursday, for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power operator Energoatom said. The final power line connecting the plant to the grid was cut twice by fires at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant. Three other lines had already been taken out in months of fighting. “The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid – for the first time in the history of the plant,” the company said in a statement. The nuclear power plant needs electricity to run cooling systems for the reactors and spent fuel rods. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. During the outage, the plant still got supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connecting the plant to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. Energoatom’s chief on Wednesday told the Guardian that Russian engineers have drawn up a risky blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from its national grid, and connect it to the Russian power network instead. The plan is ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine are cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday, Petro Kotin said. Ukraine and world leaders have warned Russia against attempting to change connections at the plant. They have also called on it to demilitarise the area, after military vehicles were parked in turbine halls and other sensitive areas of the plant, potentially blocking access for firefighters. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, as the war in Ukraine enters its seventh month with no signs of abating. The Russian president’s decree appears to point to the country’s aim to replenish its military, which has been heavily damaged in Ukraine and has failed to achieve its objective to capture the capital, Kyiv. The order, which will come into effect on 1 January, includes a 137,000 rise in the number of combat personnel to 1.15 million. It marks a noticeable increase in army personnel since the last time Russia expanded the size of its military in 2017, when it added 13,698 military personnel and 5,357 non-combatants. The top United Nations official in Ukraine said on Thursday she was shocked by military strikes that killed children and other civilians in Chaplyne in central Ukraine on Wednesday, and called on all parties to adhere to international law. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had hit a military train at Chaplyne railway station. Kyiv says 25 civilians died in the Russian strike. UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, Denise Brown, said in a statement: I am truly shocked by the strikes that yesterday killed and injured civilians close to the rail station in Chaplyne, in central Ukraine. Children were killed in this attack and they died in places where they expected to be safe, in their homes or travelling with their families. In case you missed it earlier, the UN nuclear watchdog said it was “very, very close” to being able to go to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Its chief, Rafael Grossi, told France 24 TV on Thursday: “We are very, very close to that [gaining access to the facility].” It comes as the last two working reactors at the power plant were disconnected from Ukraine’s electricity grid on Thursday after nearby fires damaged overhead power lines. Ukrainian staff are still operating the plant but the site has been controlled by Russian forces since early in the six-month war. Each side has accused the other of shelling the site, fuelling international concern about the potential for a nuclear accident. Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant under occupation by Russian troops was disconnected from the national power supply on Thursday, the state energy operator said. In a statement, Energoatom said the plant was disconnected from Ukraine’s national grid after a power line was damaged by fires at ash pits in a nearby thermal power plant. Energoatom said: The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the (Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant) from the power grid - the first in the history of the plant. Three of the nuclear plant’s power lines “were earlier damaged during terrorist attacks” by Russian forces, the operator said. As a result, the two remaining working of the plant’s six reactors still functioning “were disconnected from the network”. The operator added that the plant’s security systems were working normally and work was under way to reconnect one of the reactor blocks to the grid. A 17-year-old boy has died after Russian shelling in the town of Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region in south-east Ukraine, according to a Ukrainian official. Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, wrote on Telegram: Another massive enemy shelling in the city of Orikhiv and surrounding settlements. The occupier used artillery and fired several hours in a row. A 17-year-old boy died. He was seriously wounded and died on the way to hospital. A 66-year-old woman from the village of Preobrazhenka was seriously injured in the enemy attack. Dozens of private houses had also been destroyed as a result of the shelling, he added. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video on Telegram reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. Fedorov said: Tonight, the headquarters of the occupiers in the village of Pryazovske was blown up. It was there that the Russians prepared for the ‘voting’ and issued Russian passports. Fedorov also claimed that very few people had taken up the offer of Russian passports, although he did not have an exact number. The Guardian has not been able to verify his claims. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, Reuters has cited the Russian state-owned news agency Ria as saying. The figure, which includes a 137,000 increase in the number of military personnel to 1.15 million, will come into effect on 1 January. Russia classifies military deaths as state secrets and has not updated its official casualty figures regularly during the war in Ukraine. On 25 March, it said 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine and its “unimaginably terrifying” impact on civilians. Bachelet spoke about the six months since the Russian leader ordered his troops into Ukraine during a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. The past six months had been “unimaginably terrifying months for the people of Ukraine, 6.8 million of whom have had to flee their country”, she said. Millions of others had been internally displaced, she added. Bachelet said: I call on the Russian president to halt the armed attack against Ukraine. The former Chilean president added that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant must be “immediately demilitarised”, adding: The fighting continues, amid almost unthinkable risks posed to civilians and the environment as hostilities are conducted close to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Russian troops have widely used cluster bombs during its war in Ukraine, causing hundreds of civilian casualties and damaging homes, schools and hospitals, according to a monitoring body. Hundreds of cluster munition attacks by Russian forces have been documented, reported, or are alleged to have occurred, the Cluster Munition Coalition said in an annual report. Mary Wareham, an advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement cited by AFP: Russia’s extensive use of internationally banned cluster munitions in Ukraine demonstrates a blatant disregard for human life, humanitarian principles and legal norms. The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi, said his team is “very, very close” to being able to go to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Asked by French television France 24 if talks on gaining access to the facility had succeeded, Grossi replied: We are very, very close to that. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief cautioned that the operation was “extremely complex” and said he hoped the mission would take place within “days”. Faced with the risk of a nuclear accident at Zaporizhzhia, Grossi stressed that “we need to go there, we need to stabilise the situation, we need to ensure a presence of the IAEA soon”. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has also publicly condemned the Russian rocket strike on the Chaplyne railway station. The attack on a train station full of civilians “fits a pattern of atrocities” by Russia, Blinken wrote on Twitter. Russia’s defence ministry has now confirmed its forces struck the Chaplyne railway station in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region on Wednesday. But the Russian ministry said the strike hit a military train that was set to deliver arms to the frontline in the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine says at least 25 civilians died in the Russian strike, which it says was aimed at residential areas. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has discussed the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in a telephone call with his French counterpart, Sébastien Lecornu, the Russian defence ministry has said. Shoigu informed Lecornu “about Russia’s stance on Ukraine’s actions” related to the nuclear power plant during the call earlier today, which was initiated by the French side, the ministry said in a statement. The Russian minister also “noted the importance of sending a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the plant” and said Russia was ready to provide the necessary assistance to the UN nuclear watchdog’s inspectors, the ministry added. The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, has condemned a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station that killed at least 25 people and wounded dozens. Writing on Twitter, Borrell described the attack on Wednesday in the town of Chaplyne as “heinous” and vowed that those responsible “will be held accountable”. Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments from the Russia-Ukraine war. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. 25 people have now been confirmed dead after Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday, the Kyiv Independent reports. Four trains caught fire and the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. The western Synelnykove district in Dnipropetrovsk oblast has been shelled overnight with eight people injured so far, the Kyiv Independent reports. The southern Nikopol district was shelled with rockets and heavy artillery overnight, while a Russian missile was shot down near the city of Dnipro. Google’s subsidiary Jigsaw is to launch an anti-disinformation campaign aimed at tackling disinformation in Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic about Ukrainian refugees, Reuters reports. The campaign will run for one month and has been designed to establish resilience to anti-refugee rhetoric online. Google has conducted research with psychologists at two British universities and will work alongside academics, fact checkers, non-government organisations and disinformation experts on the project. It is 9am in Kyiv. Here is where we stand: The head of the Kyiv regional military administration said Russia launched a rocket attack on the region’s Vyshgorod district north of the city centre early this morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces said that “several” explosions were heard around 3am. The US president, Joe Biden, will speak with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy,after the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the phone call would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments. Russia plans to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, said Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia plant (ZNPP) for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. At least 22 people have been killed and 50 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station on Wednesday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the rockets struck a train in a station in the town of Chaplyne, about 145km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “There are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died,” he said adding that the death toll could increase as rescue operations continue. Zelenskiy says Russia has placed the world “on the brink of a radiation disaster”. “The Russian military made the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe a combat zone … Now all of Europe and all neighbouring regions are under the threat of radiation pollution,” he said in a Wednesday evening address. Zelenskiy also called for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to take “permanent control” of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. US president Joe Biden confirmed a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in military aid, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. US officials said the equipment, which will have to be ordered and will not be delivered for months or years, represented a longer-term investment in Ukrainian security. It is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, visited Ukraine for the third time since Russia invaded, urging the international community to “stay the course” in its support. Announcing £54m in support, he told Zelenskiy that Ukraine “can and will win the war”. Other senior politicians from across Europe travelled to Kyiv to show their support in person. Moscow is making preparations to stage referendums in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, according to US intelligence. “We have information that Russia continues to prepare to hold these sham referendum in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the so called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics,” spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said. “We’ve also learned that the Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda, particularly in Kharkiv as well. And these referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks.” Plans by Russian-backed authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in Mariupol would be a “mockery of justice”, the US secretary of state spokesperson, Ned Price, said. “The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them,” he said on Wednesday. Russia has claimed that the slowing pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is deliberate and driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said: “Everything is being done to avoid casualties among civilians. Of course, this slows down the pace of the offensive, but we are doing this deliberately.” Ukraine’s top military intelligence official, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia’s offensive was slowing because of moral and physical fatigue in its ranks and Moscow’s “exhausted” resource base. Britain is importing no energy from Russia for the first time on record. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released six months after the start of the war found that in June the UK’s imports from Russia were down by 97% and stood at only £33m as sanctions took effect. A New Zealand soldier has been killed in Ukraine, becoming the latest foreign fighter and first New Zealander to die in the war. Cpl Dominic Abelen, 30, was on leave without pay from his country’s army when he was killed after enlisting with Ukraine’s international legion. Russia is probably prepared to exploit any Ukrainian military activity near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) for propaganda purposes, according to British intelligence. While Russia maintains the military occupation of ZNPP, the principal risks to reactor operations are likely to remain disruption to the reactors’ cooling systems, damage to its back-up power supply, or errors by workers operating under pressure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence report reads. On 21 August, imagery indicated that Russia maintained an enhanced military presence at the site, with armoured personnel carriers deployed within 60 metres of reactor number five. Russian troops were probably attempting to conceal the vehicles by parking them under overhead pipes and gantries.” The head of the Kyiv regional military administration has issued an update regarding the series of explosions reported near the city earlier this morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said Russia launched a rocket attack on the Vyshgorod district north of the city centre. “Two arrivals were recorded,” Kuleba said seemingly in reference to Russian missiles. The regional head said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces earlier said that “several” explosions were heard around 3am on Thursday as residents were urged to seek shelter immediately. A New Zealand soldier has been killed in Ukraine, becoming the latest foreign fighter and first New Zealander to die in the war. Charlotte Graham-McLay brings us this report from Wellington. Cpl Dominic Abelen, 30, was on leave without pay from his country’s army when he was killed after enlisting with Ukraine’s international legion. He had served in New Zealand’s army for 10 years, the military said in a written statement on Thursday. Abelen had previously deployed to Iraq and was based in Christchurch before he left for Ukraine. He had not told the defence force he was travelling to Ukraine or sought its permission. Two people who knew Abelen – one in Ukraine and another in New Zealand – told the Guardian he had enlisted with Ukraine’s international legion and had fought on the frontline of the conflict. They would not say how long Abelen had been in Ukraine, but it is understood to have been some months. New Zealand’s military would not comment on the circumstances of Abelen’s death because he was not on active duty, but his commanding officer said he was well liked and respected. The United Nations voiced similar alarm to Russian attempts to hold tribunals for Ukrainian prisoners of war in Mariupol. UN human rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva: Under international law, individuals entitled to prisoner of war status have combatant immunity and cannot be prosecuted for having participated in hostilities, or for lawful acts of war committed in the course of the armed conflict, even if such acts would otherwise constitute an offence under domestic law.” She warned there are few details available about the potential for such trials, but that images posted by news outlets and on social media appear to show metal enclosures - possibly intended to confine the detainees - being built near a concert hall in Mariupol. The US has condemned any Russian effort to hold tribunals for Ukrainian prisoners of war in the Russian-occupied southern city of Mariupol, labelling the proceedings “illegitimate.” Reports surfaced this week that Moscow is considering prosecuting Ukrainian prisoners of war (PoWs) under conditions that could amount to war crimes. US state department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement on Wednesday: The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them.” The Kremlin is attempting to deflect responsibility for President [Vladimir] Putin’s war of aggression and distract from overwhelming evidence of the atrocities Russian forces have committed in Ukraine… All members of Ukraine’s armed forces, including domestic and foreign volunteers incorporated into the armed forces, are entitled to prisoner of war status if they are captured and must be afforded the treatment and protections commensurate with that status, according to the Geneva Conventions.” The statement also called on Moscow to “comply with its obligations under international law.” Moscow is making preparations to stage referendums in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, according to US intelligence. Spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said: We have information that Russia continues to prepare to hold these sham referendum in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the so called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics. We’ve also learned that the Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda, particularly in Kharkiv as well. And these referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks.” Kirby said that holding referendums, intended as a prelude to annexation, was proving a challenge to Russian organisers in the face of the near-total opposition of Ukraine’s population. Our information is that Russian officials are so concerned that there will be a low voter turnout … that they’re trying to work on workarounds and how they would how they would communicate that,” he said, but did not describe what those “workarounds” might be. A detailed plan has been drawn up by Russia to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. World leaders have called for the Zaporizhzhia site to be demilitarised after footage emerged of Russian army vehicles inside the plant, and have previously warned Russia against cutting it off from the Ukrainian grid and connecting it up to the Russian power network. But Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, told the Guardian in an interview that Russian engineers had already drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. They presented [the plan] to [workers at] the plant, and the plant [workers] presented it to us. The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said. He fears that Russia’s military is now targeting those connections to make the emergency scenario a reality. The plant’s electricity connections are already in a critical situation, with three of the four main lines connecting it to Ukraine’s grid broken during the war, and two of the three back-up lines connecting it to a conventional power plant also down, he said. The Russian plan to disconnect it entirely would raise the risk of a catastrophic failure by leaving it dependent on a single source of electricity to cool the reactors. “You cannot just switch from one system to another immediately, you have to … shut down everything on one side, and then you start to switch on another side,” he said. During this disconnection, the plant won’t be connected to any power supply and that is the reason for the danger,” he said. “If you fail to provide cooling … for one hour and a half, then you will have melting already.” At least 22 people have been killed and 50 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station, as the country marked a sombre independence day, and six months since Moscow’s invasion started. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the rockets struck a train in a station in the town of Chaplyne, about 145km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died,” he said adding that the death toll could increase as rescue operations continue. US President, Joe Biden, will speak with Ukrainian President, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, following the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the US would continue to “rally the free world” and “galvanise allies and partners” to support Ukraine as the Russian invasion hits the six-month mark. He said the phone call between Biden and Zelenskiy would reaffirm those commitments and would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments and congratulate him on Ukraine’s independence day, according to the White House. “The President’s looking forward to that,” Kirby said, while saying there were no travel plans to discuss for Biden to visit Kyiv. He said if a “trip makes sense,” it would come under consideration. Ukrainian officials are reporting explosions near Kyiv early this morning . Ukraine’s armed forces said that “several” explosions were heard in the Vyshgorod district around 3am on Thursday, a district north of the city centre, in an alert issued via its official Telegram account. The head of the Kyiv regional military administration, Oleksiy Kuleba, also issued a Telegram update, saying: We have information about several sounds of explosions in one of the communities of the Vyshgorod district. We are clarifying the information. Emergency services are already working.” Kuleba urged resident to seek shelter immediately. According to Ukraine’s emergency services, an air raid alert was issued throughout the region at 3.21am. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine.

The Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, put out a statement on the Telegram social media platform saying the situation at the plant, the biggest nuclear power station in Europe, was “under control”. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said in a statement: “our current assessment is that there is no immediate risk to the safety of the plant.” But there are long-term concerns, both over safety and the possibility of the plant becoming operational again in the coming years. Oleksiy, a former reactor operator and shift supervisor at the plant, pointed out that all six reactors had been shut down since the plant found itself on the frontline after the Russian invasion. Five of the reactors are in “cold shutdown”, turned off completely and being cooled, and one is in “hot shutdown”, kept at 200-250C so it would be easier to restart if conditions allowed, and to supply winter heating to the neighbouring town of Energodar. Oleksiy, who left after Russian forces occupied the plant in March last year and is now elsewhere in Ukraine, said the last reactor should be shut down and that the plant had sufficient resources to keep all reactor cores cool. “I think that the damage of the dam doesn’t impact the plant immediately, because they are being cooled by the safety systems located at the plant, which are spray systems,” he said. “The plant has a cooling lake, about two or three kilometres in diameter.” The Energoatom statement said the cooling lake was filled and was at 16.6 metres (54.5ft), “which is sufficient for the power plant’s needs”. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian nuclear scientist, said: “The fact that there’s an artificial pond next to the ZNPP [Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant] where water can be maintained above the reservoir level, and the fact that the reactors are in cold shutdown, offers some reassurance and increased time to respond if ZNPP starts getting affected.” But Budjeryn, who is a senior research associate on the project on managing the atom at Harvard University, added: “The bigger problem – who is going to do it? ZNPP is already down-staffed to bare bones.” Oleksiy said that over time water would evaporate from the cooling lake and if it could not be filled from the vast reservoir created upstream of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the turbines and the power plant could not be operated. In his statement, Grossi said that the cooling pond should last “for some months” but it was imperative it was not damaged in fighting. The water is used to cool not just the reactor cores, but also the spent fuel and the diesel generators used for safety systems. “Absence of cooling water in the essential cooling water systems for an extended period of time would cause fuel melt and inoperability of the emergency diesel generators,” he warned. Budjeryn pointed to another implication of the dam collapse regarding the future of the Russian occupied nuclear plant, which Russian occupying forces have allegedly mined. “If the Russians would do this with Kakhovka, there’s no guarantee they won’t blow up the reactor units at ZNPP that are also reportedly mined – three of the six,” she said. “It wouldn’t cause a Chornobyl, but massive disruption, local contamination and long-term damage to Ukraine.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T18:47:32Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: International Atomic Energy Agency raises grave concerns over shelling at nuclear power plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/07/ukraine-russia-war-live-international-atomic-energy-agency-raises-grave-concerns-over-shelling-at-nuclear-power-plant","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: International Atomic Energy Agency raises grave concerns over shelling at nuclear plant – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"This blog is closing now, thanks for following the day’s developments. All our Ukraine news is here Here is a summary of events today: Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling on Saturday night of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”, including sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said a worker was wounded when Russian forces reportedly shelled the plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at the plant. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday on a three-nation visit with a reported aim of countering Russian influence on the continent. Hollywood actor Jessica Chastain visited Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv today. On Telegram Zelenskiy thanked her for meeting with him adding, such visits are “extremely valuable” for helping the world “hear, know and understand” what is happening in Ukraine. Hollywood actor Jessica Chastain has met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Writing on Telegram, the president said: American actress Jessica Chastain is in Ukraine today. For us, such visits of famous people are extremely valuable. Thanks to this, the world will hear, know and understand the truth about what is happening in our country even more. Thanks for the support! Chastain also visited the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital, according to Ukrainian public broadcaster, Suspilne News. Here are some images coming over the wires today. The Zaporizhzhia power plant in Ukraine is a focus of attention in the war after Kyiv accused Russia of shelling the plant again and damaging radiation sensors. The plant, in Russian-controlled territory, was also shelled on Friday. Moscow blames Ukrainian forces for the strikes. Reuters has put together some facts about Europe’s largest nuclear facility. Zaporizhzhia is the largest of Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants, which together provide about half the country’s electricity. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February was the first time war has broken out in a country with such a large and established nuclear power programme, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says. Zaporizhzhia’s six units each have a net capacity of 950 Megawatts electric, or a total of 5.7 Gigawatts electric, according to an IAEA database. The first unit was connected to the grid in 1984, and the last in 1995. The plant is of strategic importance to Russia because it is only about 200 km (125 miles) from Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. The plant was captured by Russian forces in the opening stage of the war but it is still run by its Ukrainian technicians. Shells hit a high-voltage power line at the facility on Friday, prompting its operators to disconnect a reactor despite no radioactive leak being detected. Ukrainian emergency services have released drone footage of a burning building in Mykolaiv, after what authorities say was a Russian strike. Mykolaiv borders the mostly Russian-occupied Kherson region. A medical facility in the southern port city was recently damaged in a Russian attack, which Mykolaiv’s mayor described as ‘terrorism’ Key developments today so far. Ukraine and Russia blamed each other on Sunday for renewed shelling on Saturday night of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”, including sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel. Moscow blames Ukrainian forces for the strikes.Russian occupation authorities in the city of Energodar where the plant is located said that overnight, “the Ukrainian army carried out an attack with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan rocket launcher.” Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said a worker was wounded when Russian forces reportedly shelled the plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at the plant, which is in Russian-controlled territory and was also shelled on Friday. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday as part of a deal to unblock the country’s sea exports. The four bulk carriers were loaded with more than 160,000 tonnes of corn and other foodstuffs.The resumption of grain exports is being overseen by a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul where Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN personnel are working. Pope Francis welcomed the departure from Ukrainian Black Sea ports of the ships carrying grain saying the breakthrough could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said late on Saturday that Russian forces had shelled dozens of front-line towns and were trying to attack in six different areas in the Donetsk region. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report accusing Ukraine of endangering civilians, which infuriated president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and triggered the resignation if its Kyiv office head, Reuters reports. The report, published on Thursday, said the presence of Ukrainian troops in residential areas heightened risks to civilians during Russia’s invasion. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday to kick off a three-nation visit reportedly aimed at countering Russian influence on the continent. The visit come after Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, undertook an extensive tour of Africa late last month. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s February invasion and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor has told Reuters. Of those charged, about 15 were in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remained at large, Yuriy Bilousov, head of the war crimes department of the prosecutor general’s office, said in an interview in the capital, Kyiv. Thirteen cases had been submitted to courts and seven verdicts issued, he said. In May, a 21-year-old captured Russian soldier became the first person to be convicted in a war crimes trial in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February. He was sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian. “Sometimes we’ve been asked why we prosecute such ... low-ranked officers. It’s just because they are physically here ... If generals were here physically and we were able to capture [them], we would definitely prosecute generals,” Reuters reported Bilousov as saying. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presents orders and the other state awards to service personnel and to members of the families of fallen soldiers in Kyiv on Sunday on the Air Force of Ukraine Day. Ukraine and Russia are pointing the finger at each other for shelling at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. While the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for a stronger international response to fresh shelling at the plant, reportedly by Russian forces, Russian occupation authorities claimed on Sunday a strike reportedly by Ukrainian forces had damaged administrative buildings inside the complex, AFP reports. Zaporizhzhia – Europe’s largest atomic power complex that was occupied by Russia early in its offensive – has in recent days been the scene of military strikes that have damaged several structures, forcing the shutdown of a reactor. On Sunday, Russian occupation authorities in the city of Energodar where the plant is located said that overnight, “the Ukrainian army carried out an attack with a cluster bomb fired from an Uragan rocket launcher,” AFP reports. “The projectiles fell within 400 metres of a working reactor,” Russia’s TASS state news agency quoted them as saying. The strike damaged some administrative buildings and fell in a “zone storing used nuclear fuel”. The information could not be independently verified. As Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for the attacks, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) warned on Saturday of “the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. Amnesty International apologised on Sunday for “distress and anger” caused by a report accusing Ukraine of endangering civilians which infuriated President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and triggered the resignation of its Kviy office head. The rights group published the report on Thursday saying the presence of Ukrainian troops in residential areas heightened risks to civilians during Russia’s invasion, Reuters reports. “Amnesty International deeply regrets the distress and anger that our press release on the Ukrainian military’s fighting tactics has caused,” it said in an email to Reuters. “Amnesty International’s priority in this and in any conflict is ensuring that civilians are protected. Indeed, this was our sole objective when releasing this latest piece of research. While we fully stand by our findings, we regret the pain caused.” Zelenskiy accused the group of trying to shift responsibility from Russian aggression, while Amnesty’s Ukraine head, Oksana Pokalchuk, quit, saying the report was a propaganda gift for Moscow. Ukrainian officials say they try to evacuate civilians from front-line areas. Russia, which denies targeting civilians, has not commented on the rights report. In its email on Sunday, Amnesty said it had found Ukrainian forces next to civilian residences in 19 towns and villages it visited, exposing them to risk of incoming Russian fire. “This does not mean that Amnesty International holds Ukrainian forces responsible for violations committed by Russian forces, nor that the Ukrainian military is not taking adequate precautions elsewhere in the country,” it said. “We must be very clear: Nothing we documented Ukrainian forces doing in any way justifies Russian violations.” Pope Francis welcomed the departure from Ukrainian Black Sea ports of the first ships carrying grain previously blockaded by Russia, saying the breakthrough could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. At his weekly address to pilgrims and tourists in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday, Pope Francis said: This step shows that it is possible to conduct dialogue to reach concrete results, which help everyone. This event presents itself as a sign of hope and my own heartfelt wish is that following this path, it will be possible to bring an end to the fighting and reach a just and lasting peace. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for stronger international response to Russia’s “nuclear terror” after reported new shelling at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear power plant. During a phone call with the European Council president, Charles Michel, Zelenskiy called for sanctions to be imposed on the Russian nuclear industry and nuclear fuel, the Ukrainian leader wrote on Twitter. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace today welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. More details about the training programme can be found in this report from last month. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company, Energoatom, said on Sunday that a worker was wounded when Russian forces again reportedly shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the biggest in Europe, on Saturday evening. It said on Telegram that the site of the plant’s dry storage facility, where 174 containers with spent nuclear fuel are stored in the open air, was hit by rocket attacks. Here is the UK’s Ministry of Defence latest intelligence update on Ukraine. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, landed in South Africa on Sunday to kick off a three-nation visit aimed at countering Russian influence on the continent, AFP reports. The visit come after Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, undertook an extensive tour of Africa late last month. South Africa has remained neutral in the Ukraine war, refusing to join Western calls to condemn Moscow, which had opposed apartheid before the end of white minority rule in 1994. Blinken will hold talks on Monday with his South African counterpart, Naledi Pandor, and also make an announcement on the US government’s new Africa strategy, Pretoria said in a statement. They will “discuss ongoing and recent developments relating to the global geopolitical situation,” it said. The state department last month called African countries “geostrategic players and critical partners on the most pressing issues of our day, from promoting an open and stable international system, to tackling the effects of climate change, food insecurity and global pandemics to shaping our technological and economic futures”. Blinken who is on his second trip to Africa since his appointment early last year, is due to proceed to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda later this week. This analysis by the Guardian’s Africa correspondent Jason Burke of Lavrov’s tour gives a good insight into the battle for influence on the African continent.

They included Glory, with a cargo of 66,000 tonnes of corn bound for Istanbul, and Riva Wind, loaded with 44,000 tonnes of corn, heading for Turkey’s Iskenderun, the Turkish defence ministry said. It said the other two vessels to have left Ukraine were Star Helena, with a cargo of 45,000 tonnes of meal heading to China, and Mustafa Necati, carrying 6,000 tonnes of sunflower oil and heading for Italy, Reuters reports. The JCC also said it was near finalisation of the shipping procedures to regularise operations to support implementation of the grain deal. The procedures were expected to be published early this week, it said. The first four ships left Ukraine last week under the agreement. The JCC said it has also authorized the movement, pending inspection, of Osprey S, inbound for Chornomorsk. That ship is currently at anchorage northwest of Istanbul and was to be inspected on Sunday. On Saturday, the JCC completed the inspection of Navistar, which was cleared to sail, and its joint inspection teams were to continue inspections on Sunday morning of the remaining two vessels that departed Ukrainian ports on Friday. The first ship to leave a Ukrainian port under the deal will not arrive in Lebanon on Sunday as planned, the Ukrainian embassy in Lebanon said. The Razoni left Odesa last Monday carrying 26,527 tonnes of corn. The embassy told Reuters the ship was “having a delay” and “not arriving today,” with no details on a new arrival date or the cause of the delay. Shipping data on MarineTraffic.com showed the Razoni off the Turkish coast on Sunday morning. An official with the Russian occupying authorities in Ukraine’s Kherson region has died after an assassination attempt, local Moscow-backed authorities as saying.. Vitaly Gura, the deputy chief of the Kakhovka district, “died of his injuries”, local official Katerina Gubareva, said on Telegram, AFP reports. Gura was attacked at home on Saturday morning and was gravely wounded by bullets, a source in the Russian-backed administration is reported to have told TASS news agency. Kakhovka is about 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Kherson city. Several assassination attempts have been reported against officials in Ukrainian regions seized by Russia since the start of its military operation in Ukraine in February. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday as part of a deal to unblock the country’s sea exports, Ukrainian and Turkish officials said. The four bulk carriers were loaded with more than 160,000 tonnes of corn and other foodstuffs, Reuters reports. The resumption of grain exports is being overseen by a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul where Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN personnel are working. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the deal last month after UN warnings of possible outbreaks of famine in parts of the world due to a halt in grain shipments from Ukraine that had squeezed supplies and sent prices soaring. Before the invasion, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The JCC has authorised the departure of a total of five new vessels through the Black Sea corridor: four vessels outbound from Chornomorsk and Odesa carrying 161,084 metric tonnes of foodstuffs, and one inbound. The first four ships left Ukraine last week under the agreement The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. Reuters reports Ukraine’s military said late on Saturday that Russian forces had shelled dozens of front-line towns and were trying to attack in six different areas in the Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Reuters could not verify either side’s assertions about battlefield developments. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday said that over the past week its forces had “achieved powerful results” in destroying Russia’s logistics supplies and rear bases. He said in a late night address: “Every strike on the enemy’s ammunition depots, on their command posts, and on accumulations of Russian equipment saves the lives of all of us, the lives of Ukrainian military and civilians. Reuters also reports: Russia’s war in Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, with most fighting shifting to a nearly 350-km (217-mile) front stretching southwest from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, British military intelligence said. North Macedonia has agreed to supply tanks and planes to Ukraine to help fend off Moscow’s ongoing invasion, senior Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said. The next weapons package to Ukraine from the United States was expected to be $1 billion and include munitions for long-range weapons and armoured medical transport vehicles, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. More on the Zaporizhzhia power plant Reuters reports: Shells hit a high-voltage power line at the plant, prompting operators to disconnect a reactor despite no radioactive leak being detected. The plant was captured by Russian forces in early March, but it is still run by its Ukrainian technicians. Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom blamed Russia for the damage at the power plant. Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, saying a leak of radiation had been avoided only by luck. The United States has accused Russia of using it as a “nuclear shield” while Russia’s defence ministry said damage to the plant had only been avoided thanks to the “skilful, competent and effective actions” of its units. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement on Saturday: I’m extremely concerned by the shelling yesterday at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster,” Both sides have accused each other of engaging in “nuclear terrorism”. Read more here: Good morning and welcome to the blog, where we start with a round-up of the latest developments. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised grave concerns about shelling at a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s office said it had started criminal proceedings against what it said was a rocket and artillery shelling by the Russian military of the Zaporizhzhia power plant on Friday. The Ukrainian military said Russian shelling was recorded in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern front lines. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement with it after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas during the Russian invasion. A foreign-flagged ship arrived in Ukraine on Saturday for the first time since the war started and will be loaded with grain, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister said.

Ukraine’s military intelligence believes that Russia is planning a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant tomorrow. “The occupiers announced an unexpected ‘day off’ at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. On 19 August, only operative personnel will be at the ZNPP. Entry to all other employees will be closed,” defence intelligence of Ukraine tweeted. Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. Authorities updated the death toll in the Kharkiv attacks that took place last night and this morning, bringing the total number of people killed to 15. Russian missiles that struck a residential area Wednesday night killed 12 while a strike early this morning killed three. Dozens more were injured. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the West arming Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign ministry updated the number of Russian casualties to at least 44,300. Meanwhile, Mediazona, an independent news organisation in Russia, has delved into the background of some of these deaths. Based on social media confirmation by relatives, reports in local media, and statements by the local authorities, Mediazona was able to confirm 5,185 deaths and found that the disproportionate majority of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine came from poor and minority regions of Russia. A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. Ukraine’s military intelligence has warned that Russian forces are preparing to stage a “provocation” at a nuclear power plant they control, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, called for an urgent withdrawal of military forces and equipment from the site. Guterres, on his second visit to Ukraine since the Russian invasion, joined the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, for meetings and then a press conference in the western city of Lviv. “We are worried. We don’t want another Chernobyl,” Erdoğan said. Zelenskiy said he agreed with Guterres on a framework for a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency watchdog to inspect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It was taken over by Russian forces in March but is still being run by Ukrainians. Russia’s foreign ministry rejected a proposal by UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, to demilitarise the area around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying it would make the facility “more vulnerable”, Reuters reports. The inhabitants of two villages in southern Russia near the Ukrainian border were evacuated on Thursday after a nearby ammunition storage depot caught fire but no one was hurt, an official said. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of Belgorod region, said in a statement that emergency services were investigating the cause of the fire near the settlements of Timonovo and Soloti, 15km (9 miles) from Ukraine, Reuters reports. A Ukrainian news website posted a video it said showed a large ball of flame erupting from the base. Russia on Tuesday blamed saboteurs for orchestrating a series of explosions at an ammunition depot in Russian-annexed Crimea, further to the south. Authorities have updated the death toll in the Kharkiv attacks that took place last night and this morning, bringing the total number of people killed to 15. Russian missiles that struck a residential area Wednesday night killed 12 while a strike early this morning killed three. Dozens more were injured. “Last night was one of the most tragic of the entire war in the Kharkiv region,” local governor Oleh Synehubov wrote on Telegram. During the meeting today in Lviv between the leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the United Nations, the families of soldiers from the Azov regiment marched across the city, calling for the return of their loved ones. A number of soldiers from this regiment are being held by Russia since they surrendered in mid-May the Mariupol steel plant they had been defending for weeks. The families called for Russia to follow the Geneva convention on treatment of prisoners of war and provide their loved ones with what they need. Earlier this month, Russia’s supreme court on declared the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation, a designation that could lead to terror charges against some of the captured fighters. The regiment has been a key piece of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the alleged goal of “denazification”. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. However, since then, its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins, with the unit integrating into the Ukrainian national guard. “While continuing our efforts to find a solution, we remain on the side of our Ukraine friends,” the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said today. Erdoğan met Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the UN chief, António Guterres, in Lviv today to discuss, among other things, the deal to unblock the Ukraine’s ports that was brokered by the UN and Turkey. The three leaders also spoke urgently about the rising tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, with Erdoğan warning of the danger of “another Chernobyl” disaster, Agence France-Presse is reporting. “We are worried. We do not want another Chernobyl,” said Erdoğan. Erdoğan mentioned Vladimir Putin once in his comments to reporters. “We discussed the exchange of prisoners of war and our initiatives in this regard,” he said. “We will continue to talk about that with Mr Putin.” The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has signed an agreement with Ukraine to help reconstruct infrastructure destroyed by the Russian invasion. Erdoğan is in Lviv today meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy and UN chief António Guterres. Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the UN chief, António Guterres, met in Lviv today to discuss the UN-brokered deal to unblock the country’s ports and the increasing tensions around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. In the meeting, leaders agreed upon the parameters of a possible mission led by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the power plant, which is the largest reactor in Europe. Zelenskiy told Guterres that this “deliberate and cynical terror on the part of the aggressor could have catastrophic consequences for Ukraine and the whole world”, according to a statement released by the office of the president. They agreed that an IAEA mission “must be carried out in a legal way through a territory free from occupiers”. Kyiv accuses Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the facility, Kyiv blames Russian forces. During the meeting, Guterres also told Zelenskiy of a UN fact-finding mission to Olenivka, “where Russia committed a cynical terrorist attack against Ukrainian prisoners of war,” the statement reads. Zelenskiy asked Guterres also to investigate “the issue of compliance by the Russian side with the agreements reached in the context of the withdrawal of Ukrainian defenders from Azovstal”. Ukraine’s military intelligence believes that Russia is planning a “provocation” at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant tomorrow. “The occupiers announced an unexpected ‘day off’ at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. On 19 August, only operative personnel will be at the ZNPP. Entry to all other employees will be closed,” defence intelligence of Ukraine tweeted. Kyiv has accused Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – Kyiv says it is Russian forces. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN met in Lviv today to review the grain export deal and discuss the growing tensions around the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Here are some photos of the visit: After meeting the UN secretary general, Antònio Guterres, in Lviv today, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the United Nations must ensure the security of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant occupied by Russian forces, Reuters is reporting. On Telegram, Zelenskiy wrote that he and Guterres had discussed the UN-brokered deal to unblock the country’s blockaded ports and ease a worsening global food crisis, but “particular attention was paid to the topic of Russia’s nuclear blackmail at the Zaporizhzhia NPP”. “This deliberate terror on the part of the aggressor can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world,” Zelenskiy wrote. “Therefore, the UN must ensure the security of this strategic object, its demilitarisation and complete liberation from Russian troops.” Kyiv accuses Moscow, whose forces captured the nuclear plant in March, of using it as a shield from which it shells Ukrainian targets. While Moscow says Ukraine is the one shelling the facility, Kyiv says it is Russian forces who have shelled the facility. Today, Russia said it could shut down the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear reactor, after it came under shelling at the frontlines in Ukraine. Kyiv has since denounced the move as a risk that would increase nuclear catastrophe. Zelenskiy noted that he and Guterres also “agreed to continue the coordination of the grain initiative implementation.” “We also discussed the possible directions of its development, the issue of illegal and forced deportation of Ukrainians, the release of our military personnel and medics from captivity,” he said. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet in Lviv to review the grain export deal. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. With tensions continuing to rise around the plant, scientists with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute simulated the radiation spread of a nuclear disaster. Scientists found that with the weather conditions of the past few days, radioactive contaminants could reach as far north as the Baltic Sea, hitting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland along the way, as well as Belarus. Heading west, radioactive contaminants would enter Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, was hit hard over the course of 12 hours, with at least seven people killed in a missile strike yesterday night and three more this morning. Many more were injured. The missiles hit a residential block, reducing it to debris, and a dormitory block. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the West arming Ukraine.

A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. The Russian military announced today that it has deployed warplanes armed with state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles to the country’s Kaliningrad region, a move that has been broadly interpreted as a response to the west arming Ukraine, the Associated Press is reporting. Three MiG-31 fighters with Kinzhal hypersonic missiles arrived at the Chkalovsk airbase in the Baltic Sea enclave south of Lithuania as part of “additional measures of strategic deterrence”, Russia’s defence ministry said. The warplanes will be put on round-the-clock alert, according to the ministry. The Kinzhal has a range of up to 2,000km (about 1,250 miles) and flies at 10 times the speed of sound, making it hard to intercept, the Russian military said. Russia has used the weapon to strike several targets in Ukraine. A video released by the ministry showed the fighters arriving at the base but not carrying the missiles. The deployment of Kinzhal missiles to Kaliningrad was an apparent showcasing of the Russian military’s capability to threaten Nato assets – Kaliningrad borders Nato members Poland and Lithuania. It comes after Moscow strongly criticised the deliveries of western weapons to Ukraine, accusing the US and its allies of fuelling the conflict. Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, has been hit hard over the past few hours, with at least seven people killed in a missile strike yesterday night and three more this morning. Many more were injured. The missiles hit a residential block, reducing it to debris, and a dormitory block. Here is footage: The 25th cargo ship carrying grain has departed Ukraine under a deal with Russia brokered by Turkey and the United Nations to unblock the country’s blockaded ports, Agence France-Presse is reporting. The ship, which is expected to reach Egypt in a few days, departed as the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and UN chief António Guterres, who were key to the reaching of the accord, were convening in Lviv to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The cargo ship I Maria departed from the port of Chornomorsk. It is loaded with 33,000 tonnes of corn,” Ukraine’s ports authority said in a statement on social media. It said that 600,000 tones of Ukrainian agricultural products had been shipped through a corridor agreed by Moscow and Kyiv in Istanbul last month. “So far, 25 ships with Ukrainian products left the ports of Odessa, Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk for the Bosphorus strait,” the ports authority added. The grain agreement lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and established safe corridors through the naval mines laid by Kyiv, with the first commercial ship carrying grain leaving on 1 August. With Ukraine and Russia two of the world’s biggest grain exporters, the halt in exports caused grain prices to soar, fuelling fears of a rise in global food shortages, particularly in poor countries already experiencing shortfalls. With tensions continuing to rise around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant – the largest nuclear reactor in Europe – scientists with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorology Institute simulated the radiation spread of a nuclear disaster at the plant. The scientists found that with the weather conditions of the past few days, radioactive contaminants could reach as far north as the Baltic Sea, hitting Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland along the way, as well as Belarus. Heading west, radioactive contaminants would enter Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic. A Russian attack killed one person and injured two in Mykolaiv, a city in southern Ukraine, said the Mykolaiv mayor, Oleksandr Sienkevych. “What the fuck do we need this war for?” Pavel Filatyev, a Russian soldier who fought in Ukraine, has fled his homeland and is risking prison to speak out against the invasion. The ex-paratrooper has published a 141-page bombshell breaking down the day-to-day activities of his unit after they were sent to mainland Ukraine from Crimea and eventually entered and captured Kherson. “I simply can’t stay quiet any longer, even though I know that I probably won’t change anything, and maybe I’ve acted foolishly to get myself in so much trouble,” said Filatyev, his fingers shaking from stress as he lit another cigarette. His memoir, ZOV, detailed how his exhausted and poorly equipped unit stormed into mainland Ukraine with no idea why the war was taking place at all. “It took me weeks to understand there was no war on Russian territory at all, and that we had just attacked Ukraine,” he said. At one point, Filatyev describes how the ravenous paratroopers, the elite of the Russian army, captured the Kherson seaport and immediately began grabbing “computers and whatever valuable goods we could find”. Then they ransacked the kitchens for food. “Like savages, we ate everything there: oats, porridge, jam, honey, coffee … We didn’t give a damn about anything, we’d already been pushed to the limit. Most had spent a month in the fields with no hint of comfort, a shower or normal food. “What a wild state you can drive people to by not giving any thought to the fact that they need to sleep, eat and wash,” he wrote. “Everything around gave us a vile feeling; like wretches we were just trying to survive.” Read more here: While Ukraine’s foreign ministry has the number of Russian casualties at about 44,300, Mediazona, an independent news organisation in Russia, has delved into the background of some of these deaths. Based on social media confirmation by relatives, reports in local media, and statements by the local authorities, Mediazona was able to confirm 5,185 deaths (Russia’s defence ministry disclosed casualties only twice in March, acknowledging just 1,849 personnel killed). Looking into these deaths, Mediazona found that the disproportionate majority of Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine came from poor and minority regions of Russia. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has provided an updated intelligence report on Russian troop locations and movement in Ukraine: Russian shells have again struck Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, yesterday and early this morning. In the attack this morning, at least one person was killed and 18 others injured, while seven were killed and 16 wounded on Wednesday. Here is a look at the destruction left behind: Ukraine’s foreign ministry has posted an update on Russia’s losses since the start of the invasion. According to the ministry, at least 44,300 Russian soldiers have been killed. Estonia has been hit by extensive cyber-attacks after removing a Soviet-era tank monument from a region whose population is predominantly ethnic Russian, its government has said. Russian hacker group Killnet claimed responsibility for the attack, which it said blocked access to more than 200 state and private Estonian institutions. The Estonian government said the impact of the attack was limited and went “largely unnoticed”. “Yesterday, Estonia was subject to the most extensive cyber-attacks it has faced since 2007,” its undersecretary for digital transformation said. “With some brief and minor exceptions, websites remained fully available throughout the day. The attack has gone largely unnoticed in Estonia.” Russia has warned it may shut down the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant if Ukraine continues to shell the facility – a claim Kyiv has denied. Russia’s head of the radioactive, chemical and biological defence force said the building’s back-up support systems had been damaged in strikes. In the event of an accident, Igor Kirillov added, radioactive material would cover Poland, Germany and Slovenia. Both Russia and Ukraine have accused one another of orchestrating attacks on the plant and both have rebuffed each other’s accusations. Ukraine must “prepare for all scenarios” at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, its interior minister has warned. Dozens of Ukraine’s emergency service workers wearing gas masks and hazmat suits took part in a disaster response drill amid fears of another Chernobyl-like disaster. The exercises saw them practice evacuating the injured, carrying out radiation scans, and washing down contaminated vehicles. “Nobody could have predicted that Russian troops would be firing on nuclear reactors with tanks. It is incredible,” Denys Monastyrsky said. As long as the plant is controlled by Russia there are “major risks”, the minister added. Russia has denied its forces had heavy weapons deployed at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, accusing Ukraine of stoking the fire ahead of a UN visit to the region. Kyiv was preparing a “provocation” during secretary general António Guterres’ stop that would see Moscow “accused of creating a man-made disaster at the plane,” its defence ministry said. “Russian troops have no heavy weapons either on the territory of the station or in the areas around it. There are only guard units,” a statement read. The ministry claimed Ukraine was deploying forces in the area and planned to launch artillery strikes on the plant from the city of Nikopol on Friday, coinciding with Guterres’s visit to Odessa. “The claim for the consequences [of the strikes] will be placed on the Russian armed forces,” the statement said. One more ship loaded with corn has left Ukraine’s Chornomorsk port, Turkey’s Defence Ministry has said. It is the first of four vessels to arrive at the country’s Black Sea port today, and marks the 25th to leave with grain under a UN-brokered export deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency has accepted Ukraine’s invitation to lead a delegation into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said. “I emphasised the mission’s urgency to address nuclear security threats caused by Russia’s hostilities,” he added. The nuclear plant, which is Russian-occupied but run by Ukrainian staff, has faced intense shelling throughout the war, with both sides accusing one another of the attacks. Before I hand you over to my colleague, here is a quick rundown of where things stand: There has been another reported attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv early this morning. According to local media outlets, at least one person has been killed and 18 others were injured in the attack. The strike follows yesterday’s attack on Kharkiv which killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Russia’s war on Ukraine has reached a ‘strategic deadlock’ a senior presidential adviser has said. “Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video. “What we are seeing is a ‘strategic deadlock.’” Russia has replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. The heavy attrition of Russian main battle tanks in Ukraine is highly likely partially due to Russia’s failure to fit and properly employ adequate explosive reactive armour (ERA), according to the latest British intelligence report. A senior Ukrainian presidential advisor has urged Ukrainians to stop “cancelling” Russians and called for them to instead encourage Russians to “switch to our side”. Oleksiy Arestovych penned a lengthy Telegram post on Wednesday, hitting out at fellow citizens for letting their emotions get the better of them and “turning on the cancellation to the fullest”. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, China’s defence ministry has said. Other countries will include India, Belarus, Mongolia and Tajikistan. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” exercises from 30 August to 5 September. Ukrainian authorities performed disaster response drills near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Wednesday. This followed repeated shelling at the Russian-occupied plant, the largest of its kind in Europe. The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, the Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhaylo Podolyak said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, Zelenskiy, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, will also discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” and the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said. Military-ruled Myanmar plans to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns and rising prices, a junta spokesperson has said, the latest developing country to do so amid a global energy crisis. Military-ruled Myanmar plans to import Russian gasoline and fuel oil to ease supply concerns and rising prices, a junta spokesperson has said, the latest developing country to do so amid a global energy crisis. The southeast Asian country has maintained friendly ties with Russia and Moscow is seeking new customers for its energy in the region as its biggest export destination, Europe, will impose an embargo on Russian oil in phases later this year. “We have received permission to import petrol from Russia,” Reuters reports military spokesperson Zaw Min Tun as saying during a news conference on Wednesday, adding that it was favoured for its “quality and low cost”. There has been another reported attack on Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv early this morning. According to local media outlets, at least one person has been killed and 18 others were injured in the attack. The Kyiv Independent citied Kharkiv regional governor, Oleh Syniehubov, as reporting that Russian forces launched rockets on Kharkiv overnight. Yesterday, another strike against a residential area killed seven people in Kharkiv. The heavy attrition of Russian main battle tanks in Ukraine is highly likely partially due to Russia’s failure to fit and properly employ adequate explosive reactive armour (ERA), according to the latest British intelligence report. Used correctly, ERA degrades the effectiveness of incoming projectiles before they hit the tank, the UK ministry of defence said in an update this morning. “This suggests that Russian forces have not rectified a culture of poor ERA use, which dates back to the first Chechen war in 1994,” the report added. It is highly likely that many Russian tank crews lack the training to maintain ERA, leading to either poor fitting of the explosive elements, or it being left off entirely. These deficiencies probably contribute to the widespread incidents of turret ejection, which are well documented in eye-witness videos from Ukraine.” The cumulative effect of these failures is likely a significant factor behind the poor performance of Russia’s forces,” British intelligence said. A senior Ukrainian presidential advisor has urged Ukrainians to stop “cancelling” Russians and called for them to instead encourage Russians to “switch to our side”. Oleksiy Arestovych penned a lengthy Telegram post on Wednesday, hitting out at fellow citizens for letting their emotions get the better of them and “turning on the cancellation to the fullest”. The statement comes amid fierce debate on whether the west should stop issuing Russian visas or discontinue allowing Russian citizens to visit on holiday. It’s hard to understand the nuances, it’s easier to hate and deny everyone - the solution is for an oyster. A smart man seeks allies, a fool repels friends.” These are tens and hundreds of thousands of people sitting on the fence who could switch to our side,” he wrote. And now they’re not going to do it.” The main bridge connecting Crimea to the Russian mainland must be “dismantled”, a senior Ukrainian presidential aide has said. The 19-km (12-mile) Kerch Bridge is Moscow’s key military and civilian land corridor to the peninsula. “The bridge is an illegal object,” Mykhaylo Podolyak said. It “must therefore be dismantled. Not important how – voluntary or not”, implying the bridge could become a military target for Ukrainian forces. Chinese troops will travel to Russia to take part in joint military exercises led by the host and including India, Belarus, Mongolia, Tajikistan and other countries, China’s defence ministry said. China’s participation in the joint exercises was “unrelated to the current international and regional situation”, the ministry said. In July, Moscow announced plans to hold “Vostok” (east) exercises from 30 August to 5 September, even as it wages a costly war in Ukraine. It said at the time that some foreign forces would participate, without naming them. China’s defence ministry said its participation in the exercises was part of a bilateral annual cooperation agreement with Russia. “The aim is to deepen practical and friendly cooperation with the armies of participating countries, enhance the level of strategic collaboration among the participating parties, and strengthen the ability to respond to various security threats.” Russia has reportedly replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week. Russia’s RIA news agency cited sources as saying Igor Osipov had been replaced with Viktor Sokolov. If confirmed, it would mark one of the most prominent sackings of a military official in the war so far. The Black Sea fleet, which has a revered history in Russia, has suffered several humiliations since Russia invaded Ukraine in the hope of a swift victory. In April, Ukraine struck Russia’s flagship the Moskva, a huge cruiser, with Neptune missiles. It became the biggest warship to be sunk in combat for 40 years. A Russian strike on Kharkiv is believed to have killed at least seven people and wounded 16 others, Ukraine’s state emergencies services said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a block of flats was “totally destroyed … We will not forgive, we will take revenge.” Images of rescuers combining through the wreckage have since been shared by the emergency services. Russia’s war on Ukraine has reached a ‘strategic deadlock’ a senior presidential adviser has said. Russian forces have achieved only minimal advances, and in some cases we have advanced, since last month,” Oleksiy Arestovych said in a video. What we are seeing is a ‘strategic deadlock.’” Ukrainian forces said on Thursday they had beaten back a Russian attack in the southern region of Kherson. “The stakes of the Russian Federation in this war have been raised,” Arestovych added. Ukraine’s ministry of defence said Russian forces were also moving aircraft further back into Crimea and away from the reach of Ukraine’s forces following the recent strikes in Crimea. “The Rashists [Russians] are urgently moving their planes and helicopters deep into the peninsula and to the airfields of the Russian Federation following the recent strikes in Crimea,” the ministry said in a briefing late last night. “The occupiers are carrying out measures to partially transfer aviation equipment from forward-based airfields in Crimea to reserve airfields and airfields permanently based on the territory of the Russian Federation,” the force added. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has arrived in Ukraine to meet its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Turkish president, Tayyip Erdoğan, in the western city of Lviv. The leaders will review the UN-backed grain export deal and discuss “the need for a political solution to this conflict” as well as the situation at the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Lviv in western Ukraine. On Friday, Guterres will visit the Black Sea port of Odesa, where grain exports have resumed. On Saturday, the top UN official will visit the Joint Coordination Centre in Istanbul, which is made up of Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and UN. officials overseeing the Black Sea exports of Ukraine grain and fertiliser. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while. Whether you’ve been following our coverage overnight or you’ve just dropped in, here are the latest lines. Russia has reportedly replaced the commander of its Crimea-based Black Sea fleet after explosions rocked the peninsula this week.

The top official in Russian-annexed Crimea has claimed the FSB security service has broken up a six-person terrorist cell of a banned Islamist group. It followed a series of strikes on Russian bases and other infrastructure across the region that Russia has sought to blame on sabotage. At least 12 Russians were reportedly killed in a strike on a base in the occupied city of Nova Kakhovka, according to the Ukrainian military. Footage posted to Telegram by the state border guard service showed numerous burnt-out trucks, collapsed buildings, and debris. Ukraine has not lost any US-supplied Himars rocket launchers, the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in contradiction to Russian claims. Ukraine has received at least 20 of the US-made launchers, and has used them to attack Russian ammunition depots, command posts, and air defences. The mayor of the village of Verkhnyo Rogachytsk in the Kherson region has been kidnapped, according to the deputy chair of the regional council. Yuri Sobolevsky said Svitlana Ivanivna was taken from her home at about 11am on Tuesday. The first wartime shipment of UN food aid for Africa reached the Bosphorus Strait on Wednesday under a UN-backed deal to restore Ukrainian grain deliveries across the Black Sea. Marine traffic sites showed the MV Brave Commander taking its cargo of 23,000 tonnes of wheat across the heart of Istanbul bound for its final destination in Djibouti next week. The leaders of Ukraine, Turkey and the UN are set to meet to review the grain export deal in Lviv on Thursday.

Canada has disbursed C$450m ($348m) in loans for the purchase of heating fuel before winter for Ukraine, the finance minister in Ottawa, Chrystia Freeland, has announced. Russia foresees a 38% rise in energy export earnings this year due to higher oil export volumes, coupled with rising gas prices, according to an economy ministry document seen by Reuters.

In a statement, the company claimed it had detected an oil leak at the main gas turbine at Portovaya compressor station near St Petersburg. It said the turbine could not operate safely until the leak was repaired, with no indication of how long that may take. An expert team from the United Nations nuclear agency plans to stay at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) after gaining long-awaited access to the site on Thursday. “We are not going anywhere. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there,” the head of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, told reporters after returning to Ukrainian-held territory. He said a group of experts had stayed behind at the plant in south-eastern Ukraine and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. The physical integrity of the Zaporizhzhia plant had been violated on several occasions, Rafael Grossi said. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he said. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Russia’s ambassador to international institutions in Vienna told the RIA Novosti news agency Friday that two inspectors would remain permanently at the plant. Ukrainian officials accused Russia of manipulating and distorting information shared with the IAEA. The Ukrainian state-owned operator Energoatom said in a statement that Russian officials were “making every effort to prevent the IAEA mission from getting to know the real state of affairs. They spread manipulative and false information about this visit”. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, accused Ukraine on Friday of “nuclear terrorism”. Russia has occupied Europe’s largest nuclear power plant since March. Pro-Russian proxy authorities in Zaporizhzhia have accused Kyiv of trying to smuggle “spies” into the IAEA inspection team posing as journalists. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday: “We did everything to ensure that IAEA would get access to the ZNPP and I believe that this mission may still have a role to play. Unfortunately we haven’t heard the main thing from the IAEA, which is the call for Russia to demilitarise the station.” G7 finance ministers have agreed they will “urgently” move towards imposing a price cap on Russian oil imports, aimed at stopping Moscow from raking in huge profits from soaring energy prices. In a statement, the ministers said they would “urgently work on the finalisation and implementation” of the measure but left out key details of the plan. Prior to the G7 announcement, the Kremlin warned that imposing a price cap on Russian oil exports would trigger Russian retaliation. If G7 leaders decided to impose price caps on Russian oil, it would lead to significant destabilisation of the global oil market, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. Ukraine’s agriculture ministry has said grain exports are down 54.5% year-on-year in the 2022-23 season so far, at 4.16m tonnes. The government has said Ukraine could harvest 50m tonnes of grain this year, compared with a record 86m tonnes in 2021, because of the loss of land to Russian forces and lower grain yields. The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), Denis Pushilin, has restated the expansionist military aims of Russia’s invasion, saying: “Our task is to liberate all Russian cities that were founded by Russian people during the time of the Russian empire, and developed during the Soviet Union thanks to the help of our entire vast country. And this is not only the territories of Novorossia [the Donbas], but also much wider. It will not be any other way.” The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said in its daily operation briefing that the main military aim of Russia at the moment continued to be “establishing full control over the territory of Donetsk region and maintaining the occupied areas of Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolaiv regions”. Ukrainian troops have pushed back Russian forces at several points around Kherson since Kyiv launched its long-awaited counter-offensive aiming to retake the southern province, according to western officials. Officials estimate that about 20,000 Russian troops are in the pocket of the southern region, and caution that it is too soon to determine if Ukraine’s counterattack is working. Russia’s foreign minister warned Moldova on Thursday that any actions seen as endangering the security of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria would be considered an attack on Russia. Sergei Lavrov said: “Everyone should understand that any action that would threaten the security of our troops [in Transnistria] would be considered under international law as an attack on Russia.” US federal agents searched properties linked to a billionaire Russian oligarch in Manhattan, the Hamptons and an exclusive Miami island on Thursday. FBI agents and Homeland Security Investigations personnel searched the properties, linked to Viktor Vekselberg, who is a close ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and whose $120m yacht was seized in April, NBC News reported. Children returned to Ukrainian schools left damaged by occupying Russian forces on Thursday. Only schools that are fit for use, are in areas that do not face a regular threat of shelling and that have enough students opt for in-person teaching will reopen. School administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. A senior Russian oil executive died on Thursday after falling from the window of a Moscow hospital, months after his company criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ravil Maganov, the chair of Lukoil, Russia’s largest private oil company, “fell from a window at Central clinical hospital”, the Interfax news agency reported on Thursday, citing a source. “He died from injuries sustained.” Maganov is the second top Lukoil executive to die in mysterious circumstances in recent months. Russian forces have been forcibly transferring Ukrainian civilians to Russia or areas of Ukraine under their control, according to Human Rights Watch. Forced transfers were “a serious violation of the laws of war that constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity”, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-07T18:22:02Z","webTitle":"Russia readies for southern offensive as alarm raised over shelling of nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/07/russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-as-alarm-raised-over-shelling-of-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"Russia readies for southern offensive as alarm raised over shelling of nuclear plant","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. The assessment came as both sides traded blame for renewed shelling on Europe’s largest nuclear plant, with the UN nuclear watchdog raising grave concerns about the attack. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” said the UK’s defence ministry, confirming early assertions by Ukraine’s deputy military intelligence chief. According to a separate source with Ukraine’s military intelligence, Russian forces are creating fire damage along the frontlines in the occupied Kherson region to stop Ukrainian forces from pushing out of their positions, and adding more units to attack Mykolaiv and south Dnipropetrovsk region, as well as conducting aerial reconnaissance of the area with drones. In occupied Zaporizhzhia region, the Russians are actively attacking Ukrainian troops while bringing in new units to strengthen their numbers, according to the same source. One of the major obstacles to Ukraine’s offensive in the south could be the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe’s largest, which was shelled on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it was a crime and “an act of terror”, saying the shelling was carried out by Russian forces. In a phone call on Sunday with the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, about the plant, Zelenskiy called for sanctions on Russia’s nuclear industry and nuclear fuel in response. But the head of Zaporizhzhia’s occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said that Ukrainian forces were to blame and had “decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe” by shelling the plant. It was not possible on Saturday to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station. Ukraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July. The Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to “play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive”. The ISW further said that Russia was “effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment”. Ukraine’s nuclear power agency, Energoatom, said that containers of spent fuel had been hit in the latest shelling, damaging three radiation monitoring sensors and injuring one employee. Spent fuel is highly radioactive, according to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In a statement on Telegram, Energoatom said the damage meant it was currently impossible to detect increased radiation or leakage of radiation from the spent fuel containers. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the size of the plant “underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond”. The UK’s defence ministry predicts Russia’s war in Ukraine will soon enter a “new phase” as it believes the fighting will shift from Donbas to a 217-mile front stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson. At present, the brunt of Russia’s attacks is around what remains of Ukrainian-controlled eastern Donbas. Russian forces are still trying to achieve their aim of capturing the whole of Donbas. Russian forces now control Luhansk oblast, with the exception of a few small settlements, and about half of Donetsk oblast. Russia is currently carrying out two offensives to capture the towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka and continuing to shell dozens of towns and villages from all directions, according to a statement by Ukraine’s general staff. Russian forces now appear to be occupying the southern part of Pisky, a village in Donetsk oblast near Avdivvka, as well as the small settlement of Travneve, 11 miles south of Bakhmut, according to the ISW, which reported that the Ukrainian army seemed to be holding the line elsewhere. Ukraine’s general staff said on Sunday that Russia was deploying troops and air defence systems to Belarus. However, the same Ukrainian military intelligence source said no offensive formations had been detected in Belarus, though rocket attacks from its northern neighbour continued to be a threat. Meanwhile, four more ships successfully left Ukraine’s ports, raising hopes that the deal brokered by Turkey and the UN to end Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports might hold. Russia’s decision to strike Odesa port hours after the deal was signed cast doubt on that. The deal is valid for 120 days and can be renewed if both sides agree. The first ship to set sail from Ukraine’s ports since the invasion left on Monday. Twenty million tons of grain have been stuck in Ukraine since February, pushing some import-dependent countries in the Middle East and north Africa toward famine. Before the war, Ukraine exported some 6m to 8m tons of grain a month. Using its rivers and railways, Ukraine is managing to export about 2m tons a month and hopes the reopening of its ports will increase the total to 3m a month in four to six weeks’ time, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, told Bloomberg."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T17:41:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 188 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-188-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 188 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukrainian troops are mounting a long-awaited counteroffensive in the southern region of Kherson, military officials have said. “Today we started offensive actions in various directions, including in the Kherson region,” Ukraine’s southern command spokesperson, Natalia Humeniuk, said on Monday. She declined to provide more details about the offensive but said Ukraine’s recent strikes on Russia’s southern logistical routes had “unquestionably weakened the enemy”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged Russian soldiers to flee for their lives after his forces launched an offensive to retake southern Ukraine. Kyiv’s forces have broken through Russian defences in several sectors of the frontline near the city of Kherson, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy claimed. Oleksiy Arestovych said Ukrainian forces were shelling ferries in the Kherson region that Moscow was using to supply Russian-occupied territory on the west bank of the Dnieper River. A separate Ukrainian military source told CNN that its forces had taken back four villages near Kherson after breaking through the frontline in three places, with the main target being Kherson. The Kremlin has insisted that its so-called “special military operation” in Ukraine is going to plan despite the news of Kyiv’s counteroffensive in the south. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “The special military operation continues, it continues methodically, and in coordination with the current plans. All objectives will be fulfilled.” Ukrainian forces have heightened artillery fire in the south, according to British intelligence. Several brigades of the Ukrainian armed forces increased the weight of artillery fire in frontline sectors across southern Ukraine early on Monday, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest report. Ukrainian long-range precision strikes continue to disrupt Russian resupply. Kherson has been hit by a partial power outage and a partial shutdown of the water supply, Russian state news agencies have cited pro-Russia officials as saying. Traffic lights and building lights have been reported to have failed in the Moscow-held region, according to Russian media. The first shipment of grain from Ukraine to the drought-stricken Horn of Africa since the war began has docked in Djibouti. The UN-chartered vessel Brave Commander is carrying 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and will soon be followed by another vessel carrying 7,000 tonnes. The total shipment, which will be unloaded in Djibouti and transported to Ethiopia, is enough to feed 1.5 million people for a month. A team of inspectors from the UN nuclear watchdog arrived in Kyiv on Monday night en route to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, said a team would visit the plant from Wednesday to Saturday. “We must protect the safety and security of Ukraine’s and Europe’s biggest nuclear facility,” Grossi tweeted. Missiles and shells are frequently hitting areas around the power station and nearby towns, prompting fears it may be too dangerous for the mission to proceed. The Kremlin said the IAEA mission was “necessary” but has ruled out vacating the site. A key adviser to Ukraine’s president has accused Russian forces of deliberately shelling corridors for the UN nuclear watchdog inspectors to reach the Zaporizhzhia plant. Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was attempting to force the IAEA mission through Crimea and parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions temporarily occupied by Moscow’s forces. The European Commission has said it will donate 5.5m potassium iodide tablets to Ukraine amid fears that fighting in the area of the Zaporizhzhia plant could lead to nuclear catastrophe. The commission said it had received a request from the Ukrainian government for potassium iodide tablets “as a preventive safety measure” to increase the level of protection around the nuclear plant. Ukraine has deployed a fleet of dummy rockets to trick Russian forces into wasting expensive long-range missiles on pointless targets, according to reports. At least 10 Russian cruise missiles have reportedly been fired by Moscow’s naval fleet in the Black Sea at the dummy targets, which are made of wood but look like US-supplied advanced rocket launcher systems when spotted by Russian drones, the Washington Post reports. Germany and France have issued a joint warning against a ban on tourist visas for Russians, saying such a step would be counterproductive, reports Reuters. The split on tourist visas will be at the heart of a meeting of the bloc’s foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday and Wednesday as they discuss what further steps they can take to punish Russia for its six-month-old invasion of Ukraine. Defence ministers meeting in Prague are likely to agree in principle on the less controversial step of organising joint military training missions for Ukrainian troops. Russia’s Gazprom has informed the French utility company Engie that it is reducing its gas deliveries owing to a disagreement between the parties over contracts, adding to concerns related to energy supplies. At least four people were killed and four wounded in Russian shelling of Kharkiv, the regional governor said. Writing on Telegram, Oleh Synehubov said: “As a result of the shelling of the central part of Kharkiv, at least 4 people died and 4 more were injured.” European Union defence ministers are set to pave the way for the establishment of an EU training mission for Ukrainian forces, the bloc’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said. Reuters reports that Borrell said: “The situation on the ground continues to be very bad. Ukraine needs our support, and we will continue providing support. A general, overall political agreement (on the training mission) is what I think we have to get today … I hope we will have a political green light for this mission.” Russia has faced “numerous failures” with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran this month for use in the war, according to a senior US administration official. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US understood that Russia had received the delivery of Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over several days this month. The official said it was likely to be part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of such vehicles, reports Reuters. Russian forces have killed two people and injured four others in Donetsk, the region’s governor said on Telegram. Pavlo Kyrylenko said the two people were killed in Rozdolne and Pivnichne. Russia is struggling to find more soldiers to fight in Ukraine and has expanded recruitment efforts by eliminating the upper age limit and by tapping into prisons. “Many of these new recruits have been observed as older, unfit and ill-trained,” a Pentagon official told journalists on Monday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, decreed last week that his army would increase in size by about 10%, to 1.15 million service personnel, starting from January next year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-still-disconnected-from-ukraine-grid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T15:38:34Z","webTitle":"Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant partly reconnected to Ukraine grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-still-disconnected-from-ukraine-grid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-still-disconnected-from-ukraine-grid","fields":{"headline":"Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant partly reconnected to Ukraine grid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Ukraine has said it has managed to partly reconnect the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant to its grid after the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said it had narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” when all lines to it were cut on Thursday. The plant was captured in early May by Russian forces, who are reportedly storing equipment at Europe’s largest nuclear facility, but is still being run by Ukrainian technicians under the gaze of occupying forces. Three of the four power connections the plant relies on to keep its reactors cool were previously cut during fighting, and on Thursday, fires around the plant that Zelenskiy blamed on Russian shelling brought down the fourth, disconnecting it for the first time in its history. Russia blamed Ukrainian shelling and on Friday said it had destroyed the gun responsible. Zelenskiy said the disconnection had put “Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster”. Ukraine’s authorities said backup systems had kicked in to ensure the cooling and safety systems at the plant but as of Friday morning, Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear agency, said efforts were still under way to link it back to the Ukrainian grid before announcing success in the early afternoon with the connection of one of its six reactors. “Zaporizhzhia NPP nuclear power professionals are real heroes! They tirelessly and tightly hold the nuclear and radiation safety of Ukraine and the whole of Europe on their shoulders,” wrote Energoatom on its Telegram channel. The situation however remains fragile as fighting continues around the plant. Ukrainian authorities and international experts have consistently warned of the potential for nuclear catastrophe because of fighting around the facility, which sits close to the frontlines in the south. Disconnecting from the grid raises the risk of a catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. A nuclear incident could have disastrous consequences for the immediate population and clouds of radiation could travel across Europe. A mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency is scheduled to visit the plant next week to monitor the situation and take protective measures, said Lana Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, on Ukraine’s Radio NV. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he had received assurances from Zelenskiy and Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, that the mission would be allowed to reach the plant safely. But Zerkal said she remained sceptical that the mission would reach it. “All the logistical routes are now being worked out,” Zerkal said. “Despite the fact that the Russians agreed that the mission will go through Ukrainian territory, they are artificially creating all the conditions so that the mission does not reach the object given the situation around [the plant].” Civilians across Ukraine’s south who rely on the plant for electricity, including those in the occupied territories, have experienced power outages with the disconnection of the plant. More that 18,000 people in 72 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region were without power as on Friday, the regional administration said. People living in occupied areas already face severe problems accessing medicine, basic goods, information and freedom of movement, and those who disagree politically face repressive measures from the new administration. Thousands living along the contact line have been caught up in shelling. Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over whose shells have damaged the power plant and the surrounding area. The Wall Street Journal reported that Russia was using the plant as a military base and Washington’s Institute for the Study of War said that Russia had failed to present evidence that the shelling was caused by Ukraine, despite the fact they controlled the territory. During the outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, the plant must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If these break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative impasse, with no significant territorial gains or losses in the last two months. This week, Putin signed a decree to increase the size of the Russian army by 137,000 men, and the UK’s Ministry of Defence said on Friday it believed he had fired six generals for advancing too slowly. Also on Friday, Ukraine said it would expand the number of districts on the frontline where civilian evacuations would be mandatory, as those areas could be occupied and face central heating problems this winter. Russia’s takeover of the plant is the latest in a long list of challenges Russia and its occupying authorities are facing in running newly conquered territories. Ukrainians continue to use the western-supplied long-range missiles to target infrastructure within enemy lines. Explosions could be heard in occupied Kherson on Friday afternoon as Ukraine’s southern command said it had successfully disabled the Dariiv Bridge to the north of the city. Russia’s RIA news agency reported that the Russian air defence systems had been activated. It is not clear if the two incidents were connected. Video footage released on Thursday show the occupying authorities are attempting to build a pontoon bridge across the river to replace the Antonovskiy Bridge struck by Ukrainian forces last month, rendering it unusable. Russian authorities will hold referendums in newly occupied parts of southern Ukraine, although it appears they will take different forms and may be conducted on different dates. In the city of Melitopol in the occupied-Zaporizhzhia region, pollsters will go door-to-door instead of voters attending polling stations, according to its mayor-in-exile, Ivan Fedorov, citing sources on the ground. Authorities are trying to operate while apparently being attacked from within. RIA reported that a bomb exploded in the building from where the referendum was being planned and Russian passports were issued. In the occupied southern city of Berdiansk, the deputy head of the traffic police was killed on Friday by an explosion, Russia’s state news agency, Tass, reported. On Wednesday, Ivan Sushko, the head of another occupied city nearby, was killed by a car bomb, occupying authorities reported on Telegram. Their deaths are the latest in a string of assassinations that have targeted members of the occupying authorities. On 23 August, Ihor Telehin, the deputy head of the internal policy department for the occupied Kherson region, was also targeted with a bomb but survived, according to Tass."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T16:00:52Z","webTitle":"‘It is one minute before midnight’: the view from Germany’s industrial heartland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/03/germany-industrial-heartland-energy-crisis-small-and-medium-sized-businesses","fields":{"headline":"‘It is one minute before midnight’: the view from Germany’s industrial heartland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The winding route through the German countryside from Stuttgart to the small town of Mulfingen gives few clues that this south-west region is home to several companies that are global market leaders in their field. But north-east Baden-Württemberg boasts several successful specialist firms which make up the Mittelstand, the base of small and medium-sized engineering businesses that are the backbone of the German economy and are envied around the world. The fan and ventilator manufacturer ebm-papst is still headquartered in Mulfingen – a town with a population of about 3,600 – but its products are found all over the world in cars, household appliances and datacentres. However, the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, combined with labour shortages and post-pandemic disruption to supply chains, is piling pressure on these businesses, which are traditionally family-owned – and without the deep pockets enjoyed by Germany’s corporate giants. With Germany braced for recession this year, how this industrial heartland responds and adapts to the multiple crises will help shape not just the country’s future but wider eurozone, too. Germany is forecast to be the third worst-performing G20 country (-0.3%) this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, behind Russia and the UK. Manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of Germany’s economy, more than double 9% seen in the UK and France, and well ahead of Italy’s 15%. The biggest industrial employer in the region, about 4,000 work for ebm-papst in Mulfingen, the majority producing fans and motors for ventilation, refrigeration and air-conditioning technology. Founded in 1963 by Gerhard Sturm, the company, which calls itself a “hidden champion”, remains family-owned but has been run for the last year by the chief executive, Klaus Geißdörfer. Under his leadership, the company decided to end the production of fans for cars. Instead it has switched staff to focus on new technologies, such as making ventilators for heat pumps and fans to cool datacentres. “We said that we’d better focus on the things where we really are the best in the world,” says Geißdörfer from his office at ebm-papst’s headquarters. “We decided to significantly increase our capacities, which we will ramp up next year, because at the moment we are not able to follow demand.” Despite profiting from booming sales in fans for renewable technologies, the past few years have not been plain sailing for ebm-papst. Covid lockdowns in China and the resulting supply chain disruption occasionally brought its German production lines to a halt, which Geißdörfer says “makes no sense”. As a result, the company has worked to source more parts locally, close to its big factories in Germany, as well as in the US and China. Just down the road in this economic heartland are the headquarters of the almost 80-year-old screw and fastener maker Würth, which sits near Bürkert, a manufacturer of measurement and control systems for liquids and gases. These companies have helped south Germany become an industrial powerhouse, bringing prosperity and a sense of local pride to the area. “The region has lots of world market leaders,” says Donata Lell, who runs a local guesthouse and restaurant. She believes the industrial base boosts her customers’ spending power: “People here earn more money.” Geißdörfer, who hails from neighbouring Bavaria, is convinced the small community of Mulfingen is a good place to run a manufacturing business. “We have smart people here. I like the spirit people have here, they are very enthusiastic,” he says. But does the company have enough of those people for it to meet growing demand? Despite Geißdörfer’s positivity, ebm-papst has difficulties finding staff with the right skills, as well as problems getting hold of components, such as semiconductors. Ebm-papst has tried to solve its worker shortage by offering some remote working to staff in administrative roles, plus free bus travel to work for employees who live within a 40km (25 mile) radius, a perk currently used by about 1,500 people. Amid the company’s cost pressures, and higher prices demanded by its suppliers, staff say they are struggling with the cost of living crisis. Employees on the factory floor have raised their personal financial difficulties directly with Geißdörfer. “I had people coming to me and saying ‘I cannot buy any Christmas presents for my children any more’,” he says. “I talk to people, and they say, ‘I cannot afford vacations any more’.” During the summer the company paid staff an extra €2,500 in cost of living payments, made in five monthly €500 instalments from October onwards. “We stay close together with our people, and we support them in tough times and we go through crises together and try to find a way to handle it,” Geißdörfer says, describing this as a strength of the Mittelstand. “That’s the positive thing with this kind of family business structure we have in Germany. I see also other companies doing similar things.” Yet that might not be enough. The IG Metall metalworkers’ trade union, the country’s largest, already represents workers at ebm-papst’s other manufacturing sites in Germany, but not at its main site in Mulfingen, as a result of a historic work agreement. It is working to get its foot in the door there too, says Uwe Bauer, IG Metall’s representative for the Schwäbisch Hall region. Bauer says the union has recruited several hundred members in Mulfingen in recent months, as workers realise full employment locally has created “an employees’ market”. “Businesses have to rethink what to do about skilled workers,” Bauer says. “We get a lot of requests about which companies are bound by collective wage agreements. Wages play a role, but so do regular working hours,” Bauer says. Ebm-papst’s pay offer nationally is broadly in line with the collective wage agreement deal struck between IG Metall and employers in Baden-Württemberg in late November, although the workers in Mulfingen are not subject to this agreement. The pay deal, which sets the benchmark for wage increases for almost 4m metal and electrical sector workers across Germany, increases workers’ wages by 5.2% from June and 3.3% from May 2024. In addition, they will also receive a €3,000 “inflation bonus”, as the union calls it, which is tax-free and payable in two instalments in March 2023 and 2024. The agreement is generous by historical standards, but still drew some criticism for coming in below inflation, when the annual rate stood at 10% in November, according to official statistics. While pay matters are settled for now, sourcing parts remains a challenge amid a global shortage of semiconductor chips since the start of the pandemic. In the race to obtain these vital components, Mittelstand firms find themselves unable to compete financially with the country’s largest manufacturers, particularly carmakers. “As a company we can grow faster if we can get more semiconductors,” says Geißdörfer. “Somehow, we compete. But the industry is competing with the automotive industry, the solar industry and the renewable energy industry, and we all need the same kind of electronics.” The government should do more to support the country’s vital network of small and medium-sized companies, he says, particularly with soaring energy costs, which Geißdörfer believes are making European companies globally uncompetitive compared with Asian or American rivals. Recent falls in wholesale energy prices have offered only a glimmer of hope. “I really have worries about German smaller and mid-sized companies that heavily depend on energy. They have real problems at the moment to work to face those huge energy costs increases.” While he welcomes government support with energy bills, Geißdörfer and other Mittelstand bosses fear Berlin does not have a clear industrial strategy, particularly while it weans the country off cheap Russian gas. Angela Merkel’s government’s decision to turn off its nuclear power plants after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan has left it exposed to the Kremlin’s weaponisation of gas. “In Germany, we need to reinvent ourselves,” says Geißdörfer, acknowledging the geopolitical challenges, including the energy transition, and Brexit. “We are still strong enough to have sufficient money and we can afford it, but we need to do this fast, to think about how to have a stable economy going forward. But it is one minute before midnight.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T12:51:53Z","webTitle":"Johnson takes swipe at Truss plans for fracking and North Sea drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/01/boris-johnson-takes-jibe-at-liz-truss-plans-for-fracking-and-north-sea-drilling","fields":{"headline":"Johnson takes swipe at Truss plans for fracking and North Sea drilling","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has vowed to give his total support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. But he disparaged fracking, which Truss has pledged to lift a ban on, and hydrocarbons, another energy source his likely successor wants to exploit through further drilling in the North Sea. “If we could frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be possibly a very beneficial thing. I’m just, I have to say, slightly dubious that it will prove to be a panacea,” Johnson said on Thursday. “I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant, and where the environmental damage is really minimal.” Johnson later added: “Tell everybody who thinks hydrocarbons are the only answer and we should get fracking and all that: offshore wind is now the cheapest form of electricity in this country … Of course it’s entirely clean and green.” The comments will be viewed as a jibe at Truss, who last week pledged to “end the effective ban on extracting our huge reserves of shale gas by fracking”, and is said to want to issue up to 130 new drilling licences for oil and gas companies to explore new fields in the North Sea. Reflecting on his future, Johnson said he was “ready to get on with life”, and he refused to be drawn on whether he would disappear quickly from politics, like David Cameron, or remain on the backbenches, as Theresa May has done. “Only time will tell, is my answer on that one,” he replied. “My intention – and what I certainly will do – is give my full and unqualified support to whoever takes over from me.” Johnson also evaded questions on whether he had any regrets about his premiership, saying he would leave it to “younger, fitter, more active journalists than me” to assess. Pressed on what message he had for people worried about paying their energy bills this winter amid rising inflation and the threat of a recession, he said people should be braced for a “very tough winter and we just have to accept that”. “We’re on your side,” he insisted, adding there would be a further package of support from the next prime minister, who will be announced next Monday and will take office the following day. The “future will be better when we’re more self-reliant” and less dependent on energy imports, Johnson predicted. After being accused by Rishi Sunak of ignoring the harms of lockdown during the Covid pandemic, Johnson said the criticism that it had caused the huge backlog of NHS surgery was an “inversion of logic”. Instead, he said, the opposite was the case; if the three national lockdowns had not been ordered, the NHS would be in an “even worse” position. Johnson will travel to meet the Queen in Balmoral to formally resign next Tuesday, with his successor formally appointed shortly after. The new prime minister will return to London to appoint a cabinet, and will then face questions in the Commons on Wednesday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T12:08:17Z","webTitle":"‘Crazy things are happening’: life in occupied Ukrainian nuclear city ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/19/life-in-occupied-ukrainian-nuclear-city-enerhodar-zaporizhzhia-power-station","fields":{"headline":"‘Crazy things are happening’: life in occupied Ukrainian nuclear city ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"I dedicated my life to nuclear power and have always been proud to be part of it. For many people like me, the Zaporizhzhia plant is our pride and destiny. There are six powerful units, about half of the capacity of all Ukrainian nuclear plants and a quarter of the country’s entire energy sector. Before the war, 11,000 people worked here. More than 50,000 people live in Enerhodar. We have been living under occupation for almost six months. It’s like a double occupation – the city and the nuclear plant have been captured. Our faith is constantly being tested. Ten days ago, we were sure that the city and the inhabitants would not suffer. But there are already wounded from the shelling at the station. There are already victims in the city. The station and the city are almost a single whole, because these are places where people work and live. The station continues its struggle for existence. It is full of Russian military vehicles and soldiers. Only two power units are in operation, not at full capacity. Salaries are being paid. Many employees work remotely. In the nuclear industry, we investigate any deviation in the operation of equipment or a mistake of personnel. Corrective actions have to be taken after that. Now such crazy things are happening at the station, such as the delivery of military equipment to the turbine halls of power units, damage to equipment as a result of shelling the station’s territory, and even, according to some information, the mining of the building. There were reports of people being kidnapped, including station workers. It’s hard to describe the feeling when you read about the kidnapping of a person you know personally. The situation changed dramatically 10 days ago, when the Russians began firing at the station and the outskirts of the city. They hit a high-voltage line, buildings on the station territory, and the spent nuclear fuel storage. The city was left without electricity for several hours. Since then, every day and every night we hear the roar of artillery salvos. Sometimes the Russians drive their artillery so close that it sounds like shooting in a neighbouring yard. Window glasses tremble. It feels like the whole house is shaking. Even those who do not believe in God pray for their salvation. Sometimes it happens in the middle of night. An ordinary person cannot distinguish the sounds of an artillery salvo and a shell burst. Therefore, every time it seems that this is an explosion and the next projectile will hit your house. We know that they are hitting the opposite bank of the Dnieper – the cities of Nikopol and Marganets. A few seconds after the first salvo, an alert is activated in Telegram channels – get to a shelter! Someone is trying to save people day and night. In the morning we read how many houses were destroyed and how many people were killed and injured. For many years these cities perceived our nuclear plant as a source of mortal danger. Now real death is flying from us to them. We can only commiserate with them. Enerhodar is a young city. We love and are proud of it. Now it seems to be seriously ill. Kindergartens and schools were closed immediately after the invasion. Although boys play basketball every day on the playground in front of the school, children’s voices on the street are heard less and less. This is a city of disappearing children. The occupying authorities, which I, fortunately, do not encounter, force people to write prices in hryvnias and rubles. I do not understand where the rubles come from here, except for those that were distributed to some pensioners. Maybe it’s an important part of their reports to Moscow. There is cold and hot water and electricity in the city. In this regard, we have always been under protection of the nuclear plant. Instead of three mobile operators, a Russian “no name” one appeared, using local equipment. Several internet providers have been restored but the traffic passes through Russia, with all Russian internet bans and limitations. Doctors at the hospital are receiving salaries but, as far as I know, there are huge problems with medicines. It is better not to get sick at this time. Here we also have the Zaporizhzhia thermal power plant, the largest in Ukraine. It was shut down due to damage to the railway bridge and the impossibility of delivering coal. All billboards in the city are used for Russian propaganda – covered in quotes from Putin and phrases about one people – Russian and Ukrainian. Before that, portraits of Soviet generals from the second world war and heroes of the Soviet Union hung there. People pass by indifferently. Russian flags hang over the city hall and elsewhere, although faded ones. People are leaving the city. I often notice that someone from my apartment block has not been seen for a long time. In any case, everyone is trying to send children and wives to the unoccupied territory or abroad. Two days ago, my neighbour could not stand it and evacuated his children. You can struggle against your own fear but it is impossible to fight fear in the eyes of your children. It is possible to exit the city, but just a week ago, at the checkpoint in Vasilievka, where the line of demarcation runs, there was a queue of thousands of cars from various occupied regions and people stood there for several days. Men stay. Most of them perceive work at the nuclear plant as their duty. Nuclear power workers in Ukraine are legally exempt from conscription, so it’s like their military service. But all the same, staff members are leaving, including operational ones. Despite everything, we continue to believe that all this will end soon. As long as we believe, the station continues to work, and the city continues to live."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-06T17:03:55Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war ‘about to enter new phase’ as Russian forces gather in the south, UK intelligence warns – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/06/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-latest-updates-putin-zelenskiy","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war ‘about to enter new phase’ as Russian forces gather in the south, UK intelligence warns – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expressed concerns about the shelling the previous day at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, saying the action showed the risk of a nuclear disaster, Reuters reports. “I’m extremely concerned by the shelling yesterday at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, which underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster that could threaten public health and the environment in Ukraine and beyond,” director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement. He added that military action jeopardising the safety and security of the Zaporizhzhia plant “is completely unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs”. “Any military firepower directed at or from the facility would amount to playing with fire, with potentially catastrophic consequences.” Ukraine’s Prosecutor General’s office said it had started criminal proceedings against what it said was rocket and artillery shelling by the Russian military of Zaporizhzhia power plant on Friday. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s State Security Service (SBU) detained two men it accused of being Russian intelligence agents responsible for identifying targets for Russian missile strikes that wrecked shipbulding infrastructure in the southern port city of Mykolaiv, the agency said. The two men “collected and transmitted intelligence to the enemy about important infrastructure facilities, fuel depots, the deployment and movement of personnel and equipment of (Ukraine’s) Armed Forces,” the SBU said in a post on messaging app Telegram. As a result, the SBU said several shipbuilding enterprises and fuel depots were damaged or destroyed. The agency said both men were now being held in custody. It did not say when the infrastructure was hit. The head of Amnesty International’s Ukraine office has quit the human rights body in a disagreement after the group accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by basing troops in residential areas during the Russian invasion. Amnesty made the comments in a report published on Thursday that drew fierce criticism from the Ukrainian government, Reuters reports. Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said on Facebook late on Friday that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, and now understood that she could not get it changed or removed. Pokalchuk said the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion. In an effort to protect civilians, this study became a tool of Russian propaganda”. “It pains me to admit it, but we disagreed with the leadership of Amnesty International on values. That’s why I decided to leave the organization.” Asked about Pokalchuk’s resignation, an Amnesty spokesperson quoted Agnes Callamard, the organisation’s secretary general, as saying: *Oksana has been a valued member of Amnesty staff, and has led the Amnesty International Ukraine office for seven years with many significant human rights successes.” “We are sorry to hear that she is leaving the organization, but we respect her decision and wish her well. Ukrainian officials say they take every possible measure to evacuate civilians from front-line areas. Russia denies targeting civilians in what it describes as a “special military operation” in Ukraine. North Macedonia has agreed to supply tanks and planes to Ukraine, Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said. It was previously reported that North Macedonia would supply Soviet-era tanks but there was no mention of aircraft deliveries. Podolyak said: “Many nations are showing more courage today than half of the G20. “Like North Macedonia, giving Ukraine a (supportive) shoulder in the form of tanks and planes.” It’s 4pm in London and 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The EU has condemned Russia’s actions regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The plant has been described as being “a serious risk” by Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, Energoatom. Inside Olenivka, the notorious detention centre outside Donetsk, dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur who spent time in the jail, has told the Observer. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine. Meta, formerly Facebook, have removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St. Petersburg, Russia. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed and the report found that around $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. Pro-Russian forces in the Russian-occupied cities of the Luhansk region of Ukraine are using humanitarian aid to lure residents to provide personal data to partake in a referendum on joining Russia. The EU has condemned Russia’s actions regarding the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Josep Borrell Fontelles, the high respresentative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy and vice-president of the EU Commission, tweeted: “This is a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules and another example of Russia’s disregard for international norms”, and called for Russian forces occupying the plant to give open access to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The plant has been described as being ““a serious risk” by Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, Energoatom. Inside Olenivka, the notorious detention centre outside Donetsk, dozens of Ukrainian soldiers have been burned to death while many others face torture under a regime of “absolute evil”, Anna Vorosheva, a 45-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur who spent time in the jail, has told the Observer. Vorosheva said she had no doubt Russia “cynically and deliberately” murdered Ukrainian prisoners of war after fighters were blown up on 29 July in a mysterious and devastating explosion. Moscow claims Ukraine killed them with a US-made precision-guided Himars rocket, but satellite images and independent analysis suggest they were obliterated by a powerful bomb detonated from inside the building. “Russia didn’t want them to stay alive. I’m sure some of those ‘killed’ in the explosion were already corpses. It was a convenient way of accounting for the fact they had been tortured to death,” Vorosheva said. The Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, Serhiy Haidai, has posted a photo on his Telegram channel which appears to show the head of a Ukrainian prisoner of war stuck on a pole outside a house in the eastern Ukrainian city of Popasna, which was captured by Russian forces in May and is close to the current frontline in the Donbas. The Guardian has not confirmed the authenticity of the photo. Geolocation tools suggest it is genuine and was taken in late July, not far from the centre of Popasna. The photo is the latest in a string of apparent atrocities committed by Russian forces since the invasion started in February. Pro-Russian forces in the Russian-occupied cities of the Luhansk region of Ukraine are using humanitarian aid to lure residents to provide personal data to partake in a referendum on joining Russia, Sergei Gaidai, the head of Luhansk military administration has reported on his Telegram channel. The post suggests that campaigning and data collecting is being carried out at events which are being offered to provide support and humanitarian aid to residents of the occupied areas. “Under the guise of providing food or construction materials, the occupying power and the collaborating public movement organise meetings with the population of the recently captured territories of the region,” Gaidai said in the post. According to Gaidai the Russian forces “lure out personal data, urge people to go to the so-called referendum” while “forcing people to exchange their will for food or drinking water”. The Guardian has not been able to independently verify this information. Here are some of the latest images from photographers on the ground in Ukraine: Concerns are growing for the safety of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after an attack by Russian anti-aircraft missiles on 5 August. At the plant, which was severely damaged according to a report on the Telegram account of Energoatom, the Ukrainian state nuclear operator, emergency protection measures have been activated and one of the three working power units was turned off. The post reported the plant remains in the control of the Russian military but added that “Ukrainian staff of the station continue to work and make every effort to ensure nuclear and radiation safety”. The plant, which is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world, generates energy for Ukraine and has been controlled by the Russian military since 4 March when Russian troops captured Energodar, the city where the plant is located. Hello, it’s 11.15am in London and 1.15pm in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine. Meta, formerly Facebook, have removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St. Petersburg, Russia. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed and the report found that around $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday. Last week, EU member states agreed to reduce their use of gas by 15% over the winter, with exceptions for some countries and despite opposition from Hungary. A leading Russian hypersonics expert has been arrested on suspicion of treason, the state-controlled Tass news agency reported on Friday. Andrei Shiplyuk heads the hypersonics laboratory at the Novosibirsk Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, according to the institute’s website, and has in recent years coordinated research to support the development of hypersonic missile systems, Reuters reports. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. Meta, formerly Facebook, has removed a network of Instagram accounts operated by a troll farm in St Petersburg, Russia, according to its newest report into global threats, the Kyiv Independent reports. The accounts, which aimed to create a perception of online support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, posted pro-Russian comments on content shared by social media influencers and media. The physical troll farm was operating out of an office building in St Petersburg, which had 10 days previously prior advertised job postings for “spammers, commenters, content analysts, designers and programmers” focused on the social media platforms, YouTube, Telegram and TikTok. The accounts were targeting politicians, journalists, actors, celebrities and commercial brands from around the world that were vocal in their support for Ukraine. 45 Facebook accounts and 1,037 Instagram accounts were removed and the report found that around $1,400 had been spent in rubles to pay for ads on Facebook and Instagram. Overnight Russian shelling in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast injured three people and destroyed residential buildings, including a kindergarten and a children’s art centre, according to reports from the Kyiv Independent. The attacks left several thousand people without power or water, as gas and water pipelines and the electricity network were compromised. Oksana Pokalchuk, the head of Amnesty International’s office in Ukraine, has resigned from her role following a report published by the human rights organisation which accused the Ukrainian military of breaching international humanitarian law. The report, which has been criticised by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as well as western diplomats, including the British and US ambassadors to Ukraine, accused the Ukrainian military of putting civilians at risk by positioning themselves in residential areas such as empty schools or civilian buildings, meaning Russia will target urban areas risking civilian lives in the crossfire. Announcing her resignation via Facebook, Pokalchuk said she held meetings with Amnesty International to discuss what they were going to publish but said that her input was “deleted” and replaced with what the organisation published in its report on Thursday. “If you don’t live in a country invaded by invaders and are tearing it to pieces, you probably don’t understand what it’s like to condemn an army of defenders. And there are no words in any language that can convey this to someone who has not felt this pain,” Pokalchuk said. The report has since been used by Kremlin-directed Russian media as a way to evidence their false claims that Russian forces are only going after military targets in Ukraine. Despite ongoing criticism, Amnesty International said that while it condemned Russia’s invasion, the report’s findings were based on evidence gathered during extensive investigations and that it would report Ukrainian violations when it observed them. Here are some of the latest images from photographers on the ground in Ukraine: We’ve got more from the UK’s MoD. On what Ukraine’s troops are focusing on, it adds: Ukrainian forces are focusing their targeting on bridges, ammunition depots, and rail links with growing frequency in Ukraine’s southern regions. Including the strategically important railroad spur that links Kherson to Russian-occupied Crimea, almost certainly using a combination of block, damage, degrade, deny, destroy, and disrupt effects to try to affect Russia’s ability to logistically resupply. The MoD then adds it believes the war is about to enter a “new phase”. Russia’s war on Ukraine is about to enter a new phase, with the heaviest fighting shifting to a roughly 350km frontline stretching south-west from near Zaporizhzhia to Kherson, paralleling the Dnieper River. As we just mentioned, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has revealed there is a significant build-up of Russian forces in southern Ukraine. However, the MoD said it was unclear whether these additional forces were for a new assault on Ukrainian territory or in anticipation for a Ukrainian counteroffensive. It reported: Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, towed artillery, and other weapons continue to move away from Ukraine’s Donbas region and are headed south-west. Equipment was also reported to be moving from Russian-occupied Melitopol, Berdiansk, Mariupol and from mainland Russia via the Kerch Bridge into Crimea. Battalion tactical groups (BTG), which comprise between 800 and 1,000 troops, have been deployed to Crimea and would almost certainly be used to support Russian troops in the Kherson region. On 02 August 2022, a new BTG had been deployed to Crimea and BTGs are also being re-deployed from Eastern Grouping of Forces. These will highly likely be sent into the Kherson region in the coming days. Good morning, it’s approaching 7.30am in London and 9.30am in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is amassing troops in the south of Ukraine but the purpose of the build-up is not yet clear, UK intelligence has warned. The Ministry of Defence says Russian forces could be preparing for a new assault or merely anticipating a counter-offensive from Ukraine Ukraine has accused Russian forces of strikes near a nuclear reactor at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant in the country’s south-east. Energoatom, the state-run operator of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants, said in a statement: “Three strikes were recorded on the site of the plant, near one of the power blocks where the nuclear reactor is located.” Russia’s defence ministry accused Ukrainian forces of shelling the plant, saying a leak of radiation had been avoided only by luck. A European Union plan to cut gas use and help Germany wean itself off dependency on Russia will come into effect early next week, the bloc’s presidency said on Friday.

Vladimir Putin has met Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for talks that were expected to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and that are being rumoured to include Kremlin efforts to circumvent western sanctions. The Russian president welcomed Erdoğan to Sochi, a resort city on the Black Sea, by thanking the Turkish president for help in securing an international deal that resumed grain exports from Ukraine that had been disrupted by the Kremlin war machine – as well as Russian foodstuffs and fertilisers – to world markets. They agreed to boost cooperation in the transport, agriculture, finance and construction industries, they said in a joint statement after a four-hour meeting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-21T14:38:35Z","webTitle":"Sizewell C nuclear plant funding approved despite Tory split","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/21/sizewell-c-nuclear-plant-funding-approved-despite-tory-split","fields":{"headline":"Sizewell C nuclear plant funding approved despite Tory split","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson has approved funding for a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk in the final weeks of his premiership, but some of Liz Truss’s senior allies are split over the decision. The prime minister and the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, approved financing for the construction of two new reactors known as Sizewell C, enabling private funding of about £20-30bn to be raised. However, Simon Clarke, another key Truss ally and a Treasury minister, warned in a letter leaked to the Sunday Times that the decision could limit Truss’s economic vision. In the letter, he said the costs of Sizewell C were “sufficient to materially affect spending and fiscal choices for an incoming government, especially in the context of wider pressures on the public finances”. In an article for the Mail on Sunday, Kwasi Kwarteng stressed the need to “crack on with more nuclear power stations” in order to increase Britain’s energy security. He gave development consent for Sizewell C in July, but negotiations over the government’s investment decision had been ongoing. A Whitehall source said Boris Johnson had taken the decision to press ahead with Sizewell several weeks ago. However, he dismissed the idea that the move would tie the hands of the next prime minister, following reports that the Truss campaign was worried that it was irreversible. “In the next few weeks, we will announce a government investment decision on Sizewell C where the government formally commits to the project’s financing. It allows the project to raise private capital in the markets. But it’s only at the point of the final investment decision in early 2023 that the government would formalise any equity share.” Johnson’s decision over Sizewell was challenged by a campaign to stop the nuclear reactor being built. A spokesperson for the campaign, Stop Sizewell C, said: “Whatever way you look at it, this is a very dodgy decision. Has it been made by a lame duck PM who is not supposed to tie the hands of his successor, or was it in fact made before Sizewell C was granted planning consent, lending serious weight to our conviction that this was a prejudiced, political decision? “Our next prime minister should call Sizewell C in. There are so many better ways to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money than on a project that won’t light a single lightbulb for at least a decade.” Truss has not stated a clear position on Sizewell C, but hinted last year at concerns about the involvement of China’s state-owned energy company, CGN, as part of a consortium providing funding for the preparatory work at the nuclear plant. She told the Telegraph at the time: “I think it’s very important that we don’t become strategically dependent and I think it’s important that we make sure that we’re working, particularly in areas of critical national infrastructure, with reliable partners.” EDF, the French state energy firm, worked with CGN on the first phase of the project for a new nuclear power station to sit alongside Sizewell B, which is operational, and Sizewell A, which is being decommissioned. The UK government is keen to ease CGN out, however, over concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets. Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support the development of Sizewell C."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/03/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week?

Catch up with the must-read news and analysis","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. ‘No quick wins’: Ukraine launches Kherson counteroffensive As the war enters its seventh month, attention has shifted to the southern front, and hopes for a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Kyiv says the attempt to retake ground is already under way but Russia has dismissed its prospects of success. Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern command, announced on Monday that an offensive in Kherson – the only regional capital Russia has been able to secure since the war began – had begun. Oleksiy Arestovych, a senior adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukrainian troops had begun attacking Russian defences along the frontline and claimed they had broken through in several places. However two Ukrainian fighters on the frontlines in Kherson, who have oversight of events, described to Isobel Koshiw a situation that differed from the Ukrainian officials’ statements. According to them, fighting is taking place in Kherson region, but it is not the major counteroffensive being touted by Kyiv. Kherson has huge symbolic and practical significance and if Ukraine can entirely cut off enemy forces on the western bank of the Dnieper, they will have a realistic prospect of success, Archie Bland explains. Kyiv also needs to show that it can do more than resist the Russian advance; it can seize the initiative – thus shoring up the morale of its own population ahead of a grim winter and at the same time maintaining the support of western leaders. UN team leads mission to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine on Thursday amid calls from Zelenskiy and the international community to demilitarise and safeguard the site from potential radiation disaster. “We are going to a war zone,” IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, said ahead of the visit he described as a “technical mission” to prevent a nuclear accident at Europe’s largest atomic plant, Isobel Koshiw reported from Kyiv. In the days leading up to the visit, Ukraine accused Russia of deliberately shelling corridors along the pre-agreed route to deny the IAEA inspectors safe passage to the plant. Just hours before the team was due to cross from Ukrainian into Russian-held territory, the nearby city of Enerhodar came under fire, Jon Henley reported. A defiant Grossi told reporters: “We are not going anywhere. The IAEA is now there, it is at the plant and it is not moving – it’s going to stay there.” The nuclear chief confirmed after returning to Ukrainian-held territory that a group of IAEA experts had stayed behind at the plant and would provide an impartial, neutral and technically sound assessment of the situation. “It is obvious that the plant and physical integrity of the plant has been violated several times,” he added. “I worried, I worry and I will continue to be worried about the plant until we have a situation which is more stable, which is more predictable.” Children return to Ukrainian school trashed by occupying Russian forces Children and teachers gathered on the grass outside School No 2 in Borodianka on Thursday morning for the first day of the academic year, Isobel Koshiw writes from the town once occupied by Russian forces just north of Kyiv. There were speeches and a recital of the Ukrainian national anthem, and as is traditional the girls wore white scrunchies in their hair, the boys white shirts. They brought flowers to give to their teachers. But there will be no lessons in the classrooms of School No 2 this year. The invading soldiers used the school as a base and then trashed it as they left. Where enough students opted for in-person teaching and the schools are fit for use, school administrations have been preparing for the new academic year by outfitting basements as shelters and training teachers on what to do in case of an attack. All children who attend in person are told to carry an emergency bag with a change of clothes, any medicine they may need, a note from their parents and, for the younger children, a favourite toy. Putin: trapped and desperate Russia’s president is trapped and desperate. Will his friends in the west rescue him, Simon Tisdall asks. Putin keeps understandably schtum about his “special military operation”. But indefinite stalemate is not what he expected and an endless military quagmire is not a scenario he can afford. Slow-burn western sanctions corrode his economy and his military’s manpower and materiel are steadily depleted. So what are his options? As pressure on him grows to produce a breakthrough, Putin may well decide his best option is to raise the cost of the war to Ukraine’s backers in the context of rising anxiety over Europe’s energy and cost of living crises, largely caused by the invasion and Kremlin cuts to gas supplies. Mikhail Gorbachev, Soviet leader who ended cold war, dies aged 91 Meanwhile in Russia, Andrew Roth and Luke Harding reported the death of Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader whose reforms led to the unlooked for break-up of his own country, and to the demise of communism across central and eastern Europe. Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, died in Moscow aged 91 after a “difficult and protracted illness”, Russian news agencies cited hospital officials as saying on Tuesday. He will be associated with his attempts to modernise and to improve the Soviet Union, a process that he ultimately lost control of, leading to the country’s collapse. In his last years, Gorbachev was a paradoxical figure. Abroad, he was viewed as the hero of the cold war, whose actions – or lack of them – ushered in a freer world. In Russia he was largely reviled and unloved, an unperson at best, a traitor at worst, Pjotr Sauer explains. The Kremlin appeared unsure how to mark Gorbachev’s death this week, issuing a statement saying Putin would not attend the funeral or the public farewell ceremony, in what will be seen as an extraordinary snub by the Russian president. However Putin did visit the open coffin of the former Soviet leader on Thursday morning, leaving flowers at the mourning hall of Moscow’s central clinical hospital.

The failure to agree to a joint statement after four weeks of debate and negotiation among 151 countries at the UN in New York is the latest blow to hopes of maintaining an arms control regime and keeping a lid on a rekindled arms race. The closing session was put off for more than four hours over Russian refusal to agree to a lengthy statement of support for the NPT which included a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is occupied by Russian forces close to the frontline in Ukraine’s south-east. Alarm was raised on Thursday when the plant was temporarily cut off from the Ukrainian electricity grid but the connection was restored. Russian forces are reportedly planning to sever the plant more permanently from the grid, raising concerns of a possible disaster. A paragraph in the final draft text on Friday stressed “the paramount importance of ensuring control by Ukraine’s competent authorities of nuclear facilities … such as the Zaporizhzia nuclear power plant”. The Russian delegation was the only one to speak against the agreed text, but blamed the breakdown of the conference on Ukraine and its “protectors”, calling the negotiations a “one-sided game”. After delivering its statement, the Russian delegation walked out of the UN chamber. The NPT was a deal struck in 1968 in which nuclear weapons states pledged to disarm while states without nuclear weapons promised not to acquire them. At the time there were five acknowledged nuclear powers, though Israel had secretly developed a weapon of its own by then. There are now nine states which possess nuclear warheads. Before the NPT came into force, some had predicted there would be dozens countries with their own arsenals. It is the second five-yearly review conference that has failed to issue a joint statement recommitting to the goals of the treaty. It has been 12 years since there was even partial agreement. But Sarah Bidgood, the director of the Eurasia nonproliferation program at the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, said the NPT was not irreparably broken, and that every other country would have accepted the text. “The bigger takeaway for me is just how far-reaching the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine has become,” she said. “Even at some of the darkest moments of the cold war, cooperation in support of the NPT was often possible. But what we saw at the final plenary today does not bode well for the future of nuclear diplomacy, including on issues like arms control.” Beatrice Fihn, the executive director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said the disarmament elements in the proposed text had already been diluted by all five of the official nuclear powers recognised by the treaty – Russia, the US, France, the UK and China. “So, in all honesty, I don’t think it makes much difference,” she said. “This is the very dangerous game the nuclear weapon states are playing by consistently failing to achieve anything in this treaty. At some point, non nuclear weapon states are really going to start questioning whether or not this treaty is worth the effort, and if it’s relevant.” Fihn argued that the continued failure of NPT review conferences to find common ground meant it was all the more important for countries to join the treaty for the prohibition of nuclear weapons (TPNW), which seeks to ban them outright. It came into force in January 2021, and so far 66 states have ratified or acceded to the treaty. “It’s going to be really relevant that we quickly move forward with the TPNW and get more states,” Fihn said. “It’s really an insurance that if [the NPT] continues to fail, that we don’t stand without anything.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T18:26:41Z","webTitle":"Shelling temporarily disconnects Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine grid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-disconnected-ukraine-grid-russia","fields":{"headline":"Shelling temporarily disconnects Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant from Ukraine grid","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s national grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation, the country’s nuclear power firm, Energoatom, has said. There have been growing international concerns about safety at Europe’s largest nuclear plant. It has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war, and they are now using it to house military vehicles and equipment. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after the US president, Joe Biden, spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Biden congratulated him on the country’s 31st Independence Day, celebrated on Wednesday, which was also the six-month mark since Russia invaded. “I know it is a bittersweet anniversary, but I made it clear that the United States would continue to support Ukraine and its people as they fight to defend their sovereignty,” Biden tweeted after the phone call. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. Until then, continued fighting puts the plant, and potentially much of Europe, at risk. A nuclear accident could spread radiation far across the continent. The plant was disconnected twice from the Ukrainian grid on Thursday after a blaze at the ash pits of a nearby coal-fired power plant affected the fourth and last connection into the plant’s reactors. Three other lines had already been taken out during the war. “The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid – for the first time in the history of the plant,” Energoatom said on Thursday. The severing of that connection briefly caused a blackout in the Zaporizhzhia region, said Yevgeny Balitsky, the Russian-appointed governor for the area. Power has now been restored. Disconnecting the plant from the grid is dangerous because it raises the risk of catastrophic failure of the electricity-run cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods. During the outage, the plant still received supplies of electricity from one remaining backup line connected to the nearby conventional power plant, Energoatom said. There were three of these lines before the war, but two have been cut. If all external connections go down, it must rely on diesel-fuelled generators for power. If they break down, engineers only have 90 minutes to stave off dangerous overheating. Zelenskiy claimed late on Thursday that the world narrowly avoided a radiation accident. “If the diesel generators had not turned on … if our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,” he said in an evening address. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” He called on the IAEA and other world bodies to act much faster to force Russian troops to leave the territory of the station. The head of Energoatom’s told the Guardian on Wednesday that Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from the national grid and connect it to the Russian power network instead. Petro Kotin said the plan was ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine were cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday. But Ukraine fears Russia may deliberately cut the lines. The latest crisis at the plant, which has previously been threatened by fires, came as the death toll from a Russian rocket attack on a railway station and village in south-central Dnipropetrovsk region rose to 25. The three rocket strikes also injured 31, according to Ukraine’s authorities. The area was hit on Independence Day – an anniversary overshadowed by US warnings that Russia may be planning to “step up” attacks. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had successfully hit a military train, killing 200 Ukrainian soldiers. It said the train was set to deliver arms to the frontline in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. It is impossible to corroborate the claims. Ukraine’s authorities do not regularly share information about their military losses. At least some of the victims appear to have been civilians. Pictures and footage of the aftermath aired by Ukraine’s public broadcaster Suspilne showed at least one destroyed house in the village and extensive damage elsewhere. Those interviewed by Suspilne said fellow villagers had died. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s presidential office, said two children, aged six and 11, were killed, the latter when their house was destroyed. Zelenskiy said five people were killed while sitting in a car. Tetyana Kvitnytska, the deputy director of health at the Dnipropetrovsk regional military administration, said four children were among the injured, three of whom were in a serious condition. She said there were shrapnel wounds, burns and fractures. Only two pictures have been released so far of the railway carriages that were hit, which appear burnt out and flattened in places. Tymoshenko said five passenger carriages caught fire and a utility building at the railway station had been hit. The EU’s foreign affairs representative, Josep Borrell, wrote on Twitter: “The EU strongly condemns another terrible Russian attack on the civilian population in Chaplyny on Ukraine’s independence day. Those responsible for Russian missile terror will be held accountable.” Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative stalemate in recent months, partly after the west supplied new long-range missiles that have hampered Russia’s supply lines and ability to continue with its offensives. Ukraine says it also does not have the weapons it needs to launch a decisive counteroffensive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T17:59:23Z","webTitle":"World Bank announces additional $4.5bn in Ukraine aid – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/aug/08/russia-ukraine-war-un-secretary-general-calls-for-inspectors-to-be-allowed-access-to-nuclear-plant-as-russia-readies-for-southern-offensive-live","fields":{"headline":"World Bank announces additional $4.5bn in Ukraine aid – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s top stories: The United States will provide an additional $4.5 billion (£3.7 bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5 billion (£7 bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to the Ukraine government in tranches, beginning with a $3 billion (£2.5 bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy Bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multi-story apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Ukraine has received its first three Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems from Germany and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s occupied Zaporizhzhia region signed on Monday a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, and indeed the Ukraine live blog for today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Thanks for following along. The Pentagon has unveiled the latest billion dollar slice of US military aid to Ukraine. The main items are more ammunition for the 16 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) the US has sent, as well as new missiles for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), a thousand Javelin anti-tank missiles, and hundreds of Swedish made AT4 shoulder launched anti-tank systems. Colin Kahl, the Pentagon policy chief, noted it was the 18th drawdown on US military stocks sent to Ukraine, making a total of $9.8bn in security assistance so far under the Biden administration. “This is the largest single drawdown of US arms and equipment utilizing this authority to date,” Kahl said. “The package provides a significant amount of additional ammunition, weapons and equipment, the types of which the Ukrainian people are using so effectively to defend their country.” Kahl said the rockets (Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems or GMLRS) the US has been sending to Ukraine to fire from the Himars mobile launch vehicles, are “having a very profound effect”. “This is a 200 pound warhead. It’s kind of the equivalent of an airstrike, frankly, a precision guided airstrike,” he said. “These are GPS-guided munitions. They’ve been very effective in hitting things that previously the Ukrainians had difficulty hitting reliably - so command-and-control nodes, sustainment and logistics hubs, key radar systems and other things. And what it’s done is it’s made it more difficult for the Russians to move forces around the battlefield. “They’ve had to move certain assets back away from the Himars. It slowed them down. It’s made it harder for them to resupply other forces. So I think it’s having real operational effects.” He estimated Russian casualties as 70,000 to 80,000 dead and wounded. The US will provide an additional $4.5bn (£3.7bn) to Ukraine’s government, bringing its total budgetary support since Russia’s February invasion to $8.5bn (£7bn), the US Agency for International Development has announced. The funding, coordinated with the US Treasury Department through the World Bank, will go to the Ukraine government in tranches, beginning with a $3bn (£2.5 bn) disbursement in August, USAid, the Agency for International Development, said. Reuters reported: It follows previous transfers of $1.7bn in July and $1.3bn in June, USAid said. Washington has also provided billions of dollars in military support, and plans a new $1bn weapons package shortly. The U.S. funds are to help the Ukrainian government maintain essential functions, including social and financial assistance for the growing poor population, children with disabilities, and millions of internally displaced persons, as the war drags on. Ukrainian officials estimate the country faces a $5bn-a-month fiscal shortfall - or 2.5% of pre-war gross domestic product - due to the cost of the war and declining tax revenues. Economists say that will swell Ukraine’s annual deficit to 25% of GDP, compared with 3.5% before the conflict. The World Bank estimates that 55% of Ukrainians will be living in poverty by the end of 2023 as a result of the war and the large numbers of displaced persons, compared with 2.5% before the start of the war. Ukraine has arrested two people working for Russian intelligence services who planned to kill the Ukrainian defence minister and the head of the country’s military intelligence agency, Ukraine’s domestic security service said on Monday. The Security Service of Ukraine foiled the plot by the Russian GRU military intelligence agency to use a sabotage group to carry out three murders including that of a prominent Ukrainian activist, the agency said. The assertions could not be independently verified by Reuters and there was no immediate reaction to the Ukraine statement from Moscow or Russian state-run media. The suspects, one a resident of the eastern Luhansk region held by Russia-backed separatists and the other a resident of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, were promised up to $150,000 (£124,000) by Russian handlers for the murder of each of their targets, the SBU said. The man from Luhansk region entered Ukraine from Belarus and was detained in the city of Kovel in north-west Ukraine along with the Kyiv resident, the statement said. The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. Yevgeny Balitskyi, the head of the pro-Russia administration in the region, announced the decision to kickstart the process during a pro-Moscow forum entitled “We are with Russia” organised in Melitopol, the largest city controlled by Russia in Zaporizhzhia. “I am signing the order for the central election committee to start the preparations for holding a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation,” he said. Roughly two-thirds of Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation, part of a swathe of southern Ukraine that Moscow captured early in the war, including most of the neighbouring Kherson region, where Russian officials have also discussed plans for a referendum. Workers at the nuclear complex are “working under the barrels of Russian guns”, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN nuclear watchdog said on Monday, calling for an international mission to the plant this month. Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk said Russian forces want to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the Zaporizhzhia complex, adding that damage to the facility from Russian attacks means any radiation could not be detected. Tsymbaliuk spoke in Vienna as international alarm over artillery attacks on the Zaporizhzhia plant grew, with Kyiv warning of the risk of a Chernobyl-style catastrophe and appealing for the area to be made a demilitarised zone, Reuters reported. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has accused Ukraine of taking “Europe hostage” over the situation at Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. The plant is occupied by Russian forces, and each side has claimed the other has caused damage to the complex by shelling it. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been seeking to inspect it. Zakharova said: “The leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, over and over again, do not dare to directly name the source of the threat. They are demonstrating their unwillingness to point the finger at Kyiv.” Reuters reported that she went on to say: “They are taking the whole of Europe hostage and are not against setting fire to it for the sake of their Nazi idols.” Ukraine’s atomic energy agency Energoatom is quoting Dmytro Lubinets, the country’s human rights ombudsman, on its official Telegram channel. It says: The Russian Federation continues acts of nuclear terrorism in relation to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (NPP) facilities and its personnel. According to the information of the Main Directorate of Intelligence, the territory of the Zaporizhzhia NPP is currently mined, and individual employees of the station are subject to torture and enforced disappearance, and they receive threats. This poses a threat to the lives of employees and prevents the normal operation of the facility. As the commissioner for human rights of the parliament of Ukraine, I first of all declare the flagrant threat posed by the presence of the Russian military in Zaporizhzhia NPP not only for tens of millions of Ukrainians, but also for the whole world. The destructive consequences of nuclear terrorism and the spread of radioactivity do not ‘respect’ state borders, and radioactive emissions spread uncontrollably, the consequences of radioactive pollution remain for decades. Once again, I call on the secretary general of the UN, the IAEA and the entire world community to take all possible measures to send a security mission to the Zaporizhzhia NPP, to completely demilitarise the territory of the NPP, and to provide security guarantees to the employees of the nuclear plant and residents of the city. Reuters is carrying an opposing line from the Russian side. It quotes Russia’s foreign ministry as saying western nations are unwilling to point the finger of blame for the alleged shelling of the plant at Ukrainian forces, and that while Russia sees the IAEA’s request to inspect Zaporizhzhia, Kyiv has an interest in not allowing the inspection to take place. Ukraine has previously objected to the idea that the IAEA would visit Zaporizhzhia, as they fear it would lend legitimacy and normalise Russia’s occupation of the facility and the territory that surrounds it. For their part, if Ukraine’s claims that staff are being mistreated there are true, then Russia also has a vested interest in avoiding an inspection that might reveal this. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, to invade and take territory without being opposed, then it would be “open season” around the world. The US’s top diplomat was speaking at a news conference alongside South Africa’s foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, as part of a visit that will also take him to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. “If we allow a big country to bully a smaller one, to simply invade it and take its territory, then it’s going to be open season, not just in Europe but around the world,” Blinken said. Reuters reported that Blinken said the US felt it was important to stand up to Russia because its aggression against Ukraine threatened the foundational principles of the international system. Pandor said no one in South Africa supported the war in Ukraine but that the prescripts of international law were not being applied evenly. “We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine, as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine,” she said. South Africa abstained from a United Nations vote denouncing the invasion of Ukraine, and like other African countries has resisted calls to condemn Russia. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has had harsh words on Telegram this afternoon following news that pro-Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia are moving towards holding a referendum to join the Russian Federation. Fedorov, who was forced into exile early in the war, writes: The collaborators decided to make another propaganda picture for the Russian mass media. They brought a crowd from other temporarily occupied territories of the Zaporizhzhia region to Melitopol – 700 people, because even that many cannot be recruited among the local population – and held a ‘forum’ in the city’s palace of culture. Yevhen Balytskyi, the Gauleiter of the Zaporizhzhia region, who at one time failed miserably in the local elections, gaining less than 10%, conducted the coven. It is difficult to guess what plans will appear in the head of this mentally ill local tsar and Kremlin henchman of tomorrow. In any case, his ‘orders’ have no legal significance. The RIA Novosti news agency reported earlier that Balytskyi signed the order for a referendum at a forum entitled “We are together with Russia”. It quotes Vladimir Rogov, a member of the main council of the regional administration imposed by pro-Russian secessionists saying on the radio: We are preparing 100 percent. Everything is working out. We will have a voting format that is quite understandable to people. We will not conduct any experiments. A Ukrainian court has sentenced a Russian soldier to 10 years in jail on Monday after finding him guilty of violating the laws and customs of war by firing a tank at a multistorey apartment block, an interior ministry official said. Reuters reports the court in Chernihiv, north-east Ukraine, found Mikhail Kulikov, guilty of hitting the residential building on 26 February, two days after Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine began. Kulikov, who was capture while fighting, pleaded guilty and sought a more lenient punishment because he said he had been following orders, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. The residential block was not a military target or being used for military purposes, it said. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces deliberately target civilians. This is Martin Belam picking up the live blog again for an hour. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia is ready to facilitate a visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the RIA Novosti news agency quoted Moscow’s permanent representative to the nuclear watchdog as saying on Monday. Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of shelling the plant, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, in recent days, Reuters reported. Natalia Kompaniets spends her days running over a dilemma with her daughter as they sit in their temporary new home, a simply furnished room on the first floor of an unmarked building, in a nondescript suburb of Budapest. “Every day we think, should we go back or not? There’s a battle in our souls,” said Kompaniets, a 51-year-old who left the town of Obukhiv outside Kyiv in early March along with her daughter and young granddaughter. Here, as well as elsewhere in Hungary, Poland and other countries neighbouring Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees – mostly women, children and elderly people – are weighing up similar questions. If they are from a relatively safe part of Ukraine, is it time to return? Should they wait for the war to end? And how long would that mean waiting? Russian forces want to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling its Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex, the Ukrainian ambassador to the global nuclear watchdog has said, calling for an international mission to the plant this month. “We will use all possible channels of diplomacy to bring the IAEA and UN closer to conducting this mission,” Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, the ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters in Vienna. “We really need it urgently, as soon as possible, I would say not later than the end of this month,” he added. Ukraine has received its first three German Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft systems and will use them to defend important infrastructure facilities, the southern military command has said. The air defence systems, which are operated by three-person crews and can hit targets at up to two and half miles, are one of various pieces of western military kit being supplied to Ukraine to help it fend off the Russian invasion, Reuters reported. The Russian-installed head of southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region has signed a decree providing for a referendum on joining Russia, the RIA Novosti news agency reported on Monday. It comes as Russia’s defence ministry said that Ukraine had shelled the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, the biggest in Europe, on 7 August, damaging high-voltage power lines and forcing the plant to reduce its output. In its daily military briefing, the defence ministry said Ukraine had shelled the power station at around 12.40pm (9.40am GMT) from positions near the town of Marhanets, Reuters reported. The shelling damaged a high-voltage power line supplying electricity to the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions – parts of which are under Russian control – in southern Ukraine, the ministry said. A power surge also occurred as a result of the shelling, Moscow said, triggering a safety system that cut off the power supply, it added. German chancellor Olaf Scholz does not consider support for Russia sanctions to be waning even with energy bills expected to surge further, a government spokesperson said on Monday. “We face difficult months ahead,” the spokesperson said, adding: “But it is clear that we stand firmly on the side of Ukraine and we stand behind the sanctions that we agreed together with the European Union and the international community”. Speaking at a regular news conference in Berlin, the spokesperson also ruled out approval for the shelved Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Reuters reported. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces shot down 19 US-made Himars missiles across eastern and southern Ukraine, and destroyed Himars vehicles near the Ukrainian town of Kramatorsk. Reuters was unable to verify the reports. More on this claim as it comes. The Kremlin said on Monday there was no basis for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents at the moment. In response to a question about Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan’s offers to broker peace talks, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy could meet only after negotiators from both sides had “done their homework”. Negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv have been stalled for months, with each side blaming the other for a lack of progress, Reuters reported. “The Ukrainian delegation has gone off the radar, there is no negotiation process now,” Peskov said on Monday. “As for a meeting between presidents Putin and Zelenskiy, it is possible only after all the homework has been done by the delegations. This is missing, so there are no necessary prerequisites for the meeting,” he added. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. The UN nuclear watchdog has called for an immediate end to all military action near the plant after it was hit by shelling on Saturday night, causing one of the reactors to shut down and creating a “very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called for the plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” she said on television. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson told Interfax: “The equipment of the builders who are repairing the Antonivskiy bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed.” Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Two more grain-carrying ships have sailed from Ukraine’s Black sea ports on Monday, and the Polarnet, carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn, has arrived in Turkey. Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. “Russian troops are almost certainly amassing in the south, either waiting for a Ukrainian counteroffensive or preparing to attack. Long convoys of Russian military trucks, tanks, artillery and other things continue to move from the Donbas to the south-west,” the UK’s defence ministry said. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military. It also said Russian forces attempted to conduct assault in six different areas in the eastern Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine is investigating almost 26,000 suspected war crime cases committed since Russia’s invasion in February and has charged 135 people, its chief war crimes prosecutor told Reuters. Of those charged, approximately 15 are in Ukrainian custody and the remaining 120 remain at large. Zelenskiy said on Sunday that there could be no talks with Russia if it proceeds with referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine on joining Russia. Russian forces now hold large areas of territory in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and in southern areas, where officials have raised the possibility of holding referendums. Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. Human rights group Amnesty International apologised for the “distress and anger” caused by a report that accused Ukraine of endangering civilians. The apology comes after Amnesty’s Ukraine head Oksana Pokalchuk said that she was resigning as she opposed the report’s publication, saying the human rights group unwittingly “created material that sounded like support for Russian narratives of the invasion”. The head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom called this morning for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to be made a military-free zone, and said there should be a team of peacekeepers present at the site. Reuters reports he made the comments on television after Ukraine and Russia accused each of shelling the nuclear power plant – Europe’s biggest – which lies in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine. At the same time, Energoatom has posted on its official Telegram channel accusing Russia of mining the plant. It claims to be quoting “the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence forces of the Russian Federation, major general Valeriy Vasyliev”, accusing him of saying: “We have planted mines in all the important facilities of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. And we do not hide this from the enemy. We warned them. The enemy knows that the plant will be either Russian – or no one’s.” AFP reports Finland has registered a record number of asylum seekers following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, beating a previous high set during the 2015 migrant crisis. “By 4 August, those fleeing Ukraine due to the Russian military attack had submitted 35,074 applications for temporary protection,” the Finnish immigration service said in a statement. More than 37,000 people are currently registered in the reception system, “which is more than ever before”. “One third of those fleeing Ukraine are children,” the immigration service said. The latest figures from UNHCR, the UN’s refugee agency, show that over 6.3 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station is operating normally according to reports from Yevgeniy Balitsky, the head of the Russian-installed administration of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. Reuters reports he told Interfax: “We have information from the military and representatives of Russia’s Rosatom, who are here, just watching the situation. We have information from them that everything is operating in normal mode.” Ukraine conducted long-range strikes on Russian troop bases and two key bridges across the Dnieper River overnight, Ukrainian officials have said. The strikes hit the only two crossings Russia has to the pocket of southern Ukrainian territory it has occupied on the western bank of the river, said Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern military command. “The results are rather respectable, hits on the Antonivskyi and Kakhovskyi bridges,” Reuters reports she said on television. The claims have not been independently verified, but earlier Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson, told the Interfax news agency that the Antonivskyi bridge had been struck again. Here is a selection of images that have been sent to us today over the newswires from Sloviansk, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, appears to have confirmed on Telegram that at least one person has been killed in a strike this morning, posting “Unfortunately, as a result of the morning shelling, one person died, another one was injured. Information is being updated. Emergency medical personnel are on site.” In the last few minutes the mayor of Kharkiv, Ihor Terekhov has posted to Telegram to say: Now Pavlovo Pole is being shelled already in the morning … minutes ago there was an explosion. There is definitely no military infrastructure in this peaceful and densely populated area. I ask everyone to be in shelters – the shelling can be repeated. Here is an image that has been sent to us from Turkey of the ship Polarnet arriving at Derince port. It is carrying 12,000 tons of Ukrainian corn. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has said that two people were killed in shelling on the region in the last 24 hours. He claimed that overnight the roof of the administrative building in Kharkiv’s Kyiv district had caught fire due to the shelling. His message ended: As you can see, the Russians, because of their lack of success at the front, are striking peaceful towns and villages in the region. But we are stronger than their pathetic attempts to intimidate us. Victory is ours! In the last few minutes he has issued a broad warning to citizens in Kharkiv, posting to Telegram to say: “Residents of Kharkiv and the region, stay in shelters as much as possible. The Russian occupiers strike Kharkiv. Do not leave safe places.” In his daily status update, Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has cautioned residents about the information sources they use, saying overnight rumours had been spread about a failure of the air alert system. He wrote on Telegram: On 8 August, at 2.57am, one of the Telegram channels spread information that there was an air alert in Lviv, but due to technical reasons, the city and phone applications did not turn on the notification. This information is not true! There was no threat. Follow and trust only official sources of information. The claim has not been independently verified. Elsewhere in his daily update, Kozytskyi said there had been one genuine air alert overnight, but that “the danger did not materialise”, and that 270 people arrived in his region on two evacuation trains from the east of the country. Seven hundred and 68 people departed from the Lviv oblast to Przemyśl in Poland on four trains. My colleague Shaun Walker recently wrote a lengthy profile of Dmitry Medvedev on the former Russian leader’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk. Medvedev has given an interview to Tass, which it has published this morning, which contains plenty of Medvedev’s anti-western rhetoric. The interview is timed to coincide with the anniversary of Russia’s assault on Georgia in 2008. which took place when he was in power. In today’s interview, Medvedev says: The criminal policy of the United States is being aggressively pursued in Ukraine. True, with much more active support from the European Union, which has finally lost its independence. The goal is the same – to destroy Russia. This is the root cause of the extremely aggressive, Russophobic geopolitical process initiated by the west. Our answer is tough, but carefully thought out. If there is an opportunity to resolve the problem peacefully, at the negotiating table, this should be done. But when there is no way out, you have to react by force. Unfortunately, both in Georgia and Ukraine, the authorities of these countries left Russia no choice, disrupting the processes of political settlement of these conflicts. And we deliberately went for military intervention. As far as Nato is concerned, its relentless desire to expand along Russia’s borders, like a cancerous tumour, has become a global problem. It makes all reasonable people sick. You can read the full Medvedev interview with Tass here. Read Shaun Walker’s profile of Medvedev here: ‘I hate them’: Dmitry Medvedev’s journey from liberal to anti-western hawk The self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic, an entity recognised as legitimate and official by only three UN member states, has issued a briefing for the day in which they say in the last 24 hours they have killed “up to 53 personnel” from Ukrainian forces, and destroyed four armoured personnel carriers and “seven units of special vehicles”. The announcement on Telegram also claims that as a result of shelling by Ukrainian forces on the city of Alchevsk in occupied Luhansk, one civilian was killed and 19 people were injured, including five children. They claim that 13 apartment buildings, four kindergartens and a school were damaged. They claim that “peaceful life is being restored in the territories of the Luhansk People’s Republic liberated from Ukrainian nationalists” and cite more than five hectares being cleared of explosive devices. They also claim to be delivering humanitarian aid. None of the claims have been independently verified. A key Russian-held bridge into the occupied southern city of Kherson has been hit again overnight by Ukrainian forces, according to reports from the Russian-imposed administration there. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the pro-Russian administration imposed on occupied Kherson, told the Interfax news agency: The blow was struck on the Antonivskiy bridge. The equipment of the builders who are repairing the bridge burned down, there are no critical damages. But the opening of the bridge is slightly delayed. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted the bridge with high-precision weapons as it is one of only two permanent re-supply routes over the Dnieper River, linking the occupied city with the rest of Kherson region and down to annexed Crimea in the south. The claims have not been independently verified. Ivan Fedorov, Ukraine’s elected mayor of Melitopol, has posted to Telegram overnight about the situation in the occupied city, which he is in exile from. He told his supporters on Telegram: Today, high-precision Himars missiles fired at the points of temporary deployment of the occupying forces at industrial sites in various districts of the city of Melitopol. Last week, the occupiers redeployed a significant part of air defence from Melitopol to Kherson. Tonight is the most effective and shows that the existing enemy air defence units are no longer able to resist Himars. The weakening of the air defence system creates the necessary prerequisites for a successful counteroffensive in the direction of Melitopol. The claims have not been independently verified.

It is highly likely Russia is deploying anti-personnel mines to protect and deter freedom of movement along its defensive lines in Donetsk and Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. The PFM-1 and PFM-1S mines, also known as “butterfly mines”, have the potential to inflict widespread casualties amongst both the military and the local civilian population. The ministry calls the PFM-1 mines “deeply controversial and indiscriminate weapons”, pointing to the devastating impact the mines had in the Soviet-Afghan war where they allegedly maimed a number of children who mistook them for toys. Battle for Donbas Russian forces are trying to gain full control of eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region as it stepped up attacks north and north-west of Donetsk city on Sunday, Reuters reports The Russians attacked Ukrainian positions near the heavily fortified settlements of Piski and Avdiivka, as well as shelling other locations in the Donetsk region, according to Ukraine’s military. In addition to tightening its grip over the Donbas, Russia is entrenching its position in southern Ukraine, where it has gathered troops in a bid to prevent a potential counter-offensive near Kherson. Hello, it’s Jordyn Beazley back with you on the Guardian’s live blog as we cover all the latest developments from Ukraine. UN secretary general António Guterres has called for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe’s largest atomic plant at the weekend. “Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” Guterres told a news conference in Japan on Monday, two days after attending the Hiroshima peace memorial ceremony to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing. Here’s a summary of the main points you might have missed: Russia is strengthening its positions and numbers on Ukraine’s southern front to ready itself for a Ukrainian counteroffensive and is likely to be preparing the ground to attack, according to British and Ukrainian military authorities. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for renewed shelling of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, the Zaporizhzhia. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for new international sanctions on Moscow for “nuclear terror”. Russian shelling was recorded on Saturday in dozens of towns along the eastern and southern frontlines, according to the Ukrainian military. It also said Russian forces attempted to conduct assault in six different areas in the eastern Donetsk region, all of which failed to gain any territory and were held back by Ukrainian forces. Zelenskiy said on Sunday that there could be no talks with Russia if it proceeds with referendums in occupied areas of Ukraine on joining Russia. Russian forces now hold large areas of territory in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region and in southern areas, where officials have raised the possibility of holding referendums. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace welcomed a decision by Sweden to join countries contributing to the UK-led programme to train Ukrainian personnel in the UK. Four ships carrying Ukrainian foodstuffs sailed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports on Sunday. Pope Francis welcomed the departure of the ships carrying grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports saying this could be a model for dialogue to bring an end to the war in Ukraine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/how-dangerous-is-the-situation-at-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T12:44:34Z","webTitle":"How dangerous is the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/how-dangerous-is-the-situation-at-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/how-dangerous-is-the-situation-at-the-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant","fields":{"headline":"How dangerous is the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UN has called for international inspectors to be given access to the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, after it was shelled at the weekend. But how dangerous is the situation and what is likely to happen next? Why is the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant important? The plant, built in the Soviet era, is the largest nuclear reactor in Europe. Its six pressurised water reactors (of which at least two are currently operating) are important to Kyiv as they can produce power for up to 4m homes. Situated on the south bank of the Dnieper river at Enerhodar, south-west of the city of Zaporizhzhia itself, the plant occupies an extremely important strategic position both for Russian and Ukrainian forces, who have been contesting control of the site since early in the war. The presence of the water-cooled reactors, as well as a spent fuel storage facility, on the large and sprawling site has led Russia to use it as a so called “sheltered” artillery park, using the facilities to fire on Ukrainian positions in the belief that Ukraine would not fire back and risk a nuclear accident. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has accused the Russians of using the plant as a “nuclear shield” saying: “Of course the Ukrainians cannot fire back lest there be a terrible accident involving the nuclear plant.” That has allowed Russia to target areas like the city of Nikopol across the river which has come under heavy shelling in recent weeks. Why is there renewed concern? There are two issues fuelling a deepening anxiety over the situation at the plant, which is under Russian control but uses Ukrainian staff. International nuclear safety officials have become concerned over the lack of spare parts, access for routine maintenance of the reactors and lack of contact with staff all of which have been disrupted by the ongoing conflict. A second issue is grad missile fire around the plant at the weekend, with Russians and Ukrainians pointing the finger over responsibility. According to Energoatom – the Ukrainian nuclear authority – the impacts were close to the spent fuel storage area with the operator claiming Russian troops “aimed specifically” at the containers despite the presence of Russian troops at the site. However, it is worth noting that Ukrainian officials at times have somewhat overstated claims about nuclear risks posed by the conflict both at Chornobyl and Zaporizhzhia – so for now it is not clear how dangerous this weekend’s incident was in and of itself. While Ukraine’s objective – to see the plant treated as a demilitarised area – is an entirely prudent call it would also serve a military objective by denying Russian forces the use of a plant from which they can shell with relative impunity. A final dimension is a claim by Ukrainian intelligence – reported in Ukrainian media outlets – that Russia has mined facilities, quoting the head of the radiation, chemical and biological defence troops of the Russian armed forces, Maj Gen Valery Vasiliev, who now commands the Zaporizhzhia garrison, saying: “There will be either Russian land or a scorched desert.” However, a major and deliberate detonation in Zaporizhzhia would threaten southern Russia as well as Ukraine with nuclear contamination, so it is important to distinguish between “nuclear blackmail” and a serious threat that would have repercussions for Russia itself. So how dangerous is shelling around the plant? The reactors are designed to withstand substantial impact – think of a civilian airliner crashing into them – protected with steel and reinforced concrete as well as fire protection systems, although a strike from a substantial missile might be more problematic. The buildings housing the spent fuel, however, are not built with a similar level of protection, meaning that a release of spent fuel material is probably a greater risk from fighting than a catastrophic breach of a reactor, although more limited. The reality is that the situation at the plant in terms of safety operations is probably the most serious issue, as a deteriorating safety regime caused by the conflict has been exacerbated by a risk of a strike. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, described the ongoing crisis of safety oversight as a dire threat to public health and the environment in Ukraine, and far beyond its borders, describing the situation as “completely out of control.” “You have a catalogue of things that should never be happening in any nuclear facility,” he said. While Grossi has suggested a mission to the plant, ironically Ukraine has been blocking the initiative, with Energoatom arguing as recently as June that any visit would legitimise Russia’s presence there."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/sep/07/pine-gap-a-target-as-ukraine-invasion-raises-nuclear-war-risk-australian-defence-expert-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T17:30:25Z","webTitle":"Pine Gap a target as Ukraine invasion raises nuclear war risk, Australian defence expert warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/07/pine-gap-a-target-as-ukraine-invasion-raises-nuclear-war-risk-australian-defence-expert-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/sep/07/pine-gap-a-target-as-ukraine-invasion-raises-nuclear-war-risk-australian-defence-expert-warns","fields":{"headline":"Pine Gap a target as Ukraine invasion raises nuclear war risk, Australian defence expert warns","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australia could become a nuclear target due to its hosting of a US military base at Pine Gap in the Northern Territory, one of Australia’s leading defence strategists has warned. Prof Paul Dibb, an emeritus professor at the Australian National University and former director of Australia’s Joint Intelligence Organisation, said the current Russian invasion of Ukraine carried potential global nuclear consequences, with the possibility of a defeated and humiliated Russia pushed closer to China in “a grand coalition … united not by ideology but by complementary grievances”. In a paper released on Wednesday morning by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Dibb said “the risk of nuclear war is now higher than at any time since the Cold War”. “There’s also a real risk that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could escalate to a wider major war in Europe – and perhaps the use of nuclear weapons”. Australia should not feel its geographic distance from the epicentre of the conflict affords it any significant protection, Dibb argued. “We need to plan on the basis that Pine Gap continues to be a nuclear target, and not only for Russia. If China attacks Taiwan, Pine Gap is likely to be heavily involved,” he said. “We need to remember that Pine Gap is a fundamentally important element in US war fighting and deterrence of conflict.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Pine Gap is a highly secret US-Australian military installation near Alice Springs. It serves as a major hub for US global intelligence interception, and for satellite surveillance operations for military and nuclear missile threats in the region. Russia is unlikely to be able to subjugate Ukraine in its current invasion, Dibb said, but Ukrainian military is unlikely to succeed in driving out Russian troops entirely. “Most likely there’ll be a negotiated conclusion, probably at the ceasefire talk.” Regardless, Dibb argued, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was unlikely to be deposed as a result, but he would be a leader grown increasingly isolated, and the threat of nuclear escalation was real. “There’s little doubt that Putin is the sort of person who won’t resile from the use of nuclear weapons, particularly if it looks as though he’s losing this war. But he must surely realise that there’s no such thing as the limited use of tactical nuclear weapons in isolation from their escalation to a full-scale strategic nuclear war. “Once we enter the slippery slope of even limited nuclear exchanges, the end result will be escalation to mutual annihilation – something about which both Putin and Xi Jinping may need reminding.” The comprehensive defeat of Russia in Ukraine would bring its own dangers, Dibb argued. “A severely weakened, isolated and smaller Russia might then become more – not less – dangerous for the world.” A Russia left humiliated would be driven closer to China, Dibb said, with the nuclear powers forming what he described as a “grand coalition”, unified “not by ideology but by complementary grievances”. Dibb told the Guardian: “The most serious threat to America would be a de facto alliance between China and Russia, united in the common cause of their hatred for the west.” Dibb said he did not agree with assessments that the US was “finished” as a global power, and could no longer be relied upon as a security partner. “We went through a tricky and rocky period with Trump and if we got him back it would make matters a lot worse for us. But I don’t agree with those who are arguing that America is finished.” He said Putin was motivated by an irredentist desire to restore former Soviet glory and power. “Having studied the Soviet Union and the threat of nuclear war for decades, the depressing thing is nothing much has changed,” Dibb said. “That has a lot to do with that history and with geography, but the threat remains, and remains very real.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-183-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T17:41:18Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 183 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-183-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/25/russia-ukraine-war-latest-what-we-know-on-day-183-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war latest: what we know on day 183 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station was temporarily taken off the Ukrainian power grid. The plant in eastern Ukraine is under Russian occupation and was disconnected from the national power supply for several hours before a last remaining line supplying electricity that cools the reactors was reconnected. Disconnecting the plant raises the risk of catastrophic failure of cooling systems for its reactors and spent fuel rods, which run on electricity. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree to increase the size of Russia’s armed forces from 1.9 million to 2.04 million, Reuters has cited the Russian state-owned news agency Ria as saying. The figure, which includes a 137,000 increase in the number of military personnel to 1.15 million, will come into effect on 1 January. The death toll from Russia’s rocket strike on a Ukrainian train station has risen to 25 people. Russian forces attacked a train in the village of Chaplyne, Dnipropetrovsk oblast on Wednesday. Four trains caught fire and the deputy head of the president’s office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, reported on Telegram that two children were killed in the attack. Russia has since confirmed it was behind the attack. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed its forces struck the railway station, prompting condemnation from the US and the EU. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the attack “fits a pattern of atrocities” while the EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said those responsible would be held to account. The UN’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has called on Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine and its “unimaginably terrifying” impact on civilians. Bachelet spoke about the six months since the Russian leader ordered his troops into Ukraine during a speech marking the end of her term as the UN’s high commissioner for human rights. The mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol, Ivan Fedorov, has said a building allegedly used by Russian-backed officials in the region has been “blown up”. Fedorov, who is not in the city, posted a video on Telegram reportedly showing damage to the building, which he said was being used to plan a “pseudo-referendum” by Russia-backed authorities on whether the region should join Russia. The head of the Kyiv regional military administration said Russia launched a rocket attack on the region’s Vyshgorod district north of the city centre early on Thursday morning. Oleksiy Kuleba said there were so far no casualties or damage to residential buildings or infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s armed forces said “several” explosions were heard at about 3am. The US president, Joe Biden, was set to speak to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, after the announcement of a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in US military aid for Ukraine. John Kirby, the communications coordinator at the national security council, said the phone call would also provide the Ukrainian president with an update on US arms shipments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T01:28:06Z","webTitle":"Nuclear plant came close to ‘radiation disaster’, says Zelenskiy, amid calls for urgent UN visit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/26/zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-ukraine-russia-europe-radiation-disaster","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear plant came close to ‘radiation disaster’, says Zelenskiy, amid calls for urgent UN visit","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut by shelling. The Ukranian president said officials from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN’s nuclear watchdog, must be given urgent access to the site. Zelenskiy blamed shelling on Thursday by Russia’s military for fires in the ash pits of a nearby coal power station that disconnected the reactor complex, Europe’s largest such facility, from the power grid. He said back-up diesel generators ensured power supply and kept the plant safe. “If our station staff had not reacted after the blackout, then we would have already been forced to overcome the consequences of a radiation accident,” he said in an evening address. “Russia has put Ukraine and all Europeans in a situation one step away from a radiation disaster.” IAEA officials should be given access to the site within days, he said, “before the occupiers take the situation to the point of no return”. Negotiations are under way for the UN’s nuclear watchdog to visit the site, and Ukraine’s top nuclear official told the Guardian that IAEA inspectors could arrive by the end of the month. Until then, continued fighting puts the plant, and potentially much of Europe, at risk. A nuclear accident could spread radiation far across the continent. Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom said Thursday’s incident represented the plant’s first complete disconnection in its nearly 40 years of operation. Electricity is used for cooling and safety systems. Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February, captured the plant in March and has controlled it since, although Ukrainian technicians still operate it. Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling the site, fuelling fears of a nuclear disaster. The White House called on Russia to agree to a demilitarised zone around the plant, after Joe Biden spoke to Zelenskiy on Thursday. The US state department also cautioned Russia against redirecting energy from the site. “The electricity that it produces rightly belongs to Ukraine and any attempt to disconnect the plant from the Ukrainian power grid and redirect to occupied areas is unacceptable,” spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters. “No country should turn a nuclear power plant into an active war zone and we oppose any Russian efforts to weaponise or divert energy from the plant.” The IAEA said Ukraine had informed it the plant temporarily lost connection, “further underlining the urgent need for an IAEA expert mission to travel to the facility”. “We can’t afford to lose any more time. I’m determined to personally lead an IAEA mission to the plant in the next few days,” the organisation’s director general, Rafael Grossi, said. Writing on Telegram, Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied town of Enerhodar near the plant, said satellite photos showed the local forest in flames. He said towns in the area lost power for several hours on Thursday. “This was caused by the disconnection of power lines from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station as a result of provocations by Zelenskiy’s fighters,” Rogov claimed. “The disconnection itself was triggered by a fire and short circuit on the power lines.” Nuclear experts have warned of the risk of damage to the plant’s spent nuclear fuel pools or its reactors. Cuts in the power needed to cool the pools could cause a disastrous meltdown. There have been growing international concerns about safety at Europe’s largest nuclear plant. It has been occupied by Russian forces since the start of the war, and they are now using it to house military vehicles and equipment. The complex supplied more than 20% of Ukraine’s electricity needs and its loss would pile new strain on the government. The head of Energoatom’s told the Guardian on Wednesday that Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint to permanently disconnect the plant from the national grid and connect it to the Russian power network instead. Petro Kotin said the plan was ostensibly aimed at maintaining power supply to the plant if all connections to Ukraine were cut off by fighting, as they were on Thursday. But Ukraine fears Russia may deliberately cut the lines. Russian and Ukrainian forces have reached a relative stalemate in recent months, partly after the west supplied new long-range missiles that have hampered Russia’s supply lines and ability to continue with its offensives. Ukraine says it also does not have the weapons it needs to launch a decisive counteroffensive.

Guterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency needed access to the plant. “We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to create the conditions of stabilisation of the plant,” he said. Ukraine said renewed Russian shelling on Saturday had damaged three radiation sensors and hurt a worker at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the second hit in consecutive days on the site. Ukraine’s ambassador to the IAEA, Yevhenii Tsymbaliuk, echoed the call for international inspectors and said Russian forces were attempting to cause electricity blackouts in southern Ukraine by shelling the plant, which was captured by Russian forces in early March but is still run by Ukrainian technicians. He said Zaporizhzhia staff were “working under the barrels of Russian guns”. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear power company Energoatom, said the creation of a demilitarised zone around the site and the presence of peacekeepers “would resolve this problem”. He warned of the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more containers were to be broken, “it is impossible to assess the scale” of the resulting disaster. “Such insane actions could leave to the situation spiralling out of control and it will be a Fukushima or Chornobyl,” Kotin said. In a televised address on Sunday the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused Russia of waging “nuclear terror” that warranted more international sanctions, this time on Moscow’s nuclear sector. “There is no such nation in the world that could feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant,” Zelenskiy said. Russian-installed authorities in the area said Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket launcher, damaging administrative buildings and an area near a storage facility. The Russian embassy in Washington also released a statement itemising the damage. “Ukrainian nationalists launched an artillery strike on the territory of the specified object on 5 August. Two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline were damaged as a result of the shelling. Only thanks to the effective and timely actions of the Russian military in covering the nuclear power facility, its critical infrastructure was not affected,” the embassy said. The head of Zaporizhzhia’s occupying authorities, Evgeniy Balitskyi, said Ukrainian forces were to blame and had “decided to put the whole of Europe on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe” by shelling the plant. Ukraine says Russia has turned the plant into a military base, making it extremely hard to target the Russian troops and equipment inside. According to the New York Times, Russia has been using the plant as cover from which to fire on Ukrainian forces since mid-July. The Washington-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) assessed on 3 August that Russian forces were likely to be using the power plant to “play on western fears of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine in an effort to degrade western will to provide military support to a Ukrainian counteroffensive”. The ISW further said that Russia was “effectively using the plant as a nuclear shield to prevent Ukrainian strikes on Russian forces and equipment”. It has not been possible to independently determine which side was responsible for the attack on the power station. The IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned on Saturday that the latest attack “underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”. In other developments on Monday: The Russian-installed leader of the Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree allowing for a referendum on joining Russia to take place. The Russian state news agency Ria Novosti reported that the declaration was signed at a conference of 700 regional officials where all present unanimously raised their hands in support of the referendum. In his video address on Sunday night Zelenskiy warned about “pseudo referendums” in the occupied south of Ukraine. He told Russia that choosing that path would close down “any possibility of negotiations with Ukraine and the free world”. Ukrainian forces again shelled Antonivskyi Bridge in the Russian-controlled city of Kherson, damaging construction equipment and delaying its reopening, Interfax news agency quoted a local Russian-appointed official as saying. Two more ships, carrying corn and soya beans, departed from Ukrainian Black Sea ports, Turkey and Ukraine said, taking the total to 10 since the first ship sailed last week under a deal with Russia to unblock Ukrainian grain exports. The United Nations and Turkey brokered the agreement last month after warnings the halt in grain shipments caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could lead to severe food shortages and even outbreaks of famine in parts of the world. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said if Russia were allowed to bully Ukraine, invade and take its territory, “then it’s going to be open season, not just in Europe but around the world”. One of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies has claimed the west wants to destroy Russia. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, who is now the virulently anti-western deputy head of the country’s security council, was speaking to the news agency Tass on the 14th anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Georgia. He linked the wars in Georgia and Ukraine as “one conspiracy aimed against Russia”.

When Maureen gets wind of a deal that could lead to massive job losses in the sector, she unilaterally declares war on the powers that be, petitioning politicians and making some very powerful enemies in the process. But when Maureen is violently sexually assaulted in her own home, the initial sympathy and shock within the industry turns to suspicion when the police accuse her of faking the attack. It’s not unusual, unfortunately, for the victims of sexual attacks to find themselves distrusted and even accused. What rankles in the film’s approach is that the audience is also encouraged to question her story, with director Jean-Paul Salomé seeding the picture with doubts about the veracity of Maureen’s initial version of the events, even as it shows her vindicated in the end. It feels crass and manipulative to cast aspersions on the tale of a real-life rape victim in service of a narrative twist in a movie."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T17:58:55Z","webTitle":"Energy contracts reform can bring prices down – if the new PM is tough enough | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/sep/01/energy-contracts-reform-can-bring-prices-down-if-the-new-pm-is-tough-enough","fields":{"headline":"Energy contracts reform can bring prices down – if the new PM is tough enough","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Welcome news: a consensus is emerging around one way to attack energy costs – stop paying sky-high prices for electricity that is generated in the UK by firms whose costs are unaffected by soaring gas prices. We’re talking about nuclear power plants, windfarms, solar projects and biomass facilities, some of which are making fortunes thanks to the UK’s outdated wholesale energy pricing system. The basic problem, revealed starkly by the crisis, is that electricity in the UK is tied to global gas prices. When the gas price spikes, as now, it has perverse consequences: a nuclear power station is paid as if its input costs had just risen fivefold, when they plainly haven’t. This “clearing price” setup was designed for another age – not one where nuclear and renewables together produce about 60% of electricity in the UK. One idea to crack the problem in the short term (ie before the government settles on a method to decouple gas and electricity prices, which is the plan) was sketched out here on Tuesday. Academics at the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), followed by the consultancy Cornwall Insight, have been pushing the idea of shifting as many UK generators as possible onto contracts for difference, or CfDs. Under CfDs, the problem of overpayments doesn’t arise: when wholesale prices are above a fixed “strike” price, the projects return cash to be recycled into lowering bills. But the CfD setup has been only been widely used since 2017. Before then, the main system for encouraging investment in renewables was renewable obligation certificates, or ROCs, which are still attached to 40% of UK electricity generation. Such projects get the wholesale price plus, for instance, one ROC worth at least £50 per megawatt hour. The arrangement looked roughly fair when wholesale prices were £100 per megawatt hour, but, at £400-plus, somebody is raking in undeserved and unintended windfalls. If it’s not the owner, then it’s middlemen who bought the power via forward-selling arrangements. Thus a switch to CfDs has right on its side. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Thursday that the government is looking at a voluntary shift to CfDs, albeit one that won’t be ready until next year in order to get around the forward-selling wrinkles. The lure to developers would be a 15-year contract that guarantees still-profitable terms when the current emergency has passed and (we hope) gas prices plunge. That sounds roughly like the original UKERC proposal from April. And Energy UK, the trade body, says the industry is backing the plan. All that is welcome – it is movement in the right direction. But, before anyone gets the idea that salvation has arrived, two related points needed to be made. First, the obvious one: the savings may not be huge if ROC generators don’t all sign up for CfDs, or if the new contracts are too generous. Energy UK is projecting only £150-£250 for a typical household, albeit businesses would also benefit. So the second issue is how robust the government wishes to be. A blistering letter in the Times this week from five former energy bosses, including former chiefs of Shell, National Grid and BG Group, backed a more radical idea to address the same core problem: just cap the prices of domestic electricity produced by non-gas generators. The firms could still make returns “that reflect the investment risk”, but energy prices would be reduced at source. Yes, that idea indicates what could be possible with a bit of arm-twisting. An invitation to generators to enter a “voluntary” negotiation is far more likely to produce big savings if it is accompanied with the threat of a windfall tax. The picture is riddled with politics, it should be said. A contract for 15 years is less appealing if your nuclear power station is due to close in five; and the 80% owner of the existing nuclear fleet is EDF, under the control of the French state. Therein lies an awkward negotiation, just as commercial terms for EDF-backed Sizewell C are on the table. And getting nuclear to sign up would be crucial to maximising savings – it is the big player. But the bottom line here is that tackling prices in the wholesale generation market looks an open goal for an incoming prime minister. Some versions of the CfD suggest average household savings of £500-£600 would be possible with maximum corporate participation. But it would require an incoming PM to, first, recognise the problem; and, second, be willing to face down vested interests."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-14T16:06:11Z","webTitle":"Britons save £3m by using power-hungry appliances at quieter times","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/dec/14/price-of-gas-and-power-falls-in-uk-as-continental-energy-eases-supply-pressures","fields":{"headline":"Britons save £3m by using power-hungry appliances at quieter times","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Britons have saved almost £3m by using tumble dryers and other power-hungry devices at quieter times, under a scheme that aims to reduce the strain on electricity networks, National Grid has said. The electricity system operator (ESO) launched an initiative last month to incentivise consumers and businesses to reduce their energy use, by running appliances such as washing machines, dishwashers and tumble dryers before or after particular designated periods when demand was expected to be heavy. National Grid said on Wednesday the “demand flexibility service” had delivered more than 780 megawatt (MW) hours of demand reduction, and £2.8m in savings over five test periods since the scheme launched last month. More than 1m households and firms had signed up to participate, it said. Customers are normally given 24 hours notice to shift their power usage from a peak period – typically 4pm to 7pm. Savings are passed on via energy suppliers to customers who have signed up. Craig Dyke, the head of national control at the ESO, said: “Delivering the first of the demand flexibility service test events is a major milestone in the evolution of consumer flexibility in the UK. This service successfully proves that consumers up and down the country are standing by to get involved in flexibility solutions.” Separately, gas and power prices fell on Wednesday in signs that the strain on the UK and Europe’s energy supplies was easing despite the icy weather. A marked increase in nuclear output from power stations in France and hydroelectric power in southern Europe has lifted pressure on electricity supplies across northern Europe. The UK price for gas for delivery on Thursday fell 4% at 332p a therm, while month-ahead prices were down 5.6% at 322p a therm. The price of power, which reached a record £675 a megawatt-hour on the Epex Spot SE exchange this week, fell to £353 in a volatile market. Power prices for delivery on Thursday fell nearly 7% in Germany and about 5% in France. Power prices had soared as the freezing weather forced Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy despite high bills. The cold weather combined with a period of low wind, reducing the production of Britain’s windfarms to close to zero. Emergency power units at Drax in North Yorkshire were put on standby on Monday but ultimately not used. Live data from ESOon Wednesday showed wind accounting for 27% of electricity generation, behind gas with 47% and ahead of nuclear at 13%. Separately, French nuclear output has ramped up in recent days and is expected to improve through the week as four more nuclear reactors, which were out of action for maintenance, are due to return. There have been concerns over power shortages this winter in the UK and Europe amid the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the improving weather and resilience of the system so far has brought some encouragement. Analysts at RBC investment bank said: “Despite this grim scenario for the week, we could see that the electricity system is coping relatively well with the situation, albeit power prices suffered a significant increase. “Despite the increase in gas demand on cold weather and low wind resource, we could see how gas storage levels are doing better even this week on any single day v the same day last year.” The rise in prices will have increased the cost of the government’s energy price guarantee scheme, which aims to cushion the blow of rising wholesale costs. The energy regulator is pushing for a cap on how much power stations can charge National Grid for backup electricity. Ofgem wants to tighten rules to prevent “excessive” profits and intends to publish proposals early next year, the Daily Telegraph reports. The Grid spent more than £27m paying power stations to crank up supplies at short notice on Monday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2021/nov/16/bill-gates-natrium-nuclear-power-plant-wyomning-kemmerer","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-17T02:19:52Z","webTitle":"Bill Gates-backed experimental nuclear power plant heads to tiny Wyoming city","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/16/bill-gates-natrium-nuclear-power-plant-wyomning-kemmerer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2021/nov/16/bill-gates-natrium-nuclear-power-plant-wyomning-kemmerer","fields":{"headline":"Bill Gates-backed experimental nuclear power plant heads to tiny Wyoming city","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A tiny city in the top US coalmining state of Wyoming is set to become the home of an experimental nuclear power project backed by Bill Gates. The new Natrium nuclear power plant will be located in Kemmerer, officials announced on Tuesday, and will replace a coal-fired plant that is set to close in 2025. “Our innovative technology will help ensure the continued production of reliable electricity while also transitioning our energy system and creating new, good-paying jobs in Wyoming,” said Chris Levesque, the CEO of TerraPower, the company behind the project that was founded by Gates about 15 years ago. Construction is set to begin in 2024. The project will employ as many as 2,000 people during construction and 250 once operational in a state where the coal industry has been shedding jobs. Kemmerer, one of four cities in the running to host the project, is home to 2,600 people and is located about 130 miles (210 km) north-east of Salt Lake City. If it’s as reliable as conventional nuclear power, the 345-megawatt plant would produce enough climate-friendly power to serve about 250,000 homes. The announcement came days after world leaders met at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow. Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and chairman of TerraPower, in June announced plans for the Wyoming project along with officials from Rocky Mountain Power, Joe Biden’s administration and the state of Wyoming, which produces about 40% of the nation’s coal. “We think Natrium will be a gamechanger for the energy industry,” Gates said at the project’s launch in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Proponents of the project, which will feature a sodium-cooled fast reactor and molten salt energy storage, say it would perform better, be safer and cost less than traditional nuclear power. “Natrium will be that next improvement on safety. Importantly it won’t rely on outside sources of power, pumps and extra equipment to help the plant recover in the event of an emergency,” said Levesque, referring to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster caused by a tsunami that knocked out emergency generators. The high heat-transfer properties of sodium will allow the Natrium plant to be air-cooled. That will enable the plant to be quickly shut down in case of an emergency, and the absence of emergency generators and pumps will save on costs, Levesque said. Others are skeptical about the benefits of sodium compared with water for cooling as in conventional nuclear plants. “The use of liquid sodium has many problems. It’s a very volatile material that can catch fire if it’s exposed to air or water,” said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety with the Union of Concerned Scientists science advocacy non-profit. Countries including the US have experimented with sodium-cooled fast reactors for decades but only Russia has fielded such a reactor on a large, power-producing scale, Lyman said. “Honestly I don’t understand the motivation,” Lyman said. “There are some people who are just strong advocates for it and they’ve sort of won the day here by convincing Bill Gates that this is a good technology to pursue.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-top-us-general-predicts-very-long-counteroffensive-cia-chief-reportedly-visits-kyiv-for-talks","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-01T17:14:10Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: counteroffensive will be long and very bloody, says US general – as it happened ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-top-us-general-predicts-very-long-counteroffensive-cia-chief-reportedly-visits-kyiv-for-talks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jul/01/russia-ukraine-war-live-top-us-general-predicts-very-long-counteroffensive-cia-chief-reportedly-visits-kyiv-for-talks","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: counteroffensive will be long and very bloody, says US general – as it happened ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"That’s all for our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for today. In case you missed anything, here’s a quick rundown of all the latest developments. US general and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff Mark Milley has said Ukraine’s counteroffensive will be very difficult and achieving gains will take a long time. “This is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks. It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody. And no one should have any illusions about any of that,” he said. Vladimir Putin’s admission that the Wagner Group was funded by the Russian state could make it easier to try him for war crimes, experts in international law has said. A 51-year-old man has been killed by shelling in Mala Tokmachka, a village near the frontline in the southeastern region of Zaporizhia, local officials said. President Zelenskiy has said that a “serious threat” remains at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and that Russia is “technically ready” to provoke a localised explosion at the facility. Two children have also been injured in Russian shelling of a residential area in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to the regional governor. Last week’s mutiny by the Wagner Group serves as a “vivid reminder of the corrosive effect of Putin’s war on his own society and his own regime”, CIA Director William Burns has said. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez has addressed the Ukrainian parliament after his country assumed the presidency of the European Union. He said that Ukraine would win the war against Russia and, in time, be granted access to the bloc. Sánchez also announced that Spain had allocated €55m to support small and medium-sized businesses in Ukraine. The number of Russian casualties since the start of the war now stands at more than 228,000, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence. The ministry also claimed Russia had lost 4,041 tanks, 7,863 armoured vehicles, and 3,519 drones. A 51-year-old man has been killed by shelling in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia, according to the head of the local military administration. In a post on Telegram, Yuriy Malashko said the shelling had hit the village of Mala Tokmachka, which he described as a “frontline community under merciless enemy fire”. The village is about 25 miles east of the Dnipro River and immediately on the current border between Ukrainian- and Russian-controlled territory. Malashko added that two people – a 40-year-old woman and a 39-year-old man – had been injured in the shelling and were receiving treatment. He urged local to “take care and go to safe places!” Last week’s mutiny by the Wagner Group shows the “corrosive effect” the war in Ukraine is having on Russian society, the CIA director has said. Williams Burns was speaking at an event hosted by the Ditchley Foundation, which stages conferences focusing on British-American relations, in Oxfordshire. It comes after it was revealed he had made a secret trip to Ukraine to meet with President Zelenskiy and intelligence officials. “It is striking that [Wagner leader Yevgeny] Prigozhin preceded his actions with a scathing indictment of the Kremlin’s mendacious rationale for the invasion of Ukraine and of the Russian military leadership’s conduct of the war,” he said. Before launching the mutiny, Prigozhin released a series of audio messages in which he accused Russia’s military leaders of trying to “deceive the public, deceive the president and tell a story that there was some crazy aggression by Ukraine, that – together with the whole Nato bloc – Ukraine was planning to attack us”. Burns continued: “The impact of those words and those actions will play out for some time – a vivid reminder of the corrosive effect of Putin’s war on his own society and his own regime.” Vladimir Putin’s efforts to end a coup by the Wagner group may have made it easier for an international court to prosecute him, and the Russian state, for war crimes committed by the mercenary fighters, according to experts in international law. After the mutiny led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin said the mercenaries had been “fully funded” by Russian authorities. In the year to May 2023 alone, they received more than 86bn roubles from the state budget, or over $1bn, he added. “Those words potentially have very significant consequences in terms of exposing the Russian state to responsibility for the acts of Wagner, and Putin personally and individually as the leader of the Russian state,” said Philippe Sands KC, a professor of law at UCL and the author of East West Street, a book about the origin of international humanitarian law. Read the full story here: Two children have been injured in Russian shelling in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, according to the regional governor. Writing on Telegram, Oleksandr Prokudin said the shelling hit a residential area and that a nine-year-old girl and a 15-year-old boy were injured. He said both were receiving medical treatment. Kherson, which sits on the western bank of the Dnipro River near the frontlines of the conflict, has been the target of heavy shelling since Ukrainian forces freed it from Russian occupation during a counteroffensive late last year. In the previous post, you’ll find pictures of damage done to homes in the city during the shelling on Saturday. Here are some picture’s of the damage to homes in Kherson taken on Saturday after Russian shelling. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for more international attention to be paid towards the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Reuters reports. He warned on Saturday that a “serious threat” remained at the plant and said Russia was “technically ready” to provoke a localised explosion at the facility. Zelenskiy cited Ukrainian intelligence as the source of his information. “There is a serious threat because Russia is technically ready to provoke a local explosion at the station, which could lead to a [radiation] release,” Zelenskiy told a joint news conference in Kyiv with visiting Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. He gave no further details. Ukrainian military intelligence has previously said Russian troops had mined the plant. He also urged sanctions on Russia’s state nuclear company Rosatom. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, for his “important visit and support of our people” on Twitter. Sánchez visited Kyiv on Saturday and addressed Ukraine’s parliament, telling lawmakers that their country would win the war against Russia and that their bid to join the EU, while deserved, would not be an “easy process”. On Twitter, Zelenskiy added: “It is extremely symbolic that this visit takes place on the very first day of the Spanish presidency of the EU. Our common European home cannot be imagined without Ukraine, without our courage and commitment to freedom and justice.” Media outlets from “unfriendly countries” are due to be banned from Belarus. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has signed a law allowing media from “unfriendly countries” – those that have imposed sanctions on Belarus – to be banned, Pul Pervovo, a state outlet that reports on Lukashenko’s activities, said on Saturday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said a serious threat remains at Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant because Russia is technically ready to provoke a localised explosion at the facility, Reuters reports. Earlier, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate claimed Russia was reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of the Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. The CIA director, William Burns, made a secret trip to Ukraine where officials outlined a strategy to take back control of Russian-occupied territories and bring the war to an end, reports the Washington Post. Overnight the Post reported that Burns had recently travelled to Ukraine to meet Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Ukrainian intelligence officials. During the trip, the officials revealed a Ukrainian strategy to recapture territories occupied by the Russians as well as their endgame to open peace talks with Moscow with a view to ending the war. The newspaper reports: “… in private, military planners in Kyiv have relayed to Burns and others bullish confidence in their aim to retake substantial territory by the fall; move artillery and missile systems near the boundary line of Russian-controlled Crimea; push further into eastern Ukraine; and then open negotiations with Moscow for the first time since peace talks broke down in March of last year.” The Post also reported that Kyiv would agree not to forcefully recapture Crimea from Russia in exchange for western security guarantees. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, addressed Ukraine’s parliament on Saturday, telling lawmakers that their country would win the war against Russia and that their bid to join the EU, while deserved, would not be an “easy process”. Recalling Spain’s own accession process, which began in 1977 after the country transitioned from dictatorship to democracy, Sánchez said the process requires “changes, reforms, and sacrifices”, but that the experience taught his country “important lessons”. “Reforms make your governance and economy better, more modern, and more transparent,” Sánchez said. “They bolster international confidence and proximity. They attract investment. And, in time, they will grant you access to our European Union.” Sánchez started Spain’s six-month presidency of the European Council of the EU today and wasted no time underlining his support for Kyiv with the visit. During the trip he also announced a €55m aid package for Ukraine. Here is an overview of today’s stories so far: The top US military officer, army general Mark Milley, has warned that Ukraine’s counteroffensive will be very difficult and that achieving gains will take a long time and be “very, very bloody”. “No one should have any illusions about any of that,” he said in Washington. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. He addressed the Ukrainian parliament. He is visiting Kyiv on the first day of Spain’s six-month presidency of the European Council. Ukraine’s defence ministry claims its forces have killed more than 228,000 Russian military personnel since the invasion began last year. The ministry also claims Russia has lost about 4,041 tanks, 7,863 armoured vehicles and 3,519 drones. Figures from Ukraine’s defence ministry suggest there were almost 20,000 deaths among Russian military forces in June alone. The CIA director, William Burns, travelled to Ukraine recently and met with intelligence counterparts and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a trip that was not reported at the time, a US official has confirmed to Agence France-Presse. According to the Washington Post, which first reported the visit, Ukrainian officials shared plans to take back Russian-occupied territory and begin ceasefire negotiations by the end of the year. Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said in an interview published on Friday. The CIA director, William Burns, called the Russian spy chief, Sergei Naryshkin, after last week’s aborted mutiny in Russia to assure the Kremlin that the United States had no role in it, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have reported. The call was the highest-level contact between the two governments since the attempted mutiny, the WSJ said. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said he is certain Russian tactical nuclear weapons deployed in his country will never be used. Lukashenko and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, have acknowledged that some tactical weapons have arrived in Belarus and the remainder would be put in place by the end of the year. Lukashenko said on Friday: “As we move along, we become more and more convinced that they [the weapons] must be stationed here, in Belarus, in a reliable place.” A teacher and another employee of a school in the Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. Pope Francis said there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow. Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate has claimed. It said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. Ukrainian prosecutors charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson, some of them as young as one, Reuters reported. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to several news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say. Ukraine’s defence ministry claims its forces have killed over 228,000 Russian military personnel since the invasion began last year. The ministry also claims Russia has lost about 4,041 tanks, 7,863 armoured vehicles and 3,519 drones. On 1 June, the ministry claimed Ukrainian forces had killed 208,370 Russian military personnel. These figures suggest there were almost 20,000 deaths among Russian military forces in June alone, according to figures released by Ukraine’s defence ministry. Here are some pictures of the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, in the Ukrainian parliament on Saturday. He is visiting Kyiv on the first day of Spain’s six-month presidency of the European Council. He is expected to meet Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit. Russia has resumed commercial flights to Cuba for the first time since the invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Rossiya Airlines, part of Russia’s Aeroflot group, resumed scheduled flights to Cuba on Saturday, which had been suspended since western countries shut Russia out of their airspace in response to its invasion of Ukraine. The first flight of what will start as a twice-weekly service took off for the Cuban resort of Varadero from Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on Saturday, Aeroflot said. Russian airlines suspended flights to Cuba, Mexico and the Dominican Republic on 28 February last year, four days after the invasion, which Russia calls a “special military operation”. The deputy prime minister for tourism, sport, culture and communications, Dmitry Chernyshenko, announced in May that regular flights to Cuba skirting the airspace of “unfriendly” countries would resume by July. Here are pictures from Friday of family and co-workers attending the funeral of a young female killed in a missile attack that hit a restaurant in downtown Kramatorsk on 27 June. The Guardian’s Shaun Walker, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer have written an analysis about the likely vengeful response opponents of Vladimir Putin should expect after the attempted Wagner mutiny last weekend. Four days after Vladimir Putin faced the most serious challenge to his 23-year leadership, the Russian president called in the country’s top media figures for a briefing in the Kremlin. The panic of last weekend, as the troops of renegade warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin seemed set to march into Moscow, was still fresh in people’s minds. Putin, who had disappeared from public view for nearly two days as the crisis came to a head, was now holding meetings with various key players, including the editors of loyal media outlets, to project an image of calm control. “The main message was that he is dealing with the situation,” said Konstantin Remchukov, editor-in-chief of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a newspaper with Kremlin connections, who was present at the meeting. “He is starting to investigate and will ask every question, find everything out, and draw the necessary conclusions.” Nonetheless, as the shock of last weekend’s drama starts to wear off and those in the political elite begin to digest the import of events, which Putin himself claimed almost spilled into “civil war”, there are many questions hanging in the air. Read the full story here The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has arrived in Kyiv to meet the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Kyiv Independent reports. Today is Spain’s first day at the helm of the Council of the EU’s rotating presidency. Ukrainian forces are “almost certainly” being redeployed in the east bank of the Dnipro River in the southern Kherson region, the UK’s defence ministry said. In their daily update on Thursday, the ministry said fighting had intensified in the east bank from 27 June and that Russia had “highly likely reallocated” elements of the Dnipro Group of Forces to “reinforce the Zaporizhzhia sector”. Combat around the bridge’s head is almost certainly complicated by “flooding, destruction and residual mud” from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam earlier this month, the ministry added. Reuters reports that Japan’s defence ministry said late on Friday it had spotted two Russian navy ships in the waters near Taiwan and Japan’s Okinawa islands in the previous four days, following a similar announcement this week from Taiwan. Taiwan’s defence ministry said on Tuesday it had spotted two Russian frigates off its eastern coast and had sent aircraft and ships to keep watch. Japan’s government said last month that repeated Russian military activity near Japanese territory, including joint drills with Chinese forces, posed “serious concern” for Japan’s national security. Japan and Taiwan have joined the United States and its allies in imposing wide-ranging sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine last year. The Japanese ministry said two Steregushchy-class frigates were first spotted 70 km (40 miles) south-west of Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni, in Okinawa prefecture neat Taiwan, on Tuesday morning. The vessels sailed back and forth through the waters between Yonaguni and Taiwan, moved eastward and were last spotted on Friday in the waters between Miyako and Okinawa islands, it said, adding Japan dispatched two vessels to monitor the Russian ships. Russia’s Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday that a detachment of ships of the Russian Pacific Fleet had entered the southern parts of the Philippine Sea to perform tasks as part of a long-range sea passage. The director of the CIA, William Burns, called the Russian spy chief Sergei Naryshkin after last weekend’s aborted mutiny in Russia to assure the Kremlin that the US had no role in it, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have reported. Burns’ phone call with Naryshkin, the head of Russia’s SVR foreign intelligence service, took place during the week and was the highest-level contact between the two governments since the attempted mutiny, Reuters reported the WSJ as saying. The head of Russia’s Wagner mercenary force, Yevgeny Prigozhin, led the armed revolt last weekend, denouncing Russia’s military leadership and threatening to “destroy” his rivals, then abruptly called it off as his fighters approached Moscow. Joe Biden said on Monday that the uprising was part of a struggle within the Russian system and that the US and its allies were not involved in it. Separately, Burns made a secret trip to Ukraine recently and met his intelligence counterparts and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a US official has confirmed to Agence France-Presse. It reported the official as saying the mutiny “was not a topic of discussion”. More information has arrived on the casualties of a Russian missile attack on Friday on a village school near the frontline in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. Reuters reports that Ukrainian police said two women had been killed and six people injured. A 56-year-old primary school teacher and a chief accountant, 44, died in the strike on the village of Serhiivka, the police said. Twelve employees were the building’s only occupants, the prosecutor’s office said. Ukrainian schools were not in session for students on Friday. Ukraine’s national police said in a statement: Russian troops, in a direct hit, destroyed a school where civilians were located. The Donetsk region prosecutor’s office said four men aged 54 to 69 and two women aged 24 and 34 were injured and taken to hospital, and that it had launched an investigation into the attack. The CIA director, William Burns, travelled to Ukraine recently and met intelligence counterparts and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a US official confirmed to Agence France-Presse on Friday. The trip was not reported at the time and comes amid Ukraine’s counteroffensive. During his trip Burns reaffirmed “the US commitment to sharing intelligence to help Ukraine defend against Russian aggression”, the news agency quoted the US official as saying. According to the Washington Post, which first reported the visit, Ukrainian officials shared plans to claw back Russian-occupied territory and begin ceasefire negotiations by the end of the year. Burns “travelled to Ukraine as he has done regularly since the beginning of Russia’s recent aggression more than a year ago”, the US official said. The Post reported that the visit occurred in June. The trip took place before the 24-hour rebellion led by the Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, according to the official. The mutiny, widely seen as the biggest threat to Kremlin authority in decades, “was not a topic of discussion”, the official added. Ukraine’s counteroffensive will be very difficult and achieving gains will take a long time and be “very, very bloody”, the top US military officer has warned Army general Mark Milley told the National Press Club in Washington that the counteroffensive was “advancing steadily, deliberately working its way through very difficult minefields ... 500 meters a day, 1,000 meters a day, 2,000 meters a day, that kind of thing”. Reuters also reports that Ukraine has been cautious in publicly counting gains in the counteroffensive it launched last month to reclaim Russian-occupied territory. The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, acknowledged last week that it was going “slower than desired”. Milley said he was not surprised progress was slower than some people and computers might have predicted. War on paper and real war are different. In real war, real people die. Real people are on those front lines and real people are in those vehicles. Real bodies are being shredded by high explosives. Milley added: What I had said was this is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks, it’s going to be very difficult. It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody. And no one should have any illusions about any of that. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine. I’m Adam Fulton and here’s a quick look at the latest. The top US military officer, army general Mark Milley, has warned that Ukraine’s counteroffensive will be very difficult and that achieving gains will take a long time and be “very, very bloody”. “No one should have any illusions about any of that,” he said in Washington.

More on those stories shortly. In other news as it approaches 9am in Kyiv: The top US military officer, army general Mark Milley, said he was not surprised that progress in Ukraine’s counteroffensive was slower than some people might have predicted. “This is going to take six, eight, 10 weeks, it’s going to be very difficult. It’s going to be very long, and it’s going to be very, very bloody,” he said. “And no one should have any illusions about any of that.” Ukraine’s counteroffensive plans are hobbled by the lack of adequate firepower, from modern fighter jets to artillery ammunition, the country’s military commander-in-chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said in an interview published on Friday. The CIA director, William Burns, called the Russian spy chief, Sergei Naryshkin, after last week’s aborted mutiny in Russia to assure the Kremlin that the United States had no role in it, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal have reported. The call was the highest-level contact between the two governments since the attempted mutiny, the WSJ said. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said he is certain Russian tactical nuclear weapons deployed in his country will never be used. Lukashenko and The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, have acknowledged that some tactical weapons have arrived in Belarus and the remainder would be put in place by the end of the year. Lukashenko said on Friday: “As we move along, we become more and more convinced that they [the weapons] must be stationed here, in Belarus, in a reliable place.” A teacher and another employee of a school in the Donetsk region have been killed after the building was shelled, according to a report from Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster. Pope Francis said there was no apparent end in sight to the war in Ukraine as his peace envoy wrapped up three days of talks in Moscow. Russia is reducing its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s military intelligence directorate has claimed. It said that among the first to leave the nuclear power station were three employees of Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom who had been “in charge of the Russians’ activities”. Ukrainian prosecutors charged a Russian politician and two suspected Ukrainian collaborators with war crimes over the alleged deportation of dozens of orphans from the formerly occupied southern city of Kherson, some of them as young as one, Reuters reported. The US is strongly considering sending cluster munitions to Ukraine to boost its counteroffensive against Russian forces, according to several news reports that cite Biden administration officials. Ukraine has conducted nuclear disaster response drills in the vicinity of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, regional officials say."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/18/ukraine-woman-recounts-five-month-nightmare-of-torture-and-imprisonment","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-18T10:00:42Z","webTitle":"‘They enjoyed this’: Ukrainian woman recounts five-month nightmare of torture and imprisonment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/18/ukraine-woman-recounts-five-month-nightmare-of-torture-and-imprisonment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/18/ukraine-woman-recounts-five-month-nightmare-of-torture-and-imprisonment","fields":{"headline":"‘They enjoyed this’: Ukrainian woman recounts five-month nightmare of torture and imprisonment","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Olena Yahupova was first taken by the Russian occupiers in the Ukrainian city of Enerhodar last October. Neighbours she knew had informed on her, telling the FSB secret police that her husband was a Ukrainian military officer. What followed, she says, was two days of torture with the secret police – which turned out to be only a prelude to a nightmare of five months of detention and forced labour, during which she also had to act in faked news clips. “There was a complete absence of any source of law, they did whatever they want,” Yahupova says, now speaking in Ukraine, describing the situation in a town after Russia “gradually built up this repression machine” aimed at liquidating opposition and trying to force locals to collaborate. Enerhodar was a city of 53,000 before the war, best known as being the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. A key target for the Russian invaders, it was captured in early March 2022. Dmytro Orlov, its mayor in exile, now based in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, says only 15,000 people are left, a third of whom work at the vast site, and describes a Russian reign of terror unleashed not just on Ukrainian leaders and nuclear plant workers, but also ordinary citizens such as Yahupova. Five hundred people or more, he estimates, have been subject to kidnapping and torture, and electrocuting, he says, is commonplace. Orlov feels he has heard “just too many stories” of violence meted out to Ukrainians. “In the beginning, I felt shock and despair. But now the time has made me feel tougher and rougher.” At first, Yahupova was far from a target. A local government worker, she says she didn’t participate in any anti-Russian protests. But she made the mistake of being slow to leave, concerned about her pets, and one autumn day she was taken by FSB officers to the local police station. “They tied my hands to my ankles,” she begins, demonstrating by bending forward, before she describes being hit around the head with a full plastic bottle. Strangulation was regular – “one guy holding your neck, another pinching your nose” – while they demanded unsuccessfully that she reveal her husband’s location or inform on others with military connections in the town. A wire flex was wrapped around her neck, a gun was placed against her forehead – “Imagine the condition I was in,” she says, speaking quickly – and she says she, too, was electrocuted, although it is something she is understandably reluctant to detail. “Before doing this, they would announce it,” adding to the torture. Yahupova says the violence was the work of a team of five or six FSB officers – “One by one, they would do these things. They enjoyed this” – and recounts being in a state of shock and pain. “I wouldn’t even have time to yell … there was no time to think … often, I was just looking. It was so shocking,” she continues. After two days the torture stopped, but Yahupova was not released. Brought before a senior officer, she was told, “I don’t see any crime here”, but she was detained in a crowded cell, with up to 15 people at a time. Inmates slept on the floor during the winter and on some days no food was provided. She languished in jail until January: “Basically, they forgot about me.” There was one exception. An FSB officer demanded that Yahupova appear on Russian news to complain about alleged Ukrainian shelling. “He threatened to shoot me”, she says, if she didn’t comply. An item was filmed last October, and is still up on RIA Novosti’s Telegram channel, with the strain clearly showing in her eyes. The shelling, she says now, was conducted by Russian forces. Finally, it was decided she would be expelled from the jails, because she was “impossible to re-educate”, and she was relocated close to the front line, near Russian-held Vasylivka, with two employees of the nuclear power plant. Again, she was forced to participate in a faked video, purporting to show her being expelled to Ukraine through a checkpoint, which again appeared on RIA Novosti. But Yahupova was not expelled. “They gave us to the military and left, we were told it was time to work for the Russian Federation. We were made to dig trenches for two months in freezing weather,” she added. “They would bring us before the sunrise and make us leave after the sunset.” Their efforts were monitored by armed guards; it was “kind of a modern gulag”. A release came after another prisoner managed to persuade a soldier to lend them a phone so they could call relatives who were able to trigger an intervention. A squad turned up and took them to Melitopol, where senior Russian police officers said she could go, appearing to recognise that her forced labour was illegal, and presented her “with a business card with three phone numbers on it” in case she had problems. Yahupova had finally been released and returned to Enerhodar. It was March and when she got back “there was nothing in my house”, she says, accusing local police, people she once knew, of stealing her possessions. Almost immediately on her return, the same local police arrived, terrifying her, but they backed off after calling the numbers on the business card, finally allowing her the time to raise money and leave. Compared with what happened before, the final stage of Yahupova’s story was relatively simple. Perhaps because of the police intervention, her name was not listed at any checkpoints, and she was able to pass through one of Moscow’s filtration camps at Berdyansk into Russia proper without being questioned, although other Ukrainians were removed from the bus. After that, she crossed the border to Estonia and freedom. “I was ready to kiss the soil,” she says, when she left the filtration camp. After reaching Estonia, she finally dared to call her husband to tell him she was alive. “My family told me I should stay in Europe”, after what had happened; but she returned to Zaporizhzhia, “where I signed up to be conscripted to the army”, and to celebrate by renewing her wedding vows in church with her lifelong partner. Prior to the war, western intelligence officials warned that the FSB had been tasked with eliminating opposition in captured or surrounded cities, a prediction that appears to have been grimly borne out in Enerhodar. Although she is back in Ukraine safely, Yahupova says she believes, like the mayor, that her case is one of many war crimes: “I think there are other people digging those trenches now, and as for the nuclear power plant workers I was with in January, I fear the worst.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/13/explainer-should-australia-build-nuclear-power-plants-to-combat-the-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-12T16:30:58Z","webTitle":"Should Australia build nuclear power plants to combat the climate crisis?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/13/explainer-should-australia-build-nuclear-power-plants-to-combat-the-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/13/explainer-should-australia-build-nuclear-power-plants-to-combat-the-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Should Australia build nuclear power plants to combat the climate crisis?","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Weeks out from the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, political figures and commentators have again suggested Australia should consider nuclear energy as part of its future power grid. Though renewable energy could meet 100% of demand by 2025 at certain times of day at current rates of progress – a trend that could be turbocharged with active support from the federal government – the prospect of an Australian nuclear power station still looms large in the public conversation. Here is what we know about the pros and cons of nuclear power in an Australian context. Why was nuclear never adopted in Australia? Australian governments have always talked about building nuclear power plants but never actually followed through. While Australia holds 31% of the world’s supply of uranium, it has always been cheaper to rely on an ocean of cheap coal, gas and oil for power. Australia’s only nuclear reactor, at Lucas Heights, south of Sydney, is for scientific and medical research, and produces mostly low-level waste. Why has the idea been revived now? Nuclear power appears to solve a political dilemma. As it does not rely on fossil fuels, some who care about the climate emergency see it as the fastest way to deliver zero-carbon power. Others who rightly point out that moving away from fossil fuels will hit working-class regions hardest see the “dispatchable power” offered by nuclear reactors as the basis of a new social compact that will pay high salaries while “firming” up the grid. On Monday BHP’s vice-president of sustainability and climate, Dr Fiona Wild, called for Australia to consider nuclear due to the urgency of the threat of climate collapse. “We don’t have time to choose our favourite technologies any more, we kind of need to take an ‘all of the above’ approach because the challenge is so great and the pace at which we need to move is so fast that you want to make sure you have all those options available,” Wild said. On Tuesday the Australian newspaper’s contributing economics editor, Judith Sloan, defended the “plight of nuclear power”. “As an energy crisis affects most of the world, with soaring gas, coal and electricity prices, it is surely time for Australia to have a rational debate about nuclear power leading to a definite outcome,” Sloan said. Do the costs and benefits make sense? The idea of establishing a nuclear power industry has been periodically investigated by governments. South Australia did the homework for the rest of the nation in 2015 with a royal commission. A federal parliamentary inquiry followed up in 2019. The results were mixed. The royal commission concluded nuclear power was out of reach. The federal inquiry recommended that any such project should only go ahead if there was broad support from the public – an extremely unlikely prospect. While both reports agreed “next generation” reactors showed promise, nuclear power as a whole remained a time and money sink. As of 2019, the cost of a nuclear power plant had risen to US$1bn for 100MW of generation capacity. Construction of a commercial-scale plant would take at least 15 years. If Australia had started work on a nuclear reactor before the pandemic, it would not be in operation until about 2035. The small or “modular” reactors that are held up as the future of the industry won’t be affordable until 2050. Could they help to reduce emissions? Nuclear power is not carbon neutral. While the act of generating power itself is fairly efficient and low-emitting, the process of mining the uranium, trucking it somewhere to be refined and pouring the concrete to build the plant creates significant emissions. As uranium is a finite resource, nuclear power is also not “renewable”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Renewables, of course, share similar problems because so many other systems still rely on fossil fuels – wind turbine towers require steel, PV solar cells need resins, everything relies on diesel to transport it – but the total CO2 emissions are minute and the rapid rate of installation means there is a better shot at decarbonising these processes more quickly than with nuclear. With dirt cheap PV solar and rapid improvements being made in hydrogen and battery technology, it will only get easier. What about stabilising the grid? Critics of renewable energy sources say they do not have the capacity to respond to periods of high electricity demand with “dispatchable power” on calm, cloudy days, because they depend on the wind and sun. Nuclear, it is argued, can substitute effectively for the industrial-scale fossil fuel plants now in use that can idle up or down according to demand. The problems with renewables are real but they are becoming less of a roadblock. Plans are in train to make Australia’s power grid more decentralised with a combination of PV solar, offshore wind and onshore wind working to pick up any slack in the system when one goes offline. With the addition of battery technology to store and deliver electricity on demand, the business case for nuclear starts to look pretty thin. The challenge of renewables Thanks to the uptake of PV solar on rooftops it is costing coal and gas power plants more to keep running during periods of low demand and high supply. Operators are faced with a choice: push through or power down. In Australia, operators of ageing coal plants have so far chosen to push through but, as periods of oversupply become more frequent, the costs will make it more attractive to turn off the generator. Firing them back up again is another expensive process – one not shared by renewables, which can be turned on or off quickly. Australia is a long way from hitting peak renewable energy, and there is time to resolve the challenges associated with it long before any nuclear plant would have a chance to make it off a whiteboard. Should trends hold, breaking ground on a new nuclear plant today would mean committing to a white elephant that would be too expensive even to turn on. Any other problems? All of this is without even talking about plans to handle the decommissioning of old nuclear reactors at the end of their lifecycle or the storage of spent nuclear fuel – another expensive, time-consuming process. Australia already struggles with decommissioning and rehabilitating old mine sites, and nuclear power presents new challenges. There are few good facilities anywhere in the world with a geology or a political environment stable enough to store this material long term. During its royal commission, SA considered building its own facility to store waste but failed to get support from the public, thanks in part to the legacy of nuclear weapons testing at Maralinga. The federal government is working on a separate plan to build a storage facility for low-level and intermediate waste at Kimba in SA but the process has proved divisive. Under the proposal, this facility would not be equipped to handle spent nuclear fuel, and to scale it up would mean starting all over again."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-08T15:33:51Z","webTitle":"Ukraine: head of occupied Zaporizhzhia plans referendum on joining Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/08/ukraine-head-of-occupied-zaporizhzhia-plans-referendum-on-joining-russia","fields":{"headline":"Ukraine: head of occupied Zaporizhzhia plans referendum on joining Russia","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Russian-installed head of the occupied part of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region signed a decree on Monday providing for a referendum on joining Russia, in the latest sign that Moscow is moving ahead with its plans to annex seized Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out any peace talks with Russia if the country proceeds with referendums in the occupied areas. Yevgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration in the region, announced the decision to kickstart the process during a pro-Moscow forum entitled “We are with Russia” organised in Melitopol, the largest city controlled by Russia in Zaporizhzhia. “I am signing the order for the central election committee to start the preparations for holding a referendum on the reunification of the Zaporizhzhia region with the Russian Federation,” Balitsky said. Roughly two-thirds of Zaporizhzhia is under Russian occupation, part of a swathe of southern Ukraine that Moscow captured early in the war, including most of the neighbouring Kherson region, where Russian officials have also discussed plans for a referendum. Russia-appointed officials in Zaporizhzhia earlier said that the administration planned to proceed with a referendum even if Russia did not gain control over the entire region. Zaporizhzhia city is still held by Ukraine. Ukraine and its western allies have said that any referendums held under Russian occupation would be illegal and their results fraudulent. In 2014, Moscow and its proxies carried out a widely condemned referendum in Crimea, weeks after its forces seized the peninsula. On Sunday, Zelenskiy said peace talks with Russia would be impossible if the country proceeded with such votes in the occupied areas. “Our country’s position remains what it always has been. We will give up nothing of what is ours,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address to the nation. “If the occupiers proceed along the path of pseudo-referendums they will close for themselves any chance of talks with Ukraine and the free world, which the Russian side will clearly need at some point. Balitsky on Monday gave no further details about the timing of the referendum. Bloomberg, citing two unnamed sources familiar with Moscow’s strategy, earlier reported that the Kremlin was aiming to conduct the referendums by 15 September. Kremlin-appointed officials in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia had already instigated a number of measures aimed at bringing the occupied regions closer to Russia and setting the stage for a future referendum. Earlier this summer, the Russian occupation authorities had started to hand out Russian passports to locals in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Moscow has also forced Ukrainian teachers in occupied territories to follow the Russian curriculum, while “We are with Russia” billboards have sprung up across occupied cities. In a move further signalling Moscow’s intentions, the pro-Russian authorities in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia have set up local “elections committees” that are to be responsible for running the referendums. President Vladimir Putin initially denied that Moscow was seeking to occupy new land when Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. However, he has since made a string of statements in which he sought to justify what he portrayed as Russia’s historic quests to win back Russian lands. Last month, Russia’s minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov, said that Moscow had expanded its war aims in Ukraine, saying they now extended to Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. The Kremlin has also repeatedly hinted that it would recognise the referendums held in the seized Ukrainian territories, which would present the opportunity for Putin to declare the conquered areas as Russian territory. Ukraine, boosted by western weapons, has vowed to mount a major counteroffensive in the country’s south. However, the annexation of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia could complicate Ukraine’s attempts to recapture the areas: if annexed by Moscow, the territories would be protected by the country’s nuclear arsenal. Speaking to the BBC on Monday, the retired British general Sir Richard Barrons said that a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive launched in the southern regions annexed by Moscow would raise the prospect of Russia using “small nuclear weapons”. “Ukraine would now be pushing into territory that Russia has declared as Russia, and at that point doctrinally and probably politically, Russia will start to reach for its tactical, its small nuclear weapons,” Barrons said, adding that those weapons would have a radius of “roughly two miles”. “We need to think through that and not regard it as some sort of terrible surprise that is completely unthinkable,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/may/05/japanese-premier-warns-of-ukraine-style-invasion-by-autocratic-powers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-05T16:46:57Z","webTitle":"Japanese premier warns of Ukraine-style invasion by ‘autocratic powers’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/japanese-premier-warns-of-ukraine-style-invasion-by-autocratic-powers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/may/05/japanese-premier-warns-of-ukraine-style-invasion-by-autocratic-powers","fields":{"headline":"Japanese premier warns of Ukraine-style invasion by ‘autocratic powers’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Boris Johnson and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida have warned that the invasion of Ukraine could be replicated in east Asia if democratic powers do not stand up to autocratic ones. “Ukraine may be east Asia tomorrow,” Kishida said on Thursday during a visit to London, as he called for Indo-Pacific leaders to recognise that the invasion of Ukraine was not just a European problem. Asked about the implications for Taiwan, he said: “We must collaborate with our allies and like-minded countries, and never tolerate a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by the use of force in the Indo-Pacific, especially in east Asia.” He added: “Russia’s egregious aggression against Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, which prohibits the use of force against a nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Earlier, Johnson said: “We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region. “And there is direct read across from the actions of autocratic, coercive powers in Europe, to what may happen in east Asia.” The two countries have signed a mutual access agreement for their two forces, in part dedicated to keep the seas free and open. Kishida also announced new sanctions, including an asset freeze on 140 Russian individuals and the expansion of an export ban to include Russian military firms. The package was announced the day after Russia imposed asset bans and travel freezes on 60 Japanese officials, including Japanese cabinet members and the prime minister himself. Kishida had described the Russian action as completely unacceptable. Kishida’s ruling Liberal Democratic party has recently proposed a substantial increase in defence spending – possibly to an amount on a par with 2% of gross domestic product, up from the current 1% – and the development of the capacity to attack missile-launching sites in an enemy’s territory. He said that, in the wake of the Russian invasion, he was trying to instil a crisis mentality in the Japanese people. Facing elections in July and rising energy prices that are squeezing voters’ budgets, Kishida said nuclear power would form a bigger part of the country’s future energy policy mix. He said Japan would address the “vulnerability of our own energy self-sufficiency” by broadening where it buys energy from, promoting renewables and using nuclear power to diversify its sources of generation. Japan has become more reliant on Russian gas since shutting down nuclear reactors after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, in which an earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown, devastating its north-eastern region. The country is reluctant to impose a total ban on Russian oil imports. Kishida’s visit to London was the conclusion of a major trip that saw him visit Asean members Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Japan is chair of the G7 next year and Kishida is trying to rally east Asia into accepting that Russia’s actions, born of authoritarianism, represent a threat to stability, and that, by extension, the region may have to resist China. Many countries in the region would prefer not to take sides in a contest between China and the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-21T11:10:48Z","webTitle":"‘There’s a lot of posturing’: Europe’s nuclear divide grows as one plant opens and three close","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/21/europe-nuclear-divide-grows-one-plant-opens-three-close-finland-germany","fields":{"headline":"‘There’s a lot of posturing’: Europe’s nuclear divide grows as one plant opens and three close","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When Europe’s first new nuclear reactor in 16 years came online in Finland, it was hailed by its operator as a “significant addition to clean domestic production” that would “play an important role in the green transition”. The opening last Sunday of the long-delayed Olkiluoto 3 plant, Europe’s largest, means about 40% of Finland’s electricity demand will soon be met by nuclear power, which the government says will boost energy security and help it achieve its carbon neutrality targets. Across the Baltic Sea and just hours before the Finnish plant came on stream, Germany was finally pulling the plug on its last three nuclear power plants, shutting down the steaming towers of Isar II, Emsland and Neckarwestheim II reactors late on Saturday. The environmental group Greenpeace, at the heart of Germany’s long-lived and powerful anti-nuclear movement, organised a party at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. “Finally, nuclear energy belongs to history,” it proclaimed. There are few clearer illustrations of Europe’s nuclear divide. One faction, led by Germany, argues that the costs are too high and the risks – from reactor accidents and toxic waste – are, as the Green environment minister, Steffi Lemke, put it, “ultimately unmanageable”. Another, headed by France, argues equally forcefully that nuclear power is a reliable, low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for electricity, and that phasing it out as Europe tries to meet vital green targets is ecologically damaging and economically senseless. The debate is not new. But with a third of the bloc’s nuclear reactors nearing the end of their original lifespan by 2025, and a legally binding aim of cutting net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030, it is becoming increasingly intense. The energy shock that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, which brought an end to cheap gas imports and led Germany to briefly delay closing its last nuclear plants, has only entrenched the divisions. “There’s a lot of posturing,” the centrist MEP Pascal Canfin, who chairs the European parliament’s environment committee, said. “Different member states have made very different choices and have very different positions – and interests. “There’s scope for convergence and compromise. But given the sheer quantity of additional electricity we will need, both sides have to recognise we need every available solution … We have to take the politics and ideology out of this.” According to Eurostat, 25.4% of the EU’s electricity was nuclear generated in 2021, with 100-odd reactors in 13 member states. France, which has 56 operable nuclear reactors, accounting for just over half of that total. The divide across the bloc, though, is stark. If France has the highest share of nuclear in its electricity mix (almost 70%), followed by Slovakia (52.4%) and Belgium (50.6%), others hardly touch it. The Netherlands stands at barely 3%. Germany’s opposition to nuclear goes back a long way; it was the main issue behind the launch of the country’s Green movement. Major accidents at Three Mile Island, Chornobyl and Fukushima reinforced an essentially ideological conviction. Advocates of its “Energiewende” green transition plan note that the 46% share of its electricity generated by renewables is far greater than the share that was produced by nuclear when its phase-out was first announced in 1998. While its plan, aimed at winning long-term public and industry support, will increase fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions in the short term (coal is due to be phased out by 2038 or earlier), Germany argues it will also stimulate renewables growth. Immediate energy supply concerns meant public opinion swung against the shutdown last weekend, but polls before the war in Ukraine showed broad support for the principle. Other countries hold similar views. Several have already phased out nuclear, or plan to do so. Italy shut all its plants in 1990, after a 1987 referendum (in a 2011 plebiscite, held weeks after the Fukushima disaster, 94% of voters rejected a government plan to reintroduce nuclear power). Belgium was planning to close the last of its seven reactors by 2025, but recently extended the life of the two newest for a further decade, saying they were “critical to our energy security”. Spain aims to phase out its five active plants by 2035. Other opponents include Portugal, Denmark and Austria – which, along with Luxembourg, is suing the European Commission for classing nuclear energy as a “bridge technology” on the path to net zero, and thus as a “green” investment. In the French-led pro-nuclear camp, meanwhile, are Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia – which this year launched an alliance to boost nuclear cooperation within the bloc. Far from phasing out nuclear, Romania has doubled production in the last 15 years; Hungary and the Czech Republic have increased theirs by a fifth. Sweden is drafting a law to allow it to build more, while France aims to extend its plants’ life to 50 years and open at least six new ones by 2035. “Certain countries have made the extreme choice of turning their back on nuclear energy,” President Emmanuel Macron said when unveiling his plans in February. “Not France.” The country launched its nuclear programme after the 1973 oil crisis; a poll last year showed nearly 80% of voters support it, up 20 points from 2016. The nuclear standoff – at its most tense between France and Germany – has the potential to disrupt a range of vital EU projects, from changes to the bloc’s electricity market to the Green Deal programme supporting industry’s transition to net zero. For example, Paris and its central European allies have raged against a lack of support from Berlin for their efforts to have nuclear-derived hydrogen classified as “green” in EU legislation (so that it counts towards renewable energy targets). For Canfin, compromise will have to come through a general acceptance that renewable energy is “green” while nuclear energy is “low-carbon” – not fully green, because of its cost and risks, but also not “fossil”. “Text by text, we have to take the drama out of the question,” he said. “Behind the political slogans, there is starting to be convergence around the realities.” France and the “pro” camp now accept that only renewables are capable of boosting low-carbon electricity production short-term, Canfin said, while Germany is “evolving” to view nuclear as “part of the solution, not part of the problem”. A generational shift in Europe’s green movement – now driven more by concern about the climate crisis than, as was once the case, opposition to nuclear – should help, he said, with the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg criticising Germany’s shutdown as “a mistake”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-29T06:30:22Z","webTitle":"UK to lift import restrictions on food from Fukushima","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/29/uk-to-lift-import-restrictions-on-food-from-fukushima","fields":{"headline":"UK to lift import restrictions on food from Fukushima","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Food from Fukushima will be freely available in the UK from Wednesday, weeks after Boris Johnson snacked on popcorn from the Japanese prefecture hit by a triple nuclear meltdown in March 2011. Britain restricted Fukushima imports after the disaster, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl, but has gradually lifted them, even as other countries limit or ban produce from the region. Johnson confirmed that the remaining restrictions would end on Wednesday in a meeting the previous day with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on the fringes of the G7 summit in Germany. Johnson told Kishida that UK-Japan relations were going from “strength to strength”. “Two great island democracies, united in our values, determined to stand up together against autocracies and the dangers of drifting backwards in the world, but also wanting to do more together on technology, on security, on trade, and of course I’m delighted that tomorrow – finally – we are able to have Fukushima-origin products all over the shops in the UK,” he said. The supermarket chains Tesco and Waitrose have said they have no immediate plans to sell Fukushima produce. Instead, many of the items will be available at Japanese restaurants and specialist Japanese stores in England, Scotland and Wales. The restrictions will remain in place in Northern Ireland, which is subject to European Union rules on food and drink from Fukushima and other prefectures affected by the accident 11 years ago. The scrapping of the restrictions was made possible after the UK Food Standards Agency dropped a limit of 100 becquerels – a measure of radioactivity – per kilogram contained in Japanese food. “Our risk assessment shows that removing the 100 becquerels per kilogram (Bq/kg) maximum level of radiocaesium for food imported from Japan to the UK would result in a negligible increase in dose and any associated risk to UK consumers,” the FSA said in a report late last year. The Fukushima prefectural government says that, post-disaster, its food safety standards are among the most stringent in the world. The government-set upper limit for radioactive caesium in ordinary foodstuffs, such as meat and vegetables, is 100 becquerels per kilogram, compared with 1,250Bq/kg in the EU and 1,200Bq/kg in the US. The lifting of restrictions will affect 23 food products, such as mushrooms, which previously needed to carry proof that they had been tested for radioactive material, according to Nikkei Asia. The Japanese government said it “welcomes the fact that the UK government reached this decision based on scientific evidence, as it will support the reconstruction of the affected areas”. It added that it would “continue to work towards the early lifting of the remaining import restrictions in the EU and other countries and regions”. China, Russia, South Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan and several other countries still impose import restrictions. Johnson first sampled Fukushima produce in 2017 when, as foreign secretary, he swigged a can of peach juice given to him by his Japanese counterpart, Taro Kono, declaring it “Yum”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-03T15:15:54Z","webTitle":"Poor households face having to help foot bill for building Sizewell C","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/03/poor-households-face-having-to-help-foot-bill-for-building-sizewell-c","fields":{"headline":"Poor households face having to help foot bill for building Sizewell C","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The UK government has been criticised for exposing low-income households to the cost of building the Sizewell C nuclear power plant while letting factories “off the hook” as a crucial planning decision is due this week. If given the green light, the government hopes to use a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model to finance the project, which is being proposed by the French energy firm EDF. RAB reduces the risk to investors, who will receive regular payments before the project begins generating power. However, it also means customers pay for the construction costs through higher energy bills. A consultation on using the RAB model is due to close next month and shows operators in energy-intensive industries would be exempt but households receiving universal credit would have to pay. In the consultation, officials said the exemption for electricity-intensive users – such as factories – would avoid the risk of putting them at a “significant competitive disadvantage” when operating in international markets as they may have to add the costs to the price of their products. MPs had suggested electricity suppliers should be prevented from recovering the costs of their RAB payment obligations from consumers who are on universal credit. However, officials rejected this idea, saying such a measure could “disincentivise suppliers from engaging in commercially beneficial practices” such as payment plans and loyalty benefits to attract customers. They also argued other vulnerable consumers not claiming universal credit could also be affected by the move. The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said: “When energy bills are skyrocketing right in the middle of a cost of living scandal, the last thing that people can afford is the ballooning cost of embryonic nuclear white elephants like Sizewell C. “Not only are these projects extremely expensive to build in the first place, with Hinkley Point C now at £26bn without having generated a single watt of energy, the RAB business model passes that enormous upfront cost directly on to the consumer. While giant companies are spared with generous exemptions, the very worst-off in society will be footing the bill. Nuclear is too slow, too expensive and the wrong priority.” The 3.2 gigawatt plant at Sizewell in Suffolk could be capable of generating electricity for 6m homes and is part of a project to approve a nuclear reactor each year by 2030. Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “Taxes of any kind hit the poorest hardest and this nuclear tax is no exception. Multimillion-pound businesses will be let off the hook if they use a lot of energy but a family on universal credit struggling to afford its heating bills will have to cough up to pay for an unwanted nuclear power station.” The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said the government considerd it very important to support low-income households but believed that “support for vulnerable groups would be best tackled holistically” by looking at the factors driving up energy bills. BEIS has estimated that Sizewell C would add an extra £1 a month to household bills to aid construction costs. But research by the University of Greenwich business school seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12. In January, the government earmarked £100m to advance Sizewell C to the next stage of negotiations, and help the project attract further private investment. In May, it pushed back the deadline for a decision on a “development consent order” for Sizewell C from 25 May to 8 July. Ministers have tasked Barclays to lead a search for investors to back the project alongside the government and EDF, which each plan to take a 20% stake. That structure would force out CGN, the state-backed Chineses nuclear specialist that has a 20% stake in Sizewell C venture. According to the Mail on Sunday, the British Gas owner, Centrica, is considering taking a stake. CGN has partnered with EDF on the Hinkley Point C in Somerset – which has been delayed and is over budget – but ministers want to avoid further Chinese involvement amid worsening relations between the UK and China."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-09T06:30:01Z","webTitle":"Stalking the Atomic City by Markiyan Kamysh review – in search of meaning in Chornobyl’s forbidden wasteland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2022/jul/09/stalking-the-atomic-city-markiyan-kamysh-ukrainian-nuclear-chornobyl","fields":{"headline":"Stalking the Atomic City by Markiyan Kamysh review – in search of meaning in Chornobyl’s forbidden wasteland","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The area around Chornobyl was once meant to be a paradise. “They even planned to build a promenade with bridges, street lights and musical entertainment. They already started to lay the foundation of new power plant units, the apotheosis of joy and happiness looming on the horizon,” writes Markiyan Kamysh. “Until,” he says, with characteristic directness, “things got fucked and reactor number 4 blew the hell up.” Kamysh was born in 1988, two years after that calamity, the son of a nuclear physicist who had been brought in to work as a liquidator after the meltdown. The families of liquidators were given social benefits, and cheaper food – but this association was also a source of radioactive stigma, not to mention ill health. Kamysh’s father died in 2003. A few years later Kamysh dropped out of university in Kyiv to dedicate himself to literature and the exploration of the exclusion zone around Chornobyl – as well as the disaster’s fallout in his own psyche. He also started leading other people into the forbidden territory around the reactor, evading the police and ducking under wire fences, acting like a real-life version of the guides who take people to a forbidden area in Andrei Tarkovsky’s mysterious sci-fi film Stalker. Kamysh undertook those trips for money, but in this account, which he wrote between 2012 and 2014, he also describes the fallout zone as somewhere he can “relax”. He goes there to drink with friends, to celebrate New Year’s Eve, to wander alone among the ruins. He brings back descriptions of empty streets, the “jungles” that are spreading across the landscape, the cries of wolves in the night. Kamysh describes himself as a “degenerate”. On his trips into the zone he drinks and destroys. He makes fires with old physics textbooks and burns floorboards for heating. He smashes windows. He has a terrifying disregard for his own safety. He even jokes about meeting other stalkers in cancer wards in 20 years’ time. He can be brutally funny (credit for this must go partly to translators Hanna Leliv and Reilly Costigan-Humes), but he also demands serious attention. To those asking if he’s afraid of radiation, he says: “No. It’s only here that life won’t slip by for me, for I’m living it in the most exotic place on Earth.” By the time we get to that explanation, late on in this remarkable book, Kamysh has made us understand why he thinks the zone around Chornobyl is so special, why – because of its desolate serenity, and the freedom it grants from the strictures of normal life – it may even be worth dying for. No mean feat. It’s all the more unsettling to read about this bargain with death now that invading Russian troops have also blundered into his poisoned paradise. At least Kamysh had a choice, strange as it may seem. • Stalking the Atomic City: Life Among the Decadent and Depraved of Chornobyl by Markiyan Kamysh is published by Pushkin Press (£12.99).

The company accompanied its move with feelgood boasts about how it expected to pay £600m under Rishi Sunak’s three-year “energy profits levy” on North Sea oil and gas production. Four months later, there is less bashfulness. Earnings will be “towards the top end of the range” of analysts’ expectations, Thursday’s trading update said, and shareholders can have a much more significant distribution – a buyback of 5% of the share capital, which will cost roughly £250m. The shares rose 6%. Centrica, it seems, will live with the flak – and since its largesse is nothing compared with the oil majors’, you can understand the thinking. But Sunak, let’s hope, read Centrica’s update in detail. The North Sea fields and energy traders are still doing nicely (less so British Gas during warm weather) but an unspecified chunk of the forecast-beating returns are coming from electricity generation. That refers to Centrica’s 20% holding in the UK’s nuclear power stations, a part of the energy industry untouched by the North Sea-only windfall tax. Nuclear, though, is every bit as much of a cash cow currently. Its operating costs haven’t budged but, since the price of electricity is tied to the price of gas, revenues will be through the roof. The government has danced ineffectually around the generation sector for months, pondering price caps and voluntary negotiations to switch projects on to new-era “contracts for difference”, but no solution has yet appeared. It’s time to make a decision. If all the technocratic solutions are deemed to be too fiddly, then it has to be windfall levy. With nuclear, the case is particularly strong because there is no question of creating disincentives to future investment (the grumble from renewables developers). Any future nuclear plant, such as Sizewell C, would be funded by a bespoke financing and pricing model. Centrica, note, will have taken its share buyback decision in full knowledge that some form of levy is likely on nuclear’s windfall returns. And it still thinks it can afford £250m. Sunak should take the hint. Wolfson is right about foreign workers The last time Simon Wolfson, the chief executive of Next, pleaded for the government to allow more foreign workers into the UK, he received a pile of abuse from a prime minister (Boris Johnson) who hadn’t bothered to understand his proposal. The leave-supporting Wolfson wasn’t – and still isn’t – advocating uncontrolled immigration. Rather, he wants a demand-led system that would incentivise UK businesses to hire local workers. Overseas recruits would have to be paid the same as local counterparts, and the employer would pay a 10% surcharge to the Treasury on the wages of foreign-hired labour. “It would automatically mean that businesses never bought someone into the company from outside if they could find someone in the UK,” he said in a BBC interview released on Thursday. “But if they genuinely can’t, they’ll pay the premium.” Last time around, Johnson launched a kneejerk Brexit refrain about British business being addicted to cheap foreign labour, which completely missed the point. A question now, then, is whether the latest inhabitants of Downing Street will engage with the real issue: the lack of flexibility in the UK’s labour market that plainly comes at a cost to growth. Under Liz Truss, there were nods of recognition. The deregulation part of her short-lived agenda contained a push to reform the shortage occupations list to cover, for instance, seasonal agricultural workers and broadband engineers. Where does Sunak stand? We’ll find out (possibly) in next week’s autumn statement, but business lobbyists suspect he’ll be in the Johnson camp. They anticipate no pro-business measures on immigration. If so, it will be another missed opportunity. Wolfson is right that it’s time to move on from tired referendum-era arguments. Hospitals, pubs, restaurants and many other sectors are crying out for a pragmatic approach. His proposal offers a sensible way forward.

The ruling by Tokyo district court centred on whether senior Tepco management could have predicted a serious nuclear accident striking the facility after a powerful tsunami. Four defendants, including Tepco’s president at the time of the disaster, Masataka Shimizu, were ordered to pay the sum, while a fifth was not found liable for damages, according to the Kyodo news agency. The plant in Fukushima, 150 miles north of Tokyo, experienced meltdowns in three of its six reactors after it was struck by a tsunami on 11 March 2011, flooding the backup generators. The tsunami, which was triggered by a magnitude-9 earthquake, killed more than 18,000 people along Japan’s north-east coast. The meltdowns at Fukushima, the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chornobyl 25 years earlier, caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby – some of who have only recently been given permission to return to their homes. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2012 by 48 Tepco shareholders, is the first to find company executives liable for damages connected to the Fukushima disaster, which shook Japan’s faith in nuclear energy and resulted in widespread closures of atomic power plants. The plaintiffs had sought a record ¥22tn in damages. The executives found liable are unlikely to have the capacity to pay the full amount, according to media reports, but will be expected to pay as much as their assets allow. Tepco did not comment on the ruling, saying it would not respond to individual lawsuits, according to Kyodo. The court said the company’s countermeasures against tsunami “fundamentally lacked safety awareness and a sense of responsibility”. Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck in March 2011, and that it had done everything possible to protect the plant. But an internal company document revealed in 2015 that it had been aware of the need to improve the facility’s defences against tsunami more than two years before the disaster, but had failed to take action. Plaintiffs also cited a government report that showed Tepco had predicted in June 2008 that the Fukushima plant could be hit by tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres in height after a major offshore earthquake. The court said the government’s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures.

Ministers will decide in July whether to approve the development of the Suffolk power station proposed by the French developer EDF. The business department has estimated that the government-backed scheme will add an extra £1 a month to household bills to aid construction costs. But research by the University of Greenwich Business School seen by the Guardian shows the average monthly cost could reach £2.12, or £25.40 a year. At its costliest point, the build could cost taxpayers nearly £4 a month. That represents the study’s gloomiest forecast, which predicts construction would take 17 years and cost £43.8bn. The project had been expected to cost £20bn and take 10-12 years to build. Stephen Thomas, a professor at Greenwich Business School, said the average forecast put the cost at £35bn over 15 years, or £2.3bn a year. The figures could further inflame the debate over the cost and time of building power stations after Boris Johnson last month set a target of building a new nuclear station every year. EDF admitted last week that Hinkley Point C, the power station it is developing in Somerset, would cost an extra £3bn, taking it to up to £26bn. The already delayed project will take an extra year, and is expected to begin generating electricity in June 2027. EDF had originally planned for it be operational by Christmas 2017. The French firm said consumers would not be hit by the extra costs at Hinkley Point C, which will be taken on by EDF and China’s CGN, its junior partner in the project. However, at Sizewell C the government has already committed £100m to the project and plans to use a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model. RAB funding gives investors a set return during the construction phase of a project, reducing their risk and making an asset more attractive to outside investors. However, it shifts the risk of delays and extra costs on to taxpayers. The government argues that the RAB model could reduce the project cost of a nuclear power station by more than £30bn over its 60-year lifespan. The model was used in the construction of Heathrow Terminal 5 and the Thames Tideway super-sewer. A final decision on plans for Sizewell C was recently pushed back from 25 May to 8 July. The site is located north of EDF’s existing Sizewell B plant. Campaigners argue that the development would be costly and threatens the local environment. The prospect of extra costs comes as consumers face soaring bills amid the energy crisis. The government has been urged to intervene with annual bills forecast to balloon to nearly £3,000 from October. Johnson has thrown his weight behind nuclear power as a green option to boost Britain’s energy security in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and as he targets net zero emissions by 2050. Thomas said: “It may not seem a huge amount extra on bills but several of these projects will overlap, meaning consumers paying even more for a long time. If costs are even higher than expected, it could become a real burden.” A spokesperson for Sizewell C said: “The RAB model is a tried and tested financing arrangement, which has already been used to raise funds for more than £160bn of UK infrastructure. Applied to Sizewell C, it will bring the cost of finance down and deliver significant savings to consumers.” A government spokesperson said: “We firmly stand by our assessment that a large-scale project funded under our Nuclear Act would add at most a few pounds a year to typical household energy bills during the early stages of construction, and on average about £1 a month during the full construction phase of the project.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"Lord Deben backs Labour’s plan to halt new North Sea oil and gas drilling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/06/lord-deben-backs-labours-plan-to-halt-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-drilling","fields":{"headline":"Lord Deben backs Labour’s plan to halt new North Sea oil and gas drilling","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UK’s most senior climate adviser has strongly endorsed Labour’s vow to halt new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, and slammed the government for failing to show leadership on the issue. John Gummer, who as Lord Deben chairs the statutory committee on climate change, told the Guardian he approved of Labour’s commitment. “I welcome this policy, I am absolutely in favour and it is the right thing to do,” he said. “I’m sorry this is not a common view to all parties,” he added. Gummer, a former Conservative environment secretary in the 1990s, blasted ministers who have attacked Labour’s proposals. He pointed out that the government’s support for new oil and gas exploration ran counter to its stance at international climate negotiations, now taking place in Bonn. “I don’t understand how the government can ask other people not to produce more oil [while supporting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea]. That’s exactly what they are doing now – asking other people not to do what they’re doing,” he said. Labour has come under fire over its stance on the North Sea, from the government as well as its own supporters. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, used social media to lambast Keir Starmer, charging him with committing to higher energy bills. The GMB union also attacked Starmer after he last week reaffirmed a commitment made earlier this year to halt the drilling of new oil and gas wells in the North Sea. Gary Smith, leader of the GMB Union, claimed it was “naive” and would cost jobs. But Starmer has strongly defended his decision, which along with commitments to green jobs, new nuclear power and renewable energy will form the centrepiece of a policy statement to be made in Scotland later this month. Gummer told the Guardian that leaders across the political spectrum should follow Labour’s lead. “This should be the common view of all parties,” he said. He said it was “nonsense” to claim that new oil and gas fields would reduce energy bills. “These are new oilfields that will not come on stream for another 10 or 20 years. And when they do, the oil and gas will be sold to the highest bidder. So it will not reduce prices in the UK. The only way you could make them reduce bills here would be to nationalise them.” He said fears over jobs at risk in the North Sea were also unfounded. He said the UK should continue to produce gas from existing fields in the short term, but future jobs would be in green industries. “I’m in favour of producing more gas now, we need it owing to what Putin has done, but we are not talking about that – we are talking about new oilfields that would not come on stream for many years,” he said. “There are vast numbers of jobs to be had in offshore and onshore wind, in solar PV, which are all much cheaper than using oil. The jobs are all there in green industries – these are new jobs, the oil jobs are old jobs. Trade unions should be supporting new job creation.” Gummer said he also favoured building new nuclear power stations, which Starmer has also pledged to support. Before his ennoblement as Lord Deben, Gummer was a long-serving Conservative MP and former environment secretary and minister, under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. He is due to leave his CCC post later this month, and a successor has not yet been named. International negotiations are taking place in Bonn this week and next over how to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. But the government would not confirm to the Guardian whether any ministers will attend. Gummer said a halt to new oil and gas exploration was essential to keep the global climate livable. “Climate change will mean we will not be able to live as we do now, in the very near future. It’s urgent, it has to be dealt with, and we cannot ignore it,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “In line with our net zero 2050 commitment, we will not shy away from awarding new licences where they are justified, and where they can benefit Britain. While our plans to power up Britain include significant investment in new renewable and nuclear projects, the transition to non-fossil forms of energy cannot happen overnight and even when we’re net zero, we will still need some oil and gas, as recognised by the independent CCC.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/mar/28/actu-digs-in-on-nuclear-free-policy-in-headache-for-labor-over-aukus-subs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-28T07:39:22Z","webTitle":"ACTU digs in on nuclear-free policy in headache for Labor over Aukus subs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/28/actu-digs-in-on-nuclear-free-policy-in-headache-for-labor-over-aukus-subs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/mar/28/actu-digs-in-on-nuclear-free-policy-in-headache-for-labor-over-aukus-subs","fields":{"headline":"ACTU digs in on nuclear-free policy in headache for Labor over Aukus subs","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Australian unions have restated their position in favour of a “nuclear-free defence policy”, creating a headache for the Albanese government over the $368bn Aukus nuclear submarine acquisition. The position, restated by Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O’Neil, on Tuesday, was seized on by the Coalition, which claimed it sent a “confusing signal” for Labor and its industrial wing to be divided on nuclear submarines. Since the deal was announced earlier in March, the Albanese government has faced criticism from former prime ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull, and former Labor ministers Doug Cameron, Gareth Evans, Kim Carr and Bob Carr. The Labor caucus has united behind the government’s position, with only MP Josh Wilson expressing public concerns, despite many unions opposing the nuclear submarine acquisition. Asked if she would have preferred the purchase of conventional submarines, O’Neil told the National Press Club that the ACTU had “a longstanding policy of opposition to nuclear power, nuclear waste and proliferation”. “We also have a longstanding policy position that supports a nuclear-free defence policy. “These are not positions that have been developed in the last weeks and months. They are decades long and our position hasn’t changed.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup O’Neil said although the Aukus purchase of Virginia class and SSN Aukus class submarines was a “new announcement”, the ACTU’s had been “clear about these issues”. “The detail of the announcement that’s been made is something that we will bring our affiliates together to discuss over the coming months and we will want more detail from the government as well.” O’Neil’s comments suggest the ACTU could revisit its policy rather than seek to persuade Labor to abandon the nuclear submarine acquisition. The shadow defence minister, Andrew Hastie, said the Coalition had offered bipartisan defence on Aukus “because we know that it is a multigenerational, nation-building project that demands support from governments around the nation, industry and the private sector”. “For Labor and its industrial wing to be divided on nuclear submarines sends a confusing signal to the Australian people,” he said in a statement. “It’s particularly damaging when the government has clearly articulated our strategic need for submarines and has promised the creation of 20,000 local jobs.” Hastie called on the ACTU to “adapt, as our strategic circumstances now demand”. “The ACTU should drop its archaic last-century stance on nuclear power, and work on growing Australian industry in the national interest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T14:21:30Z","webTitle":"Russia tightens grip on Bakhmut in face of Ukraine counterattacks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/22/russia-tightens-grip-on-bakhmut-in-face-of-ukraine-counterattacks","fields":{"headline":"Russia tightens grip on Bakhmut in face of Ukraine counterattacks","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Russia appeared close to taking control of Bakhmut on Monday, although Ukraine said it continued to fight on in the south-west fringes of the city largely devastated by an intense year of deadly fighting. Hanna Mailar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, said Ukraine still controlled “certain facilities” in the Litak district, but reports said the defenders had lost control of the last of the remaining high-rises in the eastern Ukrainian city. Ukraine has switched its primary focus to engaging in limited counterattacks on the higher ground to the immediate north-west and south of the ruined city, which could be used to threaten the Russian attackers below. “The offensive potential of the enemy has been significantly reduced, huge losses have been inflicted on the enemy” Mailar said. She added: “We have gained time for certain actions, which will be discussed later.” Bakhmut was first shelled in May 2022 and Russian forces consistently targeted the mining city that had a pre-war population of about 70,000. Although not considered of particular strategic value, the city has acquired a high symbolic value for both sides in the conflict. The two sides fought building by building in the most intense fighting seen in Europe since the end of the second world war, with Russia taking a year to advance about 24km on the Bakhmut sector of the eastern Donbas, a front that has otherwise remained relatively static since last autumn. The effort was led by the Russian mercenary Wagner group, using seasoned veterans to command a large number of former prisoners. But experts question whether, as the battle draws to an end, Wagner can continue to fight further. The Institute of the Study of War said on Sunday night it believed Wagner’s offensive was likely to be at its culmination point and that “it is unlikely that Wagner will continue fighting beyond Bakhmut at its current depleted state”. Joe Biden, the US president, said at the G7 summit in Japan that Russia had suffered 100,000 casualties, killed and wounded, in fighting for the city, higher than previous Ukrainian estimates of 70,000. Ukraine does not release casualty figures but it is believed to have lost tens of thousands in the protracted struggle. Wagner’s chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin, declared on Saturday that Bakhmut had fallen, filming himself at the city’s battered railway station a few kilometres behind the frontline. Other video footage showed Russian troops waving flags at the western edge of the city, although not in the Litak district still being fought over. At that point, Prigozhin announced Wagner forces would withdraw from the city by Thursday, leaving its defence to regular Russian troops, although it was unclear whether that was a firm declaration of intent, or a feint designed to lure Ukrainian forces back into attacking the city. Attacking forces are often considered at their most vulnerable when an advance culminates, usually due to combat exhaustion, and Ukraine has been hinting that it hopes to surround the invaders in the city by attacking to the north and south. But the Ukrainian counterattacks remain relatively limited so far, and the expectation is that Kyiv will soon launch a more significant assault as the weather improves, using about 12 brigades-worth of troops, many of which have been equipped with western tanks, fighting vehicles and artillery. Three civilians were killed and 14 injured across Ukraine in overnight shelling while the country’s air force said it had shot down four cruise missiles and 20 drones. But the air force spokesperson Yuri Inhat said Ukraine did not “have enough means” – air defences – to deal with high-speed ballistic missiles across the country. Ukraine said it had reconnected the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to its external power supply after a brief outage that had left it reliant on emergency generators. Backup diesel generators were in use for a time at the site, to ensure nuclear fuel was kept cool and prevent a potential disaster. It is the seventh time during the war that the nuclear power plant, Europe’s biggest, has had to switch to backup power. Russian forces seized the plant early in the war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/23/nuclear-energy-push-is-not-powered-by-sense","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T17:50:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear energy push is not powered by sense | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/23/nuclear-energy-push-is-not-powered-by-sense","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/23/nuclear-energy-push-is-not-powered-by-sense","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear energy push is not powered by sense","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"There is much about this government’s – and, to its shame, Labour’s – newfound love affair with nuclear power that makes no sense (Johnson announces aim for UK to get 25% of electricity from nuclear power, 21 March). First, you cannot just turn off a nuclear power station. If we have 25% of our electricity generated by nuclear, then on days when all our needs can be met by renewables we will have to turn off 25% of our much cheaper renewable feed while using expensive, taxpayer-subsidised nuclear generation. Second, we have no way of dealing with the mountains of dangerous high-level and intermediate-level waste that has been accruing since the 1950s. To generate more is sheer madness. Third, nuclear power stations are vulnerable to the elements and to hostile attack – cyber, terrorist, state actors etc. Recent events in the Ukraine make this very real. Fourth, the old argument about what we do when the wind isn’t blowing and the skies are overcast over the whole of the UK, which doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny now, falls away completely if we were to invest just a small amount of the taxpayer money that will go to the nuclear industry into research and development of electricity storage. Finally, given the nuclear industry’s track record of bringing in plants well over budget, decades late, the proposed programme is not going to be realised until 2060 at the earliest. Why on earth are we contemplating it? John French Brockweir, Gloucestershire • Your report states that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”. The same justification was used in 2006, when the Labour government first committed to further nuclear power stations. Based on the official forecasts issued in 2006, we should by now be consuming at least 15% more electricity than we were then. But we are not. UK electricity consumption has in practice gone down by more than 15% since 2006. In the interim, no new nuclear power stations have been added to the system. It hasn’t collapsed, and is far less carbon-intensive. Surely we aren’t getting fooled again by the same spurious rhetoric about endless consumption growth? In that immortal phrase of the 1970s: “Save it. You know it makes sense.” Andrew Warren Chairman, British Energy Efficiency Federation • The dash to fossil fuels is not the environmental disaster set out by António Guterres (Ukraine war threatens global heating goals, warns UN chief, 21 March). It is, at worst, the replacement of existing hydrocarbons purchased from Russia. In the longer term, it is clear that alternative renewable energy sources will displace fossil fuels and most countries will wish to do this as quickly as possible. The government’s desire, supported by Labour, for increased nuclear power generation is bizarre. A wind turbine capable of producing 15MW can be installed offshore for £10m. Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and produce 3.2GW of electricity – this does not include decommissioning costs. To generate 3.2GW would need 214 turbines costing £3.2bn, albeit some money would need to be spent on storage capacity. The government plans to invest £1.7bn in Sizewell C. How is spending more than five times as much on a controversial power source that takes 10 years to build a good idea?

The German government has announced a further €2.7bn of military aid to Ukraine, its biggest such package since the Russian invasion. Russian missiles struck the home town of Ukraine’s Eurovision entry during the song contest. Ternopil, the university home town of electronic music duo Tvorchi, was among the places targeted, according to Dame Melinda Simmons, the British ambassador to Ukraine. Local authorities said the strike had hit warehouses owned by commercial enterprises and a religious organisation, injuring two people. The Russian news outlet Kommersant reported that two Russian fighter jets and two military helicopters had been shot down on Saturday close to the Ukrainian border. Kommersant said on its website that the Su-34 fighter-bomber, Su-35 fighter and two Mi-8 helicopters had made up a raiding party, and had been “shot down almost simultaneously” in an ambush in the Bryansk region, adjoining north-east Ukraine. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will push other global leaders to pledge more support for Ukraine when he attends international summits next week, according to his office. Sunak will travel to Iceland on Tuesday to meet other European leaders attending a Council of Europe summit. South Africa’s presidential security adviser said the country was “actively non-aligned” in Russia’s war against Ukraine, after US allegations it had supplied weapons to Moscow led to a diplomatic crisis. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had spoken to the South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and urged him to help implement Kyiv’s peace plan to end the war. Ukrainian forces have regained at least a kilometre of territory in Bakhmut amid a Russian withdrawal that reflects Moscow’s “severe shortage of credible combat units”, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in an intelligence briefing. It said elements of a Russian brigade withdrew “in bad order” from their positions on the southern flank of the eastern Ukrainian city, the scene of the war’s longest battle. Japan has expressed concern about Russian and Chinese military cooperation in Asia and believes the two countries are strengthening their joint exercises. Foreign minister Yoshimasa Hayashi said the security situation in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region was indivisible since the war in Ukraine started and that Russia’s invasion had “shaken the very foundation of the international order”. Russian attacks injured three people in the southern Ukrainian city of Mykolaiv, the city’s mayor said. The strikes occurred early on Saturday, Oleksandr Sienkevych said on his Telegram channel. Russian forces targeted a factory, also damaging nearby residential buildings, causing fires in three apartments and damaging an educational institution, he said. A 15-year-old girl was among two people killed while 10 more were injured in a Russian shelling attack, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. The eastern city of Kostyantynivka was targeted by Smerch rocket launchers. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Ukrainian forces injured six children and a Russian parliamentarian and damaged two disused factories in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, about 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. An unidentified object that entered Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus was probably an observation balloon, Poland’s defence ministry said on Saturday. A spokesperson for Poland’s territorial defence force said a search for the object was under way. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit was launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war Victory Day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have said.

The Freedom of Russia Legion, which describes itself as an anti-Kremlin militia seeking to overthrow the Kremlin and liberate Russia from Vladimir Putin, claimed to have crossed the border and overrun the settlement of Kozinka, while sending units into the town of Grayvoron in Russia’s Belgorod region. Any capture of territory in Belgorod has not been independently confirmed by journalists on the ground. The militia has mostly existed on social media and it is not known to have participated in any major battles during the war. But both Russia and Ukrainian officials have confirmed fighting at the border and social media video has shown armoured vehicles appearing to overrun a Russian border post near Grayvoron. The Russian-imposed leader of the occupied Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, has said that Russian forces have begun demining operations in Bakhmut. Tass quotes him appearing on the Rossiya-24 TV channel and saying: “There is a preliminary demining of the city. It is important for us to carry out a complete, thorough demining. This is a very painstaking and difficult work, given the scale of the hostilities that took place there.” In another report, Tass quotes a source from the local Russian-imposed officials saying that “a few dozen more residents” remained in Bakhmut, but that “perhaps, the figure will change as the basements of houses are examined”. The source said that the “evacuation” of civilians continues. Ukrainian troops are still advancing on the flanks of the devastated city, although the “intensity” of their movement has decreased and Russia is bringing in more forces, Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Monday. She said that Ukraine had a small foothold inside the city itself, again denying Russia’s assertion that it has established full control over Bakhmut. Russian president Vladimir Putin congratulated Wagner and Russian regular forces on “the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk [the city’s Soviet-era name]” after Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin posed among the wreckage, and said his mercenary group controlled the entire city at the weekend. It has not been possible for journalists to verify the battlefield situation in the city for months. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been reconnected to the electricity grid after it was switched to standby and emergency power supply generators were used. Russia-installed local official in the Moscow-controlled part of the region Vladimir Rogov said the plant was “completely” disconnected from external power supply after Ukraine disconnected a power line it controls, Reuters reports. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine, but Anatoliy Kurtev, Zaporizhzhia city council’s secretary in Ukraine, said that work was ongoing since early Monday to restore power to the city. Rafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has said the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) “cannot continue”. The Washington Post is reporting that the UN nuclear watchdog is pushing for a last-minute agreement to safeguard Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant ahead of any counteroffensive. At least eight people were wounded and scores of buildings were damaged in a Russian air attack on Dnipropetrovsk region. “The Russian invaders attacked military and infrastructure facilities of the eastern outpost of Ukraine – the city of Dnipro,” Ukraine’s air force said on the Telegram messaging service. “The attack was carried out by 16 different types of missiles and 20 Shahed-136/131 strike drones,” the air force said, adding that air defences brought down 20 Russian drones and four cruise missiles. At least one person was injured, and images from the city show destruction of emergency services equipment in what appears to have been a strike on a fire station. Russia’s ambassador to the US appears to have warned Washington that any strike on Crimea could be considered a strike on Russian territory by Nato after US president Joe Biden said he would support training for Ukrainian pilots on US F-16 fighter jets. In remarks published on the embassy’s Telegram channel, Anatoly Antonov wrote: “I would like to warn representatives of the administration against thoughtless judgments on Crimea, especially in terms of ‘blessing’ the Kyiv regime for air attacks on the peninsula. Let me remind you that strikes on this territory are considered by us as an attack on any other region of the Russian Federation. It is important that the United States is fully aware of the Russian response.” Mykhailo Podolyak, adviser to the head of the office of president of Ukraine, has said “Crimea is an indisputable and inseparable part of Ukraine. It was, it is and it will be. The liberation of Crimea using any military force and means is the only rational way to stop ‘Russian aggressions’ and bring the world back to international law. It is Ukraine’s direct obligation and necessity today” The governor of Russia’s Belgorod region has claimed on Telegram that an explosive device dropped from an unmanned aerial vehicle in Novaya Tavolzhanka, without causing any injuries. The governor of Russia’s Bryansk region has claimed this morning that Ukraine has shelled a village. The EU’s top diplomat will propose further sanctions against Russia, following a promise by G7 leaders to intensify western restrictions on Vladimir Putin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said he hoped to soon present “concrete proposals to implement the decision of the G7 on new kinds of sanctions against Russia”. Zelenskiy secured fresh military aid from the US during a day of frantic diplomatic activity at the G7 summit at the weekend. US president Joe Biden announced military assistance worth up to $375m (£300m) to Kyiv, telling Zelenskiy the US was doing everything possible to strengthen Ukraine’s defence. The package includes ammunition, artillery, armoured vehicles and training. Biden told a press conference that he had received a “flat assurance” from Zelenskiy that he would not use western-provided F-16 fighter jets to go into Russian territory. Biden said F-16 warplanes could, however, be used “wherever Russian troops are within Ukraine and the area”. Biden told G7 leaders that Washington supports joint allied training programs for Ukrainian pilots on F-16s warplanes, although Kyiv has not won specific, public commitments for delivery of the fighter jets. In a G7 speech, Zelenskiy said Kyiv’s plan to end Russia’s war in Ukraine was “an obvious expression of rationality”, and sought support for his “peace formula”. He thanked western leaders for achieving “a level of cooperation which ensures that democracy, international law, and freedom are respected”, but questioned: “Is this enough?” Zelenskiy played down the fact he did not meet Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit, saying it was likely because of scheduling. Lula has said Zelenskiy and Putin bear equal responsibility for the war and accused western powers of encouraging the conflict. Berlin police have opened an investigation into the suspected poisoning of two Russian journalists visiting the city for a conference last month organised by the Russian Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The probe comes after Russian investigative media group Agentsvo wrote that the two women had reported symptoms that pointed to possible poisoning around the time of the event at the end of April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/07/boris-johnson-energy-security-strategy-russian-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T13:14:03Z","webTitle":"Johnson’s energy security strategy won’t bring down our eye-watering heating bills | Eleanor Salter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/07/boris-johnson-energy-security-strategy-russian-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/07/boris-johnson-energy-security-strategy-russian-gas","fields":{"headline":"Johnson’s energy security strategy won’t bring down our eye-watering heating bills","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At last, the energy security strategy has been published, after weeks of hedging, briefing and delays. The original aims of the strategy, which was initially promised on 7 March, were worthy: to confront rocketing energy bills and transition away from Russian fossil fuels after the invasion of Ukraine. There was also hope in the climate world that the strategy would go further and faster in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. The cost of renewables has tumbled, and the UK’s leaky housing stock is crying out for retrofitting. This was an opportunity for an urgent response both to the climate and cost of living crises. But for something that was motivated by a war and an energy crisis, the headline policies of the resulting document strikingly fail to address either. One of the cornerstone issues is timescale: the strategy is big on infrastructure commitments such as new nuclear power plants and offshore wind farms, which won’t be fully operational for years, if not decades. Radical reform of the planning system to allow more onshore wind, one of the quickest and cheapest short-term salves to high energy bills, is absent. In its place there is a milquetoast commitment to “consulting on developing partnerships for a limited number of supportive communities”. Months after Cop26, the strategy has committed to licensing and drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea. Its climate ambitions are therefore deeply questionable. The majority of this oil is tagged for export; as Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, pointed out, domestic production won’t address energy bills but will only help fossil fuel executives get richer. Without nationalisation, new oil and gas will be sold at the market rate. Shell made a profit of $19.3bn (£14.7bn) last year. Other energy companies have also been raking it in, benefiting from the extortionate price of gas. Instead of imposing a windfall tax on these oil and gas companies that could help fund energy saving measures, the government’s strategy does the precise opposite. New oil and gas could blow a gigantic hole in the UK’s carbon budget. Licensing new exploration is a brazen move even for the Johnson government, committing to oil and gas in the same week as the devastating IPCC report confirmed existing and planned fossil fuel infrastructure will far exceed the 1.5C limit. This rushed energy security strategy, which is likely to be incompatible with the government’s other stated climate targets of net zero by 2050, is what happens when you push policies through the weird prism of the Tory party. Although the Johnson administration is no stranger to disorder, producing the energy security strategy has been chaos on a new scale. Over the past few weeks, the prime minister has been attempting to put out multiple fires across his party. Headlines have been peppered with briefings and counter-briefings. On 23 March, the Guardian trailed that Johnson would champion onshore wind in defiance of his Nimby backbenchers. A mere fortnight later, he apparently backed away from onshore wind after over 100 backbenchers lobbied against the policy. As a result, the new strategy has something for everyone, but pleases no one. A new survey into fracking has been ordered as bait to the Tory right, with Kwarteng claiming the government will be “guided by the science on shale gas”. But little has changed in the UK’s geology since the moratorium on fracking was enforced in 2019. Another problem with this strategy is deeply familiar. While it presents a bundle of promises, there is no money to back these up. The key phrase to look out for is “up to”. Nuclear power could provide “up to 24GW by 2050”. The government will “look to increase the UK’s current 14GW of solar capacity which could grow up to 5 times by 2035”. Even “we would like to see up to 5GW from floating offshore wind”. These are not targets, they are vague intimations. The energy strategy is silent on one fundamental issue – reducing energy demand. Widely reported wrangling between the Treasury, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and Number 10 is to blame. Energy efficiency measures are the quickest and cheapest way to lower energy bills and end reliance on Russian fossil fuels. They are also necessary for decarbonisation. But the Treasury blocked a proposal to expand the Energy Company Obligation scheme, which provides insulation measures to low-income households. This spat seemed petty to the point of ridicule: departments are bickering over a £200m top-up to an existing policy when an enormous, nationwide retrofit campaign will be both necessary and inevitable as our planet warms. The problem is not only of ideological difference, but also ideological vacuum. Most civil servants had no idea a strategy was even in the pipeline when Johnson promised it four weeks ago. But a frenzy in Whitehall to make up policy on the hoof has become a common trait of this government, whose manifesto was slender and whose party consensus is messy on almost every issue. Coordination across the cabinet is beyond Johnson’s reach, partly because he is weak and partly because he doesn’t know what he stands for. In 2012, he called wind turbines “white satanic mills” whose “collective oomph wouldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding”. Now, he’s blowing hard for offshore wind. Johnson finds himself up against a popular, anti-spend chancellor and the Net Zero Scrutiny Group. Despite his 80-seat majority, he is unable to convince his backbenchers of the need for swift commitments to the cost-of-living and climate crises, whilst we career towards 3.2C warming. He has to squeeze everything past a reticent chancellor and a party whose backbenchers are a decade behind public opinion. The result is a mash of promised policies which don’t tackle the issue of energy security. Without seriously contemplating a reduction in our energy demand or fast-tracking renewables, the strategy simply does not address what it was created for in the first place – ending dependence on a belligerent Russia, and bringing down eye-watering bills. Instead, the ragged Tory consensus is to deliver high-intensity infrastructure at some indefinite point in the future, and a failure to rise to the urgency required on energy for both people and planet.

Greens in Finland would now campaign not only for the lifespan of current reactors to be extended but also for new plants, with the technology recognised by their manifesto as “sustainable energy”. It was a decision that upended decades of environmentalist orthodoxy – by campaigners who, in many cases, cut their teeth in opposition to nuclear. And, for Tea Törmänen, it was the culmination of years of campaigning. She and others in the Finnish Greens for Science and Technology group had argued that only through the adoption of nuclear power and other technologies could human societies decarbonise fast enough to avert climate breakdown. Writing later, the biologist, who is also a former chair of Finland’s Ecomodernist Society, said: “For me it was a moment that was long overdue.” As anxiety grows over the extent of climate and ecological crises, fear for the future is loading an ever more desperate calculus in favour of radical action. For some, this could include environmentalists embracing technologies previously regarded as unacceptable. But could Britain’s green movement go nuclear? Last month, Törmänen was in a London meeting with UK activists to see if it can. RePlanet are the pro-nuclear, pro-GMO vegans who have come to shake up the environmental movement. Newly formed of an international network of pro-technology environmental campaign groups, they believe doubling down on technology and progress is the key to solving the climate and ecological crises. Now, with funding from climate philanthropists, they are spreading out from a core in northern Europe with a plan to “pivot the mainstream” across the continent. But their proposals look set to put them on a collision course with traditional environmentalists. In a video fronted by the environmental campaigner and Guardian columnist George Monbiot they have entreated the public to go vegan, calling for animal products to be replaced by fats and proteins grown in genetically modified microbial soup. In Germany they are campaigning for the government to end its phase out of nuclear power and in Finland and the Netherlands they have helped guarantee the industry’s future. At the EU level they successfully argued that nuclear should be included in its taxonomy of green energy sources, while at the same time campaigning against the bloc’s organic farming targets and longstanding ban on genetically modified crops. They have hired two seasoned activists, Joel Scott-Halkes and Emma Smart, to manage their UK campaign. With backgrounds in Extinction Rebellion, both have proven themselves committed to radical climate action. Scott-Halkes went on to join radical vegan offshoot Animal Rebellion, while Smart’s activism with Insulate Britain earned her spells in jail. A third British campaigner, the environmental writer Mark Lynas, a former staunch opponent of GM who reversed his views, is a co-founder. RePlanet has its roots in a network of “ecomodernist” groups and societies established since 2015, after the publication of An Ecomodernist Manifesto. That document, signed by Lynas among others, upended traditional environmentalist philosophy. Instead of calling for humans to live in harmony with nature, for degrowth and moderation, the ecomodernists double down on technology as a means to minimise the human impact on Earth, while providing for a population of billions. Land sparing lay at the core of the manifesto, with the aim of rewilding as much of the world’s surface as possible by concentrating human activities. Ultimately, they wrote, technology could “decouple” economic growth from planetary systems, and the “wise” use of nuclear power, genetic modification and intensive agriculture would lead “to a good, or even great Anthropocene”. Activists in Finland, the Netherlands and elsewhere took up the charge. But in the UK, reception to the ecomodernists was frosty. Summing up criticisms at the time, Monbiot said ecomodernists “would wish away almost the entire rural population of the developing world”, and they had failed to interrogate the relationships between modernity and proletarianisation, uneven development and poverty. After a botched attempt to reach out across the political spectrum by teaming up with Owen Paterson, a Tory former environment secretary, Lynas admitted attempts to launch the movement in the UK had amounted to a “screw-up of impressive proportions”. Now he is playing a key role in trying to revive ecomodernism. RePlanet, Scott-Halkes explained, had been born out of a process of “rebranding ecomodernism”, jettisoning bits of the philosophy that had “become problematic”. Over the past two years, he said, they had worked together with Monbiot to embed into their approach a critique of power. Where previously ecomodernists had been seen as naively pro-capitalist and pro-technology, RePlanet believe they have faced up to the nuances and dangers of the technologies they are proposing – and the dangers of progress in general. Like classic ecomodernists, they see themselves as “pro-science and evidence-based” supporters of prosperity, who embrace progress, said Scott-Halkes. But there is a new emphasis on development and, befitting its sojourn in social democratic northern Europe, a new faith in “the power of the democratic state to take control of technologies, to develop technologies”. Precision fermentation and nuclear power are emblematic of the kinds of technical fixes they call for. Precision fermentation could, they claim, allow for the entire world’s protein to be produced from an area the size of London. It is not a pipe dream: the same technology is already used to produce most of the world’s insulin and citric acid; in the US, ice-creams containing precision fermented replicas of milk proteins are already on the market. But RePlanet says the technology must be “open sourced” to ensure its democratisation, with precision fermentation breweries in every town. “We’re saying with precision fermentation, in particular, we need to get in there now, because this is food, this is sustenance,” said Scott-Halkes. “If this does come to dominate the global food system we should be advocating for democratic control of it right now. Otherwise, we’re actually genuinely screwed.” Less easy to open source is atomic energy. But Replanet believe it is the only way for humanity to meet the energy needs of a rapidly developing world while decarbonising as fast as possible. “Nuclear is the most land-efficient energy source that has ever been invented,” Scott-Halkes said. “It is by various degrees 300 times more land efficient than wind power, 150 times more efficient than solar power, uncountably, 4,000 to 5,000 times more land efficient than biofuels. If you want space [for] rewilding, you need nuclear.” Finland is the “gold standard” of what RePlanet hopes to achieve. Not only have ecomodernists there managed to persuade the Green party to adopt nuclear power, but in December the party’s council agreed to a dismantling of restrictions on GM. With 20 seats in Finland’s parliament, such policy decisions have force. In the UK they have further to go. When pronuclear campaigners appeared on protests at Cop26 in Glasgow last year they were accused of being paid shills of the industry. Critics of precision fermentation argue it is a complicated technology prone to centralisation, when accessible, localised, resilient and above all natural food sources are needed. Rob Percival, head of food policy at the Soil Association, which certifies organic food in the UK, described RePlanet’s Reboot Food campaign on Twitter as “akin to the rewilding movement getting hooked on GMO-steroids”. Percival said it was important for campaign groups to push boundaries, and he agreed with the potential for precision fermentation to displace intensive animal farming. “But they are pushing this land-sparing concept to quite an extreme conclusion,” he said. “I think it’s unwise in that intensive systems have proven time and again to be liable to corporate capture, bad for the soil, heavily reliant on chemicals.” Opponents of nuclear say it is far from living up to RePlanet’s promise. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace’s policy director, said the world needed alternative and clean sources of energy that are quick and cheap to deploy. “Nuclear is the opposite,” he said. “The new plant at Hinkley C is over a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. The next one in line, at Sizewell C, may not even start generating energy until today’s newborns turn teenagers. Crucially, we don’t need new nuclear. Solar and wind technologies are a much cheaper and quicker way to cut carbon emissions, and studies show we can keep the lights on with a wholly renewable energy system. All we need is the political will to make it happen.” Even Monbiot, who has helped to craft RePlanet’s updated ecomodernism, qualifies his support for the group’s ideas. He is known as an advocate for organic farming, which RePlanet has campaigned against. But he insists, nevertheless, that fresh thinking is needed to resolve the crises affecting the environment. “I broadly agree that we have to assess every issue from first principles, and we can’t afford to be blinded by prejudices against certain technologies,” Monbiot said. “We have to assess them all case by case, and we might come down in slightly different places on some of those technologies, but broadly I think we are on the same page.” RePlanet are not the only advocates of high-tech solutions to green problems. Taking his cue from Marx’s embracing of modernity as the grounds for revolutionary change, Matt Huber, author of Climate Change as Class War, dismisses degrowthers’ vision as “almost as austere as Pol Pot’s”. Adopting a more populist tone, the leftwingers clustered around the UK’s Novara Media news website have advocated for “fully automated luxury communism”, which went on to become the title of founder Aaron Bastani’s debut book. Most significantly, those with the money and power to actually bring ideas into implementation also seem to back technological solutions. Vast sums have already been invested into GM, plans are afoot for direct CO2 capture via huge industrial machinery and the cost-benefit analysis around geoengineering is increasingly regarded as worth the risk. Ecomodernism may not, yet, be the most popular idea among those who are campaigning for a solution to planetary crises created by humanity. But it increasingly looks as though it may be the one we will get."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2022/jun/28/sir-laurence-martin-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-28T16:00:52Z","webTitle":"Sir Laurence Martin obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jun/28/sir-laurence-martin-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2022/jun/28/sir-laurence-martin-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Sir Laurence Martin obituary","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"In his BBC Reith lectures in 1981, the historian and security strategist Laurence Martin, who has died aged 93, spoke of the “miserably dangerous” need to avert nuclear war, concerns that have recently returned to face the western world. He was well aware of the huge difficulties of trying to ensure the outcome of “the endless search for safety”, which became the subject of the last chapter of the book drawn from the lecture series, The Two Edged Sword: Armed Force in the Modern World (1982). While advocating vigorous and open debate, he recognised the difficulty of achieving a relationship of trust with a nuclear power such the former Soviet Union, and was “relatively pessimistic” about the prospects of a greater degree of western European unity and self-reliance in defence matters. Our peace was of a provisional kind, and in order to maintain the balance of power, security must be on hand when needed: every generation had to make its own security. Thus he strongly opposed unilateral disarmament and argued for vigorous defensive efforts, combined with maintaining conventional weapon capability and maritime power. In a letter to the Telegraph in 2014, before the Russian invasion of Crimea, he reiterated the need for the balance of power to be maintained in the west. His books included Peace Without Victory: Woodrow Wilson and the British Liberals (1958), Arms and Strategy: An International Survey of Modern Defence (1973), Strategic Thought in the Nuclear Age (1979) and The Changing Face of Nuclear Warfare (1987). Regarded by some as rightwing, or an “extreme moderate”, Laurie himself considered his politics to be middle of the road. He was a consummate committee man, able to sway opinion by dint of his quick thinking, diplomacy and personal charm, gaining the respect and admiration of those he worked with. Curious about everyone he met, he had an innate sense of fairness. These qualities were invaluable assets for his involvement in many national and international institutions. They included the Center for Stategic and International Studies in Washington, where Henry Kissinger was another leading light, from 1969, which he served as co-chair from 1998 and senior adviser for six years from 2000. In London he was involved with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, serving on its council 1973-83, and the Institute for the Study of Conflict. The culmination of his work as a security strategist came as director of Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (1991-96). This post coincided with the end of the cold war, when the institute’s experts, researchers and staff played a key role in facilitating dialogue between members of governments and policymakers surrounding the challenges of the break-up of the Soviet Union, war in Yugoslavia and its dissolution, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and the United Nations’ increased role in international politics. At the same time, since core government funding of Chatham House had ceased (it is now an independent body), Laurie helped modernise its fundraising, and promoted improved communications to policymakers by developing its use of the internet. Once he had spent some years in the US, Laurie never quite lost a slight mid-Atlantic accent. But he was very proud of having been born and brought up in Cornwall: his mother, Florence (nee Woodward), worked in the local brewery in St Austell, and his father, Leonard Martin, was a teacher. From St Austell grammar school Laurie went to Christ’s College, Cambridge to take a degree in history (1948). Then he did two years of national service with the RAF as a pilot officer, later flying officer, based in Cornwall. The first time he crossed the Atlantic was to take a PhD on Woodrow Wilson at Yale. He went on to be assistant professor at MIT (1955-61), associate professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and research associate at the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research. Back in Britain he became Woodrow Wilson professor of international politics at the University of Wales in 1964, and four years later head of the war studies department at King’s College London. He expanded it, introduced an ethicist and a diplomatic historian, and took a keen interest in the development of the college’s Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, where I got to know him. His next move, to become vice-chancellor at the University of Newcastle in 1978, reflected the recognition of his skills in negotiation and administration. His 12 years at Newcastle came during a time of reform in the higher education system and expansion of the university. He was a popular figure, and his decision to allow Channel 4 to film a documentary series, Redbrick, in 1985, proved successful, bringing the work and life of the university to a wide audience. In 1994 he was knighted, and in retirement he enjoyed his garden in Suffolk, fishing in Northumberland and trips on steam trains. He married Betty Parnall in 1951 and they had a daughter, Jane, and son, Bill. His wife and daughter predeceased him; his son and two grandsons, Tom and Jack, survive him. • Laurence Woodward Martin, historian and security strategist, born 30 July 1928; died 24 April 2022"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2022/may/27/there-could-still-be-time-to-fix-climate-but-not-with-uk-nuclear-plans","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-27T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"There could still be time to fix climate – but not with UK’s nuclear plans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/27/there-could-still-be-time-to-fix-climate-but-not-with-uk-nuclear-plans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/27/there-could-still-be-time-to-fix-climate-but-not-with-uk-nuclear-plans","fields":{"headline":"There could still be time to fix climate – but not with UK’s nuclear plans","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"With the weather changing dramatically across the world, will politicians finally take the climate crisis seriously? With a concerted effort, there could still be time. But time is the critical thing. And on the campaign trail in “red wall” seats before the May elections, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, repeatedly promised building nuclear reactors “one a year for eight years”. Last week at the Conservative conference in Wales he was at it again – this time promising one on Anglesey and another at Trawsfynydd in Mid Wales. Anyone who knows a little about nuclear reactors (current designs 10 years late and £10bn over budget) or about the prime minister’s other mega-projects – bridges across the Thames and Irish Sea, and an airport in the Thames estuary – is confident that this won’t happen. A protest via my MP brought a measured response from Greg Hands, the minister responsible for energy policy. He said provided reactors were value for money and technically sound, the government’s target for nuclear projects was to give one a final investment decision this parliament, and two in the next – so maybe three building starts by 2030. On current trends that means one reactor possibly ready by 2040 and two others much later. Far too late to heal the climate."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-11T17:28:49Z","webTitle":"Putin and Macron trade blame over risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/11/reactor-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-shut-down-operator","fields":{"headline":"Putin and Macron trade blame over risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron have traded blame over safety concerns at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, which has been a focal point of fighting in recent weeks. Separate readouts of a phone call between the French and Russian presidents highlighted the difficulties in trying to find an accord to ensure safety at the site. “The Russian side drew attention to regular Ukrainian attacks on the plant’s facilities, including radioactive waste storage, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences,” said a statement published on the Kremlin’s website. It called for a “non-politicised interaction” on the matter with the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In its statement, the French presidency said the occupation by Russian troops of the plant was what was putting it at risk. “He [Macron] asked that Russian forces withdraw their heavy and light weapons and that the IAEA’s recommendations be followed to ensure safety at the site,” the Elysee said. Earlier, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator said the last operating reactor at the plant had been shut down and the plant “completely stopped”. The six-reactor Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from the grid last week after all its power lines were disconnected as a result of fighting in the area, and was operating in “island mode” for several days, generating electricity for crucial cooling systems from its only remaining reactor in operation. Energoatom, the state-run operator of all four of Ukraine’s nuclear power stations, said one of the power lines was restored on Saturday night, allowing plant operators to shut down the last reactor. “A decision was made to shut down power unit No 6 and transfer it to the safest state: cold shutdown,” the operator said. Electricity supply to the plant has been cut with increasing frequency over the past few weeks, including at least three times last week. Energoatom said the risk of continued damage to the supply line “remains high” and that it did not want to risk the plant being powered by diesel generators, “the duration of which is limited by the technological resource and the amount of available diesel fuel”. The plant was disconnected from the Ukrainian grid for the first time in its history on 25 August. Energoatom has called for a demilitarisation of the plant by Russian forces, who took control of the area in early March. On Friday the IAEA, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, said the situation at the plant was increasingly precarious, after its offsite electricity supply line was cut again. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame over shelling of the plant and the nearby area. Ukraine claims Russia is carrying out attacks as part of a false-flag operation to blame Ukraine. Russia blames Ukraine’s forces. Researchers and journalists have pointed to some evidence that supports part of Ukraine’s claims. However, the Guardian has not been able to independently verify events at the power plant. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA’s director general, warned last week that Ukraine was considering shutting down the plant because it “no longer had confidence in the offsite power”. Grossi did not apportion blame for the shelling of the plant. Grossi said that if Ukraine decided not to restore the offsite supply, the entire power plant would be reliant on emergency diesel generators to ensure supplies for nuclear safety and security functions. “As a consequence, the operator would not be able to restart the reactors unless offsite power was reliably re-established,” he said.

Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, was shown around the plant by Russian occupying forces and officials, telling reporters: “It is obvious that military activity is increasing in this whole region, so every possible measure and precautions should be taken so that the plant is not attacked. “I think it’s no secret that there is a significant increase in the number of troops in the region, and there is open talk about offensive and counter offensives,” he added. The plant is on the south bank of the Dnieper river, which forms the frontline at a time when Russian forces have attempted to conduct a series of offensives and Ukraine is widely expected to launch a counter-offensive in the coming months. Grossi was accompanying three IAEA inspectors who will replace an outgoing monitoring team and are due to stay at the site for the next two months, the seventh team to take up the rotating role since the agency’s presence was accepted by Kyiv and Moscow. The director general is also in Zaporizhzhia to continue efforts to negotiate protections for the plant, which would require the agreement of Ukrainian and Russian forces not to fire in or out of the area. “There have been different concepts that we have been working on. Initially we were focusing on the possibility of the establishment of a well-determined zone around the plant. Now the concept is evolving and refocusing more on the protection itself and the things that should be avoided,” he said on Wednesday. “It is a work in progress.” The negotiations have so far stalled on Russian refusal to withdraw its armed forces from the plant, a Ukrainian precondition for agreement. Grossi has repeatedly warned that a direct hit or a breakdown in safety systems could cause a catastrophe. “What we need is to protect the nuclear power plant, because if we don’t do that, there is a high risk of a major nuclear accident which is going to spare no one, Ukrainians or Russians,” Grossi told reporters on a visit to Washington earlier this month. He said that while he was trying to negotiate a protection zone, it would not try to attribute daily responsibility for the shelling. “I’m still engaged in the effort, so you may understand that it wouldn’t be very wise for me to start saying who is to blame. It’s a process. It is a complex negotiation,” he said. “So this is why we avoid getting into apportioning blame because it will be a never ending story. What we need is an agreement, a solid political commitment, not to do this.” “There is a quite obvious increase in the number of troops on both sides and military equipment,” he told the New York Times this week. “Our teams are also observing and hearing and seeing more military activity, including detonations, regular, almost permanent.” Zaporizhzhia is the biggest nuclear power plant in Europe, but all six of its reactors have been shut down. Two of them are in “hot shutdown”, meaning they continue to give up a limited amount of energy to power safety and heating systems. It is however a difficult state to maintain, and the 3,000 remaining Ukrainian workers there, a quarter of the normal staff, are facing constant stress and exhaustion. “Things continue but the situation is not sustainable,” Grossi said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T14:00:12Z","webTitle":"Mark Latham to push for nuclear plants and ‘parental rights’ if made NSW kingmaker","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/16/mark-latham-to-push-for-nuclear-plants-and-parental-rights-if-made-nsw-kingmaker","fields":{"headline":"Mark Latham to push for nuclear plants and ‘parental rights’ if made NSW kingmaker","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Mark Latham will seek to overturn a longstanding ban on nuclear power technologies, strengthen “parental rights” and protect Christians from vilification if One Nation picks up enough seats to make him a kingmaker after the New South Wales election. The former federal Labor leader is attempting to grow his party’s upper house presence from two to four at the 25 March poll, capitalising on voter disillusionment and a loophole that has allowed him to resign and re-run at the top of the ticket. Pollsters and the major parties believe One Nation is in with a shot of picking up at least one extra seat – after securing two in 2019 – which means whoever forms government could have to work with, or around, One Nation to govern. Labor has preferenced the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party in key marginal seats in the hopes of stopping One Nation from gaining more power, while the Greens remain nervous they could miss out on a seat to the party. Latham told Guardian Australia his top priority was building on conversations around the Aukus agreement to build nuclear-powered subs by getting around the decades-old federal nuclear power ban, enabling uranium mining and the building of reactors across the state. “I don’t advocate getting rid of the coal-fired power stations, but as the government’s doing it, it’s much much better to have small modular nuclear reactors replacing them,” he said. “The breakthrough on nuclear means it’s more urgent than ever.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Latham also said he wants parents to be given more rights over what their children are taught in schools, which he claimed were full of “semi-illiterate” students. “Parents are being treated as second-class citizens in the education system,” Latham said. “We would ban gender fluidity teaching in NSW schools … [as] the system seems to be obsessed with questions of gender, which has got nothing to do with education. It’s a matter for parents and families.” His third priority was increasing protection for religious groups to deal with the “rise of vilification of Christians, in particular”. But the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, accused Latham of being on a “unity ticket with the ‘teal’ candidates on their shared mission to remove conservative MPs to facilitate a Labor government” – a claim the One Nation leader and the opposition deny. “He pretends he’s a conservative,” Kean told Guardian Australia. Kean also dismissed Latham’s plan to see nuclear energy generation permitted in NSW. “I hope Mark understands that although he has an oversized voice for the number of votes his party attracts, his rantings in NSW parliament can’t be heard in Canberra, where there is actual jurisdiction to amend a commonwealth ban on nuclear power,” he said. Labor has denied doing deals with any crossbenchers, including Latham. “There’s a real possibility that Mark Latham and One Nation could be the kingmaker of NSW politics – on everything from climate change, renewables, education and anti-discrimination,” said an opposition spokesperson, Penny Sharpe. A pollster, Simon Welsh of RedBridge, said the Liberal party risked losing votes at each end of their support spectrum to teals and Labor, as well as more rightwing options. “That dynamic that was there in the federal election is definitely there again … [and] One Nation is very well-positioned – picking up folks that are angry with the government about vaccines and Covid restrictions,” he said. “The other thing that they’ve got working for them this time is that it looks like there’s a bit of consolidation of that rightwing minor-party vote. Whether that then translates into a number of seats is a trickier question.” A Greens spokesperson, Jenny Leong, said she was concerned about seeing far-right parties gaining ground. “The one way that we ensure that Mark Latham is not the kingmaker … is to get a commitment out of both government and the opposition that they will not work with the likes of One Nation because of the toxic politics they represent,” she said. “It is quite possible that that last spot in the upper house would be between [Greens candidate] Lynda-June Coe and One Nation.” The comments came ahead of Coe, a Wiradjuri and Badu Island woman, releasing the Greens’ plan to stop First Nations deaths is custody on Thursday. It will include co-designing and enacting a justice reinvestment plan, creating a new independent police and prison oversight mechanism and raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14, with no one under 16 able to be sentenced to a jail term. Despite being just four years into his eight-year term, Latham last year announced he would quit parliament at the election, allowing the party to fill his vacated seat under parliamentary rules while he runs at the top of One Nation’s ticket. At the time Latham defended the run as a chance to “renew” his mandate but analysts believe he was using a loophole to increase the party’s chances of bolstering numbers to four, with one saying it raised ethical – but not any legal – concerns. The election analyst Ben Raue noted even if One Nation claimed four seats, the makeup of the rest of the chamber would decide the party’s actual power. “They could potentially have the balance of power but they could also be in a position where they’re just not that relevant,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/grogonomics/2021/oct/19/nuclear-power-too-costly-too-slow-so-its-zero-use-to-australias-emissions-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-18T16:30:02Z","webTitle":"Nuclear power is too costly, too slow, so it’s zero use to Australia’s emissions plan | Greg Jericho","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2021/oct/19/nuclear-power-too-costly-too-slow-so-its-zero-use-to-australias-emissions-plan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/grogonomics/2021/oct/19/nuclear-power-too-costly-too-slow-so-its-zero-use-to-australias-emissions-plan","fields":{"headline":"Nuclear power is too costly, too slow, so it’s zero use to Australia’s emissions plan","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The catch-22 of nuclear power in Australia is that you would only consider it if you wanted to reduce emissions because of climate change, but if you agree climate change is real and we need to reduce emissions, you would not consider nuclear power. Currently Australia burns a lot of coal – more than other comparable economies with nuclear power. If the graph does not display click here Even worse, Victoria relies greatly on the dirtiest and least-efficient brown coal. If the graph does not display click here But if you think climate change is a load of bunk then, as current head of charging with ChargeFox, Evan Beaver, puts it in his excellent blog post on the issue, “we might as well burn all the coal we have. And we have a lot.” But if you do agree climate change is real then what we need to do is reduce emissions as fast as possible. As I noted last month, at a certain point there will be so much CO2 in the atmosphere that we won’t be able to limit temperatures rising above either 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels, no matter when we get to net zero afterwards. If the graph does not display click here We must cut emissions fast – at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, and probably by about 75% if we want to limit temperature rises to less than 1.5C. Nuclear power is of zero use on that score. We know this because nuclear power has already been examined a lot. One excellent study was in 2006 under the Howard government, by Ziggy Switkowski. It noted that “the earliest that nuclear electricity could be delivered to the grid would be 10 years, with 15 years more probable”. Alright then. Firstly, not even the National party is insane enough to make nuclear power an election promise. So let’s assume if the Coalition wins next year’s election, but announces a move to legalise nuclear power, that even with the best intentions, given the task of getting the votes, it’d be lucky for that to happen until the end of 2022. Now all that has to happen is choose the type of reactor, and oh, pick a spot (have fun). Ignore the coming election in 2025 and assume everything gets in place by 2024 (not a hope, but hey, let’s play pretend). That means at best we’re looking at 2035 but more likely 2040 before the first nuclear plant comes on line. That is already too late to help prevent temperatures reaching 2C, and by then an overwhelming amount of our electricity will already be generated by renewables. That means the need for such a plant is gone. Markets know this, which is why no one will ever invest in such a plant here. The CSIRO’s latest “GenCost” report suggests the capital costs of small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear power plants by 2030 and even out to 2050 will be greater than renewables, including solar thermal plants. If the graph does not display click here But perhaps rather surprising is that nuclear becomes even less viable when the CSIRO projects the world getting to net zero by 2050. If the graph does not display click here The reason is that, under such a scenario, the push for renewables accelerates so greatly that the development of nuclear power effectively stalls, meaning Australia would have to be a leading investor in new plants – thus paying the first mover costs. As the CSIRO notes, “a major source of discomfort” for nuclear stakeholders is that the high cost estimate of nuclear power “is of theoretical value only” because “a nuclear SMR plant is not planned to be built in Australia anytime soon”. The CSIRO suggests “it is more likely that Australia would only take up nuclear SMR, if at all, from around 2030, after other countries have brought down the cost”. If the world moves to net zero by 2050, those costs will not be brought down. Even once up and running, CSIRO estimates, the price of electricity generation from nuclear power in order to meet all its costs including a return to investment would at best be little better than solar thermal, and much above wind and solar panels. If the graph does not display click here This is not new. The South Australian government conducted a royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle in 2016 and concluded that “a nuclear power plant of currently available size at current costs of construction would not be viable in the South Australian market”. Even the Switkowski report in 2006 suggested that nuclear power would only “become economic” with a carbon price of “approximately $15-$40/t CO2”. And that was in 2006. The SA royal commission considered the case where a carbon price was implemented in 2017 designed to reduce emissions to 65% below 2005 levels by 2030 and with “complete decarbonisation by 2050”. Even though this “significantly increased the wholesale price of electricity”, it concluded nuclear power remained unviable. I have no problems with nuclear power. But the only way it would be viable is with an extremely high carbon price. I say bring that on! Except a high carbon price makes renewables an even better investment, and thus nuclear less needed. And even a high carbon price won’t get enough nuclear plants built soon enough to prevent temperatures rising above 2C. Nuclear power: too costly, and too slow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-444-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-13T00:59:23Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 444 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-444-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-444-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 444 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Russia has said some of its troops fell back “to more advantageous defensive positions” near a reservoir north-west of Bakhmut. The defence ministry’s statement on Friday was Moscow’s first admission that Ukraine was successfully recapturing ground around the largely destroyed eastern Ukrainian city Russia has been trying to conquer for more than 10 months. Wagner group founder Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose troops have done most of the fighting in and around Bakhmut, said that what the defence ministry had described was in fact a “rout” that had seen troops flee. He said via his press service that Ukraine had been able to completely regain control of a crucial supply road that links Bakhmut with the town of Chasiv Yar and had seized useful higher ground. Russian-installed officials in Luhansk have said missiles fired by Kyiv damaged two disused factories and five homes in the eastern Ukrainian region’s main city, around 100km (60 miles) behind the frontlines. Luhansk authorities said on Telegram on Friday that two Ukrainian-made “grom” tactical missiles damaged or destroyed administrative buildings at a packaging plant and a factory producing cleaning materials. No casualties were reported. Two Russian pilots were killed when a Russian Mi-28 military helicopter crashed in the annexed peninsula of Crimea, Russian news agencies reported, citing the defence ministry. It said it believed the reason for Friday’s crash was equipment failure, Tass reported. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for the provision of long-range cruise missiles. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, earlier confirmed that the UK would send long-range cruise missiles. Ukraine’s planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia has a good chance of success but may bring high casualties if Russia uses its prepared defences well, Czech president Petr Pavel has said. The former Nato general said in an interview on Friday that Ukraine needed support for Nato and European Union entry but joining either would be a lengthy process, though talks on the EU accession could start this year. Police in the Russian city of St Petersburg have created an anti-drone unit to detect unmanned drones after a suspected attack on the Kremlin last week. The unit launched on Tuesday during the annual second world war victory day celebrations on St Petersburg’s Palace Square, the city’s interior ministry said. South Africa’s foreign ministry has summoned the US ambassador over allegations he made that the country had provided arms and ammunition to Russia for its war in Ukraine. Reuben Brigety said on Thursday that South Africa had loaded weapons and ammunition on to a Russian vessel, which is under sanctions, at a naval base near Cape Town in December last year and that the arms were then transported to Russia. Vladimir Putin has said Moscow has never refused the “diplomatic track” to resolving the conflict in Ukraine, in a phone call with his South African counterpart, according to the Kremlin. The Russian president said on Friday he supported South African president Cyril Ramaphosa’s proposal to involve African leaders in talks regarding a peace process for Ukraine, the Kremlin’s readout of the call said. Russia’s defence ministry has said Ukrainian forces carried out “offensive operations” along the entire line of contact near Soledar, the ministry’s official Zvezda news outlet reported. More than a thousand troops and up to 40 tanks were used in Thursday’s assault, it said on Friday, adding that the attacks were “repulsed”. The UN nuclear watchdog chief, Rafael Grossi, plans to present an agreement with Russia and Ukraine on protecting the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the UN security council this month, indicating a deal is close, four diplomats have told Reuters. Grossi has been trying for months to secure an agreement to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident from shelling at the Russian-occupied nuclear power station, Europe’s biggest. A Russian defeat in Ukraine will not derail China’s rise, while relations between Beijing and the European Union will be “critically affected” if Xi Jinping does not push Vladimir Putin to withdraw his forces, European ministers have been told. The message comes in a paper drawn up by the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, who was meeting the EU’s 27 foreign ministers on Friday in Stockholm to discuss how the bloc should “recalibrate” its policy towards Beijing. The British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has expressed disappointment at a decision to block Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s request to speak via video at Saturday’s Eurovision grand final. The European Broadcasting Union, which produces the event, said the Ukrainian president had “laudable” intentions but rejected the request over fears it could politicise the event. The US president, Joe Biden, and the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, underscored their support for Ukraine during a White House meeting that also touched on migration and defence cooperation. During talks in the Oval Office on Friday, Biden said that “together we’re supporting Ukraine” and Sanchez squarely blamed the war on Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/26/time-running-out-to-reach-iran-nuclear-deal-warn-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-26T15:53:35Z","webTitle":"Time running out to reach Iran nuclear deal, warn experts ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/time-running-out-to-reach-iran-nuclear-deal-warn-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/26/time-running-out-to-reach-iran-nuclear-deal-warn-experts","fields":{"headline":"Time running out to reach Iran nuclear deal, warn experts ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Leading former diplomats including seven ex-UK foreign and defence ministers have warned the Iran nuclear talks are heading to “corrosive stalemate devolving into a cycle of increased nuclear tension” and urged Tehran and Washington to show more flexibility. Year-long talks in Vienna on reviving the deal and for the US, which was pulled out of the agreement by Donald Trump, to lift sanctions on Iran have in effect ground to a halt in a dispute over whether the west will lift the foreign terrorist organisation designation, and sanctions, against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The former diplomats said in an open letter that a final draft text of a renewed agreement was ready to be signed and warned that “for US and European leaders to let slip the opportunity to defuse a nuclear crisis in the Middle East would be a grave mistake”. Washington says the sanctions on the IRGC do not relate to the nuclear deal, but to its long-term terrorist behaviour in the region, including in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The signatories to the open letter, coordinated the European Leadership Network, include former senior diplomats in 14 countries including the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, former defence secretaries Lord King and Des Browne, as well as the former Conservative Middle East minister Alistair Burt. They say the legacy of Trump’s strategic error in leaving the agreement “can today be measured in the tons of enriched uranium Iran has since accumulated, including uranium enriched to near-weapons grade; in the thousands of advanced centrifuges it is spinning; and, in the rapidly dwindling timeframe for Iran to reach a breakout capability”. The US left the nuclear deal in 2018. Joe Biden on his election as president said he wanted to rejoin so long as Iran came back into compliance with the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation. One proposal that Israel fears the US administration will adopt is to retain sanctions on the elite foreign arm of the IRGC, the al-Quds force, but lift the designation on the IRGC domestically. The letter’s authors acknowledge the politics of the foreign terrorist organisation designation are difficult but insist “there are ways to provide the counter-terrorism benefits of the current designation while still accommodating Iran’s specific request, and consider it imperative that these be fully explored”. “For its part, Iran should not expect a nuclear deal to address broader areas of disagreement between Tehran and Washington. Both sides must approach this final phase of negotiation with an understanding that the strategic implications of failure would be grave and profound.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/09/putin-shelling-ukraine-power-grid-russia-president-strikes-energy-infrastructure","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-09T18:04:31Z","webTitle":"Putin suggests possibility of settlement to end war in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/09/putin-shelling-ukraine-power-grid-russia-president-strikes-energy-infrastructure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/09/putin-shelling-ukraine-power-grid-russia-president-strikes-energy-infrastructure","fields":{"headline":"Putin suggests possibility of settlement to end war in Ukraine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin mentioned a potential settlement to end his war in Ukraine on Friday while still claiming that his “special military operation” was going to plan. “The settlement process as a whole, yes, it will probably be difficult and will take some time. But one way or another, all participants in this process will have to agree with the realities that are taking shape on the ground,” the Russia president said during remarks at a press-conference in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The remarks came just days after Putin appeared to be girding Russians for a protracted war in Ukraine, saying that his military operation could be a “long-term process”. Initially, Russian commanders expected the war would last just a matter of weeks before a Russian victory, according to plans captured at the beginning of the war. It is now in its 10th month and Russia has been forced to retreat for several months. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Putin claimed that his military operation was going to plan. “Everything is stable. There are no questions or problems there,” he said, adding that information was being given to the public transparently. Those remarks came a day after Putin appeared to revel in recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure. Drinking what appeared to be sparkling wine, Putin vowed to keep battering Ukraine’s energy grid despite an outcry against the systematic attacks that have plunged millions into cold and darkness as winter sets in. Speaking after an awards ceremony for “Heroes of Russia” at the Kremlin on Thursday, the president addressed a group of soldiers. Acknowledging the targeted attacks by Russia, Putin blamed Ukraine for initiating a trend of attacking civilian infrastructure, pointing to a blast on a key bridge between the Russian mainland and the annexed Crimean peninsula. “Yes, we do that,” Putin said, of the strikes on the Ukraine grid. “But who started it? There’s a lot of noise about our strikes on the energy infrastructure of a neighbouring country. This will not interfere with our combat missions.” The video, taken by the Russian state-owned TV channel Zvezda, shows Putin holding a glass while speaking about the fates of tens of millions of Ukrainians. Ukraine has previously rejected Moscow’s claims that the strikes on its energy facilities were a retaliation for the Kerch bridge attack. Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency has claimed Russian military units had received instructions from the Kremlin to prepare massive missile strikes a week before the Crimean Bridge attack. Throughout the war, journalists, independent organisations and Ukrainian officials have also documented Russian attacks on civilian buildings and infrastructure. Putin went on to accuse Kyiv of blowing up power lines from the Kursk nuclear power plant and for not supplying water to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “Not supplying water to a city of more than a million people is an act of genocide,” Putin said, blaming the west for “complete silence” on these claims and of bias against Russia. The Ukrainian prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, said last month that Russia’s attacks on the Ukrainian energy grid were an act of genocide. In April, Unicef found that at least 35 water engineers had been killed or injured in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts since 2014, when clashes broke out between Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine. Some villages have been without water since then. Putin’s shelling of critical infrastructure across Ukraine has left millions without water, heating, gas and light as winter sets in. Russian forces shelled the entire frontline in the Donetsk oblast in eastern Ukraine on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said. “The Russians have intensified their efforts in Donetsk and Luhansk,” the Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said in a video post on Thursday. “They are now in a very active phase of attempting to conduct offensive operations. We are advancing nowhere but, rather, defending, destroying the enemy’s infantry and equipment wherever it tries to advance.” The Ukrainian energy operator Ukrenergo said on Thursday that it was still reeling from the latest bout of strikes this week and was at a “significant deficit”. On Friday, Putin said after the exchange of the convicted arms dealer Viktor Bout for the US basketball player Brittney Griner that more exchanges might be possible. “Are any other exchanges possible? Everything is possible,” he said. The former marine Paul Whelan, who was arrested in Russia and sentenced to 16 years for espionage, was not included in this week’s trade. He said that the trade was organised by the Russian FSB security agency and that US and Russian spy agencies only discussed the prisoner swap. “It wasn’t our goal to move from these talks to any others. But of course, they create a certain atmosphere, it’s true,” he said. Putin also discussed the potential for a nuclear war in his remarks on Friday, saying that Russian nuclear doctrine doesn’t allow for a preventive strike and that in the case of all-out war, strikes against Russia would be “inevitable.” “However, nothing will remain of the enemy,” he added."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/may/06/five-great-reads-apathy-fit-for-a-king-oliver-stone-goes-nuclear-and-how-we-exposed-robodebt","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-05T22:20:50Z","webTitle":"Five Great Reads: apathy fit for a king, Oliver Stone goes nuclear, and how we exposed robodebt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/06/five-great-reads-apathy-fit-for-a-king-oliver-stone-goes-nuclear-and-how-we-exposed-robodebt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/may/06/five-great-reads-apathy-fit-for-a-king-oliver-stone-goes-nuclear-and-how-we-exposed-robodebt","fields":{"headline":"Five Great Reads: apathy fit for a king, Oliver Stone goes nuclear, and how we exposed robodebt","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Top of the weekend to you all. One of Australia’s most significant events of 2023 has finally arrived, and to everyone in Brisbane for the NRL’s Magic Round – play hard but fair. There’s also the not insignificant matter of us officially gaining a new head of state. I know, I know – these things creep up on you when your day-to-day is completely unaffected by it. For the royal watchers among you, the Guardian has the event (and its fallout) covered. If you’re a bit “meh” about it all, read on – you’re not alone. 1. God save us all Take it away, Stephen Marche – Canadian author and cultural commentator: *** “You might think you live in a time of truth and reconciliation, or perhaps even, if you’re feeling optimistic, progress. But this week if you’re British or a member of the 56 sovereign states that still, somehow, find themselves in the Commonwealth, you’re waking up in a country where a priest is going to smear oil – vegan oil from Jerusalem – on a rather pinkish, rather broad forehead to signify one man’s status as the Lord’s anointed.” Marche journeyed from Toronto to London to try to make sense of the crowning of King Charles. “The man represents us,” he writes, “but it’s hard to think of anyone less representative.” How long will it take to read: 10 minutes. Further reading: Guardian Australia encounters a mix of apathy, indignation and enthusiasm on the streets of Melbourne and Sydney. And in England, Gaby Hinsliff was contentedly indifferent until the call to swear an oath of allegiance went out. 2. Oliver Stone on Putin, US politics and nuclear power Oliver Stone’s filmography is all about going big: the Vietnam war, media-fuelled mass murderers, any number of US presidents (and who really killed them). Now the legendary firebrand is not only tackling the vexed issue of nuclear power but making a strong case for it in his new documentary, Nuclear Now. Lauren Mechling caught up with Stone (and his real-time factchecker, and his “twinkly-eyed” therapist) in New York and emerged relatively unscathed. What does he think of the Russian president? “A great leader for his country and the people love him.” And Joe Biden? “A cold warrior in the worst sense of the word.” How long will it take to read: Four minutes. 3. Was Michael Jordan’s career a failure? That was the question posed by Giannis Antetokounmpo when a reporter prodded him about the early exit of his Milwaukee Bucks from the NBA playoffs. After all, Jordan won only six titles in 15 seasons – a 40% success rate. Below average, if you look just at the numbers. Barry Glendenning writes that the NBA great in waiting’s “unique, bold take” was a breath of fresh profundity among the usual post-match platitudes. *** “Some days it is your turn, some days it’s not. That’s what sports is about. You don’t always win.” – The world according to Giannis How long will it take to read: Three minutes.

The dreary, seductive allure of ‘stealth wealth’ “Stealth wealth” is the name given to the clothes worn by the super-rich, writes Eva Wiseman. Defining characteristics? “Bloodless, grandly bland, dreary.” So why do so many of we mere mortals get sucked into trying to dress like the 1%? Notable quote: “Buying into ‘stealth wealth’ feels like buying a band T-shirt, except the band are the worst people in the world, and the T-shirt costs the same as a month’s rent, and the music is them laughing as they shout ‘Eat shit’ from a car.” How long will it take to read: Two minutes. 5. How two reporters gave voice to the victimised Christopher Knaus reported the first clear evidence of how income averaging was being used by Centrelink to raise millions in inaccurate debts.

The ex-paratrooper understood he was risking prison, that he would be called a traitor and would be shunned by his former comrades-in-arms. His own mother had urged him to flee Russia while he still could. He said it anyway. “I don’t see justice in this war. I don’t see truth here,” he told Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer over a tucked-away cafe table in the Moscow financial district. It was his first time sitting down in person with a journalist since returning from the war in Ukraine. Two weeks ago, Filatyev published a 141-page bombshell: a day-by-day description of how his paratrooper unit was sent to mainland Ukraine from Crimea to enter Kherson and capture the seaport. It is the most detailed voluntary account from a Russian soldier participating in the invasion of Ukraine. Filatyev described how his exhausted and poorly equipped unit stormed into mainland Ukraine behind a hail of rocket fire in late February, with little in terms of concrete logistics or objectives, and no idea why the war was taking place at all. “It took me weeks to understand there was no war on Russian territory at all, and that we had just attacked Ukraine,” he said, his fingers shaking from stress as he lit another cigarette. “We were sitting under artillery fire by Mykolaiv,” he explained. “At that point I already thought that we’re just out here doing bullshit, what the fuck do we need this war for? And I really had this thought: ‘God, if I survive, then I’ll do everything that I can to stop this.’” Ukraine hints it was behind Crimea attack A series of mysterious and devastating strikes in occupied Crimea destroyed a key railway junction used for supplying Russian troops and a military airbase this week, Luke Harding reports. Smoke billowed into the sky near Dzhankoi on Tuesday while several explosions appeared to have destroyed a Russian ammunition depot and an electricity substation about 125 miles (200km) from the frontline with Ukrainian forces. According to Russian media, a further blast took place at a military airfield in the village of Hvardeyskye, not far from Crimea’s regional capital, Simferopol. While not formally confirming responsibility for the strike, Kyiv officials reacted with glee on social media “The reasons for the explosions in the occupied territory can be different, very different, in particular, I quote the definition of the occupiers themselves, ‘bungling’,” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, mused in an evening address. Kyiv has hit Crimea three times in a week, in clinical and flamboyant style. Russia’s logistics and weapons dumps have been badly affected. ‘It’s madness’: Putin turns nuclear plant into frontline The situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is perilous, Luke Harding and Christopher Cherry reported from Nikopol, the Ukrainian-held city 7km away on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River. The plant – Europe’s largest – is now on the frontline between Russian-occupied and Ukrainian-controlled territory. Russia is using the sprawling site as a military base from which it has been shelling the nearby towns of Nikopol and Marhanets. According to Ukraine’s state energy company, Energoatom, Russia has fired on the plant several times. Shells landed close to the fire station and director’s office, not far from a radioactive sources storage unit. The International Atomic Energy Agency has demanded access and called on the Russians to demilitarise it to avoid a possible nuclear disaster. One former senior employee, who spoke to Luke Harding on the condition of anonymity, said the Russians were shelling the plant from surrounding villages and roads with the goal of raising the stakes in negotiations with Kyiv. But the Kremlin is also trying to do something unprecedented: to steal another state’s nuclear reactor, he adds. Engineers are working to connect the facility to the electricity grid in occupied Crimea and cut it off from Ukrainian homes. One reactor has already been knocked out. It is a ghoulish game of radioactive Russian roulette, in a country that has known the 1986 Chornobyl atomic disaster. Dan Sabbagh in Kyiv covered the moment Zelenskiy vowed his forces would target Russian soldiers who shot at or from the plant. Russia is resorting to “unconcealed nuclear blackmail”, Zelenskiy alleged. A “terrorist state”, it was threatening the “whole world” with Armageddon. He urged the UN and international community to do something. Ukraine aiming to create chaos within Russian forces, Zelenskiy adviser says Ukraine is engaged in a counteroffensive aimed at creating “chaos within Russian forces” by striking at the invaders’ supply lines deep into occupied territories, according to a key adviser to the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Mykhailo Podolyak told Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding there could be more attacks in the “next two or three months” similar to those which struck Crimea. Speaking from the presidential offices in Kyiv, Podolyak said: “Our strategy is to destroy the logistics, the supply lines and the ammunition depots and other objects of military infrastructure. It’s creating a chaos within their own forces.” The adviser, often described as the country’s third most powerful figure, said Kyiv’s approach ran counter to Moscow’s use of blunt artillery power to gain territory in the Donbas region to the east, which has seen Russian troops destroy cities such as Mariupol and Sievierodonetsk in order to gain territory. “So Russia has kind of taught everybody that a counteroffensive requires huge amounts of manpower like a giant fist and just go in one direction,” he said, but “a Ukrainian counteroffensive looks very different. We don’t use the tactics of the 60s and 70s, of the last century.” ‘A referendum is not right’: occupied Kherson looks to uncertain future “A city with a Russian history,” proclaim billboards across the Ukrainian city of Kherson, occupied by the Russian army since the first days of March. Others display the Russian flag, or quotes from Vladimir Putin. Over the past five months, Moscow has appointed an occupation administration to run the Kherson region and ordered schools to teach the Russian curriculum. Local people are encouraged to apply for Russian passports to access pensions and other benefits. The next stage of the Kremlin’s plan is a referendum, to add a dubious sense of legality to these facts on the ground, and create a pretext for bringing Kherson and other occupied parts of southern Ukraine into Russia, using an updated version of the 2014 Crimea playbook. “You have to remember there was never any talk in Kherson of a referendum; no one thought about it before the war. Now it will be a referendum at gunpoint,” said Kostyantyn, who worked in the IT sector before the occupation, told Shaun Walker and Pjotr Sauer. Calls grow for a Russian visa ban Thousands of Russians have flocked to Europe on short-term visas since the country invaded Ukraine, Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer report. Some sought an escape from repression, while summer has brought Russian tourists just looking to escape to the beach. Now some European politicians are calling for an end to the short-term visas that allow Russians to holiday in the EU as the war in Ukraine rages on. “They need to see a free world,” said Ilya Krasilshchik, a Russian online publisher who has been threatened with prosecution in Russia for opposing the war and is currently in Europe. “The experience of the Soviet Union shows that closing borders doesn’t lead to overthrow of the regime.” The British passport-holding son of a Russian businessman said wealthy Russians would probably find a way around any ban. “The elite will always find a way to get to Europe,” he said. “Many of my generation went to school here. We have lived long enough in the west to receive residency permits or a second passport … There will always be loopholes for those with money.” Our visual guide to the invasion is updated regularly and can be found here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T17:05:03Z","webTitle":"Germany to delay phase-out of nuclear plants to shore up energy security ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/05/germany-to-delay-phase-out-of-nuclear-plants-to-shore-up-energy-security","fields":{"headline":"Germany to delay phase-out of nuclear plants to shore up energy security ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Germany is to temporarily halt the phasing-out of two nuclear power plants in an effort to shore up energy security after Russia cut supplies of gas to Europe’s largest economy. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, announced on Monday that the power plants, Neckarwestheim in Baden Württemberg and Isar 2 in Bavaria, are to be kept running longer than planned in order to be used as an emergency reserve until the middle of next year. Habeck said that after a stress test carried out with four grid operators, considered worst-case scenarios, they had come to the conclusion that “hourly crisis-like situations in the electricity supply system during winter 22/23, while very unlikely, cannot be fully ruled out”. He insisted that Germany had “very high supply security” and that the two nuclear plants should remain “on standby until mid-April 2023, in order, if necessary, to provide an additional contribution to the electricity grid in southern Germany”. The nuclear power plants would be available for operation, and fully staffed, but only on standby and would not produce electricity unless it was deemed necessary. He insisted that Germany would continue to stick by its plans – regulated by law – to withdraw from nuclear power. The plants were due to be mothballed by the end of December, the last of Germany’s nuclear power plants to cease working, after a dramatic 2011 decision by Angela Merkel, the then chancellor, in reaction to the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. The extraordinary upending of energy markets since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February has however led to a dramatic rethink. Power bills across the continent have been soaring in light of dwindling supplies, putting households and businesses under extreme pressure as winter approaches. The sense of urgency increased when Russia failed to turn on the fifth and last functioning turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which had carried gas from Russia via the Baltic Sea to Germany. Moscow cited faults on the line, which it said were linked to the sanctions imposed on it. Discussions on extending the lifetime of the plants have triggered a heated debate in Germany, where nuclear power has been a source of controversy for decades. An announcement by Habeck, a leading figure in the anti-nuclear Green party, on restarting the plants would once have been unthinkable, but the party has come under increasing pressure, especially from its coalition partner, the pro-business FDP, to pause the phase-out. Many in the FDP hope that today’s announcement may lead to a complete rethink on the phase-out policy, arguing that nuclear power would help Germany achieve its zero-carbon emission goals sooner, as well as helping to secure long-term energy security. The Green party has rejected this position. “In the winter, our towns and cities will in part be darker because of the fact we have to save electricity. In this situation we should not forgo safer and climate-friendly ways of producing electricity such as nuclear power. This requires more than just extending their operation,” said finance minister Christian Lindner, who is head of the FDP. Already Germany had been forced to restart mothballed coal-fired power plants, considered the most environmentally damaging source of fuel, which Habeck has stressed was a temporary and painful but necessary measure. So far polls show that the majority of Germans are understanding of the need to at least temporarily revert to nuclear power, given the urgency of the situation, even if they don’t like it. Habeck has also been trying to fill Germany’s gas storage facilities, using supplies from Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. Despite Russia’s total switch-off, storage levels stood at just under 86% on Monday. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, said on Monday that the failure to resume supplies from Nord Stream 1 after the impromptu maintenance work was owing to “problems with pumping gas [that] arose due to sanctions that were imposed against our country”. Extending the lifetime of the plants is, though, not expected to boost Germany’s energy supplies by much. Habeck has said they make up just 2% of Germany’s electricity output. He had repeatedly ruled out resurrecting the plants, while chancellor Olaf Scholz had said it “could make sense”. Scholz unveiled a new series of inflation relief measures on Sunday, amounting to 65bn euros and encompassing everything from a rise in child support to assistance in housing benefit to cover high energy bills. Groups and political parties of the far left and far right have pledged an autumn of protests against higher living costs, the first of which is due to kick off in the eastern city of Leipzig on Monday evening."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/sep/25/ministers-close-to-deal-that-could-end-chinas-role-in-uk-nuclear-power-station","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-25T14:27:28Z","webTitle":"Ministers close to deal that could end China’s role in UK nuclear power station","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/25/ministers-close-to-deal-that-could-end-chinas-role-in-uk-nuclear-power-station","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/sep/25/ministers-close-to-deal-that-could-end-chinas-role-in-uk-nuclear-power-station","fields":{"headline":"Ministers close to deal that could end China’s role in UK nuclear power station","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"Ministers are closing in on a deal that could kick China off a project to build a £20bn nuclear power station on the Suffolk coast and pump in tens of millions of pounds of taxpayer cash instead – a move that would heighten geopolitical tensions. The government could announce plans to take a stake in Sizewell C power station, alongside the French state-backed power giant EDF, as early as next month, ahead of the Cop26 climate summit. That would be likely to result in China General Nuclear (CGN), which currently has a 20% stake in Sizewell, being removed from the project. It risks inflaming political tensions, which are running high after Britain’s decision to join the Aukus nuclear submarine pact with the US and Australia – a move designed to counteract China’s military expansion. CGN, the power giant backed by the communist state, is also bankrolling EDF’s Hinkley Point C power station in Somerset. Sizewell, which is still going through planning and development, would eventually power 6m homes, but has been plagued by opposition from local campaigners, fears over its price tag and China’s involvement. Washington has been leaning heavily on Westminster to remove China from Britain’s nuclear power plans, blacklisting CGN, citing fears over national security and accusing it of stealing military technology – claims it denies. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last year urged Britain to choose sides in the battle to develop nuclear technology, saying it “stands ready to assist our friends in the UK with any needs they have”. Under plans for Sizewell being discussed by Whitehall officials and EDF, the government could take a stake in a development company that will push it through various stages of planning and bureaucracy, sharing the costs with EDF. Private sector investors such as the insurance funds L&amp;G and Aviva would then be lured in at a later stage in return for a government-backed funding model called the regulated asset base (RAB), diluting the taxpayer and EDF. Legislation on RAB funding – the same model used to fund airports such as Heathrow and water companies – is due to progress through parliament next month. EDF’s board is due to hold a meeting in November to discuss pushing Sizewell forward but is understood to be wary about pumping tens of millions into the project without firm commitment from Westminster. EDF has been lobbying intensively for a RAB mechanism, arguing that it could slash the “strike price” – the guaranteed price for Sizewell’s electricity – to between £30 and £60 per megawatt hour. Hinkley’s £92.50 MWh strike price has been criticised as excessive at a time when offshore wind costs are falling. All but one of Britain’s eight existing nuclear power stations, which provide up to 20% of its electricity, are due to close by the end of the decade, resulting in a huge gap in low-carbon power generation. The global gas crunch and soaring energy bills have cranked up the pressure on ministers to act, and ministers are keen to announce a deal on Sizewell next month, ahead of November’s Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to be pushing the Treasury for a large slice of spending on nuclear power in the 27 October spending review. Kicking China off Sizewell would effectively tear up the government’s 2015 deal with CGN, under which it agreed to fund Hinkley and Sizewell, and then install its own reactors at a third site at Bradwell in Essex. The chances of CGN getting approval to build its reactor in Britain are seen as slender. That deal was seen as the pinnacle of the “golden era” between Britain and China. Pressure to remove China has ratcheted up under Joe Biden’s administration, with executives from the US construction giant Bechtel teaming up with Westinghouse, the US nuclear technology company owned by Canada’s Brookfield, to develop another nuclear power station, at Wylfa on Anglesey. In their pitch to the government, they said the project would strengthen the “special relationship”. “Through a successful partnership at Wylfa, the UK and US will share a common interest in promoting the use of this secure, reliable technology in new markets to compete against state-backed Russian and Chinese options,” they wrote. Stephen Thomas, a professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, said: “CGN’s motivation in supporting the Hinkley Point and Sizewell projects was to secure a chance to build its own reactor design at Bradwell. With Bradwell now off the table it’s unlikely they would be interested in the Sizewell investment. “CGN may still persist with approving its reactor design with the UK authorities to secure that gold standard accreditation, but this is where its UK nuclear ambitions are likely to end,” he said. CGN and EDF declined to comment. The business department said: “Nuclear power has a key role to play as we work to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global gas prices. “CGN is currently a shareholder in Sizewell C up until the point of the government’s final investment decision. Negotiations are ongoing and no final decision has been taken.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/feb/14/turkey-syria-earthquake-misinformation-relief-efforts-turkey","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-14T08:00:32Z","webTitle":"False social media posts are hindering earthquake relief efforts in Turkey.

You can help stop that","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A video shared on social media shows a column of thick smoke billowing from a harbour-side building before a cataclysmic explosion. The caption says it is, incredibly, footage of a nuclear power plant in Turkey exploding after the earthquake that ravaged the country. Except Turkey doesn’t have any operational nuclear power plants. The footage actually shows a fertiliser storage facility in the port of Beirut, Lebanon, exploding in 2020. This video is just one of countless posts spreading on social media, falsely claiming to depict catastrophic events in Turkey. Ever since, factcheckers across the world, including Full Fact, have been trying to verify real events, to limit the spread of misleading and dangerous misinformation. Factcheckers on the ground are especially stretched – last Tuesday, our counterparts based in Turkey, Teyit, got in touch to ask for support in stemming the tide of misinformation. Syrian factcheckers, Verify-sy, told us they have had to mostly stop their work due to the damage to their homes. With the death toll now climbing to more than 33,000 people, it’s crucial that those working on the relief efforts have access to good information online. False information can directly hinder aid and disaster relief. People and organisations may be using footage they see online to help identify those affected, or reunite people with missing family members. As far back as 2017, the Canadian Red Cross was trying to educate people about the reliance of victims of a disaster on any information they can find. Misleading content online can prevent those trying to help people getting the right information and support. And for the people affected by this tragedy, the last thing they need to see is their social media feeds clogged with misinformation. Victims don’t deserve to have their traumatic experiences exploited just for the sake of shares, whether well-intentioned or not. In addition, some of these accounts are directly asking for viewers to donate funds, allegedly for the relief effort. Given the inauthenticity of the content being posted, it’s possible they are deliberately exploiting events for personal financial gain. Legitimate fundraising operations such as the Disasters Emergency Committee have now raised more than £50m – it’s important that bad actors are prevented from trying to capitalise on the fact that so many people want to help. It’s understandable that people want to share footage of the tragedy, and more often than not, this is done in good faith. But when we see highly emotive breaking news stories take over our social media feeds, it creates an opportunity for misinformation to thrive. When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, we saw a similar story emerge. It wasn’t long before clips from previous wars, different countries and even video games were being shared across the internet, used to falsely illustrate the war. We even had to fact check the BBC after it used footage of an old Russian military parade that we had debunked the day before. When this sort of tragic event happens, some people unfortunately want to find ways in which they can benefit from the widespread attention to the topic. In our monitoring of online content at Full Fact, we’ve seen accounts set up seemingly with the intention of just gaining influence by posting fake clips of the tragedy. It’s hard to stop the people who appear to be sharing this kind of misinformation for money or fame. But we know that most of them are not malicious, bad actors seeking to exploit a tragedy. They are simply people looking to find and share information in the wake of an upsetting event. And in situations like this, we all have a role to play. When you see a video regarding the earthquake, the first thing to ask yourself is: does this seem plausible? The video claiming it showed a nuclear power plant exploding could be debunked with a quick Google search. Ask yourself if anything in the footage seems obviously out of place? A video we’ve seen claiming to show a tremor in Turkey was actually from Nepal. How do we know this? The cars pictured have Nepalese, not Turkish, number plates. With so much work being done by factcheckers worldwide, it’s also worth checking if the video you’re watching has been debunked already. And if you’re still unsure, we have a toolkit for spotting misinformation online that anyone can access. At times of such tragedy, we can all come together and play our part by being just a little more careful about what we share online. When bad information spreads, it can ruin lives, and in this instance, it can risk hindering the relief effort during a continuing disaster.

Labour has pledged to block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power, proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. The proposals, which Keir Starmer is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland this month, will involve not only a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences but also a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. But Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, said on Sunday that the party had “got it wrong” and risked creating “a cliff-edge with oil and gas extraction from the North Sea”. “We are critical friends of the Labour party and I think this is just a lack of intellectual rigour and thinking about where they have got to on oil and gas,” he said on Sophie Ridge On Sunday on Sky News. “They are focusing on what they think is popular rather than doing the proper thinking to understand what is right for the country.” He said the sector had been promised tens of thousands of jobs in renewable energy “time and time again” but that they “simply have not emerged”, adding: “That has been the sorry state of the renewables industry around the country.” The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said earlier on the same programme that the existing oil and gas fields in the North Sea would run until 2050 and the party was not talking about turning those off. “We are against further new licences being granted and that’s because it won’t do anything for bills, it won’t do anything for energy security, it’s not a long-term answer to jobs and clearly it would be a climate disaster,” Reynolds said. “We have got to understand that the opportunity in front of us, the number of jobs created from clean energy, is far in excess of the existing directly employed workforce in North Sea oil and gas.So it’s not some sort of consolation prize, this is the big prize, the big chance to do that, and we will work with Gary in providing this country with a better transition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/12/skulls-left-scattered-after-ukraine-dam-breach-may-be-from-second-world-war","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-12T14:50:30Z","webTitle":"Skulls left scattered after Ukraine dam breach may be from second world war","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/skulls-left-scattered-after-ukraine-dam-breach-may-be-from-second-world-war","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/12/skulls-left-scattered-after-ukraine-dam-breach-may-be-from-second-world-war","fields":{"headline":"Skulls left scattered after Ukraine dam breach may be from second world war","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The emptying of the vast reservoir along the Dnipro River in Ukraine as a result of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam last week has left mudflats littered with skeletons, according to footage posted online, in a reminder of the region’s violent past. Videos taken on Ukrainian-held and Russian-occupied sides of the Dnipro where the reservoir used to be, show skulls scattered in the ooze, one wearing a second world war helmet. The footage could not be independently verified due to fighting in the area. Historians say some of the remains may be of people who died in a huge battle fought 80 years ago over the same terrain now at the centre of Ukraine’s counteroffensive against Russian occupation, around Nikopol and Kamianka-Dniprovska. The Battle of the Dnipro (or Dnieper, in the Russian version) was the focus of one of the biggest military operations of the second world war, the Soviet army’s counterattack against the German army, involving more than 6 million troops. In late 1943, the focus was on Nikopol, on the right bank of the river, the site of metal ore mines that Hitler was determined to hold on to. Today, Nikopol is a frontline town held by Ukrainians, looking across the mudflats where the reservoir was and the Dnipro, at the occupied town of Kamianka-Dniprovska and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. In late 1943, the Wehrmacht struggled to hold out against troops of the Soviet Southwest Front, led by Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, and they were forced to abandon the town in February 1944. Andrii Solonets, a historian at the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, said: “The losses of Soviet troops ranged from 30,000 to 60,000 people. The losses of German and Romanian troops were up to 20,000 people. So in theory this video showing the helmet and skull could be linked to those events.” An expert on German military relics in Ukraine, Oleksii Kokot, said that while dead Red Army soldiers were buried in the ground, “dead German soldiers were just left lying in the fields … therefore, these could really be German soldiers”. Many of the German bodies were left lying in marshes, which were then submerged with the building of the Nova Kakhovka dam in 1956. Recovering the Wehrmacht remains would involve the German War Graves Commission, but that may have to wait until the current war on the Dnipro has ended."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-23T15:47:19Z","webTitle":"Trump: I would threaten Russia with nuclear submarines if still president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-russia","fields":{"headline":"Trump: I would threaten Russia with nuclear submarines if still president","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"If Donald Trump were still president, he told Fox Business on Monday, he would threaten Russia with nuclear submarines. Trump lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden, who is therefore dealing with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s status as a nuclear-armed power has shaped the US response, particularly in Biden’s reluctance to take steps, such as a Nato-implemented no-fly zone over Ukraine, that might lead to direct armed confrontation with Russia. Such caution cuts little ice with Trump. “I listened to him constantly using the N-word, that’s the N-word, and he’s constantly using it: the nuclear word,” Trump told Fox Business on Monday. In US usage, the “N-word” typically refers to a racist epithet for Black people. “We say, ‘Oh, he’s a nuclear power,’” Trump said. “But we’re a greater nuclear power. We have the greatest submarines in the world, the most powerful machines ever built … “You should say, ‘Look, if you mention that word one more time, we’re going to send them over and we’ll be coasting back and forth, up and down your coast. You can’t let this tragedy continue. You can’t let these, these thousands of people die.” Hundreds of thousands of people would die in any nuclear exchange with Russia. Trump has already said Biden should threaten Russia with nuclear attack. He has also said the US should put the Chinese flag on F-22 jets and “bomb the shit out of Russia”, and then “say, ‘China did it, we didn’t do it, China did it,’ and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch”. He has also praised Putin as “smart” and declined invitations to call him “evil”, stoking speculation about relations between the two men and particularly what was agreed when they met in private in Helsinki in 2018. Trump has also condemned Putin’s war in Ukraine as a crime against humanity. Biden has called Putin a war criminal. When Trump was in power, in 2018, he announced that the US would withdraw from a cold war nuclear weapons treaty which kept US and Russian nuclear weapons out of Europe. It duly did so. New Start, an Obama-era nuclear arms reduction treaty between the US and Russia, remains in place. Analysts have warned that Putin could use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine. The Russian leader has put his nuclear arsenal on high alert. In office, Trump also demonstrated a cavalier attitude to diplomacy regarding North Korea, another nuclear power. Though he courted the dictator in Pyongyang, Trump also told Kim Jong-un he had a “much bigger and more powerful” nuclear button and would answer any threats “with fire and fury like the world has never seen”. He also asked the rapper Kid Rock and rocker Ted Nugent what he should do about North Korea. Writing for the Guardian this month, the former US labor secretary Robert Reich said he like many had thought nuclear powers would “never risk war against each other because of the certainty of mutually assured destruction”. “I bought the conventional wisdom that nuclear war was unthinkable,” Reich wrote. “I fear I was wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jul/05/kremlin-china-president-xi-jining-vladimir-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-07-05T12:46:58Z","webTitle":"Kremlin denies China’s president urged Putin not to use nuclear arms in Ukraine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/05/kremlin-china-president-xi-jining-vladimir-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jul/05/kremlin-china-president-xi-jining-vladimir-putin-nuclear-weapons-ukraine-russia","fields":{"headline":"Kremlin denies China’s president urged Putin not to use nuclear arms in Ukraine","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The Kremlin has denied a report that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had personally warned his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. “No, I can’t confirm it,” Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Wednesday when asked about a Financial Times report that said Xi delivered the message when he visited Moscow in March. Peskov said the two countries had issued statements at the time on the content of their talks, calling all other reports about Xi’s state visit to Moscow “fiction”. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Xi has been unwavering in his support for his “dear friend” Putin, while Beijing has helped to prop up Russia’s sanctions-hit economy. China has also repeatedly expressed publicly its opposition to the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. In November, Xi told the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, that the international community should oppose the threat or use of such weapons and “prevent a nuclear crisis in Eurasia”. Xi reportedly made his nuclear warning to Putin while on his first foreign trip after securing a third term as president, suggesting China was concerned about the possibility that the war in Ukraine would escalate further. Beijing earlier proposed a 12-point peace plan, urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation but critically not suggesting Russia withdraw its forces from Ukraine. Some of Kyiv’s western allies have been sceptical of Beijing’s deterrence credentials given Xi’s “no limits” partnership with Putin. Although the Chinese president has not explicitly endorsed the invasion, he has refused to condemn it and has echoed many of Russia’s justifications for the war, blaming the west for fuelling the conflict by supplying arms to Ukraine. Since ordering his troops into Ukraine, Putin has occasionally issued veiled threats of using nuclear weapons against the country, warning the west last September he was not bluffing when he said Moscow would use “all available means to protect Russia and our people”. Several Kremlin-linked analysts have also advocated for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on Europe. Putin has recently appeared to soften his nuclear rhetoric. Speaking at a conference in St Petersburg last month, he said there was “no need” to use nuclear weapons because the “existence of the Russia state was not threatened”. He added that Moscow had delivered tactical warheads to Belarus, a move described by Nato on Sunday as “dangerous and irresponsible”. According to the Financial Times report, Chinese officials have privately taken credit for convincing Putin to back down from his nuclear blackmail after Xi’s visit to Moscow in March. Kyiv has warned that Russia may be planning to “simulate an attack” on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, claiming that Russian troops have placed “objects resembling explosives” on the roofs of buildings at the site. Citing Ukrainian intelligence, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the objects had been positioned on the roof of several power units of the plant that is occupied by Russia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-10T22:30:03Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt’s budget to announce £20bn funding to cut carbon emissions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2023/mar/10/jeremy-hunt-budget-cut-carbon-emissions-clean-energy-small-nuclear-reactors","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Hunt’s budget to announce £20bn funding to cut carbon emissions","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The chancellor is poised to announce a £20bn investment in technology to reduce Britain’s carbon emissions at next week’s budget, in a riposte to Joe Biden’s flagship Inflation Reduction Act that aims to create thousands of new jobs. Separately, the government plans to add urgency to Britain’s nuclear programme, with a competition to develop small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs). Jeremy Hunt will announce a “reset” of government efforts to clean up the UK’s domestic energy supply and safeguard energy security at next Wednesday’s fiscal showpiece, including efforts to create up to 50,000 highly skilled green jobs. Hunt and the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have been under pressure to respond to Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies, which have attracted a wave of green investment to the US and away from other countries, including the UK. Although the Treasury has sought to play down the scope for tax cuts and spending increases in the budget, better than expected figures for growth and the public finances have provided the chancellor with some additional financial scope on Wednesday. The Treasury said Hunt plans to announce “unprecedented investment” of £20bn spread over the next two decades into carbon capture and low carbon energy projects and “commit to spades in the ground on these projects from next year”. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity such as steel and cement production, transporting it, and then locking it into underground storage sites. The move will comes as a relief to developers of a string of carbon capture projects, which have been awaiting government approval. These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea. The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk. On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs. The government is investing £210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding. Rolls-Royce’s reactor design is now being assessed by the safety regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. However, the government has faced criticism from the nuclear industry at the pace of its decision around SMRs. Britain’s energy system has been under the spotlight since household bills began to rise sharply in late 2021, with further hefty increases after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The government was forced to step in to subsidise bills last year, and Hunt is next week expected to U-turn on a decision to cut support for bills from April. He is thought likely to extend support until July. Hunt said: “We don’t want to see high bills like this again, it’s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.” The energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “Already a global leader in offshore wind power, we now want to do the same for the UK’s nuclear and carbon capture industries, which in turn will help cut the wholesale electricity prices to among the lowest in Europe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-468-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-06T19:33:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 468 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-468-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-468-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 468 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff says he ‘does not understand’ how there are any doubts that Russian forces blew up the dam. In a statement, Andriy Yermak said: “At 2.50am, Russian troops blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and its dam. I do not understand how there can be any doubt about this. Both constructions are located in the temporary Russian-occupied territories. Neither shelling nor any other external influence was capable of destroying the structures. The explosion came from within.” The Kremlin accuses Ukraine of deliberately sabotaging the dam. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesperson, told reporters: “We can state unequivocally that we are talking about deliberate sabotage by the Ukrainian side.” He said [Russian president] Vladimir Putin had been briefed on the situation. The US “cannot say conclusively” who was responsible. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House: “We’re doing the best we can to assess”, noting “destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war”. Earlier Tuesday, NBC News reported that the US government had intelligence indicating Russia was behind the incident, according to two US officials and one western official. The Ukrainian government called for people living downstream to evacuate in the face of catastrophic flooding. Energy company Ukrahydroenergo said the hydroelectric power plant at the dam had been blown up from the inside and was irreparable. The governor of the Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said about 16,000 people were in the “critical zone” on the Ukrainian-controlled right bank of the river. The areas most under threat of flooding are the islands along the course of the Dnipro downstream of Nova Kakhovka and much of the Russian-held left bank in southern Kherson. Andrey Alekseyenko, one of the Russian-installed officials in occupied Kherson, has posted to Telegram to say that up to 22,000 people are in the flood plains in Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s foreign ministry called for an urgent meeting of UN security council to discuss what it called a Russian “terrorist act against Ukrainian critical infrastructure”. There seems to be no immediate safety threat to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam 200km downstream, according to Ukrainian and UN experts. Water from the reservoir affected by the destruction of the dam is used to supply the plant’s cooling systems. The British foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who is in Ukraine, blamed the destruction on Russia’s invasion. “I’ve heard reports of the explosion on the dam and the risk of flooding. It’s too early to make any kind of meaningful assessment of the details,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/apr/07/uk-energy-security-plan-criticised-missed-chance-bills-onshore-wind","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T15:52:10Z","webTitle":"UK energy security plan criticised as missed chance to reduce bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/07/uk-energy-security-plan-criticised-missed-chance-bills-onshore-wind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/apr/07/uk-energy-security-plan-criticised-missed-chance-bills-onshore-wind","fields":{"headline":"PM criticised for failing to push onshore wind or subsidise home insulation ","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s energy security plan has been labelled a missed opportunity to bring down bills rapidly over its failure to fund energy efficiency upgrades or back onshore windfarms in the face of Tory backbench opposition. While the government’s plans set targets for long-term expansion of nuclear, offshore wind and solar capacity, it stopped short of doing so for onshore wind. The proposals also lacked a major intervention to help households lower their gas usage by improving insulation standards. The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said Johnson had been “held to ransom” by backbench opposition to windfarms. Energy experts and environmental groups labelled the plan “inadequate”, warning it would do little to address the urgent need to tackle sky-high bills and reduce dependence on gas imports, including from Russia. The strategy did set ambitious targets for offshore wind generation, with the government raising its target from 40 to 50 gigawatts by 2030. A leaked early draft of the energy plan proposed increasing onshore wind capacity from 15GW to 45GW but the target, first reported by the i newspaper, disappeared from the final edit. Energy executives are understood to have told the prime minister during a meeting last week that onshore turbines offered the cheapest and fastest way to wean the UK off gas, the price of which has rocketed further since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But the government scrapped its initial target, apparently in response to fierce opposition from senior Tories including the chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, who called the turbines an “eyesore”. Instead, the government promised to offer a “limited” number of communities guaranteed lower electricity bills in exchange for supporting local windfarms. Miliband said this would do little to unblock planning restrictions that he said place a “unique burden” on onshore wind, which he claimed could have replaced Russian gas imports within 24 months. Under a moratorium implemented by David Cameron’s government in 2015, onshore windfarms in England require unanimous consent from local communities, meaning they can easily be blocked. “If one person objects, it doesn’t get built,” Miliband told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, adding that it was easier to build an incinerator or a road in the face of local opposition. “The government has rejected the cheapest, lowest cost, most secure forms of power we have … including onshore wind.” Mark Worcester of the Turley planning consultancy said: “Some of the more immediate opportunities appear to have been missed.” Once an onshore windfarm has secured a contract to supply energy, it can be fully operational within about two years, compared with four or five for offshore projects, according to the trade body RenewableUK. Electricity from onshore wind is also about 20% cheaper than offshore, which is in turn cheaper than nuclear or gas. Miliband accused the government of shying away from onshore “not because of the national interest but because some Tory backbenchers said they didn’t want it to happen”. The energy security plan also came in for criticism for failing to map out a return to nationwide home energy efficiency upgrades, which have dwindled dramatically over the past decade. Since 2013, successive government cuts to support for insulation have reduced the number of installations from 2.3m to 10% of that number, according to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, an independent advisory organisation. But the energy security plan contained no new measures to accelerate efficiency efforts, amid a row over cost between the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy. One Whitehall source said the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, had been keen to use about £300m in departmental underspend from the past few years to kickstart a programme of mass home insulations. But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, with whom Kwarteng has previously clashed over financial support for businesses, is understood to have preferred not to commit funding to the plan. The climate thinktank E3G said the gaps in the energy security plan meant that little had been done to address consumers’ energy costs or abandon fossil fuels, including gas and oil imported from Russia. “This isn’t an energy security strategy and will do nothing to bring down energy bills. It is a national security threat and the person who will be happiest with it is Vladimir Putin.” Robert Colvile, head of the Centre for Policy Studies thinktank, said the government had not “taken the opportunity to promote demand-side energy efficiency, including via insulation – which in turn will help reduce the most significant costs and support the push for net zero”. Greenpeace said the plans were “completely inadequate”, while the Association for Renewable Energy &amp; Clean Technology said the government had “failed to rise to the challenge facing the country”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/28/boris-johnsons-energy-strategy-funding-row-with-rishi-sunak","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-28T17:55:23Z","webTitle":"Johnson’s energy strategy held up over nuclear funding row with Sunak","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/28/boris-johnsons-energy-strategy-funding-row-with-rishi-sunak","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/28/boris-johnsons-energy-strategy-funding-row-with-rishi-sunak","fields":{"headline":"Johnson’s energy strategy held up over nuclear funding row with Sunak","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Boris Johnson’s flagship energy strategy has been held up over a row with Rishi Sunak about funding a new generation of up to eight nuclear power stations costing the public more than £13bn. The strategy, which has been delayed for a month, was due to be published this week but has now been pencilled for 5 April after disagreement about the multibillion-pound cost of new nuclear plants and amid ongoing tensions between the prime minister and his chancellor, as well as the wider cabinet. Johnson has told the nuclear industry that he wants 25% of electricity generation to come from nuclear power by 2050, up from 16% now. Whitehall sources told the Guardian this shift could require the building of about eight new nuclear power stations. Draft targets suggest ministers are looking at 30GW of nuclear power capacity, meaning a huge building programme would be needed, as capacity is due to fall to 3.6GW as plants are decommissioned. Of the eight UK plants currently in operation, all but one are due to be switched off by 2030. Each new plant would require the government to take a minority stake in the project to reduce the risk to developers, and substantial cash outlay to encourage investment. Despite Johnson’s keenness for new nuclear power, Sunak is concerned about the cost to the taxpayer, or extra costs added to soaring energy bills. The Treasury has already promised £1.7bn of direct cash for a single large-scale nuclear project – the £20bn Sizewell C – as well as £120m for a new Future Nuclear Enabling Fund, which aims to address barriers to entering the sector. Building eight plants could cost more than £13bn in initial investment costs from the government if the same amount of investment were to be put in, according to a Whitehall source. However, the government is also pushing for the nuclear industry to reduce its build costs. Officials also expect No 10 will approve an energy bill to set targets and strategy for energy security, which would be unveiled in the Queen’s speech in May. A nuclear financing bill is already due to get royal assent next week, allowing new nuclear power station owners to get more stable returns and aimed at getting institutional investors to put money in, but the government is still expecting to have to take stakes in new projects. It also allows the cost of new nuclear power stations to be loaded on to household bills – a move that is politically unpalatable given the rising cost of gas and electricity bills. Downing Street sources denied any “showdown” between Johnson and Sunak, who are due to sit down and “talk calmly” through energy strategy issues in the next few days. A Treasury source said negotiations were ongoing and were complex because they involved funding far beyond the current spending round. If an agreement cannot be reached by 14 April then the strategy may have to be delayed until after the May local elections because major announcements cannot be made during the “purdah” period beforehand. There is separately understood to be a disagreement over the Treasury resisting extra money for energy efficiency measures. No 10 is pushing for a big expansion of offshore wind and is “open-minded” about more onshore wind, which would need a loosening of current planning laws. There is less controversy with the Treasury on this issue as renewables do not need additional subsidies. However, many Conservative MPs with rural constituencies are opposed to more turbines in their seats. Under draft plans, there is a move to give communities near onshore wind turbines a discount on their bills and more of a collective say over the projects, rather than permitting them to be blocked by just one individual under current rules. One government source said it was “all about cost” and that the Treasury also seemed keener on battery storage for renewables than on the government taking big stakes in renewable projects. The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and a move against allowing Chinese investment to Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2021/may/15/weatherwatch-does-nuclear-power-really-keep-the-lights-on","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-15T05:00:17Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: does nuclear power really keep the lights on?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/may/15/weatherwatch-does-nuclear-power-really-keep-the-lights-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2021/may/15/weatherwatch-does-nuclear-power-really-keep-the-lights-on","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: does nuclear power really keep the lights on?","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The nuclear industry is fond of telling us the sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow, as if people living in Britain did not already know that. But the point atomic enthusiasts are making is that wind and solar electricity generation is not reliable, while nuclear will keep the lights on. But things are a bit more complicated than that. This is partly because large-scale batteries, pump storage in reservoirs and other ways of topping up electricity supplies mean that baseload power provided by nuclear reactors is no longer needed. Another reason is that nuclear output is falling while renewables get ever stronger. Output of electricity over a year is measured in terawatt hours (TWh). In 2020, generation from nuclear was 50.3TWh, down 11% from 2019, partly because of cracks and rust in ageing reactors. Renewable output reached a record high of 120.3TWh. Significantly, 2020 nuclear generation was 13TWh less than in 1989, when nuclear provided 20% of the nation’s electricity, and wind and solar contributions were hardly measurable. Even with the massive station Hinkley Point C being built in Somerset, nuclear power is fading away. To keep the lights on we will have to increasingly learn to carefully manage the power produced by our unreliable weather."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/07/johnsons-political-cowardice-applies-the-brake-to-cheap-energy-as-he-bets-nuclear","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T18:09:57Z","webTitle":"Johnson’s political cowardice applies the brake to cheap energy as he bets nuclear | Nils Pratley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/07/johnsons-political-cowardice-applies-the-brake-to-cheap-energy-as-he-bets-nuclear","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/07/johnsons-political-cowardice-applies-the-brake-to-cheap-energy-as-he-bets-nuclear","fields":{"headline":"Johnson’s political cowardice applies brake to cheap energy as he bets on nuclear","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The two main criticisms of the government’s new energy security strategy are fair. The tiptoeing around onshore wind, which got gentle words of encouragement but no change to planning regulations, looks a case of political cowardice. It is perverse to apply a handbrake to “one of the cheapest forms of renewable power”, to use the government’s own description, when public opinion is broadly supportive of turbines on land. Objections from Tory backbenchers should have been ignored. Equally, the lack of new measures on energy efficiency is bizarre since every serious body, from the International Energy Agency to our own National Infrastructure Commission, has been banging the drum for ages. “A gradual transition following the grain of behaviour” translates as a win for the cold hand of the Treasury. There were two clear positives in the mix, it should be said. First, the target for more offshore wind is genuinely ambitious. A fivefold increase in capacity to 50 gigawatts by the end of the decade is a significant upgrade on the previous aim of 40GW. The target may even be achievable given the current rate of progress. And from the perspective of energy security – the focus of this policy, don’t forget – offshore’s bigger turbines and higher load factors are always going to score well versus onshore. Second, solar was given a boost with the aim (though not a target, note) to increase capacity fivefold by 2035. It is illogical that the government seems more willing to flex planning rules for solar than for wind, but solar is the quiet success story of the renewables revolution. It has outpaced every cost projection over the past decade. Expansion looks the easiest to deliver. Then, though, one comes to the meat of the plan. The big bet on nuclear is, to put it mildly, hopeful. The government is trying to replace current capacity that will largely go offline by 2050 and also double nuclear’s share of electricity supply versus today’s position. The plan strains credibility. Up to eight new reactors – call it four new two-reactor plants the size of Hinkley Point C – is an enormous undertaking. The best that can be said is that it is possible to imagine how events could, possibly, run favourably. Hinkley could arrive within its revised timetable without further cost hiccups. Sizewell C in Suffolk, the next plant on the block, could attract the desired rush of private-sector investors under a new financing model that would allow the juice to be priced within the £60-£70 a megawatt hour range of political acceptability. And success in financing Sizewell could breed confidence and get the show rolling. There are, though, a lot of assumptions in that list. The biggest unknown is whether the government is prepared to back the EPR design – the one used at Hinkley and set for Sizewell – for all the new plants. Logic says it should because mixing and matching designs is a recipe for higher costs and surprises, a point stressed by the energy analyst Peter Atherton. The productivity gain in constructing Hinkley’s second reactor, for example, is said to be 15%. In a complex process, replicating one design has demonstrable value. The government is not, though, at the stage where it can have sufficient confidence to back EPRs wholeheartedly and mean it. Talk of “leading the world” in nuclear construction should therefore be filed under “believe it when you see it”. You have to know what you plan to build to make such boasts. There is an alarming nuclear-sized question mark at the heart of this strategy. Shareholders push supermarkets towards living wage See, resolutions from agitating shareholders can make a difference. Well, the tale of two pay rises for frontline staff in the supermarket sector cannot be attributed directly to the resolution filed at Sainsbury’s by the campaign group Share Action with backing from Legal &amp; General among others. But it probably helped to concentrate minds in the boardroom. Tesco is raising its minimum hourly rate of pay by 5.8% to £10.10 from late-July. Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s is expected to lift the rate for staff in outer London from £10.50 an hour to £11.05, meaning those workers will join colleagues in the rest of the country in getting the real living wage at a minimum. The shareholder resolution called on Sainsbury’s (and, by extension, its main competitors) to get itself accredited as a real living wage employer, which would require it go further. The commitment has to be permanent and third-party contractors such as cleaners and security guards have to be included. But perhaps the pace is quickening. It should. Large supermarket chains should be able to meet accepted definitions of living wages."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-28T18:11:07Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 429 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/28/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-429-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 429 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine’s forces are concluding their preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive against invading Russian troops, the country’s defence minister has said, and are, broadly speaking, ready. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for when the counteroffensive would start but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready. Kyiv has been preparing a counterattack for several months aimed at repelling Russian forces from the east and south. The death toll from a Russian missile strike that hit a nine-storey block of flats in Uman, central Ukraine, has risen to 19, including two 10-year-old children, the regional governor, Igor Taburets, and other local officials have said. The announcement brings the total number of people killed in the wave of pre-dawn strikes to at least 21. Russian missiles also hit a home in the central city of Dnipro, where the city’s mayor, Borys Filatov, said a young woman and a three-year-old child had been killed. Vladimir Putin on Friday said Russia needed to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. Russia’s economy has faced multiple challenges this year, including a weaker rouble, lower energy revenues and further isolation as western countries continue to impose an array of sanctions over its war in Ukraine. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report, issued last August, prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts of what went wrong. Among those who condemned the report was Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who accused Amnesty of “shift[ing] the responsibility from the aggressor to the victim”. A Ukrainian journalist, who formerly worked for the BBC, has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia invaded the country in February 2022. He later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked from 2007 to 2011 at the BBC’s Ukrainian service, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” and “heroic” reporter and news presenter. The UK has signed a £1.9bn deal with Poland to provide the eastern European nation with a British-designed air defence system. Some 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with Common Anti-Air Modular Missiles (CAMMs) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where CAMMs are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine‘s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), which Russia controls, will be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. A small number of International Atomic Energy Agency officials are present at the ZNPP, which is operated by Ukrainian staff working under the orders of Russian forces and the Russian nuclear company Rosatom. A UN committee said on Friday it was deeply concerned about human rights violations by Russian forces and private military companies in Ukraine, including enforced disappearances, torture, rape and extrajudicial executions, Reuters reports. In its findings on Russia, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called on the Russian authorities to investigate allegations of human rights violations committed during the invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but also means those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. Reuters reports that the decree, which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the four regions Russia has claimed and partially controls, sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there – or those holding passports issued by Russia-backed breakaway republics – can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Agence France-Presse cited Spanish media as saying the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine. Reports were emerging that the Russian colonel general Mikhail Mizintsev, known as the “butcher of Mariupol”, has been removed as deputy defence minister in charge of logistics and supplies. Reuters cites a military blogger, Alexander Sladkov, and the news website RBC as saying Mizintsev, who orchestrated the siege of the devastated city of Mariupol last year, was no longer in the role he was appointed to last September. The Kremlin has said Russian military units that have fought in Ukraine will be represented in a parade in Moscow on 9 May to mark the anniversary of the Soviet victory in the second world war, Reuters reports. The holiday is one of the most important in the Russian calendar, usually featuring a huge show of military hardware on Red Square and a speech from President Vladimir Putin."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/26/prigozhin-mutiny-monster-acting-creator-eu-diplomat-josep-borrell","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-26T10:22:29Z","webTitle":"Prigozhin mutiny was monster acting against his creator, says top EU diplomat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/26/prigozhin-mutiny-monster-acting-creator-eu-diplomat-josep-borrell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/26/prigozhin-mutiny-monster-acting-creator-eu-diplomat-josep-borrell","fields":{"headline":"Prigozhin mutiny was monster acting against his creator, says top EU diplomat","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Yevgeny Prigozhin’s aborted mutiny in Russia was “the monster acting against his creator”, the EU’s foreign policy chief has said. “The political system is showing fragilities, and the military power is cracking,” Josep Borrell told reporters in Luxembourg as he arrived for a meeting with ministers from across the 27-member bloc. Wagner group mercenary forces under Prigozhin seized control of military headquarters in southern Russia and began to move towards Moscow on Saturday before suddenly heading back to eastern Ukraine after a deal with the Kremlin. “The most important conclusion is the war against Ukraine launched by Putin and the monster that Putin created with Wagner, the monster is fighting, the monster is acting against his creator,” Borrell said. Borrell said the instability in Russia was dangerous given its nuclear arsenal and would be top of the agenda at the Luxembourg summit, where ministers voted through a promise to top up Ukraine’s military funds by €3.5bn (£3bn). After the daylong summit, Borrell said the EU’s view of the future of Russia had changed in the wake of what he described as an “armed insurrection”. “It is clear now that our vision of Russia is quite different. It is not just a threat because it has military capability of provoking war, which it has shown already, but also internal political instability,” he said, without elaborating on scenarios he said ministers had discussed. “Certainly it is not a good thing to see that a nuclear power like Russia is going into a phase of political instability,” he said. EU foreign ministers were scrambling to digest the fallout from the mutiny at their meeting. The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said Putin was destroying his own country with his “brutal war of aggression” in Ukraine. “We are seeing massive cracks in the Russian propaganda,” she added. Baerbock said the EU would focus on helping Ukraine in its fight to let its people live in peace and freedom. The Swedish minister Tobias Billström said it was too early to do an analysis but that the weekend’s events brought Ukraine’s potential membership of the EU into sharp focus. The most important thing was supporting Ukraine so it could win back its territory, he added. “We will have a good opportunity to sit down and talk about the future policy with regard to Ukraine, when it comes to EU integration,” Billström said ahead of the summit. “And when it comes to giving both political, military, humanitarian and financial support to Ukraine, until Ukraine has restored its territorial integrity completely.” Finland’s new foreign minister, Elina Valtonen, said: “It’s too early to tell where this will lead to. But of course, it’s pretty obvious that the events of the weekend will have continued effect on how Putin is seen internally, but also on how Russia is seen to the outside world. “It is common for authoritarian states that everything seems to be very stable until one day, nothing is stable any more. And I expect such a development for Russia as well.” Ministers approved the 11th round of sanctions against Russia, aimed at stopping Putin circumventing previous sanctions by using third countries to ship crude oil and other products around the world."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-energy-strategy-missed-opportunities","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-07T17:47:18Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s energy strategy: missed opportunities | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-energy-strategy-missed-opportunities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-energy-strategy-missed-opportunities","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on Boris Johnson’s energy strategy: missed opportunities","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A few weeks after the November Cop26 summit concluded in Glasgow, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy published a striking snapshot of public attitudes towards the climate emergency. It showed that popular support for renewable energy, including onshore wind farms, had reached record levels. Given a cost-of-living crunch caused by the rocketing price of fossil fuels, and the new priority of energy independence following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, an imaginative and proactive government would move to harness this enthusiasm and seize the moment. Sadly, Britain is not blessed with such a government. The future energy strategy unveiled by Boris Johnson on Thursday instead carries some of the hallmarks of his flawed government: a prime ministerial penchant for grands projets that may or may not be deliverable; a tendency to be unduly influenced by vocal lobby groups on the right of the Conservative party; and a propensity to set targets without doing the necessary work to enable them to be met. The aspiration that 95% of the UK’s electricity should come from renewable sources by 2030 is admirable, and the commitment to hugely increase offshore wind and solar capacity is significant. But inexplicable lacunae and wrong priorities make this a tale of missed opportunities. The government has placed nuclear power at the heart of its approach, promising that as many as eight new reactors will be built. The realpolitik of meeting net zero targets means that nuclear, as a least worst option, should be part of the future energy mix. But the scale of Mr Johnson’s ambition represents a hugely expensive long-term gamble, the funding of which is conveniently buried somewhere in the long grass. According to the government’s own calculations, the journey from initial investment in a plant to the generation of electricity takes up to 17 years. Meanwhile, far faster routes to fulfilling net zero obligations and driving down spiralling fuel bills have been rejected or ignored. Four out of five members of the public support the use of onshore wind farms, which could be built quickly and cheaply if planning rules were eased. This was rumoured to be on the cards. But Mr Johnson has instead bowed to the nimby instincts of Tory MPs and ministers, whose views are at odds with the mood of the country, but who have the power to make life difficult in parliament. Limited consultations with some “supportive” communities will have next to no impact and a game-changing possibility has been lost. A golden chance to fund greater energy efficiency and better insulation in Britain’s leaky housing stock has also been missed, despite the relief this would afford the less well-off in particular. The Treasury’s apparent refusal to fund the expansion of an existing scheme to help poorer households is particularly callous, given the eye-watering bills that will drop on doormats next winter. But it is also emblematic of an administration that consistently fails to grasp the bigger picture. Promoting demand-side energy efficiency is fundamental in the drive to net zero, but the government must make the transition to green energy attractive, feasible and affordable if people are to take the plunge in their own homes. The public knows that radical action is needed to cope with long-term and short-term energy crises. This flawed strategy for the future demonstrates that the government has yet to find the courage to rise to the challenge."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T18:50:51Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant reconnected to energy grid as UN warns ‘one day our luck will run out’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/mar/09/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-russian-missile-strikes-blackouts-odesa-kharkiv-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant reconnected to energy grid as UN warns ‘one day our luck will run out’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The UN gave an urgent warning regarding Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being disconnected. Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday killed at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. AFP reports Lithuania’s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. A close ally of Alexei Navalny has resigned his post at the opposition leader’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF) after it was revealed that he had signed letters calling for the EU to drop sanctions against several UK-based Russian billionaire oligarchs. Leonid Volkov confirmed he had signed and sent a 2022 letter to Josep Borrell, the EU foreign affairs chief, in which he called for Brussels to relax sanctions on Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and business partners German Khan and Alexei Kuzmichev, in a scandal marked by infighting among Russia’s contentious liberal and opposition circles. “This letter was a big political mistake,” wrote Volkov in a post on Thursday where he uploaded the October 2022 letter to Borrell. “Worse, by doing this, I exceeded my authority – I signed it not in my personal capacity, but on behalf of the organisation. I did not inform my colleagues, and, therefore, I also put them [on the letter].” Volkov said he would resign from ACF International’s board and “take a break from my public socio-political activity”. The organisation had earlier published a list of 6,000 “bribetakers and warmongers” it said should be issued with sanctions by western countries. The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has expressed concern over the recent power outage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine. On Thursday, power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. During a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board of directors held in Vienna, Rafael Grossi criticised the organisation’s complacency in preventing such incidents from happening, noting that its primary role was to ensure nuclear safety. ‘What are we doing to prevent this happening? We are the IAEA, we are meant to care about nuclear safety,’ Grossi told its board of directors in a meeting on Thursday in Vienna. ‘Each time we are rolling a dice,’ he said. You can watch the video here: The German chancellor has said that Putin has shown no willingness to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking to a group of German reporters, Scholz said: “Unfortunately, I see no willingness at the moment,” Scholz was quoted by NBR as saying, adding Ukraine must decide what conditions it is ready to accept for peace. Scholz said that energy supply in Europe’s biggest economy would be sufficient next winter and that the German economy was heading for growth rates last seen in the 1950s and 1960s due to heavy investment in climate protection. Reuters has reported that Russia has introduced personal sanctions against 144 government officials, journalists, lawmakers and other public figures from the three Baltic states who are deemed “most hostile” to Moscow. Reuters reports: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - ruled from Moscow during the Cold War but now members of the European Union and NATO - have been among the strongest critics of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ministry said the move was a response to what it called active lobbying by the three Baltic republics for more sanctions against Russia and to their “interference in our internal affairs, inciting Russophobic sentiments”. Last year, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania began restricting the entry of Russian citizens travelling from Russia and Belarus in response to what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. AFP reports Lithuania’s military intelligence service on Thursday said it estimated that Russia had enough resources to wage two more years of war in Ukraine. You can read the full report below: “Russia had been accumulating weapons and equipment over the long years of the Cold War,” military intelligence chief Elegijus Paulavicius told reporters. “We estimate that (its) resources would last for another two years of a war of the same intensity as today,” he added. He noted that the assessment depended on the perspective that no foreign country would provide military aid to Moscow. Russia has a large amount of weaponry stored in its reserves, which would allow them to “cause enormous damage and increase the costs of restoration,” he said. He spoke alongside his counterpart from civilian intelligence at a presentation of their annual report. Beyond estimates of Russian resources, the report also suggested that Russia’s mobilisation last year showed that support for the war in Ukraine “is not as big as the regime’s propaganda tried to make it seem”. “Dissatisfaction with the regime’s policies is currently taking a passive form: mostly avoiding mobilisation, complaining about poor provision and disarray in the army,” the document said. It also raised the possibility that Russia’s failures on the battlefield, further mobilisation and a sudden deterioration of the economic situation “would have negative consequences for the stability of the regime”. Lithuania, a member of both the European Union and NATO, has been a major backer of Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia in February last year. Serhii Andrushko, a Ukrainian reporter, has said that his country’s struggle for freedom also includes another kind of war - against high-level corruption - which experts think could have more success now as Kyiv strives for European Union membership. Reuters reports: Last month, the Radio Liberty correspondent confronted candidates on camera vying to become Kyiv’s next top anti-corruption official about their personal finances and political ties. That might seem less urgent when soldiers are dying every day, but part of Ukraine’s battle includes shedding any perceived similarities to Russia. “Particularly its attitude to corruption,” Andrushko said. According to Transparency International’s 2022 Corruption Perceptions Index, Ukraine ranked slightly better than Russia but still well below the global average. So reporters like Andrushko say they are working to keep their rulers honest, a job some experts and media insiders said could have more impact now that Kyiv is under pressure to prove it can clean up its act as it seeks membership in the European Union. They said a major political shake-up seen earlier this year, when more than a dozen officials were dismissed amid a flurry of critical domestic press coverage, could be a taste of things to come if Ukraine’s investigative journalists continue. Their focus also shows civil society is embracing its role as a government watchdog even as the war grinds on. “Media are becoming more influential because they’re appealing to the more acute sense of justice among citizens,” said researcher Petro Burkovskyy, of the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation think-tank. They will need to choose stories wisely and back up their reporting, he added, since being sloppy or overly critical can invite public scepticism or even accusations of being unpatriotic. Many journalists are also turning their attention to uncovering Russian war crimes and assets in Ukraine. Here is some more detailed reporting on Ukraine’s national grid being reconnected to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station today. Reuters reports: Back-up diesel generators - a last line of defence to prevent meltdown from overheating reactor fuel - kicked in after external power was lost to the plant early on Thursday, but they have only enough fuel to power it for 10 days. Ukraine blamed Russia for the loss of power to the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Officials in the part of the Zaporizhzhia region which is occupied by Russia called it a “provocation” by Kyiv. The incident renewed fears of an accident at Europe’s largest atomic power station, nearly four decades after the Chornobyl nuclear disaster, but national grid operator Ukrenergo signalled that repairs had been carried out quickly. “Specialists of ‘Ukrenergo’ have restored the power supply of the Zaporizhzhia NPP (nuclear power plant), which was interrupted by today’s missile strikes,” it said in a statement. “The ZNPP is switching from diesel generators to receiving electricity for its own needs from the unified energy system of Ukraine.” Ukrainian officials have accused Russian forces of compromising safety by shelling the site of the plant, forcing power cuts during air strikes and flouting safety measures. Russia has denied shelling the site, and has accused Ukraine of being behind the shelling. “The risks of disaster at the Zaporizhzhia NPP are significantly increasing, and our ability to react to them, to avoid them are significantly decreasing,” Oleh Korikov, acting chairman of the Ukrainian state nuclear safety watchdog, told a news briefing on Thursday. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, also expressed alarm after confirming the back-up generators had kicked in. Calling for a protection zone around the plant, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told the watchdog’s Board of Governors: “Each time we are rolling a dice. And if we allow this to continue time after time then one day our luck will run out.” IAEA monitors are currently on site and Grossi has been pressing both sides to establish a demilitarised “safe zone” around the station. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has reportedly been snubbed by the Oscars for the second year in a row. According to Variety, Zelenskiy had been hoping to appear on this Sunday’s telecast following on from previous cultural appearances but the request has been denied. In the past year, the comedian turned politician has appeared via satellite during the Grammy awards and Golden Globes and within film festivals such as Cannes and most recently Berlin. Last month marked the one year anniversary of Russia invading Ukraine. Zelenskiy had secured Mike Simpson, a top power agent at major agency WME, after his client Aaron Kaufman co-directed Ukraine documentary Superpower made with Sean Penn, who loaned one of his two Oscars to Zelenskiy last year. The actor called it “a symbolic silly thing” but after Ukraine wins the war against Russia, he could bring it back to him. He had previously promised to smelt an Oscar if the Academy didn’t let him speak. “There is nothing greater that the Academy Awards could do than to give [Zelensky] an opportunity to talk to all of us,” he said. Reuters reports that Ukraine will take part in the European Union scheme to jointly buy gas in global markets, to procure 2 billion cubic metres of the fuel ahead of next winter, the EU energy policy chief said on Thursday. EU countries plan to pool demand and sign their first joint gas contracts in the coming months, to help fill storage caverns ahead of peak winter demand as Europe replaces Russian gas. “Ukraine has indicated that on top of their own domestic production, they might need, for a secure winter, another 2 billion cubic metres,” EU energy commissioner Kadri Simson told a news conference on Thursday. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic, who leads the EU’s joint gas-buying, held a video call with international gas suppliers on Wednesday. Sefcovic said Europe was on track to expand its capacity to regasify liquefied natural gas to 227 billion cubic metres by 2024, up from 178 bcm now, as countries swap Russian gas for other supplies. Participating in the EU scheme could help Ukraine to stave off gas shortages. Of the 27.3 bcm of gas Ukraine used in 2021, domestic production accounted for about 19.8 bcm, imports were 2.6 bcm and 4.9 bcm of gas was taken from underground storage. Initial estimates from state-owned energy firm Naftogaz suggest Ukrainian gas production was around 18 bcm in 2022. Ukraine uses little gas to produce electricity, but relies on the fuel for heating and industry - sectors vulnerable should Russian strikes damage infrastructure. Ukraine does not import gas directly from Russia, but Ukrainian pipelines still carry some Russian gas to Europe. Russia has bombarded Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in recent months, and on Thursday launched missile strikes across Ukraine, killing at least six civilians and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Kadri Simson said she would convene an emergency video call with Ukraine and EU energy ministers on Thursday to discuss the situation at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, after Kyiv said Russian attacks had severed the plant from the power grid and forced it onto emergency diesel power. Russian strikes hit targets across a sleeping Ukraine early on Thursday. The capital, Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, were some of the places struck by a barrage of missiles, knocking out power to several areas. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv and the strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that the European Union is completely ignoring any talks on the need to carry out an investigation of the Nord Stream gas pipeline blasts, Reuters reports. Russia has repeatedly asked to be allowed to join the investigations into the blasts, which ruptured three of the four pipelines of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas links that connect Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Earlier today the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, described it as “incomprehensible” that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that the south command of the Ukrainian armed forces has claimed to have destroyed a Russian self-propelled artillery installation on the Kinburn spit. The claim has not been independently verified. The Kinburn spit is a stretch of land that stretches out from Kherson oblast to the west, and is opposite the southern coast of Ukraine that runs from Odesa to Mykolaiv. It is currently occupied by Russian forces. Kherson is one of the regions of Ukraine that Russia partially occupies and claims to have annexed. Petr Pavel, a former Czech army chief and high-level Nato official, took the oath of office to start his five-year term as Czech president on Thursday. Pavel beat populist former prime minister Andrej Babiš in a January election on pledges to firmly anchor the central European country in the European Union and Nato, a turn away from the policy of predecessor Miloš Zeman, who had tried to boost relations with Russia and China. Pavel, a social liberal who campaigned as an independent and gained the backing of the centre-right government, has tried to convey a message of unity after the divisive Zeman, who retired after 10 years in office on Wednesday. Reuters reports Czech presidents do not have many day-to-day duties, but they pick prime ministers and central bank heads, have a say in foreign policy, are powerful opinion makers, and can push the government on policies. Pavel has fully supported continued aid for Ukraine in its defence against Russia’s invasion. The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in southeastern Ukraine was reconnected to Ukraine’s energy grid on Thursday, Ukrainian grid operator Ukrenergo said. Reuters reports that the Ukrainian state nuclear energy company Energoatom had said earlier on Thursday that power to the Russian-occupied plant was lost during Russian air strikes. Speaking to the BBC, the Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun said she believed that Russia’s latest assault on the country was an attempt to make citizens feel as though the country was “not safe” to continue living in. Sovsun added that she thought the primary purpose of the attacks was to “make sure everybody feels scared” after a period of relative safety in the country’s capital, Kyiv. Reuters reports that local security services in the Moscow-backed breakaway Transnistria region of Moldova said on they had thwarted a Ukrainian assassination attempt against the region’s leader, according to Russian state news agencies reported. Reuters reports: Kyiv rejected the claims as a Kremlin “provocation”, the latest in a series of allegations, claims and counterclaims over escalating tensions in the territory, wedged along Ukraine’s south-western border with Moldova. It was not immediately clear whether the Transnistrian officials had provided evidence to support their claim. “The ministry of state security informs about the prevention of a terrorist attack. On the instructions of the Security Service of Ukraine, a crime was being prepared against a number of officials. The suspects have been detained,” the Russian state-run Tass news agency quoted the ministry as saying. In response, the Security Service of Ukraine said in a statement that the accusation “should be considered exclusively as a provocation orchestrated by the Kremlin”. It added: “Lies and provocations are the weapons (Russia) actively uses. But today the entire world sees the true face of the aggressor country and does not believe the statements of Russia or its satellites.” Transnistria, a mainly Russian-speaking territory which borders Ukraine, broke from Moldova’s control in 1990, a year before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and is dependent on Russian support. Its allegiance to Moscow and location on Ukraine’s western border have been a constant cause of concern since Russia invaded that the war could spread to the region. Last month, Russia accused Ukraine of planning to invade Transnistria after staging a ‘false flag’ operation there, a claim Kyiv denied. Moldova also rejected Russia’s claim. Moscow also said it would view as an attack on itself any actions that threatened Russian peacekeepers stationed in Transnistria. In a statement this morning about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, told his board of governors that urgent action was needed to protect the site’s safety and security. He said: “This is the sixth time – let me say it again sixth time, that ZNPP has lost all off-site power and has had to operate in this emergency mode. Let me remind you - this is the largest nuclear power station in Europe.” He added: “What are we doing? How can we sit here in this room this morning and allow this to happen? This cannot go on. I am astonished by the complacency. What are we doing to prevent this from happening? Each time we are rolling a dice, and if we allow this to continue then one day our luck will run out”. You can read an explainer regarding the significance of the power plant here: The South Korean company Hyundai Motor Co is in talks with a Kazakhstan company over the sale of its manufacturing plant in Russia, it has been reported. Reuters reports: Many factories in Russia have suspended production and furloughed workers due to shortages of hi-tech equipment because of sanctions and an exodus of western manufacturers since Moscow invaded Ukraine last year. The local government in St Petersburg has been negotiating with Kazakhstan to sell Hyundai’s Russia plant, Yonhap news agency reported, citing a Tass report. Yonhap reported that negotiations to sell Hyundai’s plant in St Petersburg to an auto-related company in Astana, Kazakhstan, are in the final stage, citing an unnamed source. The deal could be signed as early as June, it said. Hyundai suspended operations at its Russian factory last March. Hyundai was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. Intense fighting has continued in and around the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. The below graphic shows the Russian military advances within the region. A residential building in Lviv oblast has been targeted by Russian missiles. Maksym Kozytskyy, the head of the Lviv oblast administration, released drone footage showing the aftermath of the attack on Thursday. A fifth person had died in overnight strikes, the governor said. Reuters has reported more details on the Russian missile strikes across Ukraine while people slept on Thursday, killing at least six civilians, knocking out electricity and forcing a nuclear power plant off the grid. Reuters reports: The first big volley of missile strikes since mid-February shattered the longest period of comparative calm since Moscow began a campaign to attack Ukraine’s civil infrastructure five months ago. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said infrastructure and residential buildings in 10 regions had been hit. “The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done,” Zelenskiy said in a statement. At least five people were killed in a missile that destroyed a village house in the western Lviv region, according to emergency services. Drone footage from the area, some 700 km (440 miles) from any military battlefield, showed a flattened home surrounded by badly damaged buildings. Another civilian was reported killed by the missiles in the central Dnipro region. Three civilians were separately reported killed by artillery in Kherson. In the capital Kyiv, residents were awakened by explosions. A seven-hour air strike alert through the night was the longest of the Russian air campaign that began in October. “I heard a very loud explosion, very loud. We quickly jumped out of bed and saw one car on fire. Then the other cars caught on fire as well. The glass shattered on the balconies and windows,” said Liudmyla, 58, holding a toddler in her arms. “It’s very frightening. Very frightening. The child got scared and jumped out of bed,” she said. “How can they do this? How is this possible? They are not humans, I don’t know what to call them. They are frightening the children, their mental state will be disrupted.” Moscow says its campaign of targeting Ukraine’s infrastructure far from the front is intended to reduce its ability to fight. Kyiv says the air strikes have no military purpose and aim to harm and intimidate civilians, a war crime. Ukrainian officials said Moscow had fired six of its kinzhal hypersonic missiles, an unprecedented number, which Ukraine has no way of shooting down. Russia is believed to have only a few dozen of the missiles, which President Vladimir Putin regularly touts in speeches as a weapon for which NATO has no answer. Ukraine said the missiles had knocked out the power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, severing it from the Ukrainian grid. The plant, which Russia has held since capturing it early in the war, is near the front line and both sides have warned in the past of a potential for disaster there caused by fighting. Moscow said the was being kept safe on diesel backup power. “Everything is absolutely normal: the specialists at the plant are working quite professionally, the automation has started up,” Renat Karchaa, an adviser to the CEO of Russian state energy firm Rosenergoatom, said on state TV channel Rossiya 24. “There is no threat or danger of a nuclear incident. There is more than enough fuel and, if necessary, it will be supplied to the plant.” Alessio Mamo has been at the scene of today’s strike on Kyiv for the Guardian. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it had been “a difficult night” as Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 81 missiles in total, alongside eight Shahed drones. It claimed to have shot down 34 cruise missiles and four of the drones. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, reported five people had been killed in a strike on the Zolochiv district. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, said two women in their 70s had been injured by a strike on Pisochyn. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, reported that three people were killed in the southern city of Kherson. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for ten days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. It took two weeks for power to be restored. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia was among the countries that had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. Transnistria’s security forces claim Ukrainian security services were the source of the plans. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multi-billion dollar pipelines last September. He added that it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. In a visit to Kyiv on Wednesday, UN secretary general António Guterres told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. The Kremlin, however, said on Thursday there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the deal, and that there were currently no plans for a direct meeting with Guterres. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tobi Thomas will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Another series of air raid sirens have just sounded across Ukraine, including in Odesa and Kherson in the south, Lviv in the west and Sumy in the north. The air raid alert in Kyiv overnight lasted for seven hours, as a total of 81 missiles were fired at targets across the country by Russia. Reuters reports that the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday, during a press conference with his Saudi counterpart, that Saudi Arabia and other countries had facilitated prisoner of war swaps with Ukraine. The Kremlin said on Thursday it doubted the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines could have been carried out without state support, after the New York Times reported that a pro-Ukrainian non-government group might have been responsible for the blasts. Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was vital to identify who was behind the attacks which ruptured the multibillion-dollar pipelines last September. He added it was incomprehensible that Russia would blow up its own infrastructure. German prosecutors confirmed yesterday that investigators had searched a boat that may have been used in the bombings. Earlier today our First Edition newsletter carried some analysis of the situation, with Archie Bland speaking to our defence editor, Dan Sabbagh. Here is what they had to say about the range of people who might be considered responsible for the attack: While the consequences for European energy supplies have not ultimately proven severe, there are wider implications, Sabbagh said. “Technically this is an attack in international waters, but it’s within the Nato sphere. It’s infrastructure well beyond Russia and Ukraine, so it triggered a lot of anxiety about the security of other assets. It makes the war uncomfortably close.” If any country with a stake in the region were proven responsible, that would have significant consequences of its own. If the US or a Nato or EU country was behind the attack, that would cause a serious rift in the western alliance in support of Ukraine. If Ukraine did it, fears that Kyiv was acting recklessly would probably diminish their support in Europe and the US – particularly, for obvious reasons, in Germany. And evidence of Moscow’s culpability “would be a new frontier in Russian aggression,” Sabbagh said. While a Russian act of sabotage on a Russian-owned piece of infrastructure would not clearly amount to an act of war, the material damage to future gas supplies “would further unite the west against Putin”. You can read more of that analysis here: The mystery of the Nord Stream sabotage – and who may be responsible Ukraine will take part in European Union countries’ scheme to jointly buy gas, the bloc’s energy policy chief said on Thursday. “We have integrated Ukraine in the gas joint purchasing platform with a view to help secure 2bn cubic metres of additional gas,” Reuters reports the EU energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, told a meeting of EU lawmakers. EU countries plan to sign their first contracts to jointly buy gas by this summer. The Kremlin said on Thursday that there were still “a lot of questions” remaining over the Black Sea grain deal, and that there were currently no plans for a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres. The deal, which allows grain to be safely exported from Ukrainian ports despite a Russian naval blockade, expires on 18 March, but cannot be extended if Russia objects. Moscow has already signalled it is unhappy with aspects of the deal, as it seeks to expand the markets for its own agricultural products. Ukraine has said it will seek to extend the deal for at least a year, and wishes the port of Mykolaiv to be included. Kyiv said Russian shelling killed three people on Thursday in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, as Moscow unleashed a wave of missile strikes overnight. “Russian terrorists shelled Kherson in the morning. They hit … a public transport stop. Three people died as a result of the shelling,” AFP reports Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said on social media. Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass is reporting that security services in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria claim to have foiled an assassination attempt on the internationally unrecognised leader, Vadim Krasnoselsky. In its report Tass writes: Assassination attempts on a number of officials of Transnistria were prepared on the instructions of the Ukrainian security service (SBU), the ministry of state security of the republic reported. Suspects of preparing an assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria were detained and are giving confessions. The impending assassination attempt on the leader of Transnistria is qualified as a preparation for a terrorist attack. The prosecutor of Transnistria said that the SBU was preparing a terrorist attack using a car bomb in the center of Tiraspol. The claims have not been independently verified. Transnistria, which attempted to break away from Moldova in the early 1990s, borders Ukraine’s west and has Russian troops stationed there. Slovakia needs to make a decision on sending MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, the country’s defence minister, Jaroslav Nad, said on Thursday, adding Poland has expressed willingness to act jointly in this matter. “I think it is time to make a decision,” Reuters reports Nad said on Facebook. “People are dying in Ukraine, we can really help them, there is no room for Slovak politicking.” The governor of Lviv region, Maksym Kozytskyi, has given further details of the strike that has killed five people. In a message on Telegram he posted to say: Today, around 4 o’clock in the morning, an enemy missile fell in the Zolochiv district during an air raid. Three men and two women who were at home at that moment died. The fire destroyed three residential buildings, three cars, a garage and several outbuildings. The fire was extinguished. The demolition of the destroyed buildings has already been completed. 28 rescuers, five units of special equipment and a canine team were involved in the work. Drone footage shows the aftermath of the strike. The regional governor said air defences shot down missiles over Lviv, but “I cannot say exactly how many missiles were destroyed over our region, the relevant services have asked not to make this information public” and he urged the public not to release details. Kozytskyi went on to say: As usual, during the day, internally displaced people arrived in our region by evacuation trains, and people also left by train to Przemyśl [in Poland]. In the districts of Lviv oblast, humanitarian aid was collected and handed over to soldiers on the frontlines and to residents of frontline settlements, cars were sent to the defenders. Our foreign partners transferred aid to the communities of the region. Everyone lived yesterday, doing good deeds and getting closer to victory in their place. But we woke up to sirens, and news about the dead. We will never forget this day. We will never forgive. And we will direct all our efforts to revenge and the return of justice. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has described the overnight strikes on Ukraine as without military purpose and “just Russian barbarism”. In a tweet he said: Russia launched a massive missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight, leading to loss of lives and damaging civilian infrastructure. No military objective, just Russian barbarism. The day will come when Putin and his associates are held accountable by a special tribunal. Reuters reports that Nato member Denmark has confirmed that Troels Lund Poulsen will continue to act as acting defence minister in the absence of Jakob Ellemann-Jensen. Ellemann-Jensen, 49, was briefly admitted to hospital in February after making a trip to Ukraine and has been on an indefinite period of sick leave. At the time he said in a Facebook message: “I have been unusually busy for a long time. Now my body is sending me a signal that it’s time to take a break, if not it’s going to end badly.” Here are some more of the images to come out of Kyiv today. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to his official Telegram about the night’s events, writing: It’s been a difficult night. A massive rocket attack across the country. Kyiv, Kirovohrad, Dnipro, Odesa, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia regions. Attacks on critical infrastructure and residential buildings. Unfortunately, there are injured and dead. My condolences to the families. All services are working. The energy system is being restored. Restrictions were imposed in all regions. The enemy fired 81 missiles in an attempt to intimidate Ukrainians again, returning to their miserable tactics. The occupiers can only terrorise civilians. That’s all they can do. But it won’t help them. They won’t avoid responsibility for everything they have done. We thank the guardians of our skies and everyone who helps to overcome the consequences of the occupiers’ sneaking attacks. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, has posted this summary to Telegram of the latest news to emerge from the overnight strikes. It reports: In Kyiv, the alarm lasted for about seven hours. Two people were hospitalised due to falling rocket fragments. Five people were killed in the Zolochiv district of the Lviv region due to a rocket hitting a residential area, one person was killed and two were injured in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Energy infrastructure and industrial enterprises were also damaged in the region. About 15 strikes were made in Kharkiv and the region, two people were injured. Critical infrastructure was targeted. Metro and electric transport are not working. In Kirovohrad oblast, Odesa oblast and Zhytomyr oblast, energy infrastructure facilities were hit. Also, according to preliminary information, there are hits in Vinnytsia. At night, electricity restrictions were applied preventively in all regions to reduce risks to the system. Emergency power outages were used in regions where infrastructure was damaged. Kharkiv region and Zhytomyr region are partially de-energized. Kharkiv is completely without electricity. The claims have not been independently verified. Here are some more images from the scene of the strike in Kyiv. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, has announced that a fifth person has been killed in overnight strikes. He posted to Telegram to say: The number of people killed as a result of the fall of the rocket in the Zolochiv district has increased to five. The body of another man, born in 1963, was discovered under the rubble. Sincere condolences to the relatives. Ukraine’s air force has issued a statement via Telegram on the wave of attacks from Russia overnight. In it, it claims that “the defence forces of Ukraine destroyed 34 cruise missiles … as well as 4 ‘Shahed-136/131’ unmanned aerial vehicles”. It claims that a total of 48 Kalibr-type cruise missiles had been fired by Russia. It described the attack as featuring “81 missiles of various types” in total, and that “the launches were carried out from 10 Tu-95 strategic aircraft, seven Tu-22M3 long-range aircraft, eight Su-35 fighters, six MiG-31K aircraft and three Kalibr KR carriers in the Black Sea”. It adds: “As a result of organised countermeasures, 8 Kh-31P and Kh-59 guided air missiles did not reach their targets. It is worth noting that the armed forces of Ukraine do not have means capable of destroying Kh-22 and Kh-47 ‘Kinzhal’ and S-300.” The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that energy company DTEK has reinstated power in Dnipropetrovsk. Oleh Synyehubov, governor of Kharkiv, has provided this update via Telegram on the situation overnight in his region. He wrote: The enemy launched a massive rocket attack on Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region. At least 15 arrivals of S-300 missiles were recorded. Critical infrastructure objects are hit. In addition, a civil infrastructure object was damaged in the city of Kharkiv. Synyehubov said two women in their 70s were injured in Pisochyn, with one of them hospitalised, and that an agricultural facility was damaged in Slobozhanske. He added that during the previous day, multiple settlements had been shelled with the result that “houses and commercial buildings were damaged, fires broke out”. Here are some of the latest images we have received over the news wires of the aftermath of strikes on Kyiv overnight. That’s goodbye from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I’ll be handing over to my colleague Martin Belam shortly. Here is what happened overnight, as Russia launched mass strikes across a sleeping Ukraine: Russian strikes hit targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. “At this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them,” said Maksym Kozytskyi. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were reported in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. Strikes cut off Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant from the power grid, the company Energoatom said. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he won’t meet with Vladimir Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet Putin, Zelenskiy said: “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that.” Four people have died in Russian missile strikes on the western region of Lviv, the head of the regional military administration said on Telegram. “Residents of Lviv oblast, an air alert lasted for four hours this night … In Zolochiv district, an enemy rocket fell in a residential area. A fire started. It has already been extinguished,” said Maksym Kozytskyi. “At this moment, it is known about four dead. These are four adults. Two men and two women. They were at home when the rocket fell. The debris is still being sorted out. There may be other people under them.” Three residential buildings were destroyed. Kozytskyi posted a video of the damage: More now on Zaporizhzhia. The statement from state energy company Energoatom says: On the night of 9 March, the enemy delivered another barbaric massive attack on the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. “As a result of shelling, the last line that fed the ZNPP was damaged. Now the station works on diesel generators. The Russians are putting the world on the brink of a nuclear catastrophe. And this is the day after the negotiations with the UN on the demilitarization of the ZNPP,” said Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Galushchenko. Also, as of 6,30am on 9 March, shelling of energy facilities was recorded in the Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhya, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zhytomyr regions. Here is our wrap of the attacks overnight: Volleys of Russian missiles struck targets across Ukraine early on Thursday, including Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second city of Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, cutting power. Residential areas were also hit, but no casualties were immediately reported. Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klitschko has just confirmed that one of the explosions was an attack on a power facility, and that 40% of Kyiv’s residents are now without heating. It is currently 4C. “After the missile attack, due to emergency power outages, 40% of the capital’s consumers are currently without heating. Water supply works normally,” he said on Telegram. It is currently 8am in Kyiv. Here is a summary of what has happened overnight: Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the capital Kyiv, the Black Sea port of Odesa and the second-largest city Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The attacks struck a wide arc of targets, including cities stretching from Zhytomyr, Vynnytsia and Rivne in the west to Dnipro and Poltava in central Ukraine. Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said explosions were registered in the south-western part of the city and rescue services were on their way. Two people were injured. Power supply has been cut pre-emptively to about 15% of Kyiv residents, he said. The strikes cut Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant off from the power grid, the company Energoatom announced on Thursday morning. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from Ukraine’s National Grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Zelenskiy said he won’t meet with Putin until Russia leaves Ukraine. Ukraine’s president appeared on CNN on Wednesday night in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word” and “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that”. Here is a photo from Svyatoshyn in Kyiv, where missile strikes set cars alight: Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been off from the Ukrainian power grid, the power company Energoatom announced this morning. “Today, the last line of communication between the occupied Zaporizhzhia NPP and the Ukrainian power system has been cut off. Fuel for operation remains for 10 days,” the company said in a statement. In August last year fires caused by shelling cut the last remaining power line to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, temporarily disconnecting it from the grid for the first time in nearly 40 years of operation. Then, it took two weeks for power to be restored to the plant. Missile strikes in Zhytomyr have left people in the city without water, according to the mayor. Air sirens are sounding in Mykolaiv, the governor, Vitalii Kim, has just said on Telegram. Electricity supply has been cut for 15% of people in Kyiv, the mayor, Vitalii Klychko, said. Kyiv mayor Vitalii Klychko has confirmed that there has been another explosion in the city, this time in Svyatoshyn district. He said that there were two people injured. “Another explosion in the capital. Svyatoshyn district. All services go to the place. Cars are burning in the yard of one of the residential buildings. The air alert continues. Stay in shelters! Two injured in Sviatoshyn district. Medics provide assistance on the spot.” The CEO of Ukrainian power company Yasno, Serhii Kovalenko, has said that emergency power cuts have been put in place due to the mass strikes. “Morning. Emergency blackouts are used due to the enemy attack. This is a preventive step, as you all remember,” he said. It is currently 7.20 am in Kyiv. The Kyiv Independent reports that, according to one of its journalists, another loud explosion was heard in Kyiv a few minutes ago. “This is nowhere near over,” The British Ambassador to Ukraine has just said on Twitter. Maxim Tucker of the Times has posted a video of what he says is smoke rising from Kyiv thermo-electric power station this morning: New Voice of Ukraine journalist Euan MacDonald said that the Kyiv explosion was “near Troyeshyna on left bank of Dnipro (there’s a heat-power plant nearby). Must have been a big bang if I heard it 10km?” Kyiv’s mayor has reported that Russia has struck Kyiv during its latest mass strikes accoss Ukraine. “Explosions in the Holosiiv district of the capital. All services follow in place. More details later,” Kyiv’s Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said on Telegram a few minutes ago. Reporters in Kyiv said they heard a loud explosion at around 6am. The explosions are part of a pre-dawn wave of mass strikes by Russia launched before dawn on Thursday. Maxim Tucker of the Times posted a video of what he said was smoke rising from a thermo-electric power station in Kyiv: Explosions were also reported in Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas. Air raid sirens sounded across the country. Ukrainian newspaper Dzerkalo Tyzhnia is also reporting an explosion in Kyiv, as well as blasts heard in the city of Sumy, and a drone spotted above the western Lviv region. The Kyiv Post is reporting that one of its journalists has heard explosions in the city amid air raid warnings. The Guardian has not verified this independently. Asked by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer whether the US will send Ukraine F-16 fighter jets Zelensky said, “The fighter jets issue is difficult. We’re waiting for this decision to be taken.” “We really need this and really appeal to the president that they could start training Ukrainian pilots, and President Biden told me that it will be worked upon … I believe that the United States will give us the opportunity to defend our skies,” Zelensky said. Zelenskiy invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in the interview with CNN. When told of the invitation McCarthy told CNN’s Manu Raju that he does not plan to visit Ukraine, and argued that President Joe Biden has not acted quickly enough to aid the country. McCarthy, a California Republican, has said he supports Ukraine but does not support “a blank check,” a position he repeated on Tuesday – even though there is federal oversight of all the dollars that are spent there. Zelenskiy said that his children are still in Ukraine. “My daughter joined the university and she studies there, and my son is attending school in Ukraine,” he said in his CNN interview. “They’re both in Ukraine. They’re very much like other Ukrainian kids. We live with sirens.” “We want victory. We don’t want to get used to war, but we got used to the challenges. Everyone wants one thing: to end the war,” he said. Zelenskiy appeared on CNN this evening in the US, in a pre-recorded interview. When asked by Wolf Blitzer what it would take to get him to meet with Putin, Zelenskiy said, “We don’t have any circumstances to talk to the Russian Federation president because he doesn’t hold his word”. “We don’t have any confidence in him,” Zelensky added. “Russia should leave our territory. And after that, we’re happy to join the diplomatic tools. In order to do that, we can find any format with our partners just after that”. Here is more detail on what local officials have said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. “As a result of a mass missile strike, an energy infrastructure site was hit in the region as well as residences,” Marchenko said on Telegram. He said anti-aircraft units had downed some missiles and new attacks could follow. “Fortunately, there are no casualties. Electricity restrictions are in effect.” Kharkiv region Governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by about 15 strikes. “The enemy made about 15 strikes on the city and region,” he said on Telegram. “Infrastructure was again among the targets. Information on casualties is being clarified.” Another strike was reported in the central city of Dnipro and in the western towns of Lutsk and Rivne, far from the front lines in the year-old war. Air raid sirens are sounding across the country before dawn this morning. BBC Ukraine correspondent Myroslava Petsa wrote on Twitter, “It’s 3 am in Ukraine. Russia won’t let Ukrainians sleep tight tonight. Lots of drones and rockets fired in all possible directions in Ukraine … This is the terror civilians’ve been living through for more than a year already.” Analysts and Ukrainian leaders had expected mass missile strikes during the week of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 24 February. The Kyiv Independent reports that explosions have been heard in several cities and regional communities, but we are waiting for confirmation from local officials. The newspaper listed the cities and regions of Kyiv, Poltava, Lviv, Vinnytsia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Ternopil, Kharkiv, Odesa, Kirovohrad, Dnipropetrovsk among those where explosions were heard. Russian strikes hit a series of Ukrainian regions early on Thursday, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, Reuters reported, citing regional officials. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. Residential areas had also been hit, but no casualties were reported. Kharkiv region governor Oleh Synehubov said the city and region had been hit by 15 strikes, with targets including infrastructure. Other strikes were reported in the central city of Dnipro and regions throughout the country. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest. It’s 5am local time in Kyiv, and we have reports of strikes across Ukraine, including the Black Sea port of Odesa and Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, knocking out power to several areas, regional officials said. The governor of Odesa region, Maksym Marchenko, said on Telegram that a mass missile attack had hit an energy facility in the port city, triggering power cuts. We’ll have more news shortly. In the meantime here are the key recent developments in the war: The city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine’s east, could fall in the next few days, said Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. “What we see is that Russia is throwing more troops, more forces and what Russia lacks in quality they try to make up in quantity. They have suffered big losses, but at the same time, we cannot rule out that Bakhmut may eventually fall in the coming days,” he said. The founder of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, which has been leading the Russian assault on Bakhmut, has said Russian forces now fully control the east of the city. The claims have not been independently verified. The General Staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said in its Wednesday morning report: “The enemy, despite significant losses, continues to storm the town of Bakhmut.” Russia is unlikely to capture significantly more territory this year, according to the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. She told a Senate hearing that the military will probably be unable to carry on its current level of fighting, even with the possible capture of Bakhmut. The Pentagon has been accused of blocking the sharing of US intelligence with the international criminal court (ICC) about Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The defence department is said to be firmly opposed to using the Hague-based ICC, as a means of holding Russian forces accountable for widespread war crimes on the grounds that the precedent could eventually be turned against US soldiers. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has invited top US house speaker Kevin McCarthy to visit Ukraine as doubts over support for Kyiv’s war efforts simmer in Congress, particularly among conservatives. Zelensky proposed the visit in an interview with CNN. Zelensky has also called for “democratic success” in Georgia where thousands of protesters have rallied for a second day, against a controversial “foreign agent” bill, reminiscent of Russian legislation used to silence critics. “There is no Ukrainian who would not wish success to our friendly Georgia. Democratic success. European success,” he said in his evening address to the nation. The US obtained a warrant to seize a Boeing aircraft owned by Russian oil company Rosneft that is valued at over $25m, the Justice Department said. The District Court for the Eastern District of New York authorised the seizure, based on violations of export controls and sanctions against Russia, the Justice Department said. In a visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, UN secretary general, António Guterres, told journalists it was “critical” that a deal that allows safe passage for ships carrying grain out of Ukraine across the Black Sea be renewed, with Ukraine traditionally being one of the world’s largest exporters of grain. A senior UN trade official will meet Russian representatives to discuss the extension of the deal. European Union foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Wednesday he had suggested the bloc spend €1bn for the joint procurement of ammunition for Ukraine and to refill their own stockpiles. “I propose to mobilise another €1bn,” Reuters reported he told the media after a meeting of EU defence ministers in Stockholm. Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg said that it was still uncertain who carried out the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September last year, and that national investigations needed to be allowed to finish. German officials announced that they searched a ship in January that they believe many have been used to transport explosives used in the sabotage. Germany has the lead role in the investigation. Intelligence reviewed by US officials suggested a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022, the New York Times has reported. There was no evidence President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, or his top lieutenants were involved, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials, said the report, citing US officials."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/mar/13/tories-plan-big-expansion-of-wind-farms-to-protect-national-security","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-13T09:45:25Z","webTitle":"Tories plan big expansion of wind farms ‘to protect national security’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/13/tories-plan-big-expansion-of-wind-farms-to-protect-national-security","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/mar/13/tories-plan-big-expansion-of-wind-farms-to-protect-national-security","fields":{"headline":"Tories plan big expansion of wind farms ‘to protect national security’","publication":"The Observer","bodyText":"A massive expansion of wind farms across the UK is now needed for national security reasons, the business secretary has declared, as, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the government considers sweeping changes to planning laws to improve Britain’s energy independence. Boris Johnson is planning to unveil a radical new “energy strategy” within a fortnight to ensure the UK can meet its domestic needs from a mix of renewables and nuclear. The war in Ukraine has brought further huge rises in global fossil fuel prices and exposed countries’ dependence on overseas supplies. Remarkably, the need for more on- and offshore windfarms – traditionally a highly controversial subject in the Conservative party – is now being talked about within government as a matter of security, rather than a way of fighting climate change. Renewables such as wind and solar power are expected to be part of the new government strategy to free Britain from dependence on imported oil and gas and spare households and businesses from the effects of wild fluctuations on global energy markets. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business, energy and industrial strategy secretary, said last week on Twitter: “This is no longer about tackling climate change or reaching net-zero targets. Ensuring the UK’s clean energy independence is a matter of national security. Putin can set the price of gas, but he can’t directly control the price of renewables and nuclear we generate in the UK.” Official figures show that meeting net-zero targets would lead to a drop in gas use of 65% by 2035 in the UK, and almost 100% by 2050. While some Tory MPs also want the moratorium on fracking for shale gas to be lifted to help reduce dependence on imports, cabinet sources said there was no realistic prospect of doing so in the short term, until the process had been proved to be demonstrably safe. Instead a majority of cabinet ministers back a big push for more renewables and an expansion of nuclear. Johnson said last week that all oil imports from Russia would be phased out by the end of this year. In the UK, 4% of gas and 8% of oil currently comes from Russia. The EU sources about 40% of its gas from Russia and 27% of its oil. Sources said changes to planning rules that would make it easier to build windfarms are likely to be announced as part of the new energy strategy. Construction has tailed off since David Cameron tightened regulations when he was prime minister: at the moment local residents can easily block such plans. It is also understood that the government may ease the way for more offshore wind farms, in the teeth of opposition from the fishing industry. Other countries are also using security issues raised by the Ukraine crisis to push urgently for more green and clean energy. Germany’s government announced last week an additional €30bn for its clean energy transition in response to the invasion. Christian Lindner, the finance minister, described renewables as “freedom energies” that could allow Germany a greater degree of energy independence and transform “the economy, society and the state”. Labour has called for an urgent “national sprint” to build a clean, green, secure energy future including more renewables. Ed Miliband, shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, said last week: “Energy security is national security. Homegrown, clean power is the cheaper, more secure route to energy security and sovereignty.” In 2020 renewables generated 43 per cent of Britain’s electricity while gas, oil and coal contributed about 40 per cent. The remaining capacity was filled by nuclear. In October last year Johnson announced that all of Britain’s electricity will come from clean energy sources by 2035. The plan now is to bring that date forward. While many Conservative MPs and party members have opposed windfarms, there are signs of growing support. Kevin Hollinrake, Tory MP for Thirsk and Malton, said: “England’s planning system has blocked nearly all new onshore wind developments in the past five years, despite this being the cheapest source of new electricity generation. Reforming these rules, while ensuring communities still get a meaningful say, will spur investment in homegrown clean energy and accelerate our transition away from expensive fossil fuels.” Sam Hall, director of the Conservative Environment Network, an independent forum for Tories who back decarbonisation, commented: “Streamlining planning approvals and regulations would unleash more wind and solar projects to provide cheap, clean, homegrown power. Now is the time to accelerate the drive towards net zero and away from volatile fossil fuels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/jun/14/peak-in-global-oil-demand-in-sight-before-end-of-decade","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T12:08:10Z","webTitle":"Peak in global oil demand ‘in sight before end of decade’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/14/peak-in-global-oil-demand-in-sight-before-end-of-decade","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/jun/14/peak-in-global-oil-demand-in-sight-before-end-of-decade","fields":{"headline":"Peak in global oil demand ‘in sight before end of decade’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The worldwide peak in demand for oil is “in sight” and could come before the end of this decade, the global energy watchdog has said. The International Energy Agency said the bounceback in oil demand that followed the easing of Covid restrictions was likely to end this year and growth would slow from next year. A potential worsening in the global economy and the long-term transition to cleaner energy sources are expected to hurt demand. The IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, said: “The shift to a clean energy economy is picking up pace, with a peak in global oil demand in sight before the end of this decade as electric vehicles, energy efficiency and other technologies advance.” Global oil demand would grow by 2.4m barrels per day (bpd) in 2023 to a record 102.3m, the IEA said in its monthly report on Wednesday. However, the Paris-based agency expects economic headwinds to reduce growth to 860,000 bpd next year, and increasing use of electric vehicles to help to reduce that to 400,000 bpd in 2028 for overall demand of 105.7m. “The slowdown has been hastened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine amid heightened energy security concerns and by governments’ post-Covid recovery spending plans, with more than $2tn mobilised for clean energy investments by 2030,” the IEA said. Demand for oil from combustible fossil fuels, excluding biofuels, petrochemical feedstocks and other non-energy uses, was likely to peak at 81.6m bpd in 2028, it added. “Oil producers need to pay careful attention to the gathering pace of change and calibrate their investment decisions to ensure an orderly transition,” Birol said. Shell told investors it had ditched plans to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade as it focused on fossil fuels under its new chief executive, Wael Sawan. Energy prices soared last year after Russia, a large exporter of fossil fuels, invaded Ukraine and cut deliveries of natural gas to Europe. Western powers imposed bans and price caps on Russian oil exports in efforts to drain a significant source of cash for Moscow’s war effort. Oil and gas prices have fallen in recent months. However, British households’ energy bills remain about double what they were before the beginning of the energy crisis in 2021. The energy price cap in Great Britain will fall to £2,074 for an average household from July, from the £2,500-a-year level set by the government’s energy price guarantee, which subsidises bills. Last month a report by the IEA showed that clean energy investment was on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turned to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. The agency said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the volatility the war injected into commodity markets, had encouraged greater investment in clean energy. Joe Biden’s $369bn Inflation Reduction Act package of climate subsidies has also enticed investor capital into low-carbon projects in the US, and put pressure on the UK and elsewhere in Europe to respond with greater support for green energy on this side of the Atlantic."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/jun/21/former-tory-ministers-form-group-push-green-policies-next-election","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-21T12:08:19Z","webTitle":"Former Tory ministers push for ‘bold and positive’ green agenda at election ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/21/former-tory-ministers-form-group-push-green-policies-next-election","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/jun/21/former-tory-ministers-form-group-push-green-policies-next-election","fields":{"headline":"Former Tory ministers push for ‘bold and positive’ green agenda at election ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Former Tory cabinet ministers have formed a group to pressure the government to improve its green policies in the hope of making it “credible” in the next general election. Alok Sharma, the former Cop26 president, is urging Rishi Sunak to have a “bold and positive environmental agenda” in the next general election. He joins the former transport secretary Chris Grayling and Simon Clarke, who was the levelling up secretary, in calling for more ambitious climate policies. They will sit on the new steering committee for the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), a group of 159 Tory MPs who pressure the government to improve its green offering. The group was formed a decade ago. The ministers will be calling for Sunak to adopt ambitious policies to unlock more onshore and offshore renewables, improve home energy efficiency, incentivise sustainable transport options, clean up rivers and seas and reward farmers for using nature-friendly practices. In recent weeks, Sunak and government ministers including the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have criticised the Labour party for its green energy policies and the fact one of its donors also donates to the campaign group Just Stop Oil. There are fears among green Conservatives that despite hosting Cop26 and announcing a range of environmental initiatives, the Tories are in danger of losing credibility on the matter, while Labour commits to policies that include ending the moratorium on onshore wind, and vastly expanding green energy. In addition, the Tories have recently given the green light to a coalmine in Cumbria, which the government’s own net zero tsar, Chris Skidmore, said should never have been approved. Their focus appears to be on the more expensive routes such as carbon capture and storage, and nuclear power rather than cheaper, proven solutions such as insulation and onshore wind. Sharma said: “Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. As the UK showed at Cop26, the leadership of a country with a small share of the world’s emissions can make a big difference, raising global ambitions and creating new jobs and industries at home. “The Conservative Environment Network has been a critical voice in keeping environmentalism at the heart of successive Conservative governments. I look forward to working with its many members to ensure the government has a bold and positive environmental agenda ahead of the next election.” The new group also includes the 2019 Conservative manifesto co-author Rachel Wolf, the environmental audit committee chair and MP, Philip Dunne and the MPs Katherine Fletcher and Selaine Saxby. While the Labour party attempts to focus on green issues and make them a key part of its manifesto offering, there are debates among Conservatives about whether it is worth reaching climate goals at all. Sam Hall, the director of the CEN, added: “While some conservatives remain sceptical, they are in the minority, with almost half of Conservative MPs signing up to CEN’s principles during this parliament. “The debate has moved to focus on how we deliver on our climate and nature goals in a way that enhances our prosperity and security, not whether we have to act or if humans are responsible for environmental degradation. “As we head toward the next election and the future of conservatism debate continues, we will work to ensure environmental leadership remains at the core of the centre-right politics and to urge conservatives to set out a positive agenda for further environmental action.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T18:01:36Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards Russian defence, say western officials – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-live-odesa-missile-strike-deaths-un-nuclear-chief-zaporizhzhia-visit","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war: Ukraine taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards Russian defence, say western officials – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm. Here is a roundup of the day’s main news: Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the country’s deputy defence minister described as “extremely fierce” fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. The Kremlin said it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov later claimed that Delimkhanov was alive and well. Kalibr missiles hit the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa at 2.40am on Wednesday, setting a warehouse, a business centre, an educational institution, restaurants and shops ablaze. It was a one of a number of attacks across the country on Wednesday that left 13 civilians dead and 24 injured. After a destructive feud between his top military chiefs and the mercenary warlord Yevgeny Prigozhin, Vladimir Putin has appeared to side with his top brass, calling for Russia’s “volunteer detachments” fighting in Ukraine to be placed under direct control of the defence ministry. The decision severely undermines Prigozhin, who has turned Wagner’s role in the capture of Bakhmut into an outsized public profile in Russia that he uses to berate Putin’s generals and promote himself. Speaking to a group of pro-war bloggers on Tuesday, the Russian president said he welcomed the defence minister Sergei Shoigu’s initiative to force mercenary groups to sign contracts with the ministry – an order Prigozhin has refused to follow. You can read more on this story from my colleagues Pjotr Sauer and Andrew Roth here: The death toll from a strike on a warehouse and apartment block in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih has been raised to 12 after the death of a 67-year-old man in hospital overnight, as my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. The destruction of the Kakhovka Dam has led to a “dire humanitarian crisis” in flooded communities downstream, the United Nations in Ukraine has said. The dam, part of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, was breached in the early hours of 6 June, allowing some of the 18 cubic kilometres of water it held back to surge down across a swathe of southern Ukraine. The damage resulting from the collapse has forced the evacuation of thousands of people, flooded national parks and jeopardised water supplies to millions of people. The Ukrainian government has now requested the UN to help launch a post-disaster needs assessment that will look in depth at the long-term implications of the devastating destruction of the dam, the United Nations in Ukraine tweeted. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has said that Adam Delimkhanov, one of his senior commanders, is alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or injured in Ukraine. Kadyrov, who has led Chechnya since 2007 and is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said in a post on the Telegram messenger app on Wednesday that Delimkhanov was “alive and well and not even wounded”. Kadyrov added that he had known Delimkhanov was uninjured from the start of what he called “a fake information attack”, but had remained silent in order to embarrass Ukrainian media outlets which had reported on the commander’s alleged injury. There had been unconfirmed rumours on Ukrainian social media channels that the Chechen commander had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. Asked about the reports of Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, being injured, the Kremlin earlier on Wednesday said it was “worried” and was waiting for clarification about what had really happened (See post at 13:35). Russia appears to have doubled the number of trained dolphins defending Sevastopol naval base in Crimea, evidence seen by Naval News suggests. Analysis indicates the number of trained dolphins has increased from 3-4 to 6-7. This means dolphin patrols might have increased in frequency and have possibly been covering a wider area. Russia has a history of training dolphins for military purposes, using the aquatic mammal to retrieve objects or deter enemy divers. The Sevastopol naval base is crucial for the Russian military, as it sits in the southern tip of Crimea which Moscow seized in 2014. Ukraine had also trained dolphins at an aquarium near Sevastopol, in a program born out of a Soviet-era scheme that fell into neglect in the 1990s. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. Kyiv’s Western backers will meet on Thursday at Nato headquarters in Brussels to get the latest update from Ukraine’s defence minister on the progress of the assaults, AFP reports. “The most obvious thing is to ensure they have the weapons, the supplies, the maintenance to continue to conduct the offensive,” Stoltenberg told journalists. He added that there was always recognition that Ukraine would suffer losses as it seeks to breach heavily fortified Russian lines. Stoltenberg said: There will be casualties, also, when it comes to modern Nato equipment. No one expected there to be zero casualties. The realities of this is fierce, fierce fighting. Ukrainian troops have advanced 200-500 meters at various sections of the front line around the small eastern city of Bakhmut and 300-350 meters in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, delayed a planned trip to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant until it is safer to travel, a senior Ukrainian government official said on Wednesday. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine and was awaiting clarification about what had really happened. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine. Overnight, Russian missile attacks killed three people in the Black Sea city of Odesa and three in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. The officials’ sombre tone was clearly designed to lower expectations of a transformative breakthrough. However they nevertheless insisted the counteroffensive was “going in the right direction” and the losses were not unexpected. They said the counteroffensive was still in its early days and involved a form of warfare not seen in decades as Ukraine forces are forced to build single lanes of armoured vehicles through mines heading to main Russian defences that in some cases may be still as far as 20km away. “The vulnerability of the classic single lanes through the minefields make the Ukrainian armoury very vulnerable to attack,” the officials said. The officials denied Ukraine had lost as many as 120 armoured vehicles – a figure touted by Moscow. One official said: “The Russian manoeuvre and defence approach is proving challenging for the Ukraine and costly to attacking forces hence the advance at the moment is slow”. The officials suggested there is likely to be “grinding costly warfare likely for many months to come. This is incredibly difficult. They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare. Russia has generally put up a good defence from their well-prepared positions and falling back to tactical lines. Whilst they are inflicting casualties on the Russians they are not significant because the Russians are choosing the time to withdraw in a manner similar to the way the Ukrainians defended themselves against Russian vehicles. “The idea that the Russians were just going to melt away and the Ukrainians were going to drive straight through their defensive line was in people’s wildest dreams. “In this conflict the advantage has always been with the defender”. The officials said it may not be clear for as long as three months whether the offensive could be classified as a success. Most of the vehicles that have been damaged have been hit by mines. As the Ukrainians advance they are also more exposed to drone assaults. The officials played down suggestions that this assault was likely to give Ukraine a tactical advantage as early as September, and so give it space to reopen talks with Vladimir Putin. “We are a long way away from Ukraine being in a position to reopen negotiations”, the officials said. The slow progress is likely to place greater pressure on the west to signal to Putin that it is prepared for a long haul, and will not treat the counteroffensive as Ukraine’s one shot at reclaiming its territory. Ukraine has long feared support may decline in the west if the supply of western arms does not produce early tangible results. Western officials admitted that western-supplied jets may not be available in the short term, even if training of Ukrainian pilots is now underway. The officials also suggested Putin might have taken a truth serum before meeting military correspondents where he said Russia was suffering severe tank losses and suffering problems with its military industrial base. Even though there was still a huge amount of confusion about exact Russian deployment, the officials said the vast majority of Russian forces are now committed to positions on the line partly due to the sheer size of the line that has to be defended. That gave Russia little room for further manoeuvre to deploy reinforcements if a point in the line became vulnerable. By contrast Ukraine was holding back some of its heaviest armoury, including Challenger tanks. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has rebuffed growing international pressure on Ankara to ratify Sweden’s Nato membership bid before the western defence alliance meets in July. Western officials had hoped Erdoğan would soften his position on the diplomatically charged issue after he secured a hard-fought re-election last month (AFP reports). But Erdoğan signalled no major shift in comments released by his office while Turkish and Swedish officials were locked in last-minute negotiations in Ankara. Sweden and its Nordic neighbour Finland ended decades of military non-alignment and applied to join the US-led defence bloc in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Turkey and fellow Nato member Hungary ratified Finland’s membership this year. But both countries’ parliaments have yet to approve Sweden’s entry. Turkey is pushing Sweden to ban and crack down on rallies by Kurdish supporters of a group recognised as a terrorist organisation by Ankara. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country’s investigation told Swedish radio, Reuters reports. In September 2022, several unexplained underwater explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 and newly-built Nord Stream 2 pipelines that link Russia and Germany across the Baltic Sea. The blasts occurred in the economic zones of Sweden and Denmark and both countries say the explosions were deliberate though they have yet to single out who was responsible. There has been an update on the fire that broke out on Wednesday at the Novocherkassk power station in Russia’s southern Rostov region, close to the border with Ukraine (See post at 12:54). Citing reports, the Kyiv Independent tweeted that the fire was said to have started due to “non-compliance with safety precautions during repair work”. Here are some pictures of a local clean up effort in Odesa after a missile attack hit the southern Ukrainian city. The Duma, the lower house of Russia’s parliament, said on Wednesday it had voted to give its initial backing to legislation that would allow the defence ministry to sign contracts with suspected or convicted criminals to fight in Ukraine. More than 15 months into its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is trying to recruit more soldiers for Europe’s largest land conflict since the second world war. Under the proposed changes, a contract could be concluded with someone being investigated for committing a crime, or who is having their case heard in court, or who has been convicted – but before the verdict takes legal effect, according to the database of the Duma. People convicted of sexual crimes, treason, terrorism or extremism would not be able to sign up, Reuters reports. Those who do sign up would be exempt from criminal liability upon completion of their contract or if they receive awards for their combat prowess. The Wagner mercenary group was previously allowed to recruit convicts from prisons to fight in Ukraine, but said in February it had stopped. Prison rights activists say the defence ministry has taken over that process but wanted to make changes. The new changes being examined by the Duma do not cover recruitment of people already serving their sentences and the defence ministry has not commented. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was concerned by unconfirmed media reports that a senior Chechen commander had been wounded in Ukraine and was awaiting clarification about what had really happened, Reuters reports. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence ministry’s TV channel reported that Adam Delimkhanov, head of Chechnya’s national guard, had been injured in Ukraine (See post at 10:32am). Delimkhanov, who is a member of the Duma as well as commander of the Chechen division of the Russian national guard, is widely seen as the Caucasian region’s second most senior official, behind Ramzan Kadyrov. Vladimir Putin will hold talks in Moscow on Wednesday with Cuba’s prime minister, Manuel Marrero Cruz, the Kremlin said. Russia is seeking to bolster relations with Latin American, African and other non-western countries as the west tries to isolate and economically punish it for its invasion of Ukraine. Germany enshrined a Nato commitment to spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defence and identified Russia as the biggest threat to European security as the government announced its first ever National Security Strategy on Wednesday. Here are some of the highlights of Germany’s strategy outlined in a policy document and at a government press conference, as reported by Reuters: Russia is the biggest threat to peace in the Euro-Atlantic area Russia is trying to destabilise European democracies, weaken EU and Nato German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said it is important to continue to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine, including when the war ends Germany’s military budget was the seventh largest in the world last year behind the US, China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia and the UK. Nato members pledged in 2014 to move towards spending 2% of GDP on defence by 2024. A fire broke out on Wednesday at the Novocherkassk power station in Russia’s southern Rostov region close to the border with Ukraine, state-owned news agency RIA reported. It did not say what had caused the blaze. Here is an update on the UN nuclear chief’s trip to Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant being delayed due to travel safety concerns (See post at 09:34). The head of Russian-installed authorities in Zaporizhzhia region, Yevgeny Balitsky, also said the trip was delayed. “We will wait for Grossi at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 15 June, the visit is delayed by a day,” he was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. German Galushchenko, Ukraine’s energy minister, said the trip had been pushed back, possibly by days, Reuters reports. Russian news agency Interfax quoted a Russian-installed local official as saying Grossi would visit on Thursday. Ukraine has accused Russian military forces of attacking a car near the two countries’ shared border, and killing six people. Writing on Telegram, Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office said the attack happened on Tuesday in the Sumy region, in eastern Ukraine. These claims could not immediately be independently verified. Moscow is yet to officially comment on the allegations. The International Committee on the Red Cross, under ferocious criticism from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, admitted the principles of neutrality under which it operates have been put under unprecedented strain by the Ukraine war. It also defended the quality of its response to the floods caused by the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, saying it had been working tightly with the Ukrainian Red Cross to coordinate efforts to supply drinking water. Juerg Eglin, ICRC’s head of delegation in Ukraine, also revealed that Russia was continuing to refuse to give the body access to the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro River, where the ICRC estimates that most of the 50,000 people affected by the floods are living. Refusing to share the Russian explanation for refusing to grant access since the discussions were not over, he said: “We are ready to intervene on both sides of the river and have made concrete requests.” The ICRC said hundreds of thousands had been affected in a different way upstream of the dam, and that the risk of mines was becoming a growing threat to the civilian population. He added that ICRC staff were working under the risk of shelling. More broadly, the ICRC said it had now visited 1,500 prisoners from both sides, and that the visits had led to improvements in conditions in Russia. It had also delivered 2,500 messages between prisoners and relatives. Defending the ICRC from Zelenskiy’s longstanding criticism, the organisation said the principles under which it operates were not always understood. Ariane Bauer, ICRC’s regional director for Europe and central Asia, said: “The current environment we are in is extremely mediatised. Our efforts are not always visible. Our discrete approach can sometimes seem out of sync with today’s realities of today’s information space. “Neutrality and trust remain central to meeting our objectives and they cannot be dissociated one from another. Remaining neutral means we stick to our principles – the very principles that help people that need our support. “Remaining neutral shows that we care for the mandate we were given by states that were signatory to the Geneva convention. We have seen neutrality under strain and misunderstood in this conflict and many others, but perhaps more in this than others. For us, neutrality is not a moral position, it is a tool that helps us work and get access to prisoners of war and populations in hard-to-reach areas.” She refused to comment on whether Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia were in worse conditions than Russians held in Ukraine, but said improvements in conditions in Russia had followed ICRC visits to Russia. Russia had also cooperated with the ICRC by setting up lists of named prisoners held under its authority, she said. The water receded by another 32cm in the Kherson Region, in southern Ukraine, overnight, but 28 de-occupied settlements are still flooded, the Kyiv Post cited the regional military administration as saying on Wednesday morning. In the early hours on Tuesday last week, footage began to emerge of water spilling from the strategically important Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army’s southern military command said the dam had been blown up by Russian forces. The local Russian-installed mayor has called it a “terrorist act”. Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what it said was “extremely fierce” fighting Reuters reports. In a post on Telegram, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said the Ukrainian actions had had “partial” success. In the past day, Ukrainian troops advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the small eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, she said. She reported continuing fighting near the village of Makarivka in the direction of the southern port city of Berdiansk, and said battles were raging in the areas of Novodanylivka and Novopokrovsk in the Mariupol direction. Maliar said: Our troops are moving in the face of extremely fierce fighting, and air and artillery superiority of the enemy. If you haven’t already seen it, this stark piece from our colleague Lorenzo Tondo is well worth a read … The war in Ukraine has driven the largest annual increase of people forcibly displaced by persecution, conflict, violence and human rights violations in decades, according to the UN refugee agency. In 2022, the number of displaced people grew by 21%, standing at an estimated 108.4 million at the end of the year. That is likely have risen to more than 110 million people in May 2023, with Russia’s invasion and the war in Sudan being the biggest drivers of the growth, according to a report released on Wednesday by UNHCR. “These figures show us that some people are far too quick to rush to conflict, and way too slow to find solutions. The consequence is devastation, displacement, and anguish for each of the millions of people forcibly uprooted from their homes,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. Wagner chief reiterates refusal to sign contracts with Russian defence ministry Russian mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin on Wednesday reiterated the refusal of his Wagner fighters to sign contracts with the defence ministry, a day after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said the agreements were needed. In a rare direct show of defiance towards the Russian leader, Prigozhin said: “None of Wagner’s fighters is ready to go down the path of shame again. That’s why they will not sign the contracts.” In a televised meeting on Tuesday, Putin backed a call by the defence ministry for “volunteer” fighters in Ukraine to sign contracts with the country’s military command, widely seen as a means to assert control over Wagner. Putin said that contracts were necessary to allow all participants in Russia’s campaign in Ukraine to receive the social support payments to which they are entitled. These include compensation to fighters if they are wounded, and to their families if they are killed in action. Prigozhin has waged a bitter public feud with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the army top brass since last year, accusing them of failing to provide adequate support and ammunition to Wagner forces in Ukraine and so causing them to suffer higher casualties. In Wednesday’s remarks, however, he said he thought a “compromise solution” would be found between Putin and parliament to enable Wagner fighters to receive social guarantees and certified status as combatants. (Via Reuters) More here on the missing Chechen commander Adam Delimkhanov … Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has made a bizarre appeal for information from Ukrainian intelligence over the location of Adam Delimkhanov, his right hand man and a member of the Russian state Duma. The message on Kadyrov’s official Telegram account followed reports of a strike on Delimkhanov’s convoy in the Zaporizhzhia region which is at the heart of the Ukrainian counter offensive. Kadyrov writes: “I myself can’t find Adam Delimkhanov in any way. He doesn’t get in touch. I ask Ukrainian intelligence to provide information on exactly what place and what positions were hit, so that I can still find my dear BROTHER. I promise a generous reward and I ask you to help.” Russia’s defence ministry quoted the State Duma as confirming Delimkhanov had been injured but they provided no further information. Kyrylo Sazonov, a Ukrainian military blogger, has claimed on his Facebook account that Delimkhanov was killed in an attack near the city of Prymorsk, west of Mariupol, after Ukrainian intelligence had spotted a motorcade of SUVs. He writes: “There were no wounded... All the bodies were taken away by helicopters. They arrived in half an hour.” Senior commander of Russia’s Chechen forces in Ukraine has been wounded – report A senior commander of Russia’s Chechen forces fighting in Ukraine has been wounded, Russia’s defence ministry television channel Zvezda reported on Wednesday, citing the press service of the state Duma, the lower house of parliament. Adam Delimkhanov, who is a member of the Duma as well as commander of the Chechen division of the Russian national guard, is widely seen as the Caucasian region’s second most senior official, behind Ramzan Kadyrov. In a message posted on Telegram, Kadyrov wrote that he could not contact Delimkhanov, and asked for help finding his “dear brother”. Delimkhanov, a former Chechen separatist who eventually switched sides to Moscow along with much of the region’s leadership, had taken a prominent role in Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine, commanding Chechen forces in Mariupol in the conflict’s early days. Earlier on Wednesday, Ukrainian media reported that Delimkhanov had been killed in an artillery strike in southern Ukraine. (Via Reuters) Reuters has a useful explainer on the Russian tactical nuclear weapons that are to be stationed in Belarus, and which the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, mentioned earlier (see here). Putin said that “tactical” nuclear weapons – so called as they are designed for battlefield use – would be sent to Belarus, but did not say exactly which warheads would be deployed or where. Lukashenko said the warheads were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs the US dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The Hiroshima bomb, made from highly enriched uranium-235, was about 16 kilotons (equivalent to 16,000 tonnes of TNT), while the Nagasaki bomb, made from plutonium-239, was about 21 kilotons, according to the World Nuclear Association. If Lukashenko is correct, the Russian warheads would have a yield of about 48 to 63 kilotons each. Russia has about 1,816 non-strategic nuclear warheads, according to analysis of Russia’s nuclear weapons by Bulletin of Atomic Scientists magazine. Putin said Iskander mobile short-range ballistic missiles, which can deliver nuclear warheads, had already been handed over to Belarus. Russian sources say the Iskander has a range of 500km (310 miles). Putin also said 10 Belarusian aircraft had been adapted to carry the warheads. Belarus said Su-25 aircraft had been adapted to carry the warheads. The Sukhoi-25 jet has a range of up to 1,000km (621 miles), according to Russian sources. The Federation of American Scientists has said the weapons could be based at Lida airbase, 40km (25 miles) from the Lithuanian border. If so, the delivery vehicles could reach most of Ukraine, almost all of eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, a swathe of Germany, as well as some of Denmark, Sweden and Finland. Cities such as Berlin and Stockholm would be in range. Putin said Russia would finish the construction of a special storage facility in Belarus on 7-8 July and that the weapons would be deployed soon afterwards. Lukashenko has made different comments. He seemed to indicate last month that the weapons were already on the move while on 13 June he said the weapons would be deployed in “several days”. He has also said that there could be “nuclear weapons for everyone” who joined the Russia-Belarus union. In a video published on 14 June, Lukashenko said his country had started taking delivery of Russian tactical nuclear weapons. Germany is aiming to reduce its dependence on commodities through diversification of supply, and to create incentives for firms to hold strategic reserves, according to a summary of its new national security strategy. The strategy, which is expected to be published in full later on Wednesday, comes a year and a half after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which exposed Germany’s reliance on Russia for energy. It also contains a commitment for Germany to spend an average of 2% of economic output on defence, according to the summary – a weaker pledge, however, than the one made by chancellor Olaf Scholz days after the Russian invasion in a landmark speech heralding a “turning of era” or Zeitenwende in German foreign policy. Scholz had said Germany would start to invest more than 2% of economic output on defence, up from about 1.5%, after years of resisting pleas from Nato allies to do so. (Via Reuters) Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, has shared a video which purports to be an interview with a woman who was trapped under rubble after a Russian strike overnight, whose husband did not survive the attack. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, has delayed a planned trip to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant until it is safer to travel, a senior Ukrainian government official said on Wednesday. Grossi had been expected to visit the facility on Wednesday after talks in Kyiv on Tuesday, but a diplomatic source said the visit would be delayed by “some hours”. The Russian news agency Interfax quoted a Russian-imposed local official as saying Grossi would visit the plant on Thursday. “He’s waiting to be able to travel safely,” said the senior Ukrainian government official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The official did not say when Grossi would arrive at the plant in southeastern Ukraine. Here are some more images from the news wires showing the damage in Odesa, where at least three people have been killed and 13 wounded. Sweden hopes to be able to determine who was behind the Nord Stream gas pipeline sabotage by the autumn, the prosecutor leading the country’s investigation told Swedish radio. Reuters reports that Mats Ljungqvist, the prosecutor leading the Swedish investigation, told Swedish Radio he had met the German prosecutor and that they were working together but declined to give further details. “I hope that we at least this autumn will be able to make a decision regarding indictments, at least that is the ambition as things stand now,” Ljungqvist told Swedish public service broadcaster SR. “I think, actually, in time, [who carried out the sabotage] will be brought to light.” Germany has confirmed its investigators raided a ship in January that may have been used to transport the explosives used to blow up the pipelines. German media reported the boat could have been used by a small Ukrainian or pro-Ukrainian group. Ljungqvist told Reuters in April that the main scenario was that a state or a state-backed group was behind the attack. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reports, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva. Navalny, Putin’s best-known opponent, is serving sentences totalling more than 11 years in a penal colony for fraud and other charges that he says were trumped up to silence him. He faces further “extremism” charges that could extend his term by decades. Human rights groups and western governments view Navalny as a political prisoner. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has used the strike on Odesa to reiterate Ukraine’s frequent calls for a tightening of economic sanctions on Russia. In a post on Telegram, he said: The Russians shelled the city with Kalibr cruise missiles. Civilians died. Each of these missiles has at least 40 foreign components. Without microelectronics, Russia will not be able to produce them. Sanctions must be strengthened, in particular, against those who help the terrorist country to obtain components for weapons. A planned visit by the UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been delayed by “some hours”, a diplomatic source has told Reuters. No reason has been given for the delay. Suspilne reports that the number of people killed due to the rocket attack on Kryvyi Rih on Tuesday has increased to 12. Citing the city authority, it said a 67-year-old wounded man died in the hospital overnight. Dmitry Medvedev, long-term ally of Vladimir Putin and currently deputy chair of the security council of Russia, has said on Telegram that Russia needs to put in a demilitarised zone as far west as Ukraine’s Lviv, which he referred to by its Russian name Lvov and German name Lemberg. He went on to say that, as a result of the Nord Stream sabotage, for which he cited “western complicity”, that Russia should have “no restrictions left to refrain from destroying the cable communications of our enemies, laid along the ocean floor”. Here are some images released by the emergency services in Ukraine showing the aftermath of strikes in Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka, Donetsk region. Three people have been killed and another three injured in an early morning Russian attack on Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka in Donetsk, according to the regional governor. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reports that at least five houses were destroyed and about 20 more were damaged in Kramatorsk, while two houses were destroyed and 55 were damaged in Kostyantynivka. It cites the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. He stated that the attack happened at 5am local time (3am BST). The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence briefing on how it sees the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It claims: In the last two weeks, there has been an uptick in Russian tactical combat air sorties, especially over southern Ukraine. This has almost certainly been in response to reports of increased Ukrainian offensive operations, as the Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) attempt to support ground troops with airstrikes. Despite the uptick, VKS’ daily sortie rate remains much lower than the peak of up to 300 daily missions early in the war. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London.

Last week the Kakhovka dam in the city was destroyed, flooding swaths of land and forcing thousands to flee one of the biggest environmental disasters in Europe for decades. The administration also said that shelling of the nearby village of Plodovoye disrupted power supply there. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Ukraine and Russia deny targeting civilians in their military operations. Each side has accused the other of shelling the flooded areas in the aftermath of the dam blast. Separately, the administration said 7,200 people had been evacuated from the flooded areas in the past week, including 421 children. – Reuters The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, says he won’t hesitate to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons if faced with an act of aggression. Lukashenko’s comment contradicts earlier statements by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has said that nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus would remain exclusively under the control of Moscow. On Tuesday, Lukashenko said “everything is ready” for the Russian nuclear weapons’ deployment, adding that “it could take just a few days for us to get what we had asked for and even a bit more”. Asked later by a Russian state TV host whether Belarus had already received some of the weapons, Lukashenko responded: “Not all of them, little by little.” He appeared to confirm that his government had taken possession of some weapons from Russia and added that they were three times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. God forbid I have to make a decision to use those weapons today, but there would be no hesitation if we face an aggression. But in a later media appearance on Russian TV on Tuesday, he clarified he would consult with Putin before using any of the weapons. Listen, if a war starts, do you think I will look around? I pick up the phone, and wherever he is, he picks it up. If he calls, I pick it up any time. It’s no problem at all to coordinate launching a strike. Russian officials had no immediate comment on Lukashenko’s remarks. – AP The International Atomic Energy Agency chief, Rafael Grossi, is expected to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to “make his own assessment” on the risks posed to the operation by the war in Ukraine. Before his site visit, Grossi met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Tuesday night to discuss the issue after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, which formed a reservoir that provided cooling water for the plant. Speaking to journalists before his visit, Grossi said the situation complicated “an already precarious nuclear safety and security situation”. It is a step in the wrong direction, it is yet another step in the weakening of the safety net that one has in any nuclear power plant. Grossi said he would assess the integrity of the station’s water channels and cooling pond, and clarify whether the pond has been mined. I would say – again without having visited and on the basis of what my team there is informing me – there will be water (in the pond) for a few weeks, or maybe a month or two. There is no immediate situation: there is water there, but it could be going down. He also said that even if the reservoir empties “there are alternatives” such as pumping in water or drilling for groundwater. Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces have said. Air defences downed two Kalibr cruise missiles, but authorities said the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. The warehouse of a retail chain was also hit in the attack, causing a fire to break out. Work is under way to clear the debris and a search is taking place for people trapped under the rubble. Hello and welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war in Ukraine – this is Royce Kurmelovs bringing you the latest developments. Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured during a missile attack on the city of Odesa, Ukrainian officials said on Wednesday. Authorities say the attack struck civilian infrastructure in the southern port city and work is under way to pick through the rubble in the search for survivors. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to discuss risks to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant before a planned visit to the facility. After the meeting, Grossi told journalists that he planned to travel to the plant on Wednesday so he could “make [his] own assessment” as to “what kind of danger we have”. Zelenskiy has praised the courage of Ukrainian troops during the early stages of his country’s counteroffensive and singled out units operating near the besieged city of Bakhmut, saying: “There is forward movement in various areas.” Zelenskiy also praised several other units, thanking them “for your strength”. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, claimed that Ukrainian losses during the conflict were near “catastrophic” and that the counterattack had not been successful in any area. The Russian president made the claim during televised meetings with war correspondents and military bloggers. “This is a massive counteroffensive, using strategic reserves that were prepared for this task,” Putin said. “They lost over 160, we lost 54 tanks, and some of them are subject to restoration and repair.” In other news: Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has said his country won’t hesitate to use Russian nuclear weapons in the event his country is threatened with repression. The US House of Representatives has voted unanimously on a resolution calling for Russia to immediately release the imprisoned US journalist Evan Gershkovich. Moscow has flagged that it may withdraw from the Black Sea grain deal, after Putin said he had been cheated by the west, who had failed to deliver on a promise to help bring Russian agricultural goods to world markets. A Russian missile strike on a block of flats in Kryvyi Rih in central Ukraine has killed 11 and injured more than 30 people, according to an updated casualty list provided by Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Tuesday. The US president, Joe Biden, has met Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg before a major meeting of the alliance next month in Lithuania where questions about Ukraine’s membership are expected to be addressed. The US government has announced a new military aid package for Ukraine worth $325m which includes artillery rounds, anti-aircraft systems and 15 new Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. The UK Ministry of Defence has announced a $115m air defence package for Ukraine. Latvia has allocated another $460,000 in aid to Ukraine after the Kakhova dam disaster. Ukrainian forces have been confirmed to have liberated the village of Neskuchne on Tuesday after Reuters journalists were able to reach the area. Russia has not yet acknowledge any gains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-406-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-05T13:44:35Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 406 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-406-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/05/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-406-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 406 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukrainian troops face a difficult situation in the eastern city of Bakhmut, but that Kyiv will take the “corresponding” decisions to protect them if they risk being encircled by Russian forces. The Ukrainian president, at a news conference in Poland, said Kyiv’s troops in Bakhmut sometimes advanced a little only to be pushed back by Russian forces, but that they remained inside the city. Zelenskiy and Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, were welcomed in Warsaw with military honours, tributes and praise from Poland’s President Andrzej Duda, who awarded Zelenskiy with Poland’s oldest and highest civilian distinction, The Order of the White Eagle. Poland will send 14 MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, Duda said at a joint news appearance with Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy thanked the Polish leader, government and people for standing “shoulder to shoulder” with Ukraine and giving fleeing Ukrainians shelter. Poland’s agriculture minister Henryk Kowalczyk has formally resigned from his post, saying he decided to quit the position due to the European Commission’s decision to extend duty free imports for Ukrainain grain until June 2024. Polish farmers had called for the introduction of tariffs. Export bottlenecks caused by Russia’s invasion mean large quantities of Ukrainian grains, which are cheaper than those produced in the European Union have ended up in central European states, hitting prices and sales of local farmers. France’s President Emmanuel Macron is in China with President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Speaking to journalists, the French leader said anyone helping “aggressor” Russia in the Ukraine conflict would become an “accomplice”. He added that it was not in China’s interest to provide weapons to Russia in its war against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has attended a ceremony at the Kremlin where he met the new ambassadors to Moscow and accepted their diplomatic credentials. Among the 17 new ambassadors attending the ceremony on Wednesday was Lynne Tracy, the US’ new ambassador to Russia. Putin told Tracy in an address that US support for a revolution in Ukraine in 2014 had led to the current situation where Russia and Ukraine were in conflict. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has met Russian officials in Kaliningrad for talks on the Moscow-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine. A Ukrainian drone has crashed near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Russia’s RIA news agency cited a Russian officer as saying on Wednesday, as the chief of the global nuclear watchdog was expected in Russia for talks on the plant’s security. International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi was due to travel to Russia’s Kaliningrad region on Wednesday, a week after visiting the Zaporizhzhia facility in southern Ukraine, which is controlled by Russian forces. The six Leopard 2A4 tanks Spain has promised to send to Ukraine will leave the country in the second half of April, defence minister Margarita Robles told state broadcaster TVE on Wednesday, pushing back the estimated shipment date. The German-made battle tanks have not been used since the 1990s and had been mothballed in reserve, requiring refitting and battle readiness tests after initial doubts as to whether they could go into combat again. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, has said Sweden needs to take further steps for Ankara to ratify its Nato membership bid. Çavuşoğlu also told reporters that he had discussed Sweden’s Nato bid and developments regarding Ankara’s purchase of F-16 fighter jets with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Washington unveiled $2.6bn more in military assistance for Zelenskiy’s government on Tuesday, including three air surveillance radars, anti-tank rockets and fuel trucks. Finland became the 31st member of Nato Tuesday after its foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, signed an accession document and handed it to the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, at a ceremony in Brussels. Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister, said the accession of Finland increased the risks of wider conflict. US president Joe Biden welcomed Finlands’ ascension and urged Turkey and Hungary to conclude their ratification processes for Sweden to join. Ukraine hopes to receive two more tranches worth $1.8bn from the International Monetary Fund this year under its newly approved four-year lending program, top Ukrainian central bank officials said on Tuesday. Ukraine this week received the first $2.7bn tranche under the program, which is a part of a bigger $115bn global package of support. Britain blocked the UN webcast of an informal Security Council meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, at which Russia’s commissioner for children’s rights is due to speak. The international criminal court wants to arrest the commissioner on war crimes charges. Such meetings are not held in the Security Council chamber and all 15 council members have to agree to allow it to be webcast by the United Nations. The US is trying to wreck Russia’s planned summit with African countries as part of efforts to isolate Moscow, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview published on Tuesday. Moscow is preparing for its second summit with African countries, scheduled for the end of July in St Petersburg. A Ukrainian soldier pleaded “partly guilty” on Tuesday at Russia’s first trial for war crimes in connection with its military campaign in Ukraine. Russian investigators formally charged on Tuesday Darya Trepova, a 26-year-old woman, with terrorism offences over the killing of the pro-war military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky in a bomb blast in St Petersburg. Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested and charged with espionage in Russia last week, met his lawyers for the first time on Tuesday, editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a message to staff. “Evan’s health is good, and he is grateful for the outpouring of support from around the world,” Tucker said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-476-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T08:07:01Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 476 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-476-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/14/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-476-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 476 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Three people have been killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces have said.

The UK’s Conservative government has taken a different approach with its new energy strategy. In terms of dealing with the energy bill and climate crises, it’s picking losers. It is crystal clear that transforming the energy efficiency of the nation’s draughty homes should be the No 1 priority. After all, the cheapest, cleanest energy is the energy you no longer use and nothing can be installed faster than insulation. There are huge opportunities – for example, just 40% of UK homes have sufficient loft insulation. But there is nothing new in the strategy beyond an advice website. Former Tory energy minister Charles Hendry calls this a “major misjudgment” that will “force large numbers of very vulnerable people to be cold next winter when they need not be”. The next priority should be renewable electricity, now six times cheaper than that from gas-fired power stations. There are 649 wind and solar projects that already have planning permission. These would save more gas than the UK imports from Russia. But the strategy promises nothing to cut the planning regulations that David Cameron used to strangle onshore wind development and large-scale solar farms. The vast majority of people, including Tory voters, back more wind power in their areas, polling consistently shows. But your future energy bills now will be even higher than they need to be because ministers are worried a tiny minority of people can’t cope with looking at turbines. There is a boost to offshore wind, a genuine British success story, but it is unavoidably more expensive than onshore wind. The “big bet” Boris Johnson has chosen to take is on nuclear power. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said this week that “there is a world where we have six or seven sites in the UK” by 2050. That world is never-never land. Nuclear power is the only major energy technology that has increased in cost in the last decade and routinely suffers from massive time and budget overruns. Even Kwarteng acknowledges that France’s large nuclear fleet “cost a fortune”. The gamble Johnson is making, with taxpayers’ money, is that nuclear power is a more reliable wager to secure clean future power than renewables and fast-developing energy storage technologies. It’s a long shot. Renewables and storage will develop much faster and get much cheaper due to the rapid learning that comes with small-scale technologies, unlike colossal projects like nuclear. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) report on Monday, produced by scientists from across the globe and signed off by 195 governments, mentions renewables, wind, solar and efficiency 67 times in its summary. It cites nuclear once (in brackets), as an example of a technology with high upfront costs. The UK energy strategy also backs more drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea – which flies in the face of its own net-zero climate targets. Furthermore, the dwindling reserves that remain cannot lower the price of commodities, which is set by a global market. Don’t just take that from me; Kwarteng, energy minister Greg Hands and COP26 president Alok Sharma all agree. On Monday, after the IPCC report, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said: “The truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” That is the UK he is now talking about. The only good news is that shale gas has been sidelined, with a review of safety a sop to the small group of noisy frackheads on the Tory back benches. Another of Johnson’s “big bets” is on hydrogen, apparently in the hope that it can be used to heat a third of UK homes as an alternative to fossil gas by 2050. That is folly, not least as heat pumps will be much cheaper and less polluting. Using fossil fuels could produce lots of hydrogen, but also cement our dependence on oil and gas, while belching out CO2. Green hydrogen – produced from renewables – will be very expensive for years, and the limited supply should be reserved for sectors that are really hard to decarbonise. Why has the government got this so wrong? It’s partly short-term politics. An “ally” of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is reported to have defended the refusal to fund more energy efficiency by saying: “We have to be scrutinising every extra penny of taxpayer money that is proposed for spending because ultimately we want to do the Conservative thing and cut taxes for people.” That is, just before the next election. It is also partly the adherence to the dogma that the only solution to problems is “our treasured free-market economy”, as Kwarteng described it on Tuesday. That is despite the warning in 2011 from the government’s own climate adviser that “leaving [energy efficiency] to the market has never worked anywhere in the world”. He was right. The first of two big failed efficiency schemes saw loft insulations plunge by 93%. Most depressingly, the energy strategy’s failings seem also partly due to Johnson’s penchant for big, shiny projects, rather than the hard graft of thousands of smaller ones. But the six or seven nuclear power plants he dreams of are likely to follow the same fate as his island airport, garden bridge, and tunnel to Northern Ireland. Helen Clarkson, at the business-focused Climate Group, said: “We have tools and technologies already available which can radically reduce our energy needs and our carbon emissions now. Energy efficiency measures can deliver immediately in cutting people’s fuel bills and get us on the path to net zero in the longer term. There’s a huge opportunity for a win-win here which the government is passing up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-475-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-13T09:47:24Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 475 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-475-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/13/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-475-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 475 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"At least six people were killed and 25 injured after the Russian missile strike on Kryvyi Rih destroyed a five-storey residential building. Russian airstrikes hit several civilian structures in the city, including a five-storey building, said the mayor of Kryvyi Rih, Oleksandr Vilkul, adding “likely, there are people under the rubble”. Deputy defence minister of Ukraine, Hanna Maliar, has reported small incremental advances for Ukrainian forces near Bakhmut and Toretsk. She said in a message on Telegram that Ukraine had advanced 250m in the direction of Bakhmut in the area of the Berkhiv reservoir, and 200m in the Toretsk direction. She also claimed that 3 sq km of territory had been captured in the Berdiansk direction. Russia’s defence ministry has released video footage of what it claims were German-made Leopard tanks and US-made Bradley fighting vehicles captured by Russian forces in a battle with Ukrainian forces. In a message on Telegram, the ministry said some of the vehicles still had their engines running, illustrating the rapid flight of the crews during the battle. The location and timing of the video footage has not been independently verified. Russian military bloggers appear to be claiming that Makarivka, one of the villages that Ukraine said it had liberated in the last couple of days, is back in Russian hands. The claims have not been independently verified. Forty-one people are still missing in the floods caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, while the death toll now stands at 10, Ukrainian officials have said. Regional head Oleksandr Prokudin reports there are currently 3,600 houses in 31 settlements that remain flooded on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro. The water level has dropped by 27cm, and in the past day water has receded from 200 houses. On Monday, Ukraine accused Russian forces of destroying another dam with the aim of slowing Kyiv’s counteroffensive. As rescue and relief efforts entered their seventh day for victims of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the Russian military was accused of blowing up a much smaller dam along the Mokri Yaly River, which has become the most successful axis so far for Ukraine’s advances in western Donetsk. Russian media reported that a Ukrainian missile strike on the southern Zaporizhzhia front killed an experienced Russian general. “As a result of an enemy missile attack, the Chief of Staff of the 35th Combined Arms Army, Maj Gen Sergei Goryachev, was killed,” the prominent pro-war blogger Voenkor said in a Telegram post. Goryachev, a decorated commander, previously led Russian troops in Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria. The Russian defence ministry is yet to comment on the reports. Early morning shelling by Ukraine on two villages in Russia’s Kursk region damaged several houses and disrupted gas and electricity supply, according to the local governor. A fire broke out at an oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region overnight, Russia’s RBK news outlet reported, citing the local city administration. RBK reported that the fire was now contained and its cause was not immediately clear. The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, will arrive in Kyiv on Tuesday to meet Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, before heading to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-10T16:00:25Z","webTitle":"British households and firms cut enough peak-time energy use to power 10m homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/10/british-households-and-firms-cut-winter-electricity-use-by-enough-to-power-10m-homes","fields":{"headline":"British households and firms cut enough peak-time energy use to power 10m homes","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Households and businesses in Great Britain moved enough of their energy use to non-peak times last winter to power 10m homes and help avoid blackouts. About 1.6m households and businesses received payments to help reduce the pressure on the National Grid during the winter months as part of a demand flexibility scheme run by its electricity system operator (ESO). The energy users were called on about 22 times to reschedule their energy use to avoid peak demand hours, for example, running dishwashers or tumble dryers at night. The energy savings from peak time were equivalent to the electricity output of the Keadby gas power plant over 4.5 hours, or three hours of generation from the Sizewell B nuclear power plant. In return, the households and small businesses received payments totalling millions of pounds through their suppliers. Octopus Energy said it paid a total of £5.3m to the customers who signed up. British Gas confirmed it made a total of £1.8m in payments to customers on behalf of the ESO. Claire Dykta, the ESO’s head of markets, said the scheme successfully demonstrated “the interest of UK consumers and businesses in playing a more active role in balancing our electricity needs”. She said: “We are now working with industry and consumers to establish how this world-leading service can grow from strength to strength and support the continued evolution of consumer flexibility in the UK.” ESO is expected to run the scheme again next winter. Countries across Europe took steps to reduce their energy consumption over the last winter after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused market prices to sky-rocket and raised fears over whether there would be enough gas imports to meet demand. Industry data has shown that Great Britain used 5% less gas in the first quarter of this year compared with the same months last year, in part because of lower demand for electricity overall and the growing fleet of windfarms. Wind turbines generated more electricity than gas-fired power plants for the first time in the first three months of this year, according to an analysis of ESO data by Imperial College London. The quarterly report, commissioned by Drax, showed that electricity demand fell by 4% in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the same period last year. At the same time, wind power generation increased by 3% to make up 32.4% of Great Britain’s total electricity mix, while gas power made up 31.7%. Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London, and the lead author of the report, said: “There are still many hurdles to reaching a completely fossil fuel-free grid but wind out supplying gas for the first time is a genuine milestone event, and shows what can be achieved when governments create a good environment for investors in clean technology.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/feb/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-367-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-25T01:51:48Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 367 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-367-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/feb/25/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-367-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 367 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The first Polish Leopard tanks have arrived in Ukraine, with the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, confirming that four tanks had been delivered. “Poland and Europe stand by your side. We will definitely not leave you, we will support Ukraine until complete victory over Russia,” he said, standing alongside the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, during his visit to Kyiv to mark the the first anniversary of the Russian invasion. Zelenskiy has declared victory to be inevitable as his country marked the anniversary of the moment it was invaded by Russian troops. In a national address earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy told Ukrainians they had been proven invincible over “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity”. The US has announced that it will offer over $10bn in assistance to Ukraine. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that the funds are crucial to Ukraine and ensure that the Ukrainian government can continue to meet “the critical needs of its citizens, including healthcare, education and emergency services”. Washington has also announced an additional package of security assistance for Ukraine. In a statement, the Biden administration said it would include “several new unmanned aerial systems (UAS), counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS) equipment to strengthen Ukraine’s air defences … and electronic warfare detection equipment to bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russia’s aggression”. Sweden will send up to 10 Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and defence minister, Pål Jonson, said. “The Swedish tanks reinforce the Leopard 2 contribution that other European countries make. Coordination of support is ongoing with international partners donating Leopard 2 or other tanks,” the government said. Canada will provide additional military support to Ukraine, prime minister, Justin Trudeau, announced. He said Canada will provide four additional Leopard 2 main battle tanks. The additional tanks will bring up the total number of tanks provided by Canada to eight. The European Union has promised additional support for millions of Ukrainian refugees who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion. The EU Commission vice-president, Margaritis Schinas, said “as far as [refugees from] Ukraine are concerned, the figures are stable. If it happens, we are ready, but it doesn’t seem to be the case for the time being”, referring to a potential increase in refugees. The US Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, pledged American solidarity with Ukraine. “One year ago, Vladimir Putin committed his greatest mistake by underestimating the resolve of Ukraine. Since then, we have seen bravery, patriotism and valour personified by President Zelenskiy and the Ukrainian people,” the Democrat said. The Group of Seven has announced a range of further economic, military and financial sanctions against Russia. It promised measures against Russian diamond exports, warning that third countries that help Russia evade sanctions would face “severe costs”. The G7 is understood to be setting up an “enforcement coordination mechanism” to stop evasion of its sanctions already imposed. The UK said it was banning the export of every item Russia has been found using on the battlefield to date, a list covering hundreds of goods, including aircraft parts, radio equipment and electronic components. The British government is also imposing sanctions on senior executives at Russia’s state-owned nuclear power company Rosatom, who Ukraine says are complicit in the seizure and forced nationality change of the staff of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and their children. A “people’s court” has endorsed an indictment against Putin for the crime of aggression and called for his arrest. After a week of hearings in The Hague, a panel of three international legal experts issued the order and called on the international community “to take every step necessary to ensure that a court with legal powers issues an indictment against Putin and takes appropriate measures to arrest the perpetrator and put him on trial in an official Ukraine tribunal as soon as possible”, AP reported. Zelenskiy has welcomed some elements of a Chinese proposal for a ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine. China’s government called for peace talks while urging all parties to avoid nuclear escalation and end attacks on civilians. “China has shown its thoughts. I believe that the fact that China started talking about Ukraine is not bad,” Zelenskiy said. Russia appreciated China’s plan to resolve the conflict in Ukraine and was open to achieving the goals of what it calls its “special military operation” through political and diplomatic means, foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said. However, this would also mean recognising “new territorital realities” in Ukraine, Zakharova said, referring to Russia’s unilateral annexation of four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – as well as of Crimea."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-14T23:48:17Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 477 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/15/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-477-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 477 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine is taking significant casualties and making slow progress towards the Russian main line of defence, western officials have admitted in one of the west’s first assessments of the Ukrainian counteroffensive launched on 4 June. “This is incredibly difficult,” the official said. “They are going against a well-prepared line that the Russians have had months to prepare.” Ukraine reported incremental advances in its counteroffensive against Russian forces on Wednesday, in what the Ukrainian deputy defence minister described as “extremely fierce” fighting. In the past day, Ukrainian troops had advanced 200-500 metres in various areas near the largely devastated eastern city of Bakhmut, and 300-350 metres in the direction of the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, Hanna Maliar said. Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s secretary general, has said alliance members must ensure Ukraine keeps getting enough arms to pursue its counteroffensive against Russia. “It is still early days and we do not know if this will be a turning point,” he said. Three people were killed and at least 13 injured in a Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, Ukrainian forces said. Air defences downed two Kalibr cruise missiles, but authorities said the attack still struck civilian infrastructure including a business centre, an educational institution, a residential complex, restaurants and shops. Three people were killed and another three injured in an early morning Russian attack on Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka in Donetsk, according to the regional governor. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that at least five houses were destroyed and about 20 more were damaged in Kramatorsk, while two houses were destroyed and 55 were damaged in Kostyantynivka. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi delayed a trip to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station on Wednesday for security reasons, as heavy fighting raged in southern Ukraine. Russian news agencies quoted a senior official in Russia’s nuclear industry as saying Grossi was likely to visit the plant on Thursday. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has appeared to side with his top military commanders in calling for Russia’s “volunteer detachments” fighting in Ukraine to be placed under the direct control of the defence ministry. The order from Moscow had been seen as an attempt to rein in the Wagner mercenary group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, by incorporating them into the army. Western microchips and other components coming largely via China are being used to manufacture Russian cruise and ballistic missiles that are being launched at Ukraine, Kyiv has said in a presentation prepared for G7 members this week. The document calls for the world’s leading economies to further tighten export controls. The Chechen ruler Ramzan Kadyrov said on Wednesday that one of his senior commanders was alive and well, dismissing reports that he had been killed or wounded in Ukraine. Adam Delimkhanov heads the Chechen division of the Russian national guard and is also a member of Russia’s parliament. He is widely seen as Chechnya’s second most senior official after Kadyrov himself. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, says he won’t hesitate to use Russian tactical nuclear weapons if faced with an act of aggression. Lukashenko’s comment contradicts earlier statements by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has said that nuclear weapons stationed in Belarus would remain exclusively under the control of Moscow. A former campaign leader for the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was sentenced to seven years and six months in prison on Wednesday for “creating an extremist organisation”, Reuters reported, citing the rights group OVD-Info. Navalny supporters reacted with outrage to the sentence against Liliya Chanysheva."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-474-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-06-12T09:56:22Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 474 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-474-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jun/12/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-474-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 474 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Ukraine’s armed forces have claimed to have liberated several frontline villages in western Donetsk, almost a week after the launch of counteroffensive operations. Soldiers were shown in video footage raising the Ukrainian flag over the village of Blahodatne, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka, one of the main axes of the counteroffensive so far. Troops from another brigade filmed themselves with their unit’s banner in Neskuchne. Later on Sunday, Kyiv said a third village, Makarivka, had been taken. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, announced the liberation of Storozheve by Ukrainian marines on Monday morning. Ukraine’s top military command said on Monday that its forces were engaged in heavy battles in frontline hotspots. Twenty-five battles had taken place over the past day near the eastern town of Bakhmut and further south near Avdiivka and Maryinka, all in the Donetsk region, and also near Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s armed forces general staff said. US thinktank The Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had made “visually verified advances” in the Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions and that Russian sources “confirmed but sought to downplay” those advances. The water level at the ponds used to cool the reactors at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remain stable and sufficient despite the falling water level of the Kakhovka reservoir nearby, Ukraine’s environment minister said on Monday. Pavlo Kyrylenko, Ukraine’s governor of Donetsk, reported that Avdiivka was struck twice by rockets on Monday morning. A 50-year-old woman was injured as a result of shelling by the Russian military in the village of Novoselivka, in Zaporizhzhia region. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday it had signed a contract with the Akhmat group of Chechen special forces, a day after mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin refused to do so. The signing followed an order that all “volunteer units” should sign contracts by 1 July bringing them under the control of defence minister Sergei Shoigu, as Moscow tries to assert its control over private armies fighting on its behalf in Ukraine. Prigozhin, who has waged a running feud with the defence ministry and accused it of failing to provide adequate ammunition supplies to his Wagner mercenaries in Ukraine, said on Sunday he would refuse to sign any such contract. Former Russian president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev has celebrated Russia day by posting a photoshopped image to Telegram which shows Kyiv’s central Maidan square with the Russian flag flying on it and the message “Independence Square. Coming soon – Russia Square”. Work has already started in an investigation by the international criminal court over the breach of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine and the vast flood it triggered, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said. Suspilne, Ukraine’s state broadcaster, reported that the flood water level in Kherson had dropped by 64cm. Three civilians were killed Sunday and 10 others wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reported. Two of the 10 people wounded were law enforcement officers. Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt at the weekend to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, it said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-441-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-10T17:20:52Z","webTitle":" Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 441 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-441-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-441-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":" Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 441 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A Ukrainian military commander said Russian forces in Bakhmut had been pushed back by up to 2km in some areas after counteroffensives. Col Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, who heads Ukraine’s ground forces, posted on Telegram: “In some areas of the front, the enemy could not resist the onslaught of the Ukrainian defenders and retreated.” Russia’s oil pipeline operator Transneft said a filling point on the Europe-bound Druzhba pipeline had been targeted in a “terrorist attack” near the border with Ukraine, according to the Tass news agency. Transneft said nobody was injured in the incident. Ukraine’s military said its forces had seriously damaged Russia’s 72nd independent motorised rifle brigade near Bakhmut, made up of thousands of troops. Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, said the situation remained “difficult” in Bakhmut, but Moscow was increasingly having to use regular army units because of heavy losses among Wagner group fighters. The Wagner boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, complained that his fighters were still not getting enough shells from the defence ministry. In an audio statement, he said the defence ministry – which has promised to ensure that all combat units have the resources they need – had been holding long meetings on the shell issue, but there had been no breakthrough. “We’re not receiving enough shells, we’re only getting 10%,” Prigozhin said, according to Reuters. The French parliament called on the EU to formally label the Wagner group as terrorists, as the UK reportedly prepares to do the same. France’s parliament unanimously passed a non-binding resolution aimed at encouraging the 27 members of the EU to put Wagner on its official list of terrorist organisations. Russian forces plan to evacuate more than 3,000 workers from the town that serves the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, where there is a “catastrophic lack” of qualified personnel, Ukraine’s state-owned Energoatom company said. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of forcibly deporting its citizens from occupied Ukrainian regions to Russian Federation territory. Germany’s former chancellor Gerhard Schröder has been criticised again for his links to Russia after attending a Victory Day party at the Russian embassy in Berlin. Schröder was seen at a reception on Tuesday marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war, along with senior figures from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party and the far-left Linke party. Russia may formally denounce the treaty on conventional armed forces in Europe, which it pulled out of in 2015, according to a decree signed by Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.

Surovikin’s “defending” of Moscow’s interests in Syria involved dozens of air and ground attacks on civilian objects and infrastructure, according to a 2020 Human Rights Watch report, which said Russian forces under his command struck Syrian “homes, schools, healthcare facilities, and markets – the places where people live, work, and study”. On Monday morning, just two days after being appointed as the first overall commander for the war in Ukraine, Surovikin brought his violent Syria playbook closer to home, with a flurry of rocket attacks against civilian targets across Ukraine, which included a major road junction next to a university and a children’s playground in a park. “I am not surprised to see what happened this morning in Kyiv. Surovikin is absolutely ruthless, with little regard for human life,” a former defence ministry official, who has worked with Surovikin, told the Guardian. “I am afraid his hands will be completely covered in Ukrainian blood.” Surovikin first gained notoriety during the 1991 coup d’état attempt launched by Soviet hardliners, when he led a rifle division that drove through barricades erected by pro-democracy protesters. Three men were killed in the clash, including one who was crushed. His ruthless reputation grew in 2004 when Russian media reported that a colonel serving under him had killed himself after he received a heated reprimand from Surovikin. His colleagues have since given him the grim nickname “General Armageddon” for his hardline and unorthodox approach to waging war. Surovikin’s main challenge in Ukraine, experts say, will be to solve the structural problems plaguing the Russian military as it faces a fierce Ukrainian counter-offensive. Gleb Irisov, a former air force lieutenant who worked with Surovikin up to 2020, said the new general was one of the few people in the army who “knew how to oversee and streamline different army branches”. “He is very cruel but also a competent commander,” Irisov said. “But he won’t be able to solve all the problems. Russia is short on weapons and manpower.” Irisov pointed to previous leadership shake-ups that have done little to fix Russia’s military fortunes in Ukraine. Surovikin’s appointment has, however, softened some of the public anger among Russian hardliners, who were growing increasingly impatient with the country’s military failures. From his time in Syria, he had developed a good working relationship with the Wagner private military company, said Irisov, and his appointment was welcomed by top critics of the war effort, including Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen republic, and the Wagner head, Yevgeny Prigozhin. “Now, I am 100% satisfied with the operation,” Kadyrov wrote on his Telegram channel on Monday morning, referring to the shelling of Kyiv, where at least six civilians were killed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-30T19:25:58Z","webTitle":"Wanted: a new energy contract for renewables and nuclear projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/aug/30/wanted-a-new-energy-contract-for-renewables-and-nuclear-projects","fields":{"headline":"Wanted: a new energy contract for renewables and nuclear projects","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak, when he was still chancellor and was coming round to the idea of a windfall tax, noticed a key point about today’s energy market. Not all the corporate winners in the UK from soaraway wholesale gas prices are producing hydrocarbons in the North Sea. Some are generating power from nuclear power stations, solar projects, windfarms and biomass and are enjoying the same high wholesale prices. Those generators are benefiting from old-style contracts based on “renewables obligation certificates” (ROCs) and suchlike, rather than contracts-for-difference (CfD) arrangements that have been the main way of incentivising capacity in recent years. Under CfDs, excess revenues over the agreed “strike” price flow to the Treasury. That is not the case with ROCs, thus some spectacular improvements in corporate fortunes; the share price of biomass-heavy Drax is up two-thirds in the past 12 months, for instance. In the event, Sunak confined his “energy profits levy” to oil and gas producers. It seems the Treasury was deterred by the complexities in the generation market, which was understandable up to a point. Much of the power is sold under long-term contracts, rather than at “spot” prices, and intermediaries sub-divide output many times. It is hard to get a firm grasp on where, precisely, windfall gains arise. Here, though, is a proposal that cuts through some of the complexity. Encourage those generators with juicy old-style contracts to enter an auction to switch themselves on to CfD arrangements, suggests the consultancy Cornwall Insight. If they all did so, and if the price of power came out at £162 per megawatt hour – still high by historical standards but a lot less than the current month-ahead price of £435 – the resulting savings could be enormous. About £44.4bn over six months, it calculates (and the UK Energy Research Centre has been pushing the idea for months). By way of incentive to companies to sign up, Cornwall says the new contracts could extend beyond the span of the old ones. In effect, the generators would get more certainty (and still a very nice price) over revenues in two or three years’ time in exchange for selling at sub-market lower prices today. Arm-twisting would also be in order, one could add: current returns are way beyond the original financiers’ wildest dreams. At one level, Cornwall’s proposed reform is a technical tweak, but it gets to the heart of an infuriating aspect of the current electricity market set-up: the fact that wholesale gas prices dictate all power prices, thereby creating today’s bonanza profits for some renewable and nuclear projects whose fixed costs have barely changed. Sunak had a crack at the problem and didn’t get far. If the potential gain over the winter could really be £44.4bn, ministers should take another look urgently. Letting HBOS bosses off hook a second time was a cop out Last Friday may already feel like ancient history but let’s not forget the financial regulators’ timid verdict on events from much longer ago. The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority told us at the end of last week that their six-year investigation result in no sanction being imposed on the banking bosses who steered HBOS on to the rocks in 2008. Younger readers may need to be reminded that the catastrophe at HBOS was as bad as the one at the Royal Bank of Scotland. HBOS was meant to have a simple business model – one that didn’t rely on the racy world of investment banking – but managed to wreck itself via old-fashioned reckless lending. The bank was bailed out with £20bn of public money as it was shoved into the arms of its foolish rescuer, Lloyds TSB. The formal investigation in 2015 was scathing about dim-witted regulators at the old Financial Services Authority, but was clear on this point: “Ultimate responsibility for the failure of HBOS rests with its board.” That was why the PRA and the FCA were prodded by the Treasury select committee into re-examining the decision not to look at sanctions against senior HBOS managers – assumed to mean the two HBOS chief executives of the era, James Crosby and Andy Hornby, plus a handful of others. Now, for the second time, the result is “no further action”. It is unsatisfactory, to put it mildly. Yes, the rules around personal “culpability” were different in the old days. And, yes, Crosby and Hornby become unemployable for practical purposes in senior roles within the financial services industry (the latter these days is chief executive at the owner of Wagamama). But, come on, blaming the board as a collective while sparing individuals from censure is a cop-out. Public faith in the regulatory system has just fallen another notch."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/may/17/glimpse-of-north-korean-spy-satellite-in-kim-jong-un-pictures","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-17T02:12:50Z","webTitle":"Glimpse of first North Korean ‘spy satellite’ in new Kim Jong-un pictures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/17/glimpse-of-north-korean-spy-satellite-in-kim-jong-un-pictures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/may/17/glimpse-of-north-korean-spy-satellite-in-kim-jong-un-pictures","fields":{"headline":"Glimpse of first North Korean ‘spy satellite’ in new Kim Jong-un pictures","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Kim Jong-un has inspected North Korea’s first military spy satellite and given the go-ahead for its “future action plan”, according to state media. Kim met the “non-permanent satellite launch preparatory committee” on Tuesday before viewing the satellite, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. A month ago, Kim said construction of the satellite was completed and gave the green light for its launch. That report came about a week after Pyongyang launched what it said was a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile, marking a major breakthrough in its banned weapons programmes. ICBMs and space launch capabilities use shared technologies. The satellite appears to be a polygonal cylinder, covered in gold insulating foil and fitted with solar panels. The photographs have been partly blurred. Kim was pictured a month earlier at the “National Aerospace Development Administration” (Nada) in front of a screen showing something similar in shape, also blurred. On Tuesday, “after acquainting himself in detail with the work of the committee, [Kim] inspected the military reconnaissance satellite No 1, which is ready for loading after undergoing the final general assembly check and space environment test”, KCNA said. Kim accused the US and South Korea of escalating what he called “confrontational moves” against the North and said his country would exercise its right to self-defence. Kim then “approved the future action plan of the preparatory committee”, KCNA added. The development of a military reconnaissance satellite was one of the key defence projects outlined by Kim in 2021. In December 2022, North Korea said it had carried out an “important final-stage test” for the development of a spy satellite, which it said it would complete by April this year. At the time, experts in South Korea quickly raised doubts about the results, saying the quality of black-and-white images released by North Korea – purportedly taken from a satellite – were poor. Pyongyang has not provided a launch date, though Kim said in April that the satellite would be sent up “at the planned date”. North Korea in 2022 declared itself an “irreversible” nuclear power, seemingly ending the possibility of denuclearisation talks. Pyongyang would struggle to do satellite reconnaissance with its own technology and without technological help from Russia or China, analysts say. Still, “since North Korea’s reconnaissance satellites are an important factor in the event of a nuclear pre-emptive strike, they pose a significant threat to the South”, Yang Moo-jin, president of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP last month. In an address to South Korea’s parliament on Wednesday, Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said his country was ready to increase military engagement to mitigate threats to regional security, including from North Korea. Washington and Seoul have ramped up defence cooperation in response, staging joint military exercises with advanced stealth jets and high-profile US strategic assets. North Korea views such exercises as rehearsals for invasion and described them as “frantic” drills “simulating an all-out war” against Pyongyang.

In January 1992, as John Major seeded the ground for what turned out to be a fourth successive Tory victory later that year, voters were warned of a “tax bombshell” costing the average taxpayer £1,000. The calculations were spurious but politically damaging. A year or so away from the next election, the front-page headline in one newspaper on Tuesday read: “Families face £1,000 a year bill for Labour eco plans”. Ministers are warning that the cost of the green strategy outlined by the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, would spook markets and drive up mortgage rates. One can marvel at the chutzpah while deploring the cynicism. Aware that just these consequences followed Liz Truss’s disastrous experiment in free-market fundamentalism – a memory etched on the public mind – the government hopes to weaponise that experience against Labour’s plans to use the state to drive the transition to net zero. It has identified Labour’s £28bn “green prosperity plan” as a prime zone of vulnerability, within which it can target opposition spending pledges this time round. There will be much more of this to come. But Labour has winning economic as well as ethical arguments on its side, and needs to make them with confidence. The shadow chancellor’s proposals to borrow to subsidise windfarms (onshore as well as offshore), insulate homes, encourage the battery manufacture necessary for a viable car industry, and invest in nuclear power all go with, rather than against, the grain of market sentiment. Britain is already lagging badly behind its European neighbours and the United States when it comes to public investment in the green transition. The government’s refusal to contemplate an industrial strategy worthy of the name has dismayed leading businesses. The Climate Change Committee (CCC), the independent advisory body, has become steadily more withering in its criticisms of Whitehall drift. In the absence of a more proactive state to shape, collaborate and intervene in markets, the price of passivity will be paid in terms of lost jobs, growth and opportunities in a new economic era. The markets know this, and so do the unions. As a CCC report published last month emphasised, a crucial dimension of intervention must be to minimise the disruption caused to those at the sharp end. The gradual transition away from fossil fuel production must be accompanied by a focus on transferable skills that can be deployed in carbon capture storage and a thriving hydrogen sector. The general secretary of the GMB, Gary Smith, was right to point out at the weekend that good jobs in renewable energy had not yet materialised on a big enough scale to inspire confidence. Their creation requires a committed government prepared to invest to get ahead of the times (or rather catch up with them), and prepare the ground, rather than the chronically short-termist one currently in office. Speaking to the GMB conference in Brighton on Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer promised that a Labour government would never allow “an industry [to come] to an end and nobody had planned for the future”. To deliver on that pledge, and on the broader green transition, Labour must make its case and stick to the principles of its plan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-437-ukrainian-children-killed-so-far-says-kyiv-uk-sending-tech-to-counter-iranian-drones","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-20T18:02:42Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Zaporizhzhia attacks ‘playing with fire’, UN warns – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-437-ukrainian-children-killed-so-far-says-kyiv-uk-sending-tech-to-counter-iranian-drones","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/nov/20/russia-ukraine-war-live-437-ukrainian-children-killed-so-far-says-kyiv-uk-sending-tech-to-counter-iranian-drones","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war live: Zaporizhzhia attacks ‘playing with fire’, UN warns – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"As the time approaches 8pm in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, here is the summary of today’s news from the war. Attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “playing with fire”, the UN nuclear watchdog’s director general has said. It comes after a series of explosions in the area overnight, which damaged buildings and equipment. The International Atomic Energy Agency said none of the blasts had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security. But its boss, Rafael Grossi, said that whoever was behind the attacks, “it must stop immediately”, adding: “You’re playing with fire.” Ukraine and Russia blame each other for the attacks The Ukrainian operator of the nuclear power plant said on Telegram that Russian forces were behind “targeted” shelling on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom had earlier accused Ukraine of shelling at the plant, which is under Russian occupation. Ukraine will investigate footage that is said to show its forces killing Russian troops Moscow has said the videos, which are circulating on social media, show Ukrainian soldiers killing Russian soldiers as they tried to surrender. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, said Ukrainian authorities would investigate the footage but it was “very unlikely” that the clips showed what Russia claims. Negotiating with Russia would be “capitulation”, a key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has said. Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. Nearly 45,000 criminal proceedings have been initiated over crimes allegedly committed by Russian service personnel during the invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian national police have said. An update published on Sunday said 47 places have been discovered where Russian forces are accused of illegally detaining and torturing Ukrainian. They include in liberated regions including Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv. There are more signs of life starting to return to a modicum of normality in Kherson as supermarkets are reopening. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. The city was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces after a Russian retreat. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. That’s all for today, thanks for following along. France has sent another two air defence systems to Ukraine, along with two multiple rocket launchers, according to an interview given by a French defence minister. Sébastien Lecornu told the Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that Paris was considering a request for radars. According to the minister, since the beginning of the large-scale Russian invasion, France has provided Ukraine with €550m of military aid and is among the five largest donor countries to the war effort. The French military have also trained Ukrainian soldiers. “Our task is to train 2,000 people out of the 15,000 proposed by the European Union. Some 400 Ukrainian military personnel have already been trained on operating equipment and weapons systems that we are providing to Ukraine,” Lecornu said, Ukrinform reports. The Ukrainian parliament’s commissioner for human rights has denied that Kyiv’s forces have killed Russian prisoners of war, claiming that Ukraine’s soldiers were defending themselves against Russians who feigned surrender. Videos circulated on Russian social media this week purporting to show the bodies of Russian service personnel killed after surrendering to Ukrainian troops, Agency France-Presse (AFP) reports. The Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said “excerpts” of a video showed that Russians “using a staged capture … committed a war crime by opening fire on the Ukrainian armed forces”. This means the soldiers “cannot be considered prisoners of war”, Lubinets argued. “Those who want to use the protection of international law to kill must be punished,” he added. AFP has not independently confirmed the videos. The Russian defence ministry said on Friday the videos showed the “deliberate and methodical murder of more than 10 restrained Russian soldiers”. It called for an investigation into “war crimes”. A United Nations spokesperson told AFP on Friday it was “aware of the videos” and “looking into them”. There are more signs of life starting to return to a modicum of normality in Kherson as supermarkets are reopening. ATB, a 24/7 shop in the city, had queues of people outside on Sunday as it welcomed customers back. The city was recently recaptured by Ukrainian forces after a Russian retreat. Anton Gerashchenko, a government adviser and former minister, said people were crying when they went back into the store for the first time. The supermarket opened a phone-charging service because of continuing issues with the city’s electricity supply. About 5 million people have lost their jobs in Ukraine owing to Russia’s invasion, according to Ukraine’s deputy economy minister. Tetyana Berezhna said fighting continued in the regions where 10 million people were once employed. She said the war, which led 7 million people to flee, had “significantly” affected the unemployment rate. “The war is destroying the Ukrainian labour market,” she said, according to the Kyiv Independent. Nearly 45,000 criminal proceedings have been initiated over crimes allegedly committed by Russian service personnel during the invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian national police have said. An update published on Sunday morning said investigators had launched 44,662 proceedings. It added that to date, 47 places where Russian forces are accused of illegally detaining and torturing Ukrainian citizens had been discovered in liberated regions including Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv. Investigators from the national police had inspected specified places of imprisonment and torture, it added. Here’s a short summary of key events so far during day 270 of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are “playing with fire”, the UN nuclear watchdog’s director general has said. It comes after a series of explosions in the area overnight, which damaged buildings and equipment. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said none of the blasts had been “critical” for nuclear safety and security.

Mykhaylo Podolyak said attempts by the west to urge Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow were “bizarre” given a series of major military victories by Kyiv. He added it would mean that a country “that recovers its territories must capitulate to the country that is losing”. The comments come after recent US media reports that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks. The Ukrainian operator of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant says Russian forces were behind Saturday night and Sunday morning’s shelling, contradicting Moscow’s claim that the attack came from Ukraine. The nuclear energy company Energoatom said there had been at least 12 hits on the plant’s infrastructure facilities, Reuters reports. The company posted on Telegram that the list of damaged equipment indicated that the attackers “targeted and disabled exactly the infrastructure that was necessary for the restart of 5th and 6th power units” and the restoration of power production for the country’s needs. AP reports that Ukraine is saying it will investigate controversial video footage circulating on social media that Moscow claims shows Ukrainian forces killing Russian troops while they tried to surrender. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister in charge of the country’s push to join the European Union, told the agency: “Of course Ukrainian authorities will investigate this video.” Speaking at a security forum in Halifax, Nova Scotia, she said it was “very unlikely” that the short clips show what Moscow claims. Russia said on Friday it had opened a criminal investigation based on the clips circulating on Russian social media, and its foreign ministry claims the footage shows an “execution”. Russia wants an international investigation but Stefanishyna said Ukrainian forces were “absolutely not interested in the execution of anybody” and were under direct orders to take “as many prisoners of war as we can” so they could be swapped in prisoner exchanges with Russia. The UN’s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has called for further investigation, which Stefanishyna said Ukraine had “no problem” with. Ukraine’s defence ministry has shared a daily update on Russian losses, reporting that 330 more soldiers were “eliminated” in the last 24 hours. The total number of Russian soldiers killed during the invasion now stands at 84,210, according to the ministry. Nearly 3,000 tanks have been destroyed since February, it said. The figures, yet to be independently verified, were posted alongside a quote from the American author Helen Keller. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has condemned an attack on the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Its director general said that those responsible for “powerful explosions” in the area on Saturday night and Sunday morning were “playing with fire”. Managers told IAEA experts at the plant there had been damage to some buildings, systems and equipment, but “none of them so far” critical for safety and security. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the IAEA said: “The news from our team yesterday and this morning is extremely disturbing. Explosions occurred at the site of this major nuclear power plant, which is completely unacceptable. “Whoever is behind this, it must stop immediately. As I have said many times before, you’re playing with fire!” Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is being shelled, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass, Reuters reports. It added that “Ukraine-fired” shells had landed near a dry storage site and no radioactive emissions were being detected. Renat Karchaa, an adviser from the Russian nuclear power operator Rosenergoatom, said 15 shells were fired at the plant’s facilities, according to Tass. The plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear station, has been under Russian occupation since March but continues to be operated by Ukrainian staff. Russia and Ukraine have blamed each other for previous shelling at the site that has caused damage to buildings and threatened a nuclear accident. Prior to Russia’s invasion, the facility provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity. It has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times since being occupied by Russian forces. Russia has reached agreement with Iran to begin manufacturing hundreds of unmanned weaponised aircraft on Russian soil, the Washington Post reports. Citing intelligence seen by US and other western security agencies, the newspaper said officials from Moscow and Tehran finalised the deal during a meeting in Iran earlier this month. Russia and Iran are moving rapidly to transfer designs and key components that could allow production to begin within months, three officials familiar with the matter are reported to have said. Russia’s defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment from the Post. As what is expected to be Ukraine’s toughest winter begins, much of its energy system has been crippled by targeted Russian strikes. It means that in recently liberated Kherson, those who live in houses have started to gather wood to burn. But Ukrainian authorities have warned citizens that Russian troops may have left behind mines, tripwires and unexploded shells in the woods. At the same time, those living in flats with old Soviet centralised heating systems have even fewer options. In their latest dispatch from the city, my colleagues Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw speak to residents facing more devastation after eight months of occupation. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has issued its daily intelligence update on the war in Ukraine. It says that Russia’s withdrawal from the Ukrainian port city of Kherson was “conducted in relatively good order” compared with previous major retreats from occupied areas. It is likely Russia lost only tens, rather than hundreds, of vehicles during the retreat. Meanwhile, it “successfully” destroyed most of the kit that was left behind to prevent it from falling into Ukrainian hands. This apparent improvement is likely due to a “more effective” single operational command under Gen Sergei Surovikin, the update says. Surovikin was appointed by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as overall commander of Russia’s “special military operation” in October. A key adviser to the Ukrainian presidency has told the AFP news agency that the west’s attempts to persuade Ukraine to negotiate with Moscow, after a series of major military victories by Kyiv, are “bizarre” and amount to asking for capitulation. “When you have the initiative on the battlefield, it’s slightly bizarre to receive proposals like: ‘you will not be able to do everything by military means anyway, you need to negotiate,” said Mykhaylo Podolyak. US media recently reported that some senior officials were beginning to encourage Ukraine to consider talks, which Zelenskiy has so far rejected without a prior withdrawal of Russian forces from all Ukrainian territory. According to Podolyak, Moscow has not made “any direct proposal” to Kyiv for peace talks, preferring to transmit them through intermediaries and even raising the possibility of a ceasefire. Kyiv sees such talk as mere manoeuvring by the Kremlin to win some respite on the ground and prepare a new offensive. New Zealand said on Sunday that its defence minister, Peeni Henare, had visited Kyiv to reaffirm support for Ukraine’s resistance to Russia’s invasion. “We discussed New Zealand’s recent extension of the infantry training support mission in the UK for Ukrainian troops out to July 2023,” Henare said in a statement after holding bilateral talks with his Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov. New Zealand last week said it would send a further 66 defence personnel to Britain to help train Ukrainian soldiers. Welcome back to our continuing live coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s a brief look at the latest developments as it approaches 9.15am in Kyiv. Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said at least 437 Ukrainian children have been killed and more than 837 injured as a result of Russia’s invasion. Five people were injured in a Russian strike on a humanitarian station in southern Ukraine, said Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a senior aide to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Around 60 Russian soldiers were killed this week in a long-range Ukrainian artillery attack on their positions in the town of Mykhailkva, 40km to the south of Kherson, Ukraine’s military said on Saturday. Rishi Sunak made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Saturday to meet Zelenskiy – Sunak’s first visit to the country since taking office. Sunak announced that Britain will provide a £50m air defence package for Ukraine, including anti-aircraft guns and technology to counter Iranian-supplied drones. Ukrainian electricity supplies are under control despite Russian attacks on power-generating infrastructure and there is no need to panic, the energy ministry said a day after the government stated that almost half of Ukraine’s energy system had been crippled, and authorities in Kyiv warned that the capital could face a “complete shutdown” of the power grid as winter sets in. Zelenskiy said on Saturday that the supply problems were worst in and around Kyiv as well as in six other regions. “We are working throughout the country to stabilise the situation,” he said in a video address. Ukrainian forces could be in Crimea by the end of December, the country’s deputy defence minister, Volodymyr Havrylov, has said. Jubilant Ukrainians rolled into Kherson by train for the first time in more than eight months as residents of the newly liberated southern city greeted them on the platform with flowers and national flags. Citing damage done by Russian forces, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk announced evacuations of people who want to leave Kherson and the surrounding areas would soon begin. The funeral took place on Saturday of a Polish man who was one of two victims killed when a missile crashed into a grain storage facility in the Polish village of Przewodow. Asia-Pacific leaders added their voices on Saturday to international pressure on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, issuing a summit statement saying “most” of them condemned the war. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin said China and Russia were seeking a world where force is used to resolve disputes and he vowed the United States would continue to defend humanitarian principles and international law. Peace in Ukraine will only be possible if the country’s 1991 borders are restored, a senior aide to Zelenskiy said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2023/may/28/labour-confirms-plans-to-block-all-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-projects","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-28T10:54:54Z","webTitle":"Labour confirms plans to block all new North Sea oil and gas projects","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/28/labour-confirms-plans-to-block-all-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-projects","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2023/may/28/labour-confirms-plans-to-block-all-new-north-sea-oil-and-gas-projects","fields":{"headline":"Labour confirms plans to block all new North Sea oil and gas projects","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Labour has confirmed it will block all new domestic oil and gas developments if it wins power, proposing instead to invest heavily in renewable sources such as wind and also in nuclear power. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said details would be announced soon. “What we’ll be doing in the coming weeks is outlining how we want to invest in the green jobs of the future, to bring bills down, to create a more sustainable energy supply,” he told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show. “We’ll be outlining that in a significant mission in the coming weeks, and we’ll be announcing more details then. “We know we’ve got to move to more renewable sources of energy. It’s important for our climate change commitments, but it’s also the way in which we can bring energy bills down for consumers. This isn’t about shutting down what’s going on now. We will manage those sustainably.” The proposals, which the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is expected to set out formally on a visit to Scotland next month, will involve not just a ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences, but a pledge that any borrowing for investment should be limited to green schemes. A party source said: “We are against the granting of new licences for oil and gas in the North Sea. They will do nothing to cut bills as the Tories have acknowledged; they undermine our energy security and would drive a coach and horse through our climate targets. “But Labour would continue to use existing oil and gas wells over the coming decades and manage them sustainably as we transform the UK into a clean energy superpower.” This will not stop drilling on projects that have already been approved, with the exception of the Rosebank and Cambo schemes, which Labour has said previously it would block. Asked if this would leave the country overreliant on wind power, Ashworth said: “It’s a mischaracterisation to say our policies all depend on wind. Yes, we need to invest in wind. We need to invest in tidal; we need to invest in nuclear. “We need more sustainable sources of energy supply in order to bring the bills down for consumers and actually create jobs in this green transition.” The aim, he said, should be for the UK to become a world leader in the green energy transition, and would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, said Labour’s plans amounted to an “ideological vendetta against British energy independence” that would risk jobs and help Russia in using energy supplies as a weapon. The proposal is the latest in a series of Labour pledges over a move towards a greener economy, much of it pushed by Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary. In 2021, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the party would invest £28bn a year in climate crisis-related measures, covering not just green energy but also areas such as home insulation, active travel and flood defences. At last year’s Labour conference, Starmer said Labour would set up a publicly owned energy company run on clean UK power, to be known as Great British Energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/feb/25/nuclear-meltdown-threat-ukraine-russia-attack","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-25T20:48:37Z","webTitle":"Fears mount for safety of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors amid Russian invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/nuclear-meltdown-threat-ukraine-russia-attack","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/feb/25/nuclear-meltdown-threat-ukraine-russia-attack","fields":{"headline":"Fears mount for safety of Ukraine’s nuclear reactors amid Russian invasion","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Concerns are mounting about the safety of Ukraine’s 15 nuclear reactors and the possibility of an ecological disaster in the midst of the Russian invasion. Experts said that those reactors, at four power plants around the country, had layers of safeguards to prevent a catastrophic meltdown of their cores, but in a full scale war of the kind Vladimir Putin has unleashed, there was a heightened risk of those safety layers all failing at once. Radiation spikes were reported on Friday from Chernobyl, the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster which has been overrun by Russian forces. The remains of the reactor core are buried under concrete and the plant is also a storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. The Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova said that responsibility for the plant, spelt Chornobyl in Ukrainian, now rested with Russia as strict regulations for the plant were not being observed. She accused the Russian forces of holding 92 plant personnel as hostages. Ukraine’s regulatory authority attributed the radiation spikes to military vehicles churning up top soil that is still contaminated by the 1986 reactor explosion. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said the readings from Chernobyl remained low and did not pose a danger to the public, but added that the agency was closely monitoring Ukraine’s reactors. It said the IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi “remained gravely concerned”. Six of Ukraine’s reactors are at a nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia, the second biggest in Europe, which is close to where the Russians deployed thousands of troops in amphibious landings on Friday. Up to now the Ukrainian nuclear regulator had assured the IAEA that all its reactors were working safely. However, the Russian advance from the south was fast approaching the area. While a direct strike on the plant remains a remote possibility, experts warn that a disaster could be caused if staff were abruptly prevented from reaching the facility or if there was a sustained interruption in the power supply required to keep the fuel rods continuously cooled. Nuclear power plants use diesel generators as a backup, but those rely on the supply of fuel, which could be severely limited in the midst of a war. “There are contingencies but I doubt that these power plants have prepared for a full-scale invasion,” said Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian research associate with Harvard University’s project on managing the atom. “In the middle of a large scale conflict, there’s a myriad of things that could happen, for which normal, even very robust, safety procedures at a nuclear power plant [would be insufficient].” The alleged taking of staff as hostages in Chernobyl highlighted the dangers to functioning reactors where operators were essential to shutting them down and keeping them cooled. “There are various different challenges from a staffing perspective. Firstly, can the staff actually get into work without being killed?” said James Acton, co-director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He added that reserves of diesel for emergency generators became a critical issue in the midst of a war. “Even if you’ve turned the reactor off, you still have a bunch of intensely radioactive fuel that’s generating heat in the core, and so it needs cooling continuously,” Acton said. “Without a grid connection, you’re reliant on whatever fuel or energy you have stored on site, and that is a finite quantity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/16/british-gas-owner-centrica-reports-record-profits-of-33bn","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-16T13:17:11Z","webTitle":"Centrica boss refuses to say if he will waive bonus after ‘obscene’ £3.3bn profit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/16/british-gas-owner-centrica-reports-record-profits-of-33bn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/16/british-gas-owner-centrica-reports-record-profits-of-33bn","fields":{"headline":"Centrica boss refuses to say if he will waive bonus after ‘obscene’ £3.3bn profit","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The chief executive of Centrica has refused to say whether he will waive a £1.6m bonus, as the British Gas owner’s annual profits tripled to a record £3.3bn after a price surge triggered by Russia’s halt on gas supplies to Europe. The company’s “monster” profits angered campaigners who are calling for tougher windfall taxes, lower bills and better treatment of vulnerable customers, after British Gas and other energy suppliers were ordered by regulators to halt forced installations of prepayment meters. O’Shea could land a pay package of more than £3m, including an annual bonus of as much as £1.6m. He waived a £1.1m bonus last year, saying he could not take it “given the hardships faced by our customers”. However, during a call on Thursday morning, O’Shea repeatedly refused to say whether he would do so again. O’Shea said it was “too early to have a conversation” about his potential bonus payout despite pressure from campaigners to reject it. Details of his pay will be revealed in next month’s annual report. Centrica announced it would hand £750m of its profits to shareholders. The dividend for the year will be worth more than £200m, while a further £300m will be spent boosting its share price by buying back its own stock. The sum is on top of an already announced £250m share buyback. The sums dwarf the £51m in UK government windfall taxes that Centrica said it had paid since the levy was introduced last year. Simon Francis, of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, has called on O’Shea to “look at his conscience”, citing the number of customers forced on to prepayment meters by British Gas, as many households struggle with a big jump in energy bills. The general secretary of the Unite union, Sharon Graham, said the profits were obscene. “These energy companies are showing us everything that is wrong with the UK’s broken economy,” she said. The company’s earnings for 2022 far outstrip the £948m made in 2021, aided by soaring profits in its North Sea oil and gas, and nuclear power divisions linked to the war in Ukraine. They also surpass Centrica’s previous record profit of £2.7bn, in 2012. The Trades Union Congress general secretary, Paul Nowak, called for public ownership of energy companies and said: “While millions of families struggle to heat their homes, firms like Centrica are raking in monster profits.” Centrica cut its dividend to shareholders during the Covid pandemic but reinstated it last year, when it made an interim £59m payout. Traders cheered Centrica’s performance, sending shares 5% higher in morning trading, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100 and helping to push the UK’s blue-chip share index to a new record high of 8,047. British Gas faced widespread criticism earlier this month when it emerged that debt agents working for Britain’s largest energy supplier had ignored customers’ vulnerabilities and forced them on to prepayment meters to recover debts. The revelations caused the company to suspend the use of court warrants to install prepayment meters, and all suppliers have been temporarily banned from the practice. On Thursday, Centrica said it was “extremely disappointed by the allegations surrounding one of our third-party contractors”. Centrica’s North Sea profits are subject to a UK windfall tax, and the company said it expects to pay £2.5bn between January 2023 and March 2028. It also has a 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear power stations, which are subject to the electricity generator levy implemented by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to capture windfall gains. Labour has called for the oil and gas windfall tax to be expanded to capture a greater proportion of profits. Pressure to review the tax has increased in recent weeks after big firms including Britain’s BP and Shell posted record profits. Profits at British Gas’s energy supply arm fell 39% to £72m. In August the company announced it would donate 10% of profits from that division to help its poorer customers manage rising gas and electricity bills for the “duration of the energy crisis”. O’Shea said the £75m Centrica had spent supporting British Gas household customers had surpassed the £72m profit made. Asked whether more of Centrica’s group profits should have been invested in helping households, O’Shea said: “If we were to invest profits from one part of our business that others couldn’t invest, I’m pretty sure that [rivals] would label this anti-competitive.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/mar/04/shares-tumble-attack-ukraine-nuclear-plant-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-04T17:47:42Z","webTitle":"Global shares tumble after Russian attack on Ukraine nuclear plant – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/mar/04/shares-tumble-attack-ukraine-nuclear-plant-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/mar/04/shares-tumble-attack-ukraine-nuclear-plant-business-live","fields":{"headline":"Global shares tumble after Russian attack on Ukraine nuclear plant – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s been a grim week for global stock markets while oil, gas and other commodity prices have continued to surge, from metals to crops.

The FTSE in London finished 251 points lower on Friday at 6,998, a 3.5% drop after the war in Ukraine escalated with a Russian attack on Europe’s biggest nuclear power station, Zaporizhzhia, which was then seized by Putin’s forces. The German and French stock markets fell more than 4%, taking the Dax in Frankfurt to its lowest levels since late 2020, while the Italian index tumbled 6.2% to its lowest level in more than a year. As stock markets slid, investors piled into investments regarded as safer – gold, currencies like the dollar and yen, and government bonds. British 10-year government bonds recorded their biggest weekly rise in more than a decade. As gilts were in demand, this pushed their yields, or returns to investors, down the most since November 2011 (when bond prices go up, yields go down). The Moscow stock exchange stayed closed all week, while the rouble fell to record lows amid wider sanctions on Russia. It hit an all-time low of 118.35 per dollar in Moscow on Thursday, and ended the week at 105 per dollar. Sterling lost 1% against the dollar to $1,3210. War in Ukraine has boosted demand for safe-haven investments like the dollar and gold. Spot gold rose 1.5% to $1,965 an ounce. The euro slipped below the $1.10 level for the first time since May 2020, down 1.4%, after the Russian attack on the Ukrainian power station, Europe’s biggest. The single currency has also been hurt by growing risks to the European economy and the expectation the US Federal Reserve will hike interest rates much faster than the European Central Bank. Fears of supply disruptions have sent commodity prices soaring. Aluminium has been hitting fresh record highs most days. Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange touched a new all-time high of $3,850 on Friday and was on track for its biggest weekly gain ever, rising 13% so far. Nickel prices rose more than 13% over the week, the biggest weekly rise in August 2019. Wheat traded in Chicago, the global benchmark, has soared more than 50% since Russia invaded Ukraine over a week ago. Prices rose as high as $13.40 a bushel on Friday. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: The global inflation shock has gained momentum this week with wheat prices rising to a 14-year high, corn prices to an 8-year high, and Brent crude prices hitting 10-year highs of $120 a barrel. The rise in agricultural commodity prices is particularly worrying given that the last time they were at these sorts of levels, we had the Arab Spring in 2012. Wholesale natural gas prices hit record highs. The UK National Balancing Point (NBP) benchmark soared above 500p a therm at one point, smashing through the previous all-time high set in December amid a prolonged surge that caused the collapse of a series of household gas suppliers. The Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) for delivery in April, a common benchmark for European gas, hit €200 for the first time, before settling back later in the day. Global food prices hit a record high in February, jumping 24% year-on-year, according to the UN food agency – even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here’s a selection of today’s top stories: Thank you for reading this week. My colleague Graeme Wearden will be back next week. Bye! – JK Here is our latest list of western sanctions against Russian oligarchs. Turning to the UK stock market, Hewson said: The FTSE 100 has also had a shocker of a week, posting its largest decline since March 2020, and below the 7,000 level to its lowest point since August last year. In terms of weekly performance, the best performers have been in defence, and commodities with weekly gains for BAE Systems, and the likes of Glencore, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta. Today’s sell-off has been broad based with travel and leisure getting hit hard as surging oil prices push up fuel costs for the airlines, as well as eroding consumers disposable incomes. While some airlines are partially hedged for rising fuel prices none of them are fully hedged. Eastern European based Wizz Air is once again on the receiving end of the heaviest losses. European banks are getting clobbered over concerns about the economic outlook for the European economy, rising inflation risk, and an ECB likely to remain behind the curve when it comes to raising rates. Amongst the worst performers French bank Société Générale is down over 25% this week, as is Italy’s UniCredit, while Deutsche Bank is down over 20%. UK banks have also been hit but their weekly losses have been more modest with Barclays down over 15% this week, the worst performer. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, has looked at this week in stock markets. Investors have piled out of European stocks this week, accelerating a decline that began at the end of last month, and has accelerated over the last two days. This morning’s reckless shelling of a Ukrainian nuclear power plant by Russian forces, shows that Putin is becoming increasingly desperate to obtain a victory in the face of numerous setbacks, and with little sign that he is inclined to back down. If anything, the stubbornness of Ukrainian forces is enraging him further, in turn raising the uncertainty level further. These actions are a significant escalation and raise the question as to whether Putin could adopt a scorched earth policy in his attempts to crush Ukrainian resistance. Fears of further escalations, on top of rising inflationary risks putting pressure on European companies’ margins, as well as future profits, and has seen the Dax slide to its lowest levels since December 2020. While Boris Johnson has claimed that Britain has been at the forefront of action against Russia, this is the reality. Sainsbury’s is renaming its chicken kiev to chicken kyiv and pulling a Russian-made vodka from its shelves in the latest action by a British retailer to signal solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The UK’s second-biggest supermarket said the packaging for the poultry dish would change in the next few weeks, switching the Soviet-era name for the country’s capital for the Ukrainian one. The move comes after several smaller operators announced a switch to chicken kyiv, including the Better Naked brand and Essex-based Our Local Butcher. Marks &amp; Spencer, which popularised the dish in the UK after making chicken kiev one of the first ready meals in 1979, has also come under pressure to rename the dish. John Lewis has become the latest retailer to remove Russian-made products from sale. The John Lewis partnership is working with suppliers to review products of Russian origin. It will stop selling Russian-made vodka in Waitrose and Russian-made pizza oven pellets in John Lewis department stores. Prices for natural gas are surging, while crude oil prices have also picked up again. British wholesale gas for immediate delivery has hit a record, up 29% to 490p per therm. Brent crude is trading $4.8 higher at $115.34 a barrel, after rising to $120 earlier following the Russian shelling of a Ukrainian nuclear power station, the biggest in Europe. Russian forces have taken control of it but luckily there is no damage to its six reactors, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. US light crude has surged $5.69 to $113.37 a barrel. Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM told Reuters: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine means that fears over supply will remain front and centre. He said there is a “new sense of urgency” for the west to try and strike a nuclear deal with Iran. Crude oil prices hit their highest level in a decade this week, rising to $120 a barrel for Brent. Prices are set to post their strongest weekly gains since the middle of 2020, with Brent up 17% and the US benchmark 21% higher. On the currency markets, sterling has lost 1% against the dollar to $1,3210. War in Ukraine has boosted demand for safe-haven investments like the dollar and gold. Spot gold is up 1% higher on the day, at $1,954 an ounce. Wall Street has opened lower, as worries over the escalating war in Ukraine outweighed the strong US non-farm payrolls report. The Nasdaq has extended its losses to 1% while the Dow Jones opened almost 140 point lower, or 0.4% and the S&amp;P 500 slid 0.6% at the opening bell. Over here, the sell-off on stock markets continues. The UK’s FTSE 100 has lost 191 points to 7,047, a 2.6% drop, while Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC have slid more than 3% and Italy’s FTSE MiB has tumbled 5%. James Knightly, chief international economist at ING, echoed those comments: The US labour market continues to tighten with unemployment now firmly below 4%. Given strong hiring intentions, this will keep upward pressure on pay with the Federal Reserve set to respond with higher interest rates despite uncertainty created by Russia’s assault on Ukraine. Michael Pearce, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: The stronger than expected 678,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in February and upward revisions to previous months gains is another sign that the real economy has considerable momentum, with the Omicron wave having had surprisingly little impact. That will give the Fed greater confidence to push ahead with its planned policy tightening but, with wage growth now levelling off, there is arguably less pressure for officials to front-load an aggressive series of rate hikes over the coming months. US employers took on 678,000 more workers in February, far more than expected. The latest non-farm payrolls report from the US Labor Department painted a strong picture of the labour market. Economists had pencilled in a rise of 400,000. The increase in jobs in January was revised higher to 481,000 from 467,000 and December was revised to 588,000 from 510,000. The unemployment rate dropped to 3.8%, the lowest since February 2020, from 4% in January. British wholesale gas for April delivery has jumped 30% to a record 455.04p per therm. If gas prices stay at the current high levels, UK energy household bills – which are rising by 54% in April to an average £2,000 per year under the regulator’s price cap – are likely to go up even more at the next review in October. JD Sports, Britain’s biggest sportswear chain, has announced that it has ceased all trading in Russia across its brand websites and wholesale channels. It doesn’t have any stores or employees in either Russia or Ukraine. It is one of a number of companies that have temporarily suspended operations in those countries, including Ikea and the Smirnoff maker Diageo. It’s not just wheat that is going up in price. The price of pork and other food is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. The Co-op became the first supermarket yesterday to stop selling Russian-made vodka, followed by Morrisons. Here is a video showing the Ukrainian nuclear power station under attack earlier today. The operator of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany has not filed for insolvency, the Russian TASS news agency cited the company as saying on Friday. There are reports that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project has filed for insolvency. This comes after the German chancellor Olaf Scholz halted certification of the controversial project a week and a half ago, the day after Vladimir Putin recognised the self-proclaimed separatist republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in east Ukraine and ordered troops into the area. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east. It would have doubled the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and kept 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. As reported earlier, Russian elites could have their property seized and handed over to Ukrainian refugees, Britain’s deputy prime minister has suggested. Dominic Raab made the remarks as he defended the UK’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, called for an emergency UN summit after a Russian attack on a nuclear power station in Ukraine. Asked on LBC radio whether Britain could capture property assets owned by Russian oligarchs in punishment for Moscow’s invasion on Ukraine, Raab said: “If we’ve got the evidence and the legal basis, then we’ll do it.” Here is our full story on the London Stock Exchange suspending the remainder of Russian-linked firms, and a British independent director resigning from the board of Evraz, the steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich holds a 29% stake. The travel giant Tui has announced that Vladimir Lukin has resigned from its board. Lukin has also terminated his relationship with Russia’s Severgroup, where he acted as special adviser to the chief executive. Lukin is a Russian politician, a former Human Rights Commissioner of Russia and a former president of the Russian Paralympic Committee, and served as the Russian Ambassador to the United States from 1992 to 1994. Severgroup is owned by Alexey Mordashov, a Russian oligarch who quit Tui’s board earlier this week. Mordashov, a metals magnate and one of Russia’s richest men, is the chairman of Severstal, one of Russia’s biggest steel producers. Mordashov is also Tui’s single largest shareholder with a 34% stake, and this stake has been frozen as he is under sanctions from the EU, targeting individuals with close ties to the Russian president Vladimir Putin. European shares are sliding deeper into the red, after Russian shelling at a Ukrainian nuclear plant – Europe’s biggest nuclear power station – led to a fire that burned for several hours, before being extinguished. The reactors are fine, according to the Ukrainian authorities, but this illustrates the dangers to a nuclear plant in a military conflict and has caused deep unease at the International Atomic Energy Agency. Putin’s forces have seized the power station. UK’s FTSE 100 down 109 points, or 1.5%, at 7,129 Germany’s Dax down 273 points or 2%, at 13,423 France’s CAC down 125 points, or 2%, at 6,249 Italy’s FTSE MiB down 606 points, or 2.5%, at 23,357 The Moscow stock exchange has been shut all week. The Russian rouble has weakened 2.35% to 108.70 per dollar, after hitting 116p per dollar, near a record low. This video clip went viral last night: On the commodities markets, Brent crude is trading at $110.84 a barrel, up 0.3%, while US light crude is at $108.44 a barrel. Oil prices are set for their strongest weekly gain since mid-2020. British wholesale natural gas for next-day delivery is nearly 3% higher at 395p per therm, after approaching December’s record high of above 450p earlier this week. The Dutch futures contract has hit record highs in recent days above €185 per megawatt hour and is currently nearly 4% higher at €167. Commodity markets are on track for their biggest weekly gains in years after the shuttering of Ukrainian ports, fighting in several major cities and widening sanctions against Russia led buyers of oil and gas, crops and metals to look for alternatives. Russia and Ukraine together account for just under 30% of global wheat supplies, and Russia is a major exporter of oil, gas, aluminium, nickel and other metals. The Chicago Board of Trade’s most-active wheat futures contract has climbed 40% this week, the biggest weekly gain on record, while corn is 16% ahead and soybeans have added 5%. Analysts at ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets said: We are seeing the commodity ‘melt-up continue with no sign of a let-up. This is obviously grim news for people around the world, who are likely to have to pay more for their household energy and food in coming months. Higher oil and prices will translate into higher transport and production costs, pushing up all goods prices. Richard Hunter, head of markets at the investment firm interactive investor, said Risk assets lurched lower once more following reports of an attack on a nuclear plant in Ukraine, while commodities continued their rise amid the inflationary impacts of the conflict. Oil spiked to almost $120 per barrel on the news before settling back to around $112 – but still up by 44% in the year to date – as news emerged that an increase in output following a deal between the US and Iran is not close to materialising. Meanwhile, there were further spikes in commodities such as nickel, copper and aluminium as the escalation of sanctions on Russia threatened general supply chains. The current turmoil leaves central banks somewhere between a rock and a hard place. The Federal Reserve , for example, needs to weigh the likely economic damage to growth against the inflationary pressure of commodities. Chairman Powell indicated earlier in the week that an interest rate rise of 0.25% rather than 0.5% was imminent, which was initially of comfort to investors, but has added that it was “too early to say if Russia changes the rate path.” Further confirmation of a recovering US economy is expected later in the form of the monthly non-farm payrolls report, although this lagging indicator does not encompass the current impacts of the tensions. The limited appetite for risk assets is clearly shown by the performance of the major indices. In the year to date, the Dow Jones is now down by 7%, the S&amp;P 500 by 8.5% and the Nasdaq by 13.5%. The FTSE 100 is certainly not immune from the global uncertainty, but the latest round of tensions has sent the index into negative territory for the year. The UK’s premier index had steadfastly been clinging to small gains, propelled by its defensive nature, peppering of inflation-proof stocks, and a large exposure to the oil and mining sectors. However, after another weak opening in early exchanges, the FTSE100 now stands down by 2.7% in the year to date. British deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said that Britain will seize the properties of Russian oligarchs if there is the legal basis to do so. Speaking on LBC Radio, Raab said: If we’ve got the evidence and there is the legal basis, we’ll do it. Asked if he would support using such properties to Ukrainian refugees, he said: Yes, absolutely, we’re looking at everything in the round. Britain has been criticised for being slow to apply sanctions to pro-Putin Russian oligarchs, while Germany and France seized two yachts owned by Russian billionaires in recent days. Here’s a round-up of today’s other main stories so far. Britain’s economic growth will halve this year as a result of soaring inflation, hefty tax rises and the destabilising shock from the war in Ukraine, a leading business lobby group has warned. In the first major forecast of the UK economy since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it expected an inflation rate of 8% to cut disposable incomes in 2022, putting the brakes on the recovery from the pandemic. The UK has sanctioned two new billionaire allies of Vladimir Putin, amid growing pressure to speed up the crackdown on Russian oligarchs, with delays blamed on legal issues and poor preparation. Amid widespread criticism of the delays to sanctioning more Kremlin allies, the Guardian understands ministers are set to reform “intimidation lawsuits” to crack down on multimillion legal bills from oligarchs. The oligarchs Alisher Usmanov and Igor Shuvalov were added to the UK sanctions list on Thursday night, a week after it was announced there would be a “hitlist” of more than 100 oligarchs. Both will be cut off from their multimillion pound British mansions, with a full asset freeze and travel ban. Sajid Javid has said the NHS in England must stop using energy supplied by the Russian-owned firm Gazprom. European stocks have slid at the open. UK’s FTSE 100 down 46 points, or 0.67%, at 7,191 Germany’s Dax down 1.4% France’s CAC down 1% Italy’s FTSE MiB down 1.35% at 23,632 Spain’s Ibex down 0.3% The LSE’s move to suspend eight more stock listings means that all 36 companies with strong Russian links are now suspended from the London market. It suspended global depositary receipts, which represent shares in a foreign company. It said it was taking the action “in light of market conditions, and in order to maintain orderly markets”. The LSE added state-owned Federal Grid, Russia’s largest transmission company, the telecoms provider Rostelecom, the residential property developer Etalon, the supermarket chain O’Key, the fertiliser company Acron, the food retail chain Magnit, investment firm Sistema and the commercial seaport Novorossiysk to its list of companies barred from trading in London. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Shares have tumbled after a fire burned for several hours at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, following shelling from Russian forces. It was later put out and Ukrainian authorities said the reactors were safe. The International Atomic Energy Agency said the fire had not affected “essential” equipment. However, the incident underlined the dangers to a nuclear plant in the midst of a conflict. Reuters reported that Russian forces have seized the power station, citing Ukrainian authorities. Major stock indices in Asia fell sharply, with Japan’s Nikkei closing 2.2% lower and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng losing 2.7%. European markets are expected to open lower again, after heavy losses in recent days. The Moscow stock exchange will stay shut for a fifth day. The international benchmark Brent crude jumped above $114 a barrel but later retreated to just under $112 a barrel, up 1.3% on the day. The head of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said he was “deeply concerned” about the situation at the nuclear plant. Russia’s week-long invasion of Ukraine has sparked a rally in commodities prices amid fears of supply disruption. Wheat prices hit a fresh 14-year high yesterday, with Chicago futures closing almost 22% higher at $12.89 a bushel. In Asia today, Chinese wheat prices jumped 6% to an all-time high of 3,595 renminbi a metric tonne. Aluminium, which has hit several fresh record peaks this week, is heading for the biggest weekly gain on record, up more than 13% so far, as fears of supply disruption deepened. The metal touched an all-time peak of $3,850 a tonne this morning. Benchmark nickel rose 2.7% and hovered close to a seven-year high of $27,976 a tonne touched on Thursday. Russia is a major producer of both metals, wheat and other commodities. James Rutherford has resigned from the board of Evraz, the London-listed steel and mining group in which Roman Abramovich holds a 29% stake. The news comes a day after the Institute of Directors urged British directors to stand down from the boards of Russian companies. The London Stock Exchange has suspended the stock listings of several more Russian-based companies, including Sistema and Magnit, after suspending 27 yesterday.

While metropolitan Liberals have made it clear they will not support new coal-fired power, and the International Energy Agency has advised wealthy countries to phase out coal power plants by the end of the decade, Joyce used an interview on Sky News to champion modern coal plants, and declare he was in favour of nuclear reactors. “We absolutely need high-efficiency, low-emission coal-fired power stations,” Joyce said, before sharing his thoughts on coal exports. “No one likes big holes in the ground … but the point is, you like your health system, you like your education system. “This money has to come from somewhere. From the red rocks – iron ore. From the black rocks – coal.” The deputy prime minister also blasted Australia’s banks for managing carbon risk. Asked by Sky host Alan Jones what he would say “to people like the governor of the Bank of England, or our own banks here – the ANZ won’t fund the port of Newcastle – and the governor of the Reserve Bank”, Joyce declared Australian banks were the recipients of government protection, and that meant there should be reciprocity. Joyce noted Australia’s “four pillar” banking regulations – a Keating-era competition policy – prevented any merger between the major banks. “We protect [the banks], right, we protect them from competition,” the Nationals leader told Jones. “I think that comes with a responsibility that if something is legal and financially stands up, then you should be investing in it.” He suggested “a lot” of banking executives “believe that they own the banks, they made the banks”. “No. They just presented very well for an interview, which got them a job in the bank, and they don’t own it, it’s not their money and they should reflect on that and stop acting like it’s their actual money.” Keith Pitt, the Queensland National and resources minister who lost his cabinet spot in a recent reshuffle triggered by Joyce’s return, last year demanded a parliamentary inquiry, chaired by longtime Joyce-backer George Christensen, after a climate change commitment from ANZ to step back from business customers with material thermal coal exposure. ANZ’s market signalling last October sparked consternation within the Nationals. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, called for a boycott of the bank, and Michael McCormack, then the deputy prime minister, declared the bank’s plan “virtue signalling”. Christensen has previously denied the link between climate change and the severity of natural disasters. While some Nationals contend carbon risk management practices by the banks are unnecessary, Australia’s central bank has delivered clear warnings that climate change is exposing financial institutions and the financial system more broadly to risks that will rise over time if action isn’t taken. The RBA says while climate change is not yet a significant threat to financial stability in Australia, it is becoming increasingly important for investors and institutions to actively manage carbon risk. The banks and their lobbying arm, the Australian Banking Association, have also used new submissions to Pitt’s parliamentary inquiry to implicitly rebut claims from senior Nationals that their actions amount to moral posturing or virtue signalling. The major banks and the ABA have pointed out that current carbon risk practices – namely, disclosing information relating to climate exposures and calculating the potential risk of climate change on their balance sheets – are requirements driven by international governance-setting bodies, of which Australian regulators and Australian companies are members. The Nationals have been resisting an attempted pivot by Scott Morrison on climate policy. The prime minister says he supports Australia reaching net zero emissions as soon as possible, and “preferably” by 2050. Even though Morrison has made it clear that any net zero commitment won’t be legislated, and the transition will include the use of gas as a transitional fuel, and the government will work to ensure regional Australia benefits from the transition by building new industries, like hydrogen – some Nationals have dug their heels in. Joyce told Jones he was a supporter of Australia adopting nuclear power if people wanted zero-emission power generation. But he said whether the nation went down that road was ultimately a matter for voters. “I can’t change the nuclear position,” the Nationals leader said. “I believe we should have nuclear power and, and I believe that anything to make our nation a stronger place, this is the path we should be going down, and if people want zero emissions – well, this, this is it. “I mean, you have your wind, you can have your solar, but if you want baseline, deliverable, 24/7 zero-emission power, then nuclear does it.” Joyce said small modular reactors could “power the city of Tamworth, the city of Armidale and a lot of other towns beside” with technology you could transport “on the back of a truck”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/building-britains-biggest-nuclear-power-station-review-so-boring-its-a-masterpiece","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-02T21:00:00Z","webTitle":" Building Britain’s Biggest Nuclear Power Station review – so boring it’s a masterpiece!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/building-britains-biggest-nuclear-power-station-review-so-boring-its-a-masterpiece","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jun/02/building-britains-biggest-nuclear-power-station-review-so-boring-its-a-masterpiece","fields":{"headline":" Building Britain’s Biggest Nuclear Power Station review – so boring it’s a masterpiece!","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"This programme was so boring. How boring? Let’s put it this way. It dealt with a 130-metre-long boring machine that is boring three boreholes under the Bristol Channel’s Jurassic bedrock. It’s a machine even more boring than the one boring through the Chilterns to make the rail journey to or from Birmingham less boring. As if that were possible. The machine is so boring it doesn’t have a name, though if there were a public vote it would be called Borey McBoreface. First, we saw the boring machine arriving by barge then loaded on to trucks and driven under police escort through Somerset lanes. This sequence was so devoid of incident it resembled that four-hour BBC film of a sleigh ride across the tundra in real time. At least the tundra film had huskies. Director Mat Stimpson only had an answer to the question “Where did all the interchangeable male engineers in hi-vis gilets and hard hats go?” Actually that’s not fair: there was a female engineer, whom we saw checking that the ambient temperature didn’t rise too fast to make concrete set too quickly. Which wasn’t boring at all. Then, improbably, something happened. A tractor blocked the convoy’s route. Could this tractor halt the £22bn project for a plant due to generate 3.2 gigawatts of power, supplying about 7% of total UK electricity? Could the tractor stop Hinkley Point C becoming operational in 2025? Was this in fact passive resistance by nuclear protesters otherwise minimally represented in this BBC Two documentary? Sadly, the answer to all these questions was no. The farmer reversed into a lay-by. The driver waved his thanks and proceeded to his destination. Gosh, that was exciting. Then we saw the boring machine in action. “This,” said an engineer, “is what we’ve been waiting for.” Speak for yourself. It must be tricky to film an underwater boring machine in action, so Stimpson cut to a graphic showing how pre-cast concrete panels are installed by automated paws (if that’s the right word) as the machine drills and rubble is pumped backwards through some internal tube (I’m no engineer). This documentary, made in association with the Open University, was educational. I learned there is one thing more dull than watching paint dry, namely watching concrete being poured. And not just any old concrete, but 9,000 cubic metres of special concrete in a circle 56 metres in diameter and several metres deep. And not just any old pour but a non-stop pour lasting 70 hours, overseen by a man sipping from an “I heart concrete” mug. If there has ever been a more boring pouring, don’t feel as though you have to tell me about it. The pour had a moment of jeopardy. Engineers worried the sun might dry the concrete too fast, causing cracking through which water might seep in. This, you’d think, would be disastrous for the reactors that are to be installed above this concrete foundation inside walls so tough that they can resist earthquakes, tsunamis, aircraft and, fingers crossed, Chernobyl part two. Happily, the pour ended without cracking. There was even a man with a hose winched above the concrete to water it so it didn’t harden too quickly. I know this because I watched him do it for minutes of my life I’ll never get back. None of the above should be taken as suggesting I didn’t enjoy this programme. This was bravura telly of the old school. Instead of some over-caffeinated muppet getting conniptions over loo roll manufacture in Manchester (Gregg Wallace) or the sausage production of the Volkswagen canteen in Wolfsburg (Richard Hammond), Stimpson dared to make a fact-packed programme narrated in calm voiceover by Priyanga Burford. It unfolded with the necessary tedium and professional integrity of Chris Whitty asking for the next slide. Through this boring approach, something magical emerged. Like Chartres Cathedral, Hinkley Point C is being made by anonymous humans whose work is too rarely hymned. But unlike the former, it is not dedicated to the glory of God but to meeting British energy consumption, which is expected to double by 2050. Questions remain. Is nuclear power a solution to Britain’s looming energy gap? Where will the nuclear waste go? Can we send it with our recycling to Turkey, and if not why not? Are we happy that a Franco-Chinese collaboration has its fingers on Somerset’s foremost nuclear button? Will lockdown delay the project? Where does all that rubble go? Quantocks, you reply. There’s no need for that language. One last question. In the kitchens, two men were stirring a big pot. Needs more cumin, said one. They were making possibly the world’s biggest Moroccan shepherd’s pie for famished workers. I wrote in my notebook: “Do Moroccans eat Moroccan shepherd’s pie – check.” It seems very improbable. Reading that now, I realise it’s not this programme that was boring. It’s me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/jun/21/fight-climate-crisis-clean-energy-nuclear-power","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-21T10:18:42Z","webTitle":"If we want to fight the climate crisis, we must embrace nuclear power | Bhaskar Sunkara","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/21/fight-climate-crisis-clean-energy-nuclear-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/21/fight-climate-crisis-clean-energy-nuclear-power","fields":{"headline":"If we want to fight the climate crisis, we must embrace nuclear power","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"On 30 April, the Indian Point nuclear power plant 30 miles north of New York City was shut down. For decades the facility provided the overwhelming majority of the city’s carbon-free electricity as well as good union jobs for almost a thousand people. Federal regulators had deemed the plant perfectly safe. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, a key figure behind the move, said that the shuttering of Indian Point brought us “a big step closer to achieving our aggressive clean energy goals”. It’s hard to reconcile that optimism with the data that’s recently come out. The first full month without the plant has seen a 46% increase in the average carbon intensity of statewide electric generation compared to when Indian Point was fully operational. New York replaced clean energy from Indian Point with fossil fuel sources like natural gas. It’s a nightmare we should have seen coming. In Germany, nuclear power formed around a third of the country’s power generation in 2000, when a Green party-spearheaded campaign managed to secure the gradual closure of plants, citing health and safety concerns. Last year, that share fell to 11%, with all remaining stations scheduled to close by next year. A recent paper found that the last two decades of phased nuclear closures led to an increase in CO2 emissions of 36.3 megatons a year - with the increased air pollution potentially killing 1,100 people annually. Like New York, Germany coupled its transition away from nuclear power with a pledge to spend more aggressively on renewables. Yet the country’s first plant closures meant carbon emissions actually increased, as the production gap was immediately filled through the construction of new coal plants. Similarly, in New York the gap will be filled in part by the construction of three new gas plants. For the Germans, investment in renewables did eventually pay dividends, but it largely replaced the old nuclear plants’ output rather than reducing existing fossil fuel consumption. The carbon intensity of German electricity is higher than the EU average. However, even a more aggressive investment in renewable energy wouldn’t have solved Germany’s problem. There are just a handful of large economies that have already mostly decarbonized their grids; all of them have a foundation of nuclear or hydroelectricity (or both), and then to greater or lesser degrees add renewables like wind and solar on top. This is because nuclear and hydro are able to provide electricity whenever we need it. These “firm” sources of clean electricity do not need to wait for the sun to shine or the wind to blow to power the ventilators in our hospitals. Batteries and other forms of energy storage are great, and we need much more funding of research and development to make them even better, but until huge technological leaps occur, sustainables are hindered by the need for cooperative weather. Elsewhere around the world, even where we’ve been investing in renewable technology, without nuclear or the right geography that allows hydroelectricity, we’ve had no choice but to rely on fossil fuels to fill the gap. So why, given the stakes of global warming, is there still so much hostility to nuclear power? Some of the paranoia is no doubt rooted in cold war-era associations of peaceful nuclear power with dangerous nuclear weaponry. We can and should separate these two, just like we are able to separate nuclear bombs from nuclear medicine. And we should also push back against popular narratives around Chernobyl and other disasters that simply aren’t replicable with modern technology. Advanced reactors and many existing ones are designed with passive safety systems – they don’t need active intervention by humans or a computer to deactivate in case of emergencies. Instead these plants use natural forces such as gravity to disable them, while maintaining active monitoring as a backup. As the science journalist Leigh Phillips puts it, “it is no more physically possible for them to melt down than it is for balls to spontaneously roll up hills.” There are some legitimate concerns about nuclear waste, but the public perception is driven by outdated information. The amount of waste produced by plants has been reduced dramatically, and most of what remains can be recycled to generate more electricity. These worries are not particularly unique to nuclear, either. Renewable energy produces waste of its own – solar, for example, requires heavy metals like cadmium, lead and arsenic, which unlike nuclear waste don’t lose their toxicity over time. As an article in Science points out: “Current electric vehicle batteries are really not designed to be recycled” and could pose public health problems as battery cells decay in landfills. Other objections to nuclear power, like its reliance on mining, are also not unique to nuclear. Renewables require destructive extraction to unearth lithium and other critical minerals. The answer to those concerns is simple: we should demand environmental and labor regulations from the state and defend good working conditions as our primary consideration. But opposing socially necessary extraction as a matter of principle simply isn’t compatible with wanting to live in a world that can meet basic human needs. I’m not alone in expressing these sentiments. Beyond just preserving existing nuclear facilities, Americans’ support for constructing new plants is now at 50%, markedly higher than in years past. On the political left, in particular, where opposition to nuclear first catalyzed decades ago, there seems to be a shift underway. After initial hesitation, Alexander Ocasio-Cortez has said her Green New Deal leaves the door open for nuclear power. More unabashed was the backing from Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party, former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Bolivia’s eco-socialist former president Evo Morales. Nuclear is an idea whose time came and seemed to have passed, but may indeed have a future. For those of us looking for a solution to climate change, the least we can ask is that no plants like Indian Power close until we have a clean, dependable and scalable alternative already in place.

Russia’s permanent representative to the body, Vasily Nebenzya, told Interfax on Friday that Moscow must “protect” the Zaporizhzhia plant. A withdrawal of its troops would make the facility “vulnerable … to provocations and terrorist attacks”, he said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, had earlier called for all military personnel and equipment to be pulled out, saying the plant “should not be used as part of any military operations” and a demilitarised zone needed to be agreed. Both the US and France backed Guterres’ appeal. Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, said officials must visit the plant as soon as possible. “This is a serious hour, a grave hour,” Grossi told the UN security council. Ukraine and Russia on Friday accused each other of risking nuclear catastrophe at the plant, which lies on the opposite bank of a reservoir from several Ukrainian-held towns and cities that have come under intense shelling from the Russian-held side. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on Friday said Ukraine was shelling the plant itself. “They say it’s Russia,” he wrote on Telegram. “That’s obviously 100% nonsense, even for the stupid Russophobic public.” Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, added: “They say it happens purely by chance, like ‘we didn’t mean to’. What can I say? Let’s not forget that the European Union also has nuclear power plants. And accidents can happen there, too.” Ukraine’s Energoatom agency, whose workers still operate the plant under Russian occupation, said it was struck five times on Thursday, including near where radioactive materials are stored. Kyiv said Russian troops struck it themselves, and were also using the plant as a shield to provide cover while they bombard nearby Ukrainian-held towns and cities. “The Ukrainian armed forces do not damage the infrastructure [of the plant], do not strike where there may be a danger on a global scale,” the army spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk told national television. “We understand that the invaders are hiding behind such a shield because it is not possible to strike there.” Earlier this week, Ukraine accused Russia of firing rockets from around the captured plant, killing at least 13 people and wounding 10, in the knowledge it would be too dangerous for Ukraine to return fire. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, demanded Russia return the plant to Ukraine’s control. “Only a full withdrawal of the Russians … and the restoration of full Ukrainian control of the situation around the station can guarantee a resumption of nuclear security for all of Europe,” he said in his latest video address. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, has previously warned of the danger of shells hitting containers of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel. If two or more containers were to be broken, “it is impossible to assess the scale” of the resulting disaster, he said, adding that “such insane actions could lead to … a Fukushima or Chornobyl”. Grossi said he was ready to lead an international expert mission to inspect the site in south-eastern Ukraine and called on Russia and Ukraine to cooperate so officials could travel as soon as possible. “Time is of the essence,” he told the 15-member security council late on Thursday, adding that the agency could perform urgent work on safeguards and provide a stabilising influence in order “to prevent a nuclear accident”. Fighting has intensified in recent days in anticipation of what Ukraine says is a planned counteroffensive in the south. The country’s general staff on Friday reported shelling and air attacks by Russian forces on scores of towns and bases. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the eastern Donetsk region, said on Telegram seven civilians had been killed and 14 wounded in the past 24 hours. Britain’s defence ministry said on Friday that explosions earlier this week at the Russian-operated Saky military airfield in western Crimea were “almost certainly” the result of the detonation of up to four uncovered munition storage areas. It did not say what the exact cause of the blasts was but said at least five Su-24 fencer fighter-bombers and three Su-30 flanker H multi-role jets appeared to have been destroyed or seriously damaged. The airfield itself, while seriously damaged, probably remained serviceable, the report added. Kyiv has not claimed responsibility for the attack or explained how it was carried out. Russia has denied aircraft were damaged and said the explosions at the base were accidental."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-430-of-the-invasion","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-29T15:06:41Z","webTitle":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 430 of the invasion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-430-of-the-invasion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/29/russia-ukraine-war-at-a-glance-what-we-know-on-day-430-of-the-invasion","fields":{"headline":"Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 430 of the invasion","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A huge fire was burning in the Crimean port city of Sevastopol on Saturday after what was reported to be a Ukrainian drone strike on fuel tanks at a Russian navy depot. Video footage posted on social media showed a large waterside area on fire, with a column of black smoke rising from the burning fuel. Other images showed a huge pall of smoke hanging over the area. The fire was later extinguished on the same day, according to Moscow-installed governor Mikhail Razvozhaev. The death toll from Russia’s aerial attacks on cities across Ukraine early on Friday has risen to at least 25, including five children. Firefighters tackled a blaze at a residential apartment hit by a Russian missile in the central town of Uman and rescue workers clambered through a huge pile of smouldering rubble searching for survivors. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has said it is necessary to ensure Russia’s invasion of Ukraine does not succeed and that Seoul is considering its options when it comes to providing lethal aid to Kyiv. Yoon said the Russian invasion was a violation of international law and the rights of Ukrainians. There is a realistic possibility the Russian missile strike that struck Ukraine on Friday was an attempt to intercept Ukrainian reserve units and military supplies that were recently given to the country, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said on Saturday. In its intelligence update on the conflict, the MoD said Moscow launched “the first major wave of cruise missile strikes against Ukraine since early March 2023.” The bombardment killed at least 25 people, and were a departure from Russia’s use of long-range strikes that targeted energy infrastructure over winter, the MoD said. Russia says it will lodge an official diplomatic protest over what it says is the illegal seizure by the Polish authorities of its embassy school in Warsaw. Moscow’s ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, told Russian state news agencies on Saturday that the move was illegal, but Poland said it was within its rights to take back the building. Ukraine’s president said on Friday that he had asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to help bring back Ukrainian children deported by Russia. More than 16,000 Ukrainian children have been deported to Russia since the invasion, according to Kyiv. Russian occupying authorities in southern Ukraine said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were subjecting the city of Novaya Kakhovka to “intense artillery fire” that had cut off electricity. The city’s authorities said on Telegram: “Novaya Kakhovka and settlements around the district are under very intense artillery fire from the armed forces of Ukraine.” Novaya Kakhovka is in the part of the southern Kherson region that Russia controls. A Moscow court has fined a Russian baker who decorated her cakes with pro-Ukraine and peace slogans. Since President Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine in February 2022, authorities have banned all public criticism of the offensive. On Friday, the Izmailovo district court in Moscow ordered the baker Anastasia Chernysheva to pay a fine of 35,000 rubles (around £350) for “discrediting” the Russian army. Russia’s embassy in Ireland has warned of possible “ensuing consequences” over tributes paid to an Irishman killed while fighting in Ukraine. Finbar Cafferkey, from Achill Island in Co Mayo, is reported to have been killed while serving as a military volunteer in eastern Ukraine, PA Media reports. In the wake of his death, the Irish deputy premier, Micheál Martin, expressed his sympathies to Cafferkey’s family and said he had obviously been “a young man of clear principles”. In response, the Russian embassy issued a stark warning against encouraging Irish citizens to take part in the conflict in Ukraine. Five EU countries have agreed on a deal to allow the transit of Ukrainian food exports, the European Commission said, after temporary bans were imposed on the foodstuffs amid protests by farmers. The agreement with Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia comes as limits on Ukraine grain’s export channel via the Black Sea necessitate export overland via the country’s neighbours. A leaked internal review commissioned by Amnesty International is said to have concluded there were significant shortcomings in a controversial report prepared by the rights group that accused Ukraine of illegally endangering citizens by placing armed forces in civilian areas. The report last August prompted widespread anger in Ukraine, leading to an apology from Amnesty and a promise of a review by external experts. Ukraine’s forces are concluding preparations for a long-expected spring counteroffensive againstRussian troops and are broadly ready, the country’s defence minister has said. Oleksii Reznikov told an online briefing on Friday: “As soon as there is God’s will, the weather and a decision by commanders, we will do it.” He gave no date for the start of the counteroffensive, intended to repel Russian forces from the east and south, but said: “Globally speaking, we are to a high percentage ready.” Vladimir Putin has said Russia needs to act quickly and as a “cohesive team” to counter the west’s “economic aggression”, adding that Moscow would expand ties with countries in Eurasia, Africa and Latin America. A Ukrainian journalist who formerly worked for the BBC has been killed fighting on the frontline. Oleksandr Bondarenko volunteered for Ukraine’s territorial defence after Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and later became part of the military. Details of how he was killed in action are not yet known, BBC News reports. Bondarenko, known as Sasha or Sashko, worked at the BBC’s Ukrainian service from 2007 to 2011, broadcasting from Kyiv. His colleagues paid tribute to the “extraordinary” reporter and news presenter. A Russian navy vessel specialising in submarine operations was photographed near the sabotaged Nord Stream gas pipelines just days before the mysterious blasts last September, according to the Danish daily newspaper Information. The prosecutor leading Sweden’s investigation into the sabotage of the pipelines linking Russia to Germany confirmed the existence of the previously publicly unknown photographs. The UK has signed a £1.9bn ($2.4bn) deal with Poland to provide the country with a British-designed air defence system. About 22 Polish air defence batteries will be equipped with common anti-air modular missiles (Camms) and launchers as part of the arrangement. It expands on pre-existing defence ties with Poland, where Camms are already deployed with the British army following Russia’s invasion. Russia informed the UN’s nuclear watchdog that equipment spotted at Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant would be used to fix a power transmission line that leads to Russian-held territory, the watchdog said on Friday. The planned restoration of the downed power line could heighten Ukrainian fears that Russia is preparing to connect Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, to the power grid of territory that it controls. Vladimir Putin has signed a decree giving people living in parts of Ukraine that are under Moscow’s control a route to Russian citizenship – but it also means that those who decline it, or do not legalise their status, potentially face deportation. The decree – which covers Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia – sets out ways that Ukrainian citizens living there can start the process of becoming Russian citizens or legalise their status. Spain’s foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador over a video shared on the embassy’s social media accounts that falsely portrayed Spanish troops fighting in Ukraine. Spanish media said the video, which has now been taken down, showed what the embassy claimed were Spanish soldiers on the battlefield, set against a clip of Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, saying Spanish troops would never fight in Ukraine.

She is among the most famous people in the Russian-speaking world for hits such as the 1982 song Million Scarlet Roses and the 1978 film The Woman Who Sings. Her husband, the television presenter and comedian Maxim Galkin, joined journalists, human rights activists and Kremlin opponents in September in being labelled a “foreign agent” for opposing the invasion. The couple left Russia for Israel shortly after the war began in February: Galkin, 46, is eligible for Israeli citizenship under the country’s law of return, which gives people with Jewish roots the right to acquire Israeli citizenship. Pugacheva, however, appears to have returned to Russia with their two children ahead of the new school year, attending the funeral of the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow in September. Last month, after Galkin’s designation, the singer made a bold statement against the war in Ukraine, in an address to the Russian justice ministry posted to her Instagram account. “I am asking you to include me on the foreign agents list of my beloved country,” she wrote. “Because I stand in solidarity with my husband, who is an honest and ethical person, a true and incorruptible Russian patriot, who only wishes for prosperity, peace and freedom of expression in his motherland.” The artist said her husband wanted “the end of the deaths of our boys for illusory goals that make our country a pariah and weigh heavily on the lives of its citizens”. According to the Russian state media outlet RIA Novosti, Pugacheva has since been placed under investigation for “discrediting” the Russian army. Domestic criticism of the invasion of Ukraine has been met with a fierce crackdown, including fines and prison sentences for dissenters. About 24,000 Russians have moved to Israel since the start of the war, and another 35,000 are waiting for paperwork to be processed, according to the Jewish Agency, which facilitates Jewish immigration to Israel. Israel has tried to remain neutral since the conflict began. The country relies on Moscow to facilitate its military operations next door in Syria, but has also faced pressure from its western allies to impose sanctions and take forceful diplomatic action. It has provided humanitarian aid but has refrained from sending military assistance, despite criticism from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In June, the Russian justice ministry recommended the Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental body, be shut down for violating privacy laws. Israel’s caretaker prime minister, Yair Lapid, has warned that closing the Jewish Agency’s offices would be a severe blow to bilateral relations.
