Council house tenants in the city said they feel “lied to” after being signed up to the contracts without realising, and facing years of what they believe is poor quality customer service and installation. Community Energy Scheme (CES) was launched in 2018 by the city council in conjunction with Solarplicity Energy, which sent staff door to door to encourage residents to sign up to the solar panel scheme. It now has 4,800 customers in the city. Tenants signed up to contracts on the spot with a signature on an iPad, but many residents said they thought they were only agreeing to have their home assessed for its suitability for solar panel installation. Cassandra Burton, 50, has lived in her three-bedroom semi-detached council property for 15 years, and was alone at home when someone from CES came. “I thought it was for them to do a survey on the property, check the roof basically. I signed the iPad and that was it, I never heard anything else from them,” she said. “I had no idea I’d signed up to a 25-year contract until we read a story in the newspaper about them.” She later found out her digital signature had been copied on to three separate documents. “I’m autistic, I was by myself, I didn’t have my partner with me, I just thought it was a council thing. I feel like they took advantage,” said Burton, adding that her solar panels were never hooked up to her electricity supply but she still received bills. “It’s a constant stress. Every single day I’m on the CES community group on Facebook to check what’s happening, what the latest advice is. I won’t let anybody in my house now,” she said. “Who doesn’t want more renewable energy? Who doesn’t want to help the Earth be a better place? But it makes me really angry.” Bibby Thomas, 58, said she specifically asked the salesperson to explain what she was signing when he came to her door in 2019. “He gave me this iPad, and I said: ‘I’m dyslexic, so I can’t read the whole lot. I’m not signing anything that shouldn’t be signing, am I?’ He said no, everything was fine, so I did a squiggle on it.” She claims no one mentioned a 25-year contract. A number of residents are to launch a class action lawsuit against the council and CES over how the scheme was sold to them. In response to concern expressed by customers, CES said they were given the option to keep their existing contract, swap to an updated contract with more user-friendly language and terms, or exit the agreement and switch back to receiving all of their electricity from the grid. The company insists the fact the agreements were for 25 years was stated on the CES website, literature, contracts and by sales teams, and that all tenants received a letter from the council explaining the scheme before being signed up. It also said the majority of tenants received a verification call to check they had been given the information. The Conservative-run Stoke-on-Trent city council gave Solarplicity Energy exclusive rights to install the panels on its housing stock, initially handing over the details of more than 1,000 homes it thought would be suitable, in return for £100 for each installation. Solar panels were also installed on empty council house properties, meaning prospective tenants had to sign up to the solar energy scheme as a condition of tenancy. The Stoke-on-Trent Labour councillor Desiree Elliott said the scheme had been “a failure and a scandal from the beginning”. She said: “The company involved has demonstrated time and again that it is not up to delivering a project of this size with any semblance of professionalism.” Residents said they were promised the solar panels would come with batteries, allowing them to store surplus solar energy to use in the evenings and on darker days, but these have only recently started being rolled out. CES said 200 tenant properties have had batteries installed since 2020. In 2019 Solarplicity Energy ceased trading after criticism from Ofgem and the Energy Ombudsman, who received 3,324 complaints about the company, and tenants have been switched to a different supplier, while still remaining part of the 25-year CES contracts. A Stoke-on-Trent city council spokesperson said the scheme was designed to support tenants “in lowering their energy bills and reducing carbon emissions”. “Supporting households to generate more sustainable, cheaper and greener energy is even more significant given the considerable rises in energy prices this winter. It is clearly not appropriate to comment any further on a matter that is subject to legal proceedings.” A spokesperson for CES said: “We have worked hard to get sustainable and affordable energy to those who would otherwise completely miss out. We’ve listened to concerns raised about the accessibility of language used in our contracts, and we’ve offered tenants the opportunity to make their own choice about how the solar energy being generated on their home is used. “We remain committed to making access to solar as easy and beneficial as possible, and tenants are welcome to contact us if we can provide them with any support.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/26/solar-power-payback-takes-much-longer-than-you-think","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-26T16:45:47Z","webTitle":"Solar power payback takes much longer than you think | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/26/solar-power-payback-takes-much-longer-than-you-think","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/26/solar-power-payback-takes-much-longer-than-you-think","fields":{"headline":"Solar power payback takes much longer than you think","bodyText":"Your article suggests that a 4 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system can save its owners £980 a year at 28p per kilowatt hour (kWh) and £1,575 at the 45p per kWh that is coming soon (Solar panels: how to fix your energy bills while the sun shines, 20 August). This estimate overlooks the important fact that most electricity is produced in summer, and all of it in daylight, while most consumption is in winter and at night. Our 4kW system has produced about 4,000kWh a year for the last 10 years. Although that is equivalent to our annual consumption we only consume about 30% of what we produce, despite having a household of three stay-at-home pensioners and electric cooking and water heating. An average day in summer produces 15-20kWh. In winter it is a fraction of that: the total for the whole of January is about 100kWh. This means that interseasonal storage or huge overcapacity would be required to go off grid; batteries at this scale will not be either environmentally or economically appropriate to achieving self-sufficiency. I have a log of production and consumption in five-minute intervals for one year, and using that data I calculate that with a battery system I could consume an additional 30% of our production. A larger system (8kWh storage) would not save proportionately more than a smaller (3kWh) system, because a large battery will not be fully charged on most days in the winter. At foreseeable electricity prices a 4kW system with or without a small battery may pay for itself within its lifetime, but not within the five to seven years suggested – although higher feed-in tariffs that reflect the value of the electricity exported would substantially reduce payback times.

However, since Ovo Energy started managing the payments I have been having problems. For the past nine months I have not received any money despite submitting readings in February, May and August. I have tried phoning Ovo numerous times but its automated message always warns of waits in excess of one hour. I also have written to the company with the automated response from the FIT team advising that at busy times it can take up to four weeks to respond. The three outstanding payments total in excess of £2,000. That money would be very useful to help me pay for the forthcoming increases in gas and electricity bills. I’m sure if I owed Ovo for nine months of gas and electricity it would be in contact. I cannot get through to a human being at the company to resolve this. Can you help? MJ, Wootton Bassett Your letter is one of several I have received about delayed Ovo FIT payments. At the same time you wrote to us you also emailed the Ovo chief executive, Stephen Fitzpatrick, and this did the trick. You were contacted almost immediately by a senior manager who informed you a cheque to cover the February and May payments would be in the post by the end of the week. The delay was blamed on the integration of the SSE business into Ovo (Ovo bought SSE’s energy supply arm in 2019) as the two companies dealt with FIT payments in a different way. Ovo waits until Ofgem has paid it before paying its FIT customers, which takes longer. The company offered a case of wine as a goodwill gesture which you accepted.

It consists largely of redbrick Victorian terraces. There are similar streets throughout the area, in Walthamstow, northeast London. Some houses are pebble-dashed. Some have doors painted in contemporary grey. There are wind chimes, geraniums in boxes, wheelie bins and the occasional cat sitting on a gate post. The only unusual feature is the number of windows displaying an A4 poster with the words “Power Station” printed in the font used by polling stations. Power, in the sense of the energy, is at the forefront of everyone’s mind. Energy bills have reached record highs and are still rising, with the war in Ukraine highlighting how fragile energy supplies can be. This year’s Cop27 climate conference promised money to poorer countries to assist with damage caused by climate change, yet no agreement was reached on phasing out fossil fuels. The idea of cleaner power, generated closer to home, should feel like an obvious goal. But, at the moment, there are no large-scale programmes dedicated to making it happen. Instead, there are people like Dan Edelstyn and Hilary Powell. These two are on the roof of their house, sitting on a bed they have just assembled. It is made up with a knitted blanket, bright sheets and a cheap foam mattress that is plastic-wrapped against the elements. Facing one way you can see their narrow back garden that ends when it hits the railway embankment. Turn around and you look down into their street, Lynmouth Road, which Dan and Hilary want to turn into a solar power station. They are living on their roof as a crowdfunder for the project. “I think it will be fine,” says Hilary, who has been scanning both the sky and the weather forecast. “I only get scared when the children say they want to come up, then I turn to jelly.” The couple are artists and filmmakers. They live in the middle of the street, with their children, Esmé, 12, and George, 10, and the family’s two dogs. “It is a street that has a sense of community,” says Hilary, down from the roof and sitting at their kitchen table. “That became apparent with the Covid mutual aid group that was set up.” And it was during lockdown that a sentence from economist Ann Pettifor’s book, The Case for the Green New Deal, which makes a strong argument for total decarbonisation and a financial system based on fairness, struck both of them. The phrase was: “Every building a power station.” “We clung on to that,” says Hilary. There was also People’s Power by American writer Ashley Dawson. “He wrote about energy democracy and tackling the power monopolies within the energy industry,” she adds. The idea started to take shape. Could they make a home into a power station? And not just their home, but perhaps their whole street by linking the houses together into a grid? Buying and installing a solar system for an average three-bedroom house costs around £10,000, they discovered. Linking them together would be hard – the technology is complex, especially in an urban area with lots of individual buildings. They did more research. And then they started talking to neighbours. “Well, if someone came and said there was a way of helping with the bills, you’d be over the moon, wouldn’t you?” says Ejaz Hussain, 71, now retired. “If it comes off, I’ll know that I’ve been blessed.” Sipke Visser, 45, is a photographer and retoucher. He lives with his wife, their two children and his father-in-law. “I know Dan and Hilary, so I wasn’t that surprised,” he says, “But I do think if a complete stranger were to knock on my door, I would be very sceptical.” “We looked at putting solar panels up quite a few years ago and we found the cost of doing it was too much,” says Pippa Evans, 57, who works at an adoption and fostering therapeutic agency. “So I was intrigued when this flyer came through the letterbox. I wanted to know how it was going to work and if we could afford it. Were Dan and Hilary going to coordinate everything? I knew about their previous project. So I knew they were quite good at making things happen.” The previous project was Bank Job. In 2018, the couple started working in an empty building, a former bank on one of Walthamstow’s main streets. They printed artwork that looked like bank notes, complete with pictures of people from local community projects, and sold them, raising £40,000 in the process. Half the money went back to the local groups. And with the remaining £20,000 they bought up £1.2m worth of high-interest debt owed by people in the local community. “You can buy it for so much less because the assumption is that it won’t be paid off,” says Dan. They let the debtors know there was nothing left to pay, although GDPR rules meant this could only be done by sending letters via a debt broker. Then they packed up the paper records into a gold-coloured van and blew the whole thing up on wasteland outside Canary Wharf, the towers of the UK’s financial sector looming in the background. The documentary they made about the project came out in 2021 and the remains of the van are currently on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. They describe Power Station as a natural evolution. “It’s also a show-and-do project,” says Dan. “We’re learning as we go and we’re sharing it as we learn it.” “We’re not setting ourselves up as experts,” adds Hilary. “There isn’t just one solution and we don’t know everything about kilowatts per hour, so we’re a conduit. We’re learning and educating ourselves and others and then also building partnerships with people who are experts.” Their own expertise, they say, is in making a project come to life and then drawing attention to the issues using art and storytelling. As of 2019 there were around 300 community energy projects in the UK covering 67,000 homes, according to the thinktank Green Alliance. The sector was hit when the government’s community energy strategy was scrapped, with at least 66 projects folding in 2017 and more becoming precarious. The initial grand design for Lynmouth Road was for an entire street interlinked, powered for free and managed by a cooperative. But the mixture of rented and private, leasehold and freehold, and various mortgages with various banks meant dropping uniform infrastructure across the rooftops would be almost impossible. “It turns out that not many people fully own their roof,” says Dan. While the whole street can’t be linked now, Dan harbours a dream of making this happen as the project grows and would love to see a community battery so that those who can’t have solar panels could also access power. And with 30 households involved – nearly half the residencies in Lynmouth Road – there is enough for the street to become a solar energy hotspot and model for what other streets could also achieve in terms of renewable power. The project, as it stands, will be funded in various ways. There are grants from organisations, such as the London Community Energy Fund. There’s the crowdfunder, running while Dan and Hilary sleep on top of their house. They have also printed a new run of bank notes to sell, the notes and large handprinting machines currently occupying half of their living room. Buying solar equipment in bulk brings the price down, so participating residents can offer to pay, but the scheme is free for those who need it to be. Each resident will be given a grant for their solar installation and deal with the company directly. As we sit on the bed on the roof, the surveyor from the solar company is finishing his assessments. He climbs the scaffolding at the back of the house to come and chat, although he doesn’t make it all the way up. “It’s a bit ironic, in my line of work, but I’m not great with heights,” he says. Not everyone in the street has wanted or been able to take part. “Some people just shut the door before we started speaking,” says Dan. “Then there were people who were dying or divorcing or moving. Or having a loft conversion.” Loft conversions came up a lot. They can make rooftops unsuitable for solar panels, but the more frequent issue was that of imminent building work. Andy Richford, 70, is one of the people planning a loft conversion. An editorial consultant working in scientific publishing and with a background in ecology, he believes the project will amplify a necessary message. “I’ve been banging on about it for years,” he says. “I might not be able to participate in terms of getting the panels, but making a difference is important to me. Putting solar panels on top of houses, with a direct feed into the house, means energy isn’t lost in transmission and we don’t have the worry of covering acres and acres of farmland or wild land.” The ground on which Lynmouth Road stands was once part of the marshland on the banks of the River Lea. The remaining marsh is less than half a mile away, some of it a Site of Special Scientific Interest and all of it popular with picnickers, dog walkers, runners and the occasional raver. The Lynmouth Road area, says Hilary, who has been looking into its history, was a watercress farm until the houses started going up in 1886. The Victorian era was Walthamstow’s first growth spurt. Boosted by new rail links, the land filled up with houses for workers. It remained a largely working-class area for most of the 20th century, but in the 2000s house prices accelerated andWalthamstow, with its garden terraces, good schools and decent transport links, became a prime location. Between 2012 and 2019, house prices more than doubled. “It used to be full of very long-term residents,” says Hilary. “One family staying in a house for decades. We moved in around 14 years ago and found a newspaper from 1945.” Dan also mentions a former resident, Dorothy Burroughs, who spent her 100 years living on the street, only leaving to briefly enter a care home before her death last year. Dorothy remembered when electricity first came to the houses in the 1930s. “She said that people needed to be shown what to do and how to use appliances. People would come round and demonstrate.” Ejaz Hussain has lived here since 1978. He has worked all of his adult life, including 20 years at a local food processing factory, now demolished to make way for flats. “I’m struggling, although the mortgage is paid. I’ve got two daughters, one at college, one about to go to university. We put them first. But the bills come in and the house needs repairs and I’m on my pension,” he says. Like many of his neighbours, he had also looked at solar panels, but had been unable to afford them. He has also watched the street change around him. “In the early days it was brilliant, simple. You said good morning to your neighbours, they said good morning to you. Then it got that if you said hello, people would give you a funny look.” The Power Station project, he says, has meant the people in the street talk to one another once more. “This is what we want, the community spirit,” he says. “It costs nothing to look after one another.” The collective nature of the scheme has been a draw for many of the residents. “We all have concerns about the environment,” says Chris Humphreys, 49, who works in education and lives with his wife, Catherine, and their two sons. “And you try and do your little thing, but to be part of something bigger is very appealing. You see what’s happening in the news at the moment and you know it won’t be those people who make changes for the better. It’s got to start at the grassroots. I’ve never been especially active politically, but I’m very happy to stand alongside our neighbours in what I think is hopefully a practical and positive solution.” “I want to be part of the solution, even if it’s just a small part,” says Dee Tweedie, 48, who has been involved with the project from the beginning and went door-to-door with Dan and Hilary to explain the idea. “We all want to save the planet and the prices of everything are rising in tandem… energy, food, mortgage. But you don’t always know what you can do when it’s just you and your family. It’s been lovely to meet so many of our neighbours. There’s camaraderie. Maybe that’s how it felt during the war.” “It’s building on the sense of community that started to grow during the pandemic,” says Pippa Evans. “To me, it’s almost as important as the energy. It’s within human nature to be self-centred at times and I think the political climate has encouraged that. But humans are sociable and we’re interdependent and those aspects can be emphasised when we’re working together and helping create something. As a community, we can make bigger changes than as individual people.” “The energy for what we do is drawn from anger, but I don’t think you would necessarily see that as a tone in our films or in our work,” says Dan. “But you wouldn’t see us here, doing all this, if we didn’t feel an intense sense of how absurd our political and social realities are. We’d like to see a kinder world, but we’ve created a system that profits a very narrow minority and so many more people could be living more meaningful and useful lives.” “I can be really angry,” says Hilary. “We live in a society where Matt Hancock can be on celebrity TV and you think, ‘What the fuck is going on? This is sick, it’s like The Hunger Games. And we acquiesce. And the corruption and vandalism of those in charge are just forgotten. At the same time, we can’t be paralysed,” she continues. “I hope this can wake others up and make them realise you can take action, and that the worst thing would be to sit in despair and do nothing.” The Power Station may not be actively producing energy just yet, but it has generated an idea that is already flowing to the rest of the area. Dan and Hilary are working with five local primary schools, including the one their son attends, to arrange funding and installation via the Solar for Schools project. People in neighbouring streets have started asking how they could join in. “We’re busy behind the scenes, working out how it could become a street-by-street model,” says Hilary. “I hope, after the first wave, when there are people sharing testimonials, others will want to be involved, too.” On their wall they have an aerial photograph of the road, with the houses already involved marked by coloured Post-It notes. “I was kind of heartbroken when the obstacles to doing the whole street started to pile up,” says Dan. “But I started to realise it doesn’t really matter. We have 30 households, and more and more people expressing interest. Three nearby streets are starting to organise themselves. And we can share what we’ve learned. You need someone to coordinate, otherwise scheduling the surveys is tough. You need at least 20 people. But you can go from there.” The surveys on Lynmouth Road are just wrapping up. If all goes to plan, the panels will start to go up in January. “I feel like we’ve promised people something and I want everyone to see it’s really happening,” says Hilary. But even without the solar panels, the street has started to change. “When society is organised from the top down, you feel reliant on the government to change things,” says Pippa Evans. “But if you have brave individuals who stand up and gather other people around them… We can stand up for ourselves, we can do things ourselves.” “We can be powerful, us, the people who should be powerless,” says Dan. He is on his rooftop with the street – and the geraniums and cats and wheelie bins – spread out two storeys below. “We do have the power to change things.” For all information on the Power Station, go to power.film.

Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, will visit a solar farm on Friday. He is to lay out his opposition to plans by Truss and her environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, who the Guardian revealed earlier this week are hoping to ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land. “This government cannot deliver when you have a prime minister who is a longstanding opponent of solar, and an environment secretary doing her bidding,” Miliband told the Guardian. Labour is hoping to make the most of a cabinet rift over energy strategy. On Thursday, the business secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg, came out in opposition to plans to ban solar. In a piece for the Guardian, Rees-Mogg insisted he was persuaded of the need to boost renewable energy. He also revealed new policies including loosening regulations for businesses to put solar power in place and giving homeowners grants to install panels on their houses. Miliband said: “The problem for Liz Truss is that her anti-clean-power dogma is now catching up with her.” Labour is to say that blocking solar would “rob the UK of potential for cheap power that could bring down bills for households” and tell voters that even before the Ukraine crisis, new solar was a quarter of the price of gas. Miliband will accuse Truss of trying to “destroy the solar industry” and argue this will “make the UK energy sector even more insecure”. Labour’s calculations show each 5GW of additional solar would cut UK gas imports by 2%, and that solar power could supply 17% of the UK’s annual electricity needs by 2035, supporting 60,000 jobs. He will also declare Labour’s plans to block fracking, saying that this and an expansion of solar would make the UK a “world-leading clean energy superpower” by 2030. At their party conference, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, announced plans to deliver a zero-carbon electricity system by 2030 as well as to create a publicly owned clean energy company. The Liberal Democrats have also criticised Truss’s plans. Their chief whip, Wendy Chamberlain, the MP for North East Fife, said: “People are facing higher energy bills, and the UK urgently needs more renewable, reliable energy … solar power is clean, cheap and popular. We shouldn’t block solar but encourage opportunities to develop it.” Truss’s spokesperson confirmed on Monday that plans to ban solar from agricultural land would go ahead despite analysis in the Financial Times showing that in doing so, England would lose £20bn in investment. During Truss’s party leadership campaign this summer, she dismissed solar panels as “paraphernalia”, adding: “On my watch, we will not lose swathes of our best farmland to solar farms.” No 10 has been contacted for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-30T06:35:19Z","webTitle":"‘It’s got nasty’: the battle to build the US’s biggest solar power farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/30/its-got-nasty-the-battle-to-build-the-uss-biggest-solar-power-farm","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s got nasty’: the battle to build the US’s biggest solar power farm","bodyText":"When proposals for the largest solar plant ever conceived for US soil started to gather pace – a plan that involves spearing several million solar panels into the flat farmland of northern Indiana – something in Connie Ehrlich seems to have snapped. Ehrlich, 63, is part of a longstanding farming family in Pulaski county, the site of the new solar project, but doesn’t live in the county and previously only rarely dabbled in its usually somnolent local politics. She has carved out a comfortable life in a sprawling mansion set on 10 acres (four hectares) of land, just outside the city of Lafayette, and is known locally for her donations to medical research and her small fleet of deluxe cars with personalized license plates. But to Ehrlich the idea of transferring 13,000 acres of prized farmland to solar energy production seems to have been so unthinkable that it demanded an extraordinary response. Within months of the project being proposed she had mobilized her wealth to fund a flurry of lawsuits, spearheaded a sometimes-vituperative pressure group and spent $3m buying new plots of land, including a cemetery, on the fringes of the project. Ehrlich even acquired an office nextdoor to the solar developer’s own premises – and in its window a cartoon has been placed showing Joe Biden shoveling cash into the mouths of solar developers, depicted as pigs in a sty. The solar farm, which could have its goal of completion next year delayed because of the lawsuits, has stirred up strong feelings among some in Pulaski. “It’s got nasty, really nasty,” said Derrick Stalbaum, a hog farmer who also acts as president of the county’s board of zoning appeals. “It’s surprising as we live in a quiet area with a huge sense of community usually.” The opponents of the solar project, a $1.5bn venture appropriately called Mammoth that is set to span an area almost as large as Manhattan, say they are defying an egregious assault on time-honored farming traditions and are standing up to a newcomer that threatens to warp their pastoral way of life with Chinese-made technology. “We need to protect America’s farmland,” Ehrlich wrote in a February post for the Pulaski County Against Solar group’s Facebook page. “Not only from being sacrificed for the inefficient, unreliable energy generation, but from foreigners’ interest!” The ongoing fight is a sobering reminder of how Biden’s ambitions for a mass transition to renewables, aimed at averting the worst ravages of the climate crisis, will in significant part be decided by the vagaries and veto points of thousands of local officials, county boards and Connie Ehrlich-style opposition across the US. Localized battles over new solar projects threaten to proliferate as the industry, buoyed up by the huge tax credits available for clean energy in the Inflation Reduction Act, seeks to expand. Over the past year, solar projects in Ohio, Kentucky and Nevada have all been delayed or sunk by irked local people. Ordinances restricting solar, wind and other renewable energy facilities have been passed in 31 states. The prospect of solar energy projects occupying a chunk of American land has stirred unease among farmers, and even among some environmentalists, that valuable forests, wetlands and fertile soils may be sacrificed. If the US really is to zero out its carbon emissions by 2050, researchers at Princeton University have estimated that solar production could have to grow more than 20-fold, occupying an area that, put together, would be equivalent to the size of West Virginia. “We are absolutely seeing local opposition to solar arrays across the US,” said Samantha Levy, climate policy manager at American Farmland Trust. “About half of solar development is going on the best, most productive farmland and that is causing some concern because it’s not like we are making more land. We need to have a smart solar buildout and not hollow out these farming communities.” But for developers, the challenges posed by opponents such as Ehrlich are infuriating. “It’s just throw spaghetti and see what sticks,” said Nick Cohen, chief executive of Doral Renewables, the Israeli-founded developer behind the Mammoth project in Indiana. “It only takes one person to file a lawsuit and this feels like a one-person crusade to burn down the town.” Cohen said his dealings with Ehrlich have been “civil but direct” and that Doral holds out hope of being an amiable neighbor to its foe. The project won’t fell trees or disturb any fragile ecosystem, he pointed out. “If people have real concerns we can work it out,” Cohen said. “But the conduct here is so irrational and perplexing. Connie and [a] small group of followers are working against the best interests of the entire community.” The episode is also a demonstration of how an era of toxic politics and vicious online vitriol can quickly sour a community like Pulaski. Some people have left their church because of arguments with other congregants over the solar plant, while even family members have been at odds with one another. Stalbaum, the head of the board of zoning appeals, said while most people in the county are either supportive or apathetic about Mammoth, a faction of people are so outraged they have taken to following and videoing him and other members of the board, or idling in cars outside their homes. Anonymous phone calls, meanwhile, were made to a school where Stalbaum was previously a teacher to cryptically warn that he was not suited to be around children, he said. On Facebook, supporters of the project have been called “roaches” and “traitors” and, in one instance, seemingly compared to Adolf Hitler. “I can only imagine how intimidating he is around children!!” one poster wrote about Stalbaum. “This is no longer really about the solar applications; it’s more about driving the community apart,” said Stalbaum. “I have been attacked pretty hard for this, simply because this project meets our county requirements.” Much of the debate in Pulaski county about solar has become entangled in national resentments, with several unprompted attacks on Biden in public hearings for supposedly forcing through the Green New Deal, or for allowing Mexican immigrants to somehow take precious farmland along with the solar developers. In Pulaski, a county where Donald Trump outperformed Biden four to one in the 2020 election, flags hanging outside homes declaring “Let’s Go Brandon” and, less euphemistically, “Fuck Biden” are commonplace. *** Pulaski county appears to be an otherwise unassuming location for what will be one of the largest solar projects in the world. A rectangular slice of agricultural northern Indiana, Pulaski is home to about 12,000 people, a number that is declining, and a lot of corn. Peppermint is grown here, too, and sold to the Wrigley Company for gum flavoring. A ripple of excitement was felt in nearby Fulton county in 1978 when the partial skeleton of a hulking mastodon was discovered in a drainage ditch, exquisitely preserved in peat. It was this 10,000-year-old specimen that would give the Mammoth project its name, although Doral was more excited by quirks of infrastructure and geology – the area has flat, sandy ground ideal for solar and is a meeting point for two vast electrical grids, called MISO and PJM, that service tens of millions of Americans and will allow Mammoth to dump converted sunlight into both of them for consumption. In July 2019, Cohen was introduced to a farmer named Norm Welker. Welker’s land, Cohen said, was “right on the bullseye, exactly where you’d want to be.” Transmission lines run through Welker’s fields in Starke county and, crucially, Welker himself has been unsentimental about turning away from half a century of planting and harvesting corn on this land. “You couldn’t dream of a better project for us,” said Welker, a 62-year-old who has a short, clipped moustache and is almost more enthused by the idea of solar than the developers themselves. The money helps, of course – Welker’s 1,075 acres in Starke county will be leased for the next three decades at $1,000 an acre a year. “It’s five times what I’d make through corn,” he said. “It’s crazy money.” Construction began on Welker’s land earlier this year and a grid-like pattern of pilings driven into the soil is already in place. Long steel tubes are placed horizontally upon the pilings, with brackets on top to affix the solar panels, which are awaiting clearance for import from Malaysia. Wiring dangles from some of these poles, and cables lie in partly dug trenches, ready to connect the output to an inverter which will then help propel electrons into the grid. The panels will automatically rotate east to west, chasing the sun throughout the day, shaking off snow in the winter. But the whole system is fairly simple to slot together and is shorter than the serried ears of corn Welker would normally grow here. “It’s so passive, I mean, it’s even more benign than wind,” said Kevin Parzyck, a senior project manager for Doral. A few years ago, officials in Pulaski rejected an application to build wind turbines in the county. “With wind you’re actually spinning a generator,” Parzyck said. “The crickets make more noise than these solar panels do.” To Welker, solar is an evolution of farming rather than a betrayal of it. He already harvests the sunlight for his crops, he reasons, and considers fears of food shortages by taking land out of production overblown given that 40% of all US corn is already mashed up for another form of energy – ethanol, which is added to gasoline. Farmers are also routinely paid by the federal government to keep tracts of land free from crops, in order to bolster the price of corn. The rows of nodding metal and glass will contrast with the surrounding fields of corn, but it’s a moot point as to whether they are more unnatural or harmful to the surrounds. Wild grasses and wildflowers are springing up around the metal pilings, bringing back insect life to a landscape that is typically bombarded by pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. America’s corn belt, which stretches from Indiana to Nebraska, produces a fifth of the world’s maize, a stunning feat of agricultural might that has deforested large areas, stripped away topsoil and made the land, by one measure, 48 times more toxic than it was 25 years ago. “I’m gonna retire, I’m gonna restore habitats – it’s likely there’ll never be a cornfield here ever again,” said Welker. He has a further 500 acres in Pulaski county he hopes to give over to solar, too, but there he faces the tenacious obstacle of Ehrlich, whom he knew as a neighbor when she went to community college in Indianapolis and then married Donald “Jerry” Ehrlich, founder of the Wabash trucking company. Now the relationship is somewhat strained. “It blows my mind! It’s my farm – why do I need my neighbor’s permission to do this?” Welker asked, suddenly enraged. “I’m not doing any harm to you. What’s the deal with this woman? These people are nitwits.” The Guardian made multiple requests to Ehrlich and her lawyer for comment. There was no response to these requests. The Mammoth project – which will generate 1.3 gigawatts of renewable energy, enough to power more than 200,000 households annually in coal-dependent Indiana – is split into three distinct areas encompassing dozens of landowners, which looks on a map like a collection of Jenga blocks scattered on to the landscape. Two of these areas are in Pulaski, which has a county ordinance that requires special hearings to consider changing the use of land for solar. This opportunity to stymie the project was seized upon by Ehrlich and her group. The first hearing – by the county’s board of zoning appeals, a five-member body that issues typically mundane decisions about land use – in July 2020 was eagerly anticipated. Outside, people livestreamed proceedings via their phones and speakers were set up so the overflow crowd could listen in. Inside, Stalbaum tried to maintain a sense of order. A procession of local residents stepped up to speak at the microphone, the supporters of solar stressing it would help sustain farms for future generations and raise vital tax revenue for ailing public services. Opponents, meanwhile, were more pointed, often invoking a divine plan for this land and taking aim at local officials who would stray from this. “I don’t want my back yard to be a guinea pig!” exclaimed Riley Cervenka Tiede, Ehrlich’s niece, a recording of the meeting shows. “As a farmer I take great pride in the beautiful land that God has blessed us with and believe it should stay to be used to grow crops.” Tiede warned that property values would decline if solar arrived – there is somewhat threadbare evidence of this – and raised the spectre of a disastrous fire. On the Facebook streamed comments, people pondered if birds and plants would be fried by the glare from the panels, perhaps in response to a different, and unusual, type of solar farm in California that caused some birds to spontaneously combust after flying into its beams of concentrated sunlight. “Firefighters, police, please stand up,” Tiede implored, as applause thundered for the first responders. “Their lives are more important than a few landowners getting money!” When Nathan Origer, head of community development for Pulaski, attempted to explain that revenue from Mammoth could be used to help lower taxes for landowners – Mammoth will plow about $1.5m a year into Pulaski’s coffers, about a fifth of the county’s revenues from income tax – a man off camera shouted, “You’re full of shit!” Mark Cervenka, Ehrlich’s brother who farms land in Pulaski, said locals had been ambushed by a “disturbing, frightening and disgusting” solar plan. “I’m a farmer and always will be. I believe the land should be used the way God intended it to be,” he added. Things get so heated at one point a woman stormed toward the board members and started shouting indecipherably at them while holding up her phone. Stalbaum asked two burly sheriff’s deputies to remove her and muttered, “You’re not helping your cause here.” The board voted unanimously to allow a special exception for the solar project in the wake of the gathering, although with conditions, pushed for by Ehrlich and allied local resident Jennifer Knebel, that new trees will block the sight of the solar panels, noise will be kept to a minimum and wide buffer areas of open land will be kept at the project boundaries. Just 20% of the project area will be covered by the actual solar panels, which are disparagingly called a “sea of black glass” by opponents. Ehrlich has not been sated by this partial victory. According to Knebel, the group has spent “hundreds of hours” pondering the issue, usually coming to hearings with reams of notes to read out. Doral has had to muster a cadre of experts to counter claims the silicon and aluminum panels will give off deadly radiation, or that they will kill sandhill cranes by blinding them or will leach poison into the soil. “I feel like they got just about everything they could get apart from outright banning solar,” said Origer. “But whatever everyone did, it wasn’t enough. I have to conclude that it is at least partially an ideological thing. Ms Ehrlich simply doesn’t think that solar is good.” In a flurry of online posts, op-eds and speeches, Ehrlich has claimed solar developers “prey upon financially struggling counties”, questioned the efficacy of renewable energy and complained that the energy generated won’t be used by the county itself, a striking protest given Pulaski farmers’ routine sale of corn to be consumed across the US. “How can some landowners believe they have the right to do whatever they want with their land while destroying someone else’s property and quality of life?” Ehrlich posted in July last year on her group’s Facebook page. Public records show that Ehrlich has spent about $3m to buy three plots of land in Pulaski since 2020, including a cemetery near the town of Francesville. Some of the land is within a mile of the planned Mammoth project. Meanwhile, Ehrlich and eight other complainants have filed lawsuits to try to overturn the approval of the land use, dispute a tax abatement given to Doral and stop the county’s subsequent move to make it easier for developers to set up in Pulaski county. In September, Ehrlich got some reward for her efforts – the Indiana court of appeals ruled that Mammoth had not submitted a complete application for the project’s zoning. The state supreme court may now be called upon for further judgment, although the developers do not expect to be halted by what they frame as an administrative redo. “It doesn’t make much sense to me that she would purchase land for very high prices in the neighborhood if she thinks property prices will go down because of the project,” said Cohen. “She hasn’t been willing to compromise to discuss a mutual solution. All of the millions of dollars we are spending on lawsuits, that could’ve been put into the community. There’s nothing I would like more than to have them as our friends.” A detente doesn’t appear likely, however, if you take a trip to Doral’s project headquarters in Winamac, a small town that is Pulaski’s county seat. On the main road into Winamac is a huge billboard that reads “No to industrial solar” and, once you get to the Doral office, the opposition is hard for the developers to ignore. Ehrlich spent $100,000 on a former cigar store, public records show, that is a footstep from Doral’s own office. The windows are plastered with anti-solar posters, including the cartoon of Biden shoveling cash into the mouths of solar developers depicted as pigs. “Protesting – that’s Connie’s job,” said Welker, as he looked at the strange juxtaposition of the two offices. “Nick and I stopped in one time and tried to have peace talks, but she’s just, ‘No. I’m here to save Pulaski county from solar panels.’ That’s her job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-on-collision-course-with-jacob-rees-mogg-over-solar-power-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss on collision course with Jacob Rees-Mogg over solar power ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-on-collision-course-with-jacob-rees-mogg-over-solar-power-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/13/liz-truss-on-collision-course-with-jacob-rees-mogg-over-solar-power-ban","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss on collision course with Jacob Rees-Mogg over solar power ban","bodyText":"Liz Truss is facing a rebellion from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s business department over plans to ban solar power from most of England’s farmland. The prime minister and her environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, want to ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land, the Guardian revealed earlier this week. But her business secretary, Rees-Mogg, is understood to believe it is “unconservative” to tell farmers what they can and cannot do with their land. Her climate minister, Graham Stuart, said on Wednesday he would be speaking to Defra about the plans as more ground-mount solar is needed to meet renewable energy targets. In a piece for the Guardian, Rees-Mogg, who has previously decried “climate alarmism”, insists he is convinced by the need to boost renewable energy. He also reveals new policies including loosening regulations for businesses to put solar power in place and giving homeowners grants to install panels on their houses. In the piece, he says he is “not a green energy sceptic”, adding that his department would give “unprecedented support” to renewable energy sources. Rees-Mogg also brands coalmines and oil rigs as “dark satanic mills”, vowing to replace them with windfarms. On solar, he adds: “We are exploring options to support low-cost finance to help householders with the upfront costs of solar installation, permitted development rights to support deployment of more small-scale solar in commercial settings and designing performance standards to further encourage renewables, including solar PV, in new homes and buildings.” Stuart told the environmental audit committee in parliament on Wednesday that his and Rees-Mogg’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy opposed the ban. He said his department would be speaking to Defra about its plans. “We’re going to work closely with Defra, and the British energy security strategy set out an expectation for a fivefold increase in solar,” he said. “It’s clear that we need significant growth in both ground-mount and rooftop solar to meet this ambition.” The rebellion comes after reports that Truss has berated her cabinet ministers for briefing against her more unpopular policies, including rumours she considered linking benefit rises to wages rather than inflation. Truss’s spokesperson confirmed on Monday that the plans to ban solar from agricultural land were going ahead. This is despite analysis in the Financial Times showing that in doing so, England would lose £20bn in investment, which critics said would harm her growth agenda. Asked about the Guardian’s report, Truss’s official spokesperson told journalists: “I can point you back to what the prime minister said, I think at the start of September, when she said she doesn’t think we should be putting solar panels on productive agricultural lands, because obviously as well as the energy security issue, we face a food security issue. So we need to strike the right balance.” The prime minister has always had a personal ambivalence towards ground-mount solar, falsely claiming when she was environment secretary that solar panels harmed food security. During her leadership campaign this summer, she dismissed panels as “paraphernalia”, adding: “On my watch, we will not lose swathes of our best farmland to solar farms.” Truss is understood to have the support of Jayawardena, who would have to submit the plans to change the farmland grading system to Rees-Mogg’s department and the department for levelling up in order for it to be approved. He has asked his officials to redefine “best and most versatile” land (BMV), which is earmarked for farming, to include the middling-to-low category 3b, on which most new solar projects are built. Land is graded from 1 to 5, and currently BMV includes grades 1 to 3a. Planning guidance says that development on BMV land should be avoided, although planning authorities may take other considerations into account. Rees-Mogg’s pro-renewable comments may come as a surprise to green campaigners, who have been alarmed by his previous remarks on climate. Last month, he told department staff that Britain “must get every cubic inch of gas out of the North Sea”, a leaked video shows. Critics at the time accused the business secretary of “putting his ideology before the climate” and “greenwashing fossil fuels” by prioritising gas over renewables. He has also been a keen advocate of fracking, with a leaked email showing he was trying to evade scrutiny of new energy projects, including those using the controversial method. Sources close to the business secretary later clarified that he wanted to be able to quickly build for all energy methods, including renewables and fracking. An email to officials, seen by the Guardian, set out that he had noted that parliamentary legislation was not subject to judicial review, and could potentially be used to speed along new projects. Rees-Mogg has also said he would be “delighted” to have fracking in his back garden, and has called those who oppose shale gas extraction “luddites” and “socialists”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/oct/09/beam-me-down-can-solar-power-from-space-help-solve-our-energy-needs","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-09T11:00:55Z","webTitle":"Beam me down: can solar power from space help solve our energy needs?

","bodyText":"In late November, a top-level meeting of European science ministers will convene in Paris. Their job is to decide the next priorities for the European Space Agency (Esa), of which the UK is still a member, and one of the items on their list to consider is a proposal for testing the feasibility of building commercial power stations in orbit. These huge satellites would bask in the sunlight, converting it to power and beaming it down to Earth to be fed into the power grid. The proposed project, known as Solaris, would determine whether the idea can contribute to Europe’s future energy security – or if it is all still pie in the sky. If the study gets the go-ahead, it will be like coming home for the space industry, which has always been at the forefront of solar power development. A year after the Russians launched the battery-powered Sputnik 1 in 1957, the Americans launched Vanguard 1. This was the fourth satellite in orbit and the first to generate its power using solar energy. Since that time, solar panels have become the primary way of powering spacecraft, which has helped to drive research. Vanguard 1’s solar cells converted just 9% of the captured sunlight into electricity. Today, the efficiency has more than doubled, and continues to increase, while the cost of fabrication has been falling. It’s a winning formula. “The cost of solar has been decreasing rapidly over the past 20 years, and faster than most players in the industry expected,” says Jochen Latz, a partner at management consultant McKinsey &amp; Company. So much so, that in the Middle East and Australia, solar power is now the cheapest way to generate electricity. According to Latz, as the technology continues to develop, this will become true in the mid-latitude countries too. “In 2050, we expect more than 40% of the energy in the EU to come from solar power – if the countries achieve their committed targets,” says Latz. That would make solar power the single largest contributing energy source to the EU. However, there are obvious problems that need solutions if we are to fully utilise solar panels on Earth. For one thing, what do we do at night? In May, Ned Ekins-Daukes, associate professor at the school of photovoltaic and renewable energy engineering at the University of New South Wales, Australia, and his team of researchers demonstrated a solar cell that could generate electricity from the emission of infrared rather than from the absorption of sunlight. This works perfectly at night because the Earth stores energy from the sun in the form of heat, which it then radiates back into space as infrared radiation. The prototype device is based on the same kind of technology used in night-vision goggles and at present it can only generate a few milliwatts of power, but Ekins-Daukes sees the potential. “This is the beginning – it’s the world’s first demonstration of thermal radiative power,” he says, indicating that the team is aiming for a finished product that is “10,000 times more powerful”. At those levels, it is possible that a rooftop installation of such devices, probably fabricated in some way as an additional layer to conventional solar panels, would capture enough energy to power the house overnight – that is, keeping the fridge, wifi router and so on running. While that is a modest saving for each household, multiplied across a country’s population, it becomes significant. Another obvious issue with solar power is that some days will be cloudy. To alleviate this, excess electricity generated on sunny days needs to be stored in batteries but storage capacity is currently woeful. “The EU will need about 200 gigawatts [GW] of battery storage by 2030, but as of 2021 there was only 2.4GW of storage in place, so a massive increase will be needed,” says Aidan McClean, chief executive of UFODrive, an all-electric car rental company. To help with this shortfall, McClean champions a scheme called vehicle-to-grid – V2G – which uses the battery in an electric vehicle (EV) to store excess energy generated by a home’s rooftop solar panels and then transfer it back into the house when needed in the evening, or even sell it on to National Grid at other periods of high demand. “If V2G becomes widely adopted, the expected storage capacity of all the EVs will vastly exceed any expected storage requirements the grid will require going into the future,” says McClean. A recent V2G trial in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, showed that participants saved money and cut their carbon footprint by using an “intelligent” charging system that topped up the batteries when renewables were generating electricity. Another approach is to use solar power not to generate electricity but to produce sustainable vehicle fuels. Virgil Andrei of the department of chemistry at Cambridge University and his colleagues have developed a thin “artificial leaf” that draws its inspiration from photosynthesis. In plants, photosynthesis takes in sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2) and converts them into oxygen and sugars. In the artificial leaves, the output is syngas, or synthetic gas. This mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be used to produce a number of fuels via various industrial processes. It is even possible to produce petrol and kerosene. “We envisioned using CO2 from the atmosphere or other industrial processes and pouring that into these types of systems to create green fuel. Instead of releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere, we just have a circular carbon economy,” says Andrei. In effect they would piggyback off carbon-capture plants, which are currently being deployed to harness CO2 from industrial processes, and “recycle” it into sustainable fuels. The team first made an artificial leaf in 2019 but it was a bulky construction of glass and metal that sat on a bench top. This year, however, the team announced the results of a smaller, actual leaf-like structure that the researchers floated on the River Cam. The leaf was sealed inside a transparent plastic bag with the precursor gas and water and then left on the river for a number of days. The team then opened the bag and tested what gases had been produced by photosynthesis. The artificial leaves themselves are composed of materials called perovskites. The archetypal perovskite is a naturally occurring mineral of calcium titanium oxide – also known as calcium titanate – which was discovered in 1839 in the Ural mountains of Russia by German mineralogist Gustav Rose and named after his Russian counterpart Lev Perovski. Modern perovskites can have different chemical constituents and some have shown that they can function as solar cells. “These materials are very new and very exciting,” says Andrei. Laboratory tests show that they can be more efficient than the silicon used in conventional solar panels. Perovskites could even replace silicon in the solar panels of the future as they can be fabricated more easily and in thin, flexible layers. Another bonus is that these materials produce higher currents and voltages than their silicon counterparts, which allows more energetic processes such as the reactions that were used in the artificial leaves study. *** As promising as all this sounds, though, there is one insurmountable problem when generating solar power from the surface of the Earth: the atmosphere. The molecules in our atmosphere scatter about half the sunlight out of the direct beam. This scattered light bouncing around is what creates the blue sky we are so familiar with. In space, there is no atmosphere, so the sun’s light is undiluted. And as the aerospace engineers at the beginning of the space race found, put a solar panel in orbit and it will automatically generate about twice as much power as the equivalent panel on Earth. Unsurprisingly then, engineers and visionaries have been dreaming of putting solar power-producing satellites into orbit for decades. The basic principle is simple. A fleet of spacecraft with giant solar panels collects sunlight, before converting it into power and then beaming that energy back to Earth. How do you wirelessly beam energy across space? It turns out we’ve been doing it for decades. Every telecommunications satellite since the 1960s has used a solar panel to generate electricity, which is then converted into a microwave signal and sent to Earth. On the ground, antennas convert the microwaves back into electrical energy and read the signals. “The physics involved in that whole chain is exactly the same for space-based solar power, but the scale of it is completely different,” says Sanjay Vijendran of Esa, who is coordinating the proposed Solaris programme to study the feasibility of space-based solar power. Every few decades since the beginning of the space race, the idea of space solar power has been investigated. On every occasion, the story has been the same: the cost of launching such large satellites is prohibitive. But now, things are different. “In 2015, a miracle happens. The Falcon 9 reusable rocket flies for the first time,” says John Mankins, a former Nasa physicist who is now president of Artemis Innovation Management Solutions. Mankins is an expert on solar-power satellites, having worked on many of the feasibility studies over the decades. With the advent of a truly reusable rocket, the cost of sending equipment into orbit is tumbling. Instead of costing about $1,000 to launch every kilogram into space, Mankins now expects the price to come down to closer to $300 a kilogram. “That’s the holy grail for space solar power. It is not just possible some day – it’s inevitable in the next five or seven years,” he says. Others are similarly optimistic. In September 2021, the Frazer-Nash Consultancy published a report for the UK government that concluded: “Space solar power is technically feasible, affordable, and could both bring substantial economic benefits for the UK, and could support net zero pathways.” In late August, Esa released its own studies on space-based solar energy, which arrived at a similar conclusion for the whole of Europe. As a result, the agency will request in November that its member states fund a three-year feasibility study into solar-power satellites to examine in detail whether such a system might become commercially viable. “Solaris is a bridge to check that this is really doable and that it would really help before we ask for billions of euros,” says Vijendran. Whether or not such satellites go into orbit, there can be no doubt that solar power is set to dominate the energy landscape of the future. And as the current Ukraine crisis shows, that could lead to better energy security as well as reducing our carbon output."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/25/10-things-you-might-have-missed-in-labor-bread-and-butter-budget-october-australia-federal-2022-beef-week-jet-zero","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-25T08:46:40Z","webTitle":"From solar power for renters to detector dogs – 10 budget measures you may have missed","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/10-things-you-might-have-missed-in-labor-bread-and-butter-budget-october-australia-federal-2022-beef-week-jet-zero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/10-things-you-might-have-missed-in-labor-bread-and-butter-budget-october-australia-federal-2022-beef-week-jet-zero","fields":{"headline":"From solar power for renters to detector dogs – 10 budget measures you may have missed","bodyText":"The October 2022 budget has been touted as largely a “bread-and-butter affair” but some unexpected areas have managed to secure a slice of the economic pie.

Beef Australia 2024, Casino Beef Week, the second Dairy Symposium and LambEx are among the major conferences to win big in the budget. 2.

Separately, the federal government has promised $5.5m for the office of the Australian information commissioner to investigate the Optus data breach. 3. ‘Jet zero’ planes The real winner in the October budget may be plane puns. The federal government will funnel spending into establishing a “jet zero”-style council to encourage emissions reduction in the aviation industry. It’s part of $139.9m over three years to support the sector – including upgrading Hobart airport and border facilities at Newcastle and western Sydney’s international airports. 4. Dog detectors Labradors in training and fans of Border Security rejoice – the federal government has committed $11.7m over the next four years for expanded detector dog capability at Australia’s borders. From 2026 an additional $3.3m a year has been promised to train up sniffer dogs well into the future. Sign up for our free morning newsletter and afternoon email to get your daily news roundup 5. Climate change health risk In a frank acknowledgement of the health risks posed by the climate crisis, Labor is committing $3.4m over the next four years then $700,000 a year to establish a “national health sustainability and climate unit”. The body will coordinate climate change responses across the health system. 6. Toy libraries Free haircuts and expanding toy libraries are part of $12.7m committed to the Department of Social Services over the next four years to “improve access to services that enhance community wellbeing”. It’s the first budget that has raised “wellbeing” as a measurable factor. The bulk will be funnelled into community playgroups and toy libraries, including new First Nations and intergenerational playgroups, while $350,000 will be rolled out to Short Back and Sidewalks, which provide free haircuts to people experiencing homelessness. 7. Solar power for renters Renters may finally be able to address their ballooning power bills. A $102.2m community solar banks program will improve access to clean energy technologies among underrepresented communities including social housing, apartments, rentals and households traditionally unable to access rooftop solar. The four-year funding commitment has been redirected from savings found in Labor’s government spending audit. 8. Targeting anti-vaxxers In a sign the pandemic isn’t behind us, $41.8m has been allocated for “communication activities” to drive uptake of the Covid vaccine, with specific focus on those with “lower access to mainstream media” and Australians at risk of severe disease. It’s part of $355.8m in funding for the distribution of Covid vaccines, with particular emphasis on administering the fourth dose to vulnerable communities. 9. Supporting seafood workers Commercial fishers and seafood workers read on. The Seafood Industry Australia’s Stay Afloat program is receiving $1.5m over the next two years to roll out 50 hubs in Australian fishing communities to provide mental health and wellbeing support. 10. LGBTIQA+ health services To address barriers to healthcare in the LGBTIQA+ community, $1.3m has been committed over a two-year period to fund peak community organisations consulting with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer and asexual Australians. Additional funding will also be provided to QLife to recruit volunteer peer support workers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/may/07/uk-solar-energy-firm-scheme-save-ripple-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-07T13:00:21Z","webTitle":"UK solar energy firm offers ‘shared’ scheme that could save £200 a year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/07/uk-solar-energy-firm-scheme-save-ripple-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/may/07/uk-solar-energy-firm-scheme-save-ripple-energy","fields":{"headline":"UK solar energy firm offers ‘shared’ scheme that could save £200 a year","bodyText":"If you would love to have solar panels but don’t own your home or can’t afford the outlay, how about investing in Britain’s first “shared” solar park that is promising cheaper, zero-carbon electricity, direct to your energy bills for the next 40 years? With two successful community energy schemes already behind it, Ripple Energy is looking for investors for its third: the construction of a 42MW solar park in Derril Water in Devon, not far from the Cornish town of Bude. Once up and running in the summer of 2024, the project, which is being built by one of the world’s largest independent renewable energy companies, RES, will produce enough electricity to power 14,000 homes across Britain. Ripple says this co-owned venture – which will have about 70,000 panels – will be the first solar park in the UK to share its green electricity among its thousands of owners. Householders can invest as little as £25, although most people will probably want to put in a typical £3,000 to £3,600 – the amount required to buy enough generation capacity to cover up to 120% of their home’s annual electricity consumption. The company says this should result in average savings of at least £200 a year. Instead of paying the market rate for their electricity, they will in effect be paying the wholesale cost – the price the solar park would have got in the market. Of course, a lot depends on what happens to energy prices in the future. Ripple says it has designed the scheme to be similar to a consumer investing in their own rooftop solar panels – except that the panels just happen to be somewhere else in the country. An investment of £3,000 is significantly cheaper than buying your own rooftop solar panels. Home solar system installations start at about £7,000, rising to more than £12,000 if you add a decent battery. As well as those who can’t afford that, the scheme may appeal to people who live in a property where the roof isn’t suitable for solar panels. Sarah Merrick, the founder and chief executive of Ripple Energy, says that by offering consumer ownership, Derril Water solar park “will become a completely different kind of solar park, one owned by the people it supplies low-cost green power to”. She adds: “We want Derril Water to become a blueprint for consumer-owned solar parks around the world. The aim is to create a wave of green energy ownership that enables people to make a real climate impact, as well as stabilising their energy bills. We hope as many as possible become part of this pioneering project.” The firm says the solar park will save 19,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year. So how does it all work? Those putting their money in are actually buying shares in a cooperative society, one managed by Ripple. Between now and when the plant starts generating power, the household has to switch to one of the six approved energy suppliers, which include Octopus and E.ON. Provided you have bought enough capacity to meet 100% of your home’s electricity consumption, you should typically save about 20-25% off your electricity bills, it is claimed. This is automatically processed by your supplier, with the lower bills available for the next 40 years. Users are not getting a 100% electricity saving because the non-energy costs, such as the grid charges, taxes and supplier costs, still have to be paid. A typical household investing £3,600 upfront is expected to save at least £8,000 in total (£200 or so a year x 40 years), the firm claims, while at the same time helping the planet, although the actual savings will depend on future electricity prices. The savings rate is set each year. Further energy supply problems such as those following the Russia-Ukraine war would mean bigger savings. Equally, a collapse in prices would result in the opposite. One of the advantages of this scheme is that if you move, you get to take the panels and savings with you. It is no problem if you rent, and you also don’t have to find and hire contractors to have your own system installed. However, it is important to be aware that, unlike traditional investments, money invested in this scheme is not protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, the official body that steps in to protect UK customers when authorised financial services firms go under. However, investors can take some comfort in the fact that this is Ripple’s third scheme, and its partner, RES, is a big player in the renewables field. Ripple’s first project was a single wind turbine in Wales where 900 people signed up for co-ownership. Its second project, in Scotland, has eight wind turbines and is fully funded and under construction. About 5,600 co-owners and 19 business members own that scheme and will get their bills reduced when it starts operating by the start of 2024, or earlier. The latest project is Ripple’s first solar park. The buy-in cost is higher than that of the windfarms but users will be benefiting from the energy discounts for 40 years rather than 25. “When we launched our first windfarm, we were expecting it to take 13 or 14 years for users to get their investment back but since we launched, the prices have gone so high that it’s actually looking like the costs could be paid back through savings in maybe four years instead,” Merrick says. Once invested, the money has to stay in the scheme, meaning no withdrawals. Ripple may be able to “resell” your capacity to another household whose consumption has risen.

The offer is expected to close on 16 May, or earlier if there is very high demand."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-27T20:58:14Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: solar soothes power prices, gamblers face credit card ban, Jerry Springer dies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/apr/28/morning-mail-solar-soothes-power-prices-gamblers-face-credit-card-ban-jerry-springer-dies","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: solar soothes power prices, gamblers face credit card ban, Jerry Springer dies","bodyText":"Morning everyone. “People should not be betting with money they do not have,” says the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, as she makes a strong case for the government’s attempt to ban gamblers from topping up their wagering accounts with credit cards.

But she knows what she wants to do with it. “While I’m still breathing, I’d like to get some action on solar panels for people in public housing, because it’s just terrible at the moment,” she says. The 73-year-old public housing resident has spent more than a decade advocating for improved living conditions for public tenants in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs. She says with the cost of living soaring, she has never seen so many people doing it so tough. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “A lot of people around here are getting help from the Salvos and neighbourhood houses with food, especially pensioners. How are they supposed to pay their power bills, medication, groceries when it’s all going up by so much?” Rabey says. “I know some people are just not turning their heaters on in winter, while the ones who have air conditioners, they don’t use them at all in the summer because they can’t afford to. Others are just switching everything off.” For Rabey, this is not an option. She has permanent scarring on her lungs following a viral infection that put her in hospital for nine weeks. As a result, she needs to use an oxygen machine and run two air purifiers and a compressor 24 hours a day. “I don’t know what it’s going cost me as we head into winter because I have to keep the heating on throughout the night, because otherwise in the morning it’s freezing and I start coughing up,” Rabey says. She is backing a push by the Victorian Public Tenants’ Association to install solar panels on every public housing property in the state. In its state budget submission, the VPTA, the peak body representing existing public housing renters and those on the waitlist, estimates 23,500 existing public housing properties are suitable for installation of rooftop solar panels. It could save each household up to $535.49 each year in energy bills. The VPTA chief executive, Katelyn Butterss, said the proposal would tackle cost-of-living pressures for low-income households, help Victoria reach its emissions reductions targets, and create more than 1,000 jobs. “Homeowners, people who live in community housing and those in private rentals have had an opportunity to access subsidised solar panel installations, while the tenants of Victoria’s biggest landlord – the director of housing – are the only people left behind,” she said. “It’s time they also reaped the benefits.” The VPTA’s submission also calls for a program that would see vacant property owners lease their homes to the government for temporary inclusion in the public housing stock for up to 15 years. The government would pay participants market rent plus 1%. To encourage owners to join the program, the government could increase the vacant residential land tax or apply it to more parts of the state, the submission states. Butterss said the idea followed the release of 2021 census figures last year, which showed there were 1m unoccupied properties across Australia – or 10% of all housing stock – on census night. “That’s really hard to reconcile when in Victoria, there are more than 100,000 individual Victorians waiting for access to safe, secure, affordable housing,” she said. She described the proposal as a “stopgap” until the government’s $5.3bn “Big Housing Build” to construct more than 12,000 new homes eventuates. However, she warned it was likely these new properties would make only a small dent on the “very swollen waitlist”. Rabey is keen to stress that most people in public housing don’t want to be there. “Sometimes stuff happens to people in their lives that they can’t control,” she says. “I only ended up here because my brother’s business went down. That’s life. So we should try to make it a bit easier when we can.” “I don’t know how long I have left but I want to see this one through.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/03/uk-interest-in-solar-power-energy-bills-soar-boom","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-03T12:11:52Z","webTitle":"‘It’s hot’: UK interest in solar power heats up as energy bills soar","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/03/uk-interest-in-solar-power-energy-bills-soar-boom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/03/uk-interest-in-solar-power-energy-bills-soar-boom","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s hot’: UK interest in solar power heats up as energy bills soar","bodyText":"“It’s hot,” says Steve Springett, a director of the renewable energy brand Egg, cheerily assessing the solar market. “There’s two key factors: people are understanding the environmental benefits of it better, and energy is really, really expensive at the moment.” Consumer interest has increased in recent months as Britons hunt for ways to cut huge energy bills. A reduction in VAT on energy efficient systems from 5% to nothing this spring has added to the appeal of solar power. The number of eBay searches for solar panels and solar power batteries increased by 54% and 134% respectively in June compared with same period last year. Consumers are also increasingly hunting for smart meters as they try to keep a handle on their energy use. Murray Lambell, the general manager of eBay UK, says: “As the cost of living crisis hits, shoppers are seeking out savvy investments to keep energy costs low wherever they can. Many are choosing green energy options as a solution that’s good for their wallet and the planet, and we’ve seen a significant surge in demand for products like solar panels and batteries as a result.” The boom is the latest in an industry so known for its unpredictable fortunes that it has been called the “solar coaster”. The name emerged from peaks and troughs created by the government’s “feed-in tariffs”, through which householders received payments for the electricity generated by eligible systems to incentivise their uptake. A rush of installations took place on the eve of each deadline before payments would become less generous, followed by a fallow period. The closure of the scheme to new applicants in March 2019 drained some of the buoyancy from the market. Industry watchers say the market had become more stable since the scheme ended – until this year. Data from the consumer credit reporting company Experian shows that about 1.9 million households intend to install solar panels or other renewable capabilities this year. Springett says the huge increase in energy bills could reduce the time it takes to recoup the cost of an installed system, coming down from “double-digit years” to more like seven, depending on size and location of the property. Warranties usually last for 25 years and the panels – also known as photovoltaic cells – can last for up to 40 years. Costs typically vary between £5,000 and £15,000 for a family home, and applications to connect to the grid can take about three months. “There’s a definite crossover between people who are getting solar panels, and electric cars and heat pumps. They want the whole package,” Springett says. The clamour for panels is now so great that one senior industry executive says his company ran out of labour and materials to take new orders. “I tried to pass on inquiries to competitors to help out the customers only to find out they didn’t have the capacity to help them either. A lot of the installers went back to their professions, like electricians, when the feed-in scheme ended, and it’s hard to get them back,” he says. The solar panel industry is noticeably fragmented in the UK, with few nationwide players. Ikea sold solar panels and batteries in the UK for two years before stopping in 2019, although it still sells them in Europe. Britain’s Solarcentury, which was founded by the oil geologist Jeremy Leggett, was bought by the Norwegian renewables specialist Statkraft in late 2020. UK institutional investors have shown more interest in the industry of late. Shares in NextEnergy Solar Fund – which invests in large projects in the UK and Italy – have risen by 7% this year, valuing the London-listed investment company at £640m. In the US, John Burger, the founder and chief executive of Sunnova, recently said his company, which is one of the country’s biggest residential solar firms, had had its best ever day of sales. However, tightening regulations, tough markets and concerns over rising interest rates have pummelled the stocks of industry giants including First Solar and Sunrun. For businesses, rising electricity bills – along with labour costs – have made solar panels an attractive investment. Amazon has announced plans to roll out solar panels across all of its UK sites, and will have more than 30,000 new modular solar panels installed on its facilities in Manchester, Coalville, Haydock Green, Wakefield, Bristol and Milton Keynes by the end of the year. The increase in consumer interest in installing solar panels has highlighted difficulties in sourcing them. A squeeze on global shipping capacity and freight rates triggered by the pandemic has led to a shortage of inverters, devices that convert the direct current created by the panels to alternating current used to power the home. The panels themselves are typically made in Asia, with a central hub in China. During a parliamentary debate last week, the Conservative MP Nus Ghani noted that much of the production took place in Xinjiang, where China has been accused of potentially committing genocide against the Uyghur population. Xinjiang, officially an autonomous region of China, accounts for about 45% of the world’s supply of polysilicon, the key component of solar panels. Asked about the sourcing of solar panels from China, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “What’s happened over the last 20 years is that the Chinese have had a very strategic game, they could see which way the global economy was going and they essentially monopolised and gathered extensive capacity in their own hands, and we’re in a world now where we’re trying to get away from overdependence.” Kwarteng has targeted a tripling in solar power by 2030, increasing capacity from 15 gigawatts now to 50GW. With further jumps in energy bills expected in October and again next year, consumer frenzy to pile in this summer could well set Britain on its way towards hitting that target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/dec/08/rome-solar-powered-christmas-tree-lights-row-italy","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-08T14:08:40Z","webTitle":"Rome’s solar-powered Christmas tree lights spark row over ‘ugly’ panels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/08/rome-solar-powered-christmas-tree-lights-row-italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/dec/08/rome-solar-powered-christmas-tree-lights-row-italy","fields":{"headline":"Rome’s solar-powered Christmas tree lights spark row over ‘ugly’ panels","bodyText":"A row has broken out over two “ugly” solar panels intended to power the lights on Rome’s traditional Christmas tree. There is always much anticipation in the Italian capital when the fir arrives at the Piazza Venezia in the historic centre – a Unesco world heritage site – with many giving their view on the choice of decoration. The 2017 incarnation made headlines around the world when its threadbare appearance drew comparisons with a toilet brush. This year it was the decision to install two giant solar panels at its base that sparked a row. Vittorio Sgarbi, an art critic and undersecretary at the culture ministry, described the initiative as “an exhibition of bogus environmentalism”. He said he had sought clarification from Rome’s superintendent for archaeology as he wages his battle “in defence of the landscape”. “This is an idea à la Greta Thunberg,” he said, adding that the panels should not be placed in a “monumental square” when there were plenty of alternatives. Fabrizio Santori, a politician with the far-right League, told La Repubblica: “I am receiving messages from people who have tried to install solar panels but who have been blocked by the superintendency, then seeing that the city can place two huge ones in Piazza Venezia seems like a mockery. The issue of renewable energy is important but we need respect for the scenery.” Linda Meleo, a former Rome councillor with the Five Star Movement, a party which places environmental protection among its central policies, also criticised the move. “There are other methods to light the tree with clean energy without placing two panels there which are objectively ugly,” she said. Rome’s mayor, Roberto Gualtieri, defended the use of the panels, which will also power the Christmas lights on the nearby shopping thoroughfare, Via del Corso, especially during a period of high energy costs. He said the panels would lower carbon dioxide emissions by more than 70 kilos a day. “This is intended to strongly promote a culture of sustainability, also taking into account the delicate moment linked to the war in Ukraine,” he said. “The tree will consume 5.5 kilowatt hours which, instead of coming from the grid, will be self-produced by the photovoltaic system.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/mar/29/comedy-climate-change-michelle-wolf-david-perdue","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-29T13:56:32Z","webTitle":"‘How do you laugh about death?’: the comedians tackling climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/mar/29/comedy-climate-change-michelle-wolf-david-perdue","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/mar/29/comedy-climate-change-michelle-wolf-david-perdue","fields":{"headline":"‘How do you laugh about death?’: the comedians tackling climate change","bodyText":"When David Perdue applied to be part of a climate comedy program, he felt a little out of his element: “I couldn’t recall one time I’d ever had a conversation with my friends about climate change,” said the Atlanta-based comic. Perdue, who is Black, added, “But I knew it was an issue that was going to affect people who look like me, so I wanted to use comedy to address that.” Perdue was one of nine comedians who took part in a nine-month fellowship where they learned about climate science and solutions and collaborated on new, climate-related material. The Climate Comedy Cohort produced shorts, toured together, and pitched ideas to television networks. Their work is part of a broader effort to bring some levity to a topic that is increasingly present in everyday life. For Perdue, that meant bringing race into the conversation about sustainability and clean energy. “[Solar power] is free labor, and the most American thing to do is to use free labor,” he says in one of his sets. “We just have to tell people the sun is Black.” Climate change has increasingly featured in television dramas and apocalyptic thrillers. But comedians like Perdue, as well as higher-profile acts like Michelle Wolf and Joel Kim Booster, are also taking on the climate crisis. (Wolf, in her HBO special, says that “Mother Nature is trying to kill us in the most passive-aggressive way possible. She’s like, ‘What? I raised the temperature a little.’”) By talking about climate, even irreverently, social scientists say, they may be helping to combat climate doom and boost civic engagement. Comedy – even if it’s about heavy topics like climate change – can motivate feelings of hope and optimism, said Caty Borum, a professor at American University and author of The Revolution Will Be Hilarious: Comedy for Social Change and Civic Power. “Those are routes to persuasion because we’re being entertained and because we’re feeling emotions of play – and this is particularly important for climate change,” she said. The Climate Comedy Cohort, a joint project between American University’s Center for Media &amp; Social Impact, which Borum runs, and Generation180, a clean-energy non-profit, announced a new class of comedians earlier this month. “As it just turns out, the very unique qualities of comedy that allow us to break through taboo, allow us to use social critique, and translate topics, all of that really contributes” to people feeling like they can take action, Borum said. Actor and former Obama aide Kal Penn hosts a new show on Bloomberg called Getting Warmer that focuses on climate technology and solutions “with a dose of humor and optimism”, according to its tagline. And in April, a group of comedians is putting on a show in Los Angeles called lol climate change: a show. A majority of Americans says climate change is real and caused by humans, but only about half think there’s anything they can do about it, according to a 2022 AP-NORC poll. Borum said that programs like hers can help combat climate doom and inaction. “The goal of the program is not to have comedians tell more scary stories about climate change, but to really dig in on the solutions,” she said. Just because climate change is heavy and important, it doesn’t mean comedy about it can’t be really silly, said Esteban Gast, a comedian who helped create the Climate Comedy Cohort. He noted that comedy often draws from tragedy. Marc Maron’s new special, From Bleak to Dark, delves into the death of his partner, Lynne Shelton; in Nanette, Hannah Gadsby opens up about being sexually assaulted. “It’s the comedian’s job to pull from that,” Gast said. On stage, Katie Hannigan, part of the Climate Comedy Cohort notes that gas stoves are horrible for the planet. She says, “I am doing my part for climate change. I have never even used my gas stove … since I started that fire.” Kat Evasco, one of the lol climate change comedians, has a joke connecting her mother’s skepticism about climate change to her denial about being gay – even though she’s shared a bedroom with a woman for 25 years, Evasco quips. “It’s about moments that might not center on climate change, but can tie back to it,” she said. “We aren’t big on sharing data and statistics,” Evasco said. “What we are looking for is: how does this show up in human experience? How do you laugh about death?” Max Boykoff, a professor in environmental studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, said he believes comedy can help drive the conversation forward on polarizing topics like climate change. (The majority of Americans don’t feel comfortable talking about the climate with their neighbors or co-workers.) “The comedic approach is not just simply a matter of making someone laugh. It’s actually a way to open people up,” he said. In 2018, Boykoff and Beth Osnes, a professor of theatre, developed a creative climate communication course in which students developed their own comedy skits. At the end of the semester, 90% of students reported feeling more hopeful about climate change, and 83% said they believed their commitment to taking action on climate change was more likely to last. Borum said that when comedy is done well, it can change minds on almost any topic – she has studied how comedy can create social change around poverty, inequality and human rights. “The best comedy that inserts something important about the world is not boring and lame,” she said, “and that’s true from a science perspective, but also a comedy perspective.” This article originally appeared in Nexus Media News"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/24/huge-uk-public-support-for-direct-action-to-protect-environment-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-24T15:00:10Z","webTitle":"Huge UK public support for direct action to protect environment – poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/24/huge-uk-public-support-for-direct-action-to-protect-environment-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/24/huge-uk-public-support-for-direct-action-to-protect-environment-poll","fields":{"headline":"Huge UK public support for direct action to protect environment – poll","bodyText":"A large majority of the UK public supports nonviolent direct action to protect the environment, according to an opinion poll. People also strongly backed solar power on farmland and opposed fracking. The poll indicates the unpopularity of a recent swathe of government policies, with more than twice as many people saying they trusted Labour to protect the environment as said they trusted the Conservatives. The public order bill going through parliament introduces stiff penalties for protests, such as those by Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion and others described as “Guardian-reading, tofu-eating wokerati” by the former home secretary Suella Braverman. In the poll, 66% of people supported taking nonviolent direct action to protect the UK’s nature, with 34% opposed. Support for such action dropped to 44% among Tory supporters. Recent direct action has included protesters throwing soup at a Van Gogh painting and blocking the Dartford Crossing. The government has also proposed banning solar panels on most farmland. But 75% of people, including Conservative supporters, opposed this in the poll. Solar power has long been the most popular energy source in opinion polls. On Tuesday, the government also begins legislating its “Brexit freedoms bill” that could remove all EU-derived regulations, including 570 environmental protections. Along with proposals to end the plan to use most farm subsidies to protect and improve the environment, the moves have been described as an “attack on nature” by the nation’s largest green groups, which have not ruled out taking direct action. In the poll, conducted by Omnisis, 68% of people said they most trusted Labour to protect and improve the environment, with 32% backing the Conservatives. The government aims to resume fracking in the UK, contrary to a manifesto pledge. However, only 34% of people said they would be happy to have a shale gas site in their constituency, while 66% said they would not. Just over half of Conservative supporters – 53% – said they would be happy living near a fracking site. The government has already received applications for its proposed investment zones, where planning and environmental rules would be relaxed and tax breaks introduced to encourage new building and businesses. This issue split people in the poll fairly evenly, with 47% supporting the relaxation of environmental protections in the investment zones and 53% opposing it. The poll questioned 1382 people on 20 October and is weighted to a nationally representative population.

According to its inventors, the prototype produces hydrogen with greater than 99% purity and can work in air that is as dry as 4% relative humidity. The device would allow hydrogen to be produced without carbon emissions even in regions where water on land is scarce, they say. Hydrogen is a zero-carbon fuel that yields only water as a byproduct when used in fuel cells. However, pure hydrogen is not abundant in nature and producing it requires energy input. Large-scale production commonly involves fossil fuels that generate carbon emissions. The study’s lead author and a senior lecturer in chemical engineering at the University of Melbourne, Dr Gang Kevin Li, said the hydrogen-producing device could be powered by solar or wind energy. A prototype produced hydrogen for more than 12 consecutive days in a monitored trial. “[For] one of them, we left it to run by itself for eight months,” Li said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The device is comprised of spongy material with a hygroscopic liquid – fluid that absorbs moisture from the air, similar in function to silica gel sachets. The absorbed water molecules are then split at electrodes into hydrogen and oxygen gasses, a process known as electrolysis. “Hydrogen is the ultimate clean energy … as long as you have renewable sources of energy to electrolyse the water,” Li said. The device is estimated to produce up to 93 litres of hydrogen a square metre an hour. “If you have 10 sq metres of this unit, you can power a whole house … to replace your consumption of natural gas at home for cooking and heating,” Li said. The prototypes are still only small in size, and the team has plans to create 1 sq metre and 10 sq metres units in the coming year. The researchers envisage the device could be a useful tool in regions where liquid water is not readily available for producing hydrogen. “Large parts of the world have water scarcity problems,” Li said. “When you have lots of renewable energy – wind or solar – you [often] don’t have much fresh water for this type of hydrogen production.” Dr Kim Beasy of Swinburne University’s Victorian Hydrogen Hub, who was not involved in the research, said hydrogen fuel, while important, was not a silver bullet for reaching net zero. “We’re coming to understand that hydrogen is going to be one piece of the puzzle,” she said. “It’s going to provide us with direction out of some pretty hard-to-mitigate industries such as transport. We have no alternative to diesel at the moment … hydrogen is a really good option.” The required economies of scale were “probably not going to be reached with clean hydrogen straight away”, Beasy said, citing the expensive price of conventional hydrogen electrolysers. “What we really need is more government support and subsidies in bringing down the cost of getting this technology on the ground.” The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. • This article was amended on 14 September 2022 to make clear that hydrogen produces only water as a byproduct when used in fuel cells. When burned in air it also produces nitrogen oxides."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/09/uk-needs-urgent-long-term-plan-to-develop-future-green-hi-tech-industries","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-09T17:16:15Z","webTitle":"Lack of plan for green industry risks UK ‘falling behind’, top government adviser warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/09/uk-needs-urgent-long-term-plan-to-develop-future-green-hi-tech-industries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/09/uk-needs-urgent-long-term-plan-to-develop-future-green-hi-tech-industries","fields":{"headline":"Lack of plan for green industry risks UK ‘falling behind’, top government adviser warns","bodyText":"Britain risks falling behind in a multibillion-pound global “arms race” of re-industrialisation without an urgent launch of a coherent plan for manufacturing, Andy Haldane has warned. The influential economist, who is on Jeremy Hunt’s council of economic advisers, said the UK was “not really in the race at any kind of scale” as other countries steal a march in developing the green, hi-tech industries of the future. “The world is facing right now an arms race in re-industrialisation. And I think we’re at risk of falling behind in that arms race unless we give it the giddy up,” he said. The chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts thinktank said three factors underpinned the scramble: a need to boost the resilience of supply chains after widespread disruption during the Covid pandemic; decarbonisation; and rising military tensions. It comes as the US and the EU invest billions of pounds to support domestic production of everything from renewable energy to microchips and electric vehicles, with Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) pumping $369bn (£292bn) into America’s industrial base. Haldane, a former chief economist at the Bank of England, said: “China has been at this – green tech – for many, many years, and has stolen a march in many, many technologies, including solar and batteries. “The west has belatedly woken up. The IRA is throwing cash to the wall on that. The cost of that [is] almost certainly north of half a trillion dollars. Possibly north of a trillion. The EU is now playing catch up, [and] the UK currently is not really in the race at any kind of scale.” Speaking at an event in London held by the manufacturing trade body Make UK, Haldane urged the government to develop an industrial strategy to succeed the one scrapped by Boris Johnson. Haldane had been chair of the government’s Industrial Strategy Council before the group was abolished. “What was an imperative a few years ago – to create that long-term platform – I think now is absolutely essential,” he said. Jeremy Hunt has previously said he wants to turn Britain into “the world’s next Silicon Valley”. However, industry leaders have warned that repeated “flip flopping” by successive Conservative governments has damaged the British economy. Greg Clark, the business secretary under Theresa May who launched the last industrial strategy, said the government had “tried and failed to have longevity” with its manufacturing policy. Speaking alongside Haldane, the Conservative MP said the decision during Johnson’s premiership to abolish the industrial strategy council was “a piece of vandalism that was completely without purpose”. “Little did I think it would be my own party that would decide to get rid of it.” Clark said the current government had continued and “accelerated” some of the support for British manufacturing contained in the industrial strategy, but suggested a long-term plan was still required. “A short-term strategy is a contradiction in terms. It seems to me essential that you have to build up a means for investors outside of this country to have confidence that the policy framework is going to endure.” A government spokesperson said: “The government has shown a clear strategy for UK manufacturing with a variety of schemes that ensure sectors from auto, to aerospace, to low-carbon technologies have access to the funding, talent and infrastructure they need. “We are focusing on providing a competitive business environment to stimulate growth, reducing red-tape and investing millions in new government funding to help manufacturing SMEs increase productivity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/12/solar-panel-inquiries-off-the-charts-after-alinta-boss-predicts-35-power-price-rise","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-12T02:01:58Z","webTitle":"Solar panel inquiries ‘off the charts’ after Alinta boss predicts 35% power price rise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/12/solar-panel-inquiries-off-the-charts-after-alinta-boss-predicts-35-power-price-rise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/12/solar-panel-inquiries-off-the-charts-after-alinta-boss-predicts-35-power-price-rise","fields":{"headline":"Solar panel inquiries ‘off the charts’ after Alinta boss predicts 35% power price rise","bodyText":"A forecast of a 35% rise in power prices by the boss of Alinta Energy, Jeff Dimery, has triggered a burst of inquiries about solar panels, according to the founder of SolarQuotes. “One of our traffic guys came to tell me, ‘traffic is off the charts’,” Finn Peacock said. “It’s completely driven by the media.” Dimery, whose company runs the Loy Yang B coal-fired power station in Victoria, gave the estimate to the AFR’s energy conference on Monday. A day later the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, described rising energy costs as the most “problematic aspect of our inflation problem over the course of the next six or nine months”. SolarQuotes saw a similar spike in interest in June, typically a quiet month for the solar industry, after regulators announced looming electricity tariff increases of as much as 20%. The company fielded more than 10,000 inquires, roughly double the level of June 2021 and the most for any month ever. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning That spurt in inquiries was an early indicator of an upturn in the solar PV industry. Installations picked up in August and particularly September, according to Tristan Edis, a director at the consultancy Green Energy Markets. He said data for the two months was closer to the boom period of 2020 and 2021, marking “a notable recovery from the prior months of 2022 where numbers were substantially down from the levels for the two previous years”. Total installed capacity in Australia in September was 253 megawatts, or about 17% higher than the year-to-date average, Green Energy Markets data shows. The bounce-back in demand will be welcomed by an industry that had begun to retreat from record numbers for new capacity added in recent years, Edis said. Residential demand was up 13.8% in capacity terms, while commercial demand rocketed by about a third. “It does seem to indicate there’s a recovery,” he said. “If anything, [companies] were cutting back staff before the surge in interest.” Australia has the highest proportionate uptake of solar PV in the world, in part because of relatively high levels of sunshine but also because of high power prices. Fluctuating policies have also contributed to what Dylan McConnell, a contributor in new book The Superpower Transformation, dubs a “solar coaster” of booms and busts in the sector. With solar panels already on about a third of houses in some states, an increasing amount of power is being generated at home. Last month, the region of WA including Perth saw rooftops supply almost three-quarters of demand, nudging overall grid demand to a record low. Edis said that while there were still many suitable rooftops for solar, demand may cool again. One drag will be the rising cost of new systems – in part because of supply chain issues in China – and the “pittance” being paid to households for the surplus energy supplied back into the grid. Labor shortages, too, will add to installation costs as they are doing in many parts of the economy, he said. Peacock, of SolarQuotes, said that while system prices had increased, they were “not putting people off” yet. With the media speculation about how high electricity tariffs might go, buyers see panels as “an insurance against further price rises”, he said. The size of systems is also ticking up, with an average unit now about 8 kilowatts of capacity. Also on the rise are inquiries about batteries to accompany the panels to store surplus power. In October so far, about one in five inquiries about solar panels also include a query about batteries, up from about 12% a year ago. Another pointer to the way the industry is headed is the increase in electric vehicle purchases. Tesla’s Model Y was the third-most popular car sold in Australia last month with the company selling almost 6,000 all-electric vehicles, according to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. Peacock said EV owners, who often already have solar panels, are becoming a new source of inquiries because they find their current systems are too small. That shift could generate fresh demand for the sector in the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/oct/13/green-energy-guardian-reader-growth-net-zero-liz-truss-jacob-rees-mogg","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T05:00:02Z","webTitle":"I’m maligned as a ‘green energy sceptic’.

I’m not. Dear Guardian reader, here’s what I think","bodyText":"It is always intriguing to see my own views through the lens of a newspaper refracted away from what I think. Although I am no admirer of Extinction Rebellion, I can assure Guardian readers that I am not a “green energy sceptic”. I am in favour of intelligent net zero in which green energy will play the biggest role. I’m proud to belong to a country that has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% since 1990, while growing the economy by over 70% in that time. It is in this light that we can achieve our commitments to net zero by 2050, as dark satanic mills are replaced by onshore and offshore windfarms. But if the green agenda does not provide economic growth, it will ultimately not have political support and it will be self-defeating. Getting the British people on board with net zero requires us to demonstrate that we can go green in a way that makes them better off, not worse off, that drives growth instead of hindering it and that stimulates investment and innovation rather than driving traditional industries to the brink of ruin. The effect we have had on energy-intensive industries increases carbon emissions as we import more from abroad while destroying high-paid jobs in the United Kingdom. There are ways to make this work which the country is adopting. Consider the Contracts for Difference scheme. This programme has grown to support a bountiful range of renewable energy sources, from onshore wind to offshore, solar power to tidal and from remote island wind to energy production from waste – all while bringing down costs and growing the economy. The drive to produce up to 50GW of offshore wind by 2030 means that this sector alone should grow to support 90,000 jobs. The scheme has successfully overcome demands for upfront capital and settled uncertainties for generators navigating volatile wholesale prices. It has spurred £90bn of investment in renewables since 2012 and contributed to a five-fold increase in electricity generation from renewable sources over the decade. The latest auction round last year secured 93 new contracts for 11GW of renewable generation capacity – enough to power 12m homes. In 2010, renewables accounted for a mere 7% of the UK’s electricity generation. Programmes such as Contracts for Difference mean that renewables now meet about 40% of our needs, reducing our reliance on authoritarian regimes such as Russia and strengthening our domestic energy sector. The war in Ukraine has thrown into sharp relief the need to rapidly increase our domestic energy supply and strengthen our energy security, from all forms of renewables to nuclear and our domestic oil and gas reserves, which are of course significantly greener than shipping liquefied natural gas from overseas. That is why our recently announced growth plan will accelerate the delivery of major infrastructure projects including onshore and offshore windfarms. This plan will also boost the UK’s nascent hydrogen industry, which will work in harmony with the renewables and gas sectors alike. The government will also align onshore wind planning policy with other infrastructure to allow it to be deployed more easily in England. We understand the strength of feeling that some people have about the impact of wind turbines in England. The plans will maintain local communities’ ability to contribute to proposals, including developing local partnerships for communities that wish to see new onshore wind infrastructure in return for benefits such as lower energy bills. We are exploring options to support low-cost finance to help householders with the upfront costs of solar installation, permitted development rights to support deployment of more small-scale solar in commercial settings and designing performance standards to further encourage renewables, including solar PV, in new homes and buildings. We also need to focus on another key part of our energy infrastructure, reinforcing the grid so that renewable electricity can be transported to homes and businesses all over the country. Grid connection can often be on the critical path for getting new renewable infrastructure online, which is why I am committed to significantly reducing timelines for building new network infrastructure. But in exchange for the unprecedented support that is being offered to renewable energy companies, they must charge consumers and taxpayers a fair price for the energy they produce. By separating the price of renewable energy from the most expensive form of production, which today is gas, and moving these companies on to Contracts for Difference, the government is providing the renewables sector with long-term stability and a sensible price that is fair to the industry and consumers alike. The energy prices bill, introduced this week, will strengthen energy security and stop Putin holding our energy policy to ransom. It also has the potential to save billions of pounds for British billpayers, without deterring essential investment in low-carbon generation as we progress towards net zero. Given the stakes, it’s important that the public debate on net zero and energy security is robust and lively, but I hope my commitment to making it a reality is clear. • Jacob Rees-Mogg is secretary of state for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A report from the IEA has found that clean energy investment is on track to reach $1.7tn (£1.4tn) this year as investors turn to renewables, electric vehicles, nuclear power, grids, storage and other low-carbon technologies. At the same time investment in coal, gas and oil will rise to just over $1tn, the IEA said. The Paris-based agency found that clean energy investments have been boosted by many factors including periods of strong economic growth and volatile fossil fuel prices as well as heightened concerns about energy security after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “Clean energy is moving fast – faster than many people realise. This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels. “In very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it’s very exciting.” The clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. “For the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,” he said. Clean energy investment has climbed steadily in recent years as governments and investors have sought to take advantage of the low cost of renewables such as wind and solar power. In contrast, investment in fossil fuels plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic when severe travel restrictions caused demand for transport fuels to plummet, leading to a collapse in energy commodity prices. The IEA report showed that clean energy investment has accelerated well beyond spending on gas, coal and oil as governments become increasingly concerned about developing secure, homegrown energy sources. However, the IEA report warned that Russia’s war in Ukraine has also prompted increased investment in upstream oil and gas, which is expected to rise by 7% in 2023 in a return to 2019 levels. At the same time global coal demand reached an all-time high in 2022, in part owing to record high gas prices, which has spurred estimated coal investment for this year to nearly six times the levels that are aligned with global 2030 climate targets. Birol said the single most important barrier facing the expansion of renewable energy remains problems with projects being able to connect to electricity grids. “We are seeing a pipeline of projects in Europe, US and Asia and Africa where the grid is the main problem. If you cannot reduce permitting time we will not be able to see the rapid expansion of renewables,” he said. In the UK, developers of renewable energy projects have complained that they have been forced to wait for more than a decade to connect to the electricity grid."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2023/mar/04/solar-panels-home-batteries-save-cut-bill-costs","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-04T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"‘My new solar panels and batteries should save me £1,600 this year’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/mar/04/solar-panels-home-batteries-save-cut-bill-costs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2023/mar/04/solar-panels-home-batteries-save-cut-bill-costs","fields":{"headline":"‘My new solar panels and batteries should save me £1,600 this year’","bodyText":"How would you like to be able to power two electric cars, cover most of the electricity for your greener home, and still save £150 a month on your electricity bill? If you don’t believe it is possible, look no further than Giles Parker. Last year the 69-year-old, who lives in the village of Ickleford in Hertfordshire, spent £9,500 on installing 14 solar panels on his east-west roof and two 8.2 kilowatt hour (kWh) solar batteries in his garage. Nine months on, he estimates he has cut his annual electricity bill in half, and is on course to save about £1,600 this year. Energy bills, and what can be done to reduce them, were yet again front-page news this week as pressure mounted on the government to postpone a looming cut in support for households. As things stand, consumers face an increase in their bills from April, despite Monday’s announcement that the industry price cap will fall by almost £1,000. Parker, who runs his own digital signage business, is relatively unusual in that he and his son run electric cars, meaning his electricity consumption is significantly higher than most households. However, with careful management of the system – which sometimes leads to him dialling in to set the home batteries to charge up at night using super-cheap electricity – he says he has slashed his outgoings, as well as his home’s carbon emissions. While solar panel installation has been around for years, the arrival of reasonably priced home energy batteries capable of storing a home’s daily electricity consumption – plus the big increase in prices because of the Russia-Ukraine war – has helped revitalise a sector that was left on its knees when the government stopped paying feed-in tariffs. Last week the body that accredits installers, MCS, said solar panel installations have doubled this year and are running at the highest level since 2015. The fact that most of us are now paying about 35p a kWh for each unit of electricity – almost three times as much as a few years ago, with prices about to go up again in April – has left householders looking for ways to save money on electricity bills that now average £1,200 a year. “I did it partly to reduce my carbon emissions but also to save money,” says Parker, whose panels were producing about 1kW when the Guardian visited on a sunny February day. This would rise to above 4kW on the brightest summer’s day. For comparison, the highest-using item in most kitchens, the kettle, is typically rated at 3kW. “If we are out and the sun’s shining, the power generated is automatically sent to the battery for later use when we are back at home,” Parker says. “I opted for two batteries because you pay 5% VAT if you buy them at the same time as the solar panel install, and I wanted to future-proof the house. We have a very old boiler, which is going to need to be replaced at some point, an electric hob and an immersion heater. When the boiler goes, I will probably be moving to an electrically powered heating system – possibly infrared heating panels – which will require more capacity.” Parker says a significant part of his £150-a-month savings come from the fact that he is on Octopus Energy’s Intelligent electric vehicle tariff, which also allows him to recharge his home battery system between 11.30pm and 5.30am for only 7.5p a kWh. “It means we rarely have to use power from the grid at the full price [about 35p a kWh], only when using things like a kettle, which exceeds 2.6kW – the maximum that the batteries will supply to the house. The whole thing is really easy to manage using an app on my phone, and we are now using seven times as much off-peak power as that charged at the full price.” So should we all be following his lead? One issue for the rest of us is the fact that the prices of panels and batteries have risen since Parker’s installation. Today, a system that features a 4kW array of solar panels plus a good-quality 9.2kWh home battery costs about £11,000-£13,000, once the inverter and other bits are added. The price will depend on roof size, where you live and the type of hardware chosen. Certainly, if you are wanting to cut your home’s carbon footprint and improve the energy performance certificate (EPC) rating, this is one of the simplest ways to do it. Once set up, the panels will either power the house or charge the battery, with excess power exported to the grid. However, by shifting your power use – for example, running the washing machine in peak sunshine – and by charging the battery up at night in the winter, using discounted off-peak electricity, most households should be able to reduce their electricity bills from an average of £1,200 a year currently to only £200-£400. It means a typical nine- to 10-year payback period, based on current prices. The panels should typically last for 25 years, and the batteries are warranted for 10 years, although they should continue to store power, albeit at a slightly depleted level, for years after their 10th anniversary, making a long-term investment worth looking at – particularly if you have no plans to move home. Picking the right electricity tariff is crucial One of the key points in terms of making these systems work financially is to be on the right electricity tariff. While most of the big suppliers have been downgrading the old Economy 7 tariffs that offered cheap night-time rates, Octopus Energy is firmly embracing the concept with a range of tariffs aimed at customers needing to charge electric cars and, most recently, batteries, with some of the lowest off-peak prices. A few days ago the company added a new tariff called Octopus Flux, aimed at those with a solar PV and home battery setup. It is more complicated than most tariffs out there and is clearly set up to incentivise customers to avoid buying power at the 4pm-7pm peak period, when it typically charges 49p a kWh. On the flipside, the company will pay households about 40p a kWh for every peak-time unit their panels export to the grid. Households charging their battery at night pay about 21p a kWh – considerably more than the 10p being charged to new electric car owners on the company’s Intelligent tariff but less than the day rate the rest of us are paying. Customers on EDF’s Economy 7 rates are currently paying about 47p a kWh for day usage and 11p a kWh for off-peak power, although they only receive 5.6p a kWh for power exported to the grid. Rebecca Dibb-Simkin, the Octopus head of marketing – and who has just had 18 solar panels and a battery system installed at her Midlands home – says the new tariff has been launched to cater to the growing number of homeowners who have such systems installed. “There is huge interest right now from customers in installing solar panels and batteries to store the excess power. I can tell you from personal experience that it is quick and easy. The best bit is that we should end up only paying for electricity about 60 days of the year, using the power we generate ourselves the rest of the time. I expect the install has added significantly to the home’s value, too,” she says. Octopus also recently started offering to carry out solar PV panel and battery installations at people’s homes in the Midlands and parts of the south of England, and Dibb-Simkin says the plan is to go nationwide with this. Asked whether people spending £11,000 and upwards on such systems could be left looking at poor investments if energy prices swiftly fall back down to the levels of a few years ago, she maintains that the answer is no. “I really don’t see energy prices ever falling back to those levels,” she says. The financial services firm Investec has said it expects the Ofgem price cap to fall to £2,165 from July – down from the £3,000 we are all set to be paying in April under the government’s energy price guarantee scheme. Meanwhile, earlier this week, analysts at Cornwall Insight forecast that the price cap will fall to £2,112 from 1 July, and then £2,118 from October until the end of the year. Ultimately, the payback period on these investments will depend on future electricity prices that may or may not fall if and when the war in Ukraine ends. If prices stay relatively high over the coming years, we will all be wishing we had followed Parker’s lead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2021/sep/01/spains-energy-cooperatives-lead-charge-to-exploit-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-01T08:57:39Z","webTitle":"Spain’s energy cooperatives lead charge to exploit solar power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/01/spains-energy-cooperatives-lead-charge-to-exploit-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/sep/01/spains-energy-cooperatives-lead-charge-to-exploit-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Spain’s energy cooperatives lead charge to exploit solar power","bodyText":"Spain’s growing energy cooperative movement has received a boost after the government announced that some of the latest allocation of renewable energy will be in small lots, rather than large tranches that only big energy companies can afford. The move signals a change of attitude after successive governments have given in to the demands of the power giants. It comes as cooperatives in rural and urban areas are trying to break free from the major electricity suppliers that have exploited high demand during the recent heatwave to push prices up to record levels. Cristina Alonso, energy spokeswoman for Friends of the Earth, welcomed the government’s apparent change of heart as “a favourable measure – but not one that actually promotes energy communities because it doesn’t define what they are. These need to be defined as democratic and genuinely autonomous.” Solar installation has accelerated rapidly since the abolition in 2018 of the so-called “sunshine tax”. The rightwing government imposed this on self-sufficient consumers in 2015 for, in effect, depriving power companies of income. Consumers were also obliged to give their surplus energy to the grid free of charge. With no oil or gas and not much coal, sunshine is Spain’s greatest energy resource, and yet it remains underexploited. According to the Spanish Electric Network, in 2020 renewables accounted for 43.6% of energy production of which only 6.1% came from solar power, with the bulk coming from wind (21.7%) and nuclear (22.2%). Germany has three times as much installed solar power as Spain even though it had about 1,896 hours of sunshine in 2020, compared with almost 3,000 hours in Spain. In countries where most people live in single-family dwellings, any individual can generally decide to install solar panels. In Spain, however, 66.5% of the population live in apartment blocks, usually a mix of owner-occupiers and tenants, so the situation is more complex. To get around the problem of trying to get everyone to agree to invest in renewable energy for a multi-occupied building, one solution is to install solar panels on the roofs of public buildings such as schools, as well as factories and warehouses, that can supply electricity to neighbouring homes and businesses. The NGO Sustainability Observatory has proposed a rooftop campaign that would produce 15,400GWh, enough for 7.5 million people, on an investment that it says would be recoverable within six years. This is what Athletic Bilbao football club is offering its neighbours. When the club built a new stadium in 2013, it installed 300 solar panels and through its offshoot Tekathletic supplies electricity to 200 homes and businesses within a 500-metre radius at prices 25% below the going rate. Something similar is happening in Zaragoza, where the NGO Ecodes has teamed up with the power company EDP and the local authority to initiate the Solar Neighbourhood project. EDP has supplied and installed solar panels on the roofs of two municipal sports centres, each of which generates 50kWp, enough to supply 200 homes and businesses in the vicinity. Cecilia Foronda, the head of energy at Ecodes, explains that participants in the scheme do not pay up front for the installation, in recognition that people who are not homeowners are not motivated to invest. Participants pay a monthly quota of €6.90 (£5.90), which goes to repay the cost of the installation, and enjoy electricity prices that are about 30% cheaper than the market rate. The quota is waived for those least able to pay. Foronda says Ecodes is seeking European funding in order to replicate the scheme in six other Zaragoza neighbourhoods. Meanwhile, Som Energia (We Are Energy), which was founded in Girona in north-east Spain in 2010 and claims to be Europe’s oldest energy cooperative, has about 70,000 members. The co-op, which is run democratically, acts as an umbrella for smaller co-ops across the country, says Albert Banal-Estanol, its president. Members pay a €100 joining fee that is later reimbursed. When individuals want to install solar panels on their homes, Som Energia encourages them to form a local cooperative and then buy in bulk as it is not only cheaper but creates an energy community that in turn helps spread the word about self-sufficiency. “Last year we had a project that cost around €5m and we asked members to contribute, money that would be paid back from the income we get from selling excess electricity to the grid,” says Banal-Estanol. “We set a deadline of 15 days but we raised it all in one day.” “We want to extend this model but at the same time we’re not obsessed with growth,” he says. “We just want to see renewables grow.” Now that the big power companies can no longer rely on the government to stymie the spread of the cooperative movement, they are getting in on the act, offering to fund rooftop installations for communities in order to hang on to their customers. A genuine energy community, Alonso says, has social and environmental objectives, as well as economic ones. If it’s simply a case of a company supplying electricity from renewable sources “the company still owns the installation, you have a contract with them, and the only difference is the electricity comes from solar panels.” “The big power companies are reconfiguring themselves from selling electricity to selling services,” says Foronda. “But we need to ensure that energy self-sufficiency is in the hands of citizens because it empowers them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/18/puerto-rico-solar-power-climate-resilience","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-18T09:00:11Z","webTitle":"‘We want sun’: the battle for solar power in Puerto Rico","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/18/puerto-rico-solar-power-climate-resilience","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/18/puerto-rico-solar-power-climate-resilience","fields":{"headline":"‘We want sun’: the battle for solar power in Puerto Rico","bodyText":"Rosalina Marrero spends the best part of each day ironing and watching telenovelas at her modest bungalow in Puerto Rico’s coastal Guayama province. When it gets too hot or her asthma plays up due to the toxic coal ash from the nearby power plant, the 78-year-old widow rests on an adjustable hospital bed, clicks on the fan and thanks God for the solar panels on her roof. Earlier this year, Marrero was among two dozen residents in a low-income, predominantly Black neighbourhood blighted by coal pollution, fitted with a rooftop solar and storage system. Campaigners say systems like hers should be rolled out more widely to tackle the island’s energy crisis and the global climate emergency – both of which are exacerbating racialized health inequalities. The situation with the electricity is dire. Puerto Ricans can pay more than twice as much for electricity as Americans on the mainland, depending on which sector they are in, yet earlier this month power cuts to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses caused widespread anger and misery. Traffic lights failed, hospitals used expensive diesel generators to keep dialysis machines and ventilators running, and fires broke out due to fluctuations in voltage. Despite the abysmal service, electricity rates have increased four times so far this year. In hot and humid Guayama, the lights went out for several hours almost every day for those unable to afford a backup generator. But thanks to the rooftop solar system, Marrero could stay cool and watch TV without worrying about the food going off in the fridge. “It’s the best thing that’s happened to me. I thank God because my poor neighbours are suffering but I’ve always got electricity. I feel more secure, if we get another big hurricane like Maria, I won’t suffer so much,” said Marrero. Marrero is lucky because while Puerto Rico gets enough sunlight to meet its residential electricity needs at least four times over, less than 3% of the island’s energy comes from renewable sources. The rest is generated from imported fossil fuels: 49% from petroleum and 29% from natural gas, while coal accounts for 19%. Hurricane Maria was a wake-up call: it not only exposed Puerto Rico’s vulnerability to extreme weather events linked to global heating, but also focused attention on the economic and environmental ramifications of the island’s dependence on fossil fuels for local communities and greenhouse gas emissions. This gave rise to a social movement that came up with a plan called Queremos Sol, or we want sun – an evidence-based roadmap to make Puerto Rico’s energy system self-sufficient by swapping fossil fuels for onsite small solar grids distributed throughout the island. The concept is simple: a localized system that doesn’t require moving electricity from centralized power plants along overhead wires to local substations would be better equipped to withstand and recover from super storms and other natural disasters. Onsite batteries would better cover critical needs during disruptions. Experts say that such radical change is necessary to comply with Puerto Rico’s ambitious energy policy, which mandates that 40% of electricity must come from renewable resources by 2025 and 100% by 2050. It would also help the US comply with the Paris agreement, which Biden rejoined on the first day of his presidency, as well as the administration’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by investing in green infrastructure and jobs to address climate change and environmental justice. On the other hand, local authorities and the energy sector insist that more electricity must be generated to avoid shortages and power cuts – claims which campaigners dismiss as a ruse to justify further investment in gas and transmission infrastructure, as official documents suggest there’s enough capacity to cover demand. What’s agreed is that Puerto Rico is at a pivotal point and for once there’s real money on the table: last September, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) approved an unprecedented $9.6bn to reconstruct the island’s energy system and is currently deciding how the money should be spent. “Rooftop solar could supply all of Puerto Rico’s energy needs. It’s viable, sustainable and more reliable than the current centralized system that the energy industry and authorities want to rebuild,” said Ruth Santiago, lawyer and environmental policy expert who contributed to Queremos Sol. “We need the Biden administration to act. This is a critical time, a lot is at stake.” A move to renewables – but how fast? Puerto Rico is a tropical Caribbean archipelago and US territory located a thousand miles or so south-east of Miami. The main island is mostly mountains surrounded by narrow coastal plains where the majority of the 3 million habitants reside in towns and cities. Over the past two decades, Puerto Rico has been among three territories (along with Haiti and Myanmar) most affected by extreme weather such as storms, floods, heatwaves and droughts, according to the Germanwatch Climate Risk Index. In September 2017 hurricanes Irma and Maria made landfall two weeks apart and destroyed much of Puerto Rico’s electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure (including industrial wind farms), leading to the longest blackout in US history. About 3,000 people died in the aftermath as homes, businesses and healthcare facilities were left without power for months. Marrero was cut off for about 15 weeks, and recalls having to buy just enough food to last each day as she couldn’t afford a generator for the fridge or fan. In addition to increasingly frequent and intense catastrophic weather events, global heating is also causing slower changes such as rising sea levels and ocean warming that endanger the island’s infrastructure. But the climate crisis isn’t the only threat facing Puerto Rico: a 6.4 magnitude earthquake in January 2020 left two-thirds of residents without power, and significantly damaged the island’s two gas-fired power plants. In fact, much of the existing energy infrastructure (plants, transmitter towers, poles and cables) is in flood-prone areas or at risk of sea-level rise, storm surges and tsunamis, as well as strong winds and earthquake damage. It’s one reason why rooftop systems, not industrial farms, are proposed by Queremos Sol – as centralised renewable plants also rely on transmission and distribution lines. Rooftop solar relies on batteries and local distribution networks, which would be easier to fix if damaged. In addition, Puerto Rico lacks open land, so large-scale wind and solar farms would affect scarce agricultural lands and ecologically sensitive areas. It’s widely agreed that Puerto Rico’s energy system is in disarray. The publicly owned utility (Prepa), like Puerto Rico, is in bankruptcy and maintenance has been neglected for years. The latest spate of power cuts led to resignations at the top of Prepa, which is responsible for generating electricity, and angry public protests against Luma, the private US-Canadian consortium that took over transmission and distribution in June. What’s disputed is how quickly the island should move to renewables. Official documents show the government of Puerto Rico, Prepa and Luma want to spend most of the historic funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) on rebuilding the existing transmission system and new gas-fired plants, with only a fraction left over for renewables. Fema told the Guardian that Prepa and Luma have so far submitted 88 projects, but detailed work plans would be evaluated before final approval. Fernando Gil, the new chairman of Prepa’s board, told the Guardian that progress towards the legally binding renewable targets had been too slow, but denied vested interests were to blame. “We need to stabilize the system, generate more power and be proactive with maintenance while planning for renewables, but we have to be flexible … Gas is way cleaner and can be more efficient if combined with other fuels.” Yet Tomás Torres, the consumer representative on the board, said the utility should be investing in rooftop solar installation now. “Puerto Rico has the proper laws, regulations and funds to achieve energy transformation, it just has to be executed.” A Luma spokesperson said: “By key measures including reliability, customer service and safety, Puerto Rico has the worst electrical service in North America. It will take time and concerted effort to set it right.” As the battle for Puerto Rico’s energy future intensifies, for many ordinary people it’s a matter of life and death. Solar power ‘can save lives’ In Guayama, 72-year-old Margarita Velázquez was diagnosed with COPD, a chronic respiratory condition, a few years after the nearby coal plant opened in 2002. “I stopped being able to breathe. I remember the doctor asked me how long I’d been smoking for, but I’ve never smoked!” On bad days, when coal ash hovers in the air over the community, Velázquez finds it hard to stop wheezing and needs an electric-powered nebulizer machine to open up her airways. The anxiety of losing power has gone since she was selected for the rooftop project. “It’s given me some peace of mind,” she said. At the nearby plant, a huge pile of grey ash laden with toxic heavy metals is waiting to be shipped to Florida and Georgia for disposal. When the wind picks up, the ash scatters through the air. For years hundreds of thousands of tonnes were dumped in landfills, roads and fields, contaminating the air and drinking water sources of mostly low-income neighborhoods. The coal plant has cost lives. Public health researchers have found higher rates of several chronic conditions among communities near the plant, including respiratory illness, heart disease, allergies and skin complaints. The incidence of cancers increased by 65% in the decade after the plant opened, while the numbers of patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis have also risen, according to Dr Gerson Jiménez, director of the Guayama hospital where he has worked for more than four decades. Amid growing backlash, the coal ash must now be removed, but huge toxic deposits remain scattered across the island and now others face the same deadly consequences. “It’s now being sent to poor communities of colour on the mainland, who can expect to see an increase in the same lethal diseases in years to come,” said Jiménez. Puerto Rico’s energy reforms, passed in 2019 with bipartisan support, mandate phasing out coal by 2028 (the company’s 25-year contract ends in 2027), but advocates argue that rolling out rooftop solar could make the plant obsolete sooner and therefore save lives. José Vázquez, 76, Velázquez’s husband and a member of Guayama Community United for Your Health – a group campaigning for the plant’s closure, cleanup and compensation – said: “There are big politicians and big interests in this struggle. We are in the middle like ham in a sandwich.” Perhaps there is another way. Solar town Adjuntas is a small mountain town surrounded by lush forests in the central midwestern part of the island where the temperate climate provides relief from the steamy coasts. Here, the solar power movement dates back more than two decades to a grassroots environmental group called Casa Pueblo, which organized the community to kick out a mining company before embarking on a crusade to make the town energy independent. Since Maria, hundreds of rooftop and onsite solar systems have been installed at homes, emergency services and critical businesses around Adjuntas, known locally as Pueblo Solar (Solar Town). The initiative relies on locally trained volunteers, donations and grants from groups like the US non-profit Honnold Foundation, and includes vulnerable households, a nursing home, fire station, community radio station and selection of general stores which serve isolated neighbourhoods stranded after the hurricanes. At the town’s picturesque main square, all 25 businesses – including a pizzeria, a pharmacy and hardware store – have created a micro energy network with a social justice twist: savings from generating and sharing their own energy will help fund solar systems for low-income residents who are homebound or need to keep medication refrigerated. On the edge of town, José Hernández runs a minimart which Maria partially destroyed and left without power for six months. The hurricane triggered a mass exodus to the mainland of mostly working-age folks left unemployed or homeless, but Hernández, 33, decided to stay and rebuild. It has been hard to expand the business as frequent power cuts force him to close the store and also damage the fridges, which are costly to repair. But six months ago Hernández obtained a grant for solar panels, and then used his savings to buy the other equipment. Since then, he has had uninterrupted power and his electricity bill has fallen drastically, allowing him to hire an employee. “It’s given me a sense of tranquillity. It’s exciting, I can now expand and invest in my future.” At its heart, this is a social justice initiative seeking to democratise access to energy, according to Arturo Massol from Casa Pueblo. “It’s anti-poverty, locally driven development as we believe clean renewable energy is a right for everyone, not just the privileged few.” • This article was amended on 25 October 2021.

They’ve tried everything to achieve their goal, from making deliberately unlistenable albums, to – in the memorable case of the late Scott Walker – locking themselves in a monastery on the Isle of Wight. But few have attempted to bid farewell to mainstream pop stardom as prettily as Lorde does on her third album. It opens with a guitar picking a gentle, woozy-sounding figure. A flute glides beatifically by and Lorde offers a grim depiction of life as a teenager superstar – complete with “nightmares from the camera flash” – before apparently saying goodbye to all that: “alone on a windswept island”, she “won’t take the call if it’s the label or radio”. “If you’re looking for a saviour,” she adds, “that’s not me”, which would sound a little self-aggrandising had the world of online fandom not become so overheated that whenever a female pop star posts anything on social media, the responses are clogged up by stans calling them “mum”, “queen” and “goddess”. It’s a theme Solar Power frequently returns to. On the title track, she chucks her mobile in the sea. Oceanic Feeling depicts the “cherry black lipstick” that formed part of Lorde’s old image “gathering dust in a drawer”, while California dismisses the hedonism that Solar Power’s predecessor, 2017’s Melodrama, positively revelled in: “goodbye to all the bottles, all the models … it’s all just a dream, I want to wake up.” Clearly Lorde has been on quite a journey in the eight years since her debut album, although it would be more shocking if she hadn’t: she was, after all, only 16 when she released Pure Heroine, with its global No 1 hit single Royals. The surprise is that her journey turned out to be a round trip. Pure Heroine painted her home in New Zealand as impossibly remote, filled with “cities you’ll never see onscreen”. So does Solar Power, but rather than a source of frustration, it depicts New Zealand’s remoteness as an asset: a place you can escape celebrity in favour of a life that, as far as can be gathered, consists largely of smoking weed and sunbathing. To which the obvious response might be: well, that’s easy for you to say. Skinning up on a beach all day is doubtless better than working, but it’s not really an option if you’re not absolutely minted. To her credit, Lorde seems to realise that, undercutting her sermonising with a selection of metaphorical cocked eyebrows and sly looks to camera: “I’m kinda like a prettier Jesus”, “maybe I’m just stoned”. There’s a knowing wink about the title of Secrets from a Girl (Who’s Seen It All); the distinct sense that she knows the guy she mocks in Dominoes – forgoing cocaine for yoga and wellness – doesn’t seem a million miles removed from her. She draws from an eclectic range of musical inspirations – Primal Scream kindly declined to call their lawyers over the title track’s obvious resemblance to their single Loaded, and she’s presumably the first pop star in history to suggest Robbie Williams’ Rock DJ as a big influence – but what Solar Power really recalls, at least spiritually, is the rash of albums by artists who followed the example of Steve Winwood’s band Traffic, and uncoupled themselves from the dizzying whirl of mid-60s pop to move to Berkshire or Wales or Scotland in order to get it together in the country. It shares their back-to-nature-ethos; their mood of recumbent contentment; their tendency to deal in homespun wisdom. The cover might depict its author skipping along the sand with her bum out rather than wrangling a sheep on a muddy farm, but there’s not a huge distance between Lorde counselling her fans to spend time “with the people who raised you” and protesting the constant online judgment that accompanies modern fame – “I don’t miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head” – and Paul McCartney hymning the pleasures of home cooking and complaining about “too many people preaching practices” on 1971’s Ram. It also shares those old albums’ retreat from the currently-hip sound of contemporary pop in favour of something earthier. There are electronics on Solar Power, but its main instrument is guitar, usually acoustic. There are plenty of lovely melodies, but it noticeably declines to deal in the primary currency of latterday pop, the banger, in favour of understatement. Bucking another current pop trend, it’s an album clearly designed to be listened to in full, rather than a collection of tracks from which to select additions to a playlist. It’s an approach that, at its worst, yields songs that sound undernourished – Fallen Fruit and Dominoes – but elsewhere it delivers, albeit gently: Stoned at the Nail Salon’s softly yearning power; the delicate shuffle of Secrets from a Girl (Who’s Seen It All). There is a chance Solar Power might capture a widespread mood in the same way that Pure Heroine’s highlighting of the gulf between pop’s projection of glamour and teenage life did in 2013. There’s currently talk about the Great Resignation, a post-pandemic reconsideration of the work-life balance that’s apparently led to millions of Americans quitting their jobs every month. Then again, the relatively underwhelming commercial performance of its singles thus far suggests not. Listening to Solar Power, you wonder whether its author wouldn’t actually prefer the latter response to the former. This week Alexis listened to The Five Stairsteps – Dear Prudence I’d never heard this before a friend posted it on social media: a glorious, delicate 1970 soul reimagining of the Beatles’ song."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2021/aug/23/solar-power-in-australia-outstrips-coal-fired-electricity-for-first-time","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-23T02:40:54Z","webTitle":"Solar power in Australia outstrips coal-fired electricity for first time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/aug/23/solar-power-in-australia-outstrips-coal-fired-electricity-for-first-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2021/aug/23/solar-power-in-australia-outstrips-coal-fired-electricity-for-first-time","fields":{"headline":"Solar power in Australia outstrips coal-fired electricity for first time","bodyText":"The national electricity market reached a new milestone on Sunday, with solar power outstripping energy generation from coal for the first time since the market was set up two decades ago. The crossover point lasted for only a few minutes, as low demand and sunny skies on Sunday meant the contribution from coal dropped to a record low of 9,315MW just after noon, while solar provided the dominant share with 9,427MW. Dylan McConnell, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne’s climate and energy college, said that for a brief moment renewable energy represented 57% of national electricity generation. “This is what I unofficially call ‘record season’,” McConnell said. “It’s actually still pretty early in the season [to get these numbers] but in spring or the shoulder seasons you have the combination of low demand, because there’s no heating or cooling, and then nice weather on the weekend. “Those factors combine, and you get these giant shares of renewable energy that generally push out coal.” While McConnell said it was only “fleeting” and that “Australia was a long way from peak renewable energy”, energy prices also went negative on Sunday from 8.30am through to 5pm. Though the exact price differed by jurisdiction, it means producers were getting paid to consume, or energy producers were paying to keep running. Unlike more nimble solar and wind producers, coal generators are particularly hurt when prices turn negative. The costs associated with shutting down and restarting coal generators are prohibitive, meaning operators will choose to keep running even at a loss. According to datalogger NEMlog, South Australia had 100% of its energy needs met by wind and solar while Victoria would have met 102% of state demand had operators not been forced to switch off during the period of negative prices. Energy analyst Simon Holmes à Court said the overall proportion of renewable energy – solar, wind and hydro – would have been higher in the energy mix but wind producers chose to shut down to avoid the price hit. “There was a significant amount of curtailment,” he said. “What it shows is that there’s already more renewables that could have gone into the grid if the coal plants were more flexible and transmission was upgraded.” The development coincides with calls from the Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) – an 18-member body that advocates for investors in large-scale renewable energy projects – for financial reforms to “align Australia with international markets” and “unlock” new investment. Modelling conducted for the group by Rennie Partners found that Australia needs 51GW of renewable energy generation by 2042 if it is to meet its commitments under the Paris Climate Change agreement but that only 3GW of new wind and solar projects have been committed, leaving a 48GW shortfall. Simon Corbell, the chief executive of CEIG, said governments and regulators should bring Australia’s investment guidelines into line with global markets. “Clean energy investors currently face significant risks in the NEM, which is holding back the capital needed,’’ Corbell said. “To unlock an investment pipeline worth $70bn we need effective market reforms and policy certainty, which could also save up to $7bn in capital costs, or up to 10% of the cost of Australia’s clean energy transition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/aug/21/lorde-solar-power-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-08-21T13:00:05Z","webTitle":"Lorde: Solar Power review – she has earned her wistful, floaty record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/aug/21/lorde-solar-power-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/aug/21/lorde-solar-power-review","fields":{"headline":"Lorde: Solar Power review – she has earned her wistful, floaty record","bodyText":"Sometimes, Solar Power – Lorde’s long-awaited third album – feels like the polar opposite of her second, 2017’s Melodrama: it is filled with calm, sun-kissed serenity. Over 12 outdoorsy but often inward-looking tracks, the 24-year-old New Zealand pop sensation seems to bid adieu to the toxic and the fraught, the garish and the busy. If the mood of the album’s title track – and its eye-catching video, in which dancers gyrate cultishly around Lorde’s “prettier Jesus” – felt tremendously beach-ready, the rest of Solar Power is dappled with late-afternoon shade.

But the album is not much poorer for this equanimity, with its former teen star, elevated to instant mega-fame in the 2010s, pondering past lives, present happiness and future uncertainty with some deft writing, a gauzy feel and the odd Beatles melody. The drums are a kit, not a program; there are susurrations and New York sirens lurking within the production, lending depth and breadth. Even on her debut single, the 2013 hit Royals, Lorde contrasted her reality with the luxe American tropes being disseminated by pop and hip-hop. You might cast Solar Power as a deeply New Zealand album: full of cicadas, NZ musicians such as the wonderful Marlon Williams on backing vocals, and references to Bulli Point, a promontory offering a seven-metre jump into a lake; an album that gently castigates generations past for the mess they left (Fallen Fruit). Between Melodrama and the start of Solar Power, Lorde travelled to Antarctica, an emotional “palate-cleanser” that brought home the vast beauty of the natural world – and the reality of the climate emergency. Leader of a New Regime is just one song that quietly ponders escape when the apocalypse comes. “Wearing SPF 3000 for the ultraviolet rays/ Made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes,” she sings. The album will not be released on CD, but as a more eco-conscious Music Box format, which consists of a download, bonus tracks and exclusive content. If Solar Power feels antipodean, it does exist in tension with New York and Los Angeles. Laurel Canyon feels, spiritually, not far away from Lorde’s idyll, and the New Zealander’s most recent single, Stoned at the Nail Salon, has a serious melodic affinity with Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman Like Me to Have – But I Have It by Lana Del Rey, another student of the canyon canon. The link is producer Jack Antonoff, who should have policed such a tune-bleed between clients. It raises the question: is this quieter, more contemplative Lorde album a reflection of where the singer is now, and bang on-trend? Or does it cast her as something less than a trailblazer, after more low-key albums by Del Rey and Lorde’s friend Taylor Swift, to name but two? A clutch of songs here question lifestyles that Lorde seems to want to leave behind. Secrets From a Girl (Who’s Seen It All) hugs her old self, wondering where a decade went. Having sad-pop queen Robyn play a tour guide to emotional pain on the song’s coda is just one of this album’s lovelier touches. Although Solar Power was part-written and recorded in the US with Antonoff and the Grammy-winning Malay, who also worked on Melodrama, a track called California enumerates the ways in which Lorde has moved on from LA’s sensory overload – tequila is now a trigger. A more mischievous song, Mood Ring, fondly pillories a “Pluto in Scorpio” generation of young women unsure of what they feel, looking to their mood rings for clues and to crystals for succour. For an artist known previously for her cool grasp of drama, these songs are consolatory. Despite being “born in the year of OxyContin/ Teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash”, no one is being appointed as a conservator over this young female singer’s affairs. Solar Power glows with love songs – to her departed dog (Big Star), to her family (Oceanic Feeling) and to her current partner. Although this last track has a slightly alarming undertone – “You felled me clean as a pine,” she sings on The Man With the Axe – these are photovoltaic fairy lights illuminating a path to wellbeing; a state overshadowed by the end of days, but a good place nonetheless. Lorde has earned her wistful, floaty record, even if she’s behind the curve. Another question lingers: when Lorde sings “it’s time to cool it down, wherever that leads”, on Stoned at the Nail Salon, what does she mean? The Man With the Axe ponders her “fistful of tunes that it’s painful to play”; how “falling apart for the princess of Norway” can sometimes feel rote. The album ends with what might be a very quiet cliffhanger. Lorde is building a pyre on the beach, her “enlightenment” a work in progress. “I’ll know when it’s time to take off my robes and step into the choir,” she sings, perhaps beginning to contemplate an incarnation after this one."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2023/mar/31/solar-power-viable-rainy-england-why-not-better-plans-in-place","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-31T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Solar is now viable even in rainy climes – so why aren’t we making hay?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/mar/31/solar-power-viable-rainy-england-why-not-better-plans-in-place","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2023/mar/31/solar-power-viable-rainy-england-why-not-better-plans-in-place","fields":{"headline":"Solar is now viable even in rainy climes – so why aren’t we making hay?","bodyText":"It may seem unlikely with the dark, rainy skies in many parts over the last month, but solar power is now the cheapest way of generating electricity, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 30 years solar has gone from the most expensive and an unlikely candidate to help save us from the climate crisis to a frontrunner. Among its great advantages is that panels mostly take only a day to install, the electricity can also provide hot water and the surplus can be stored in a battery for later use. With no moving parts maintenance is minimal. For householders who can afford to have panels fitted to existing houses, the saving in heating and lighting bills has been enormous, particularly in the last year following the invasion of Ukraine. It also increased the value of their properties. It therefore remains a puzzle why in England the government is reluctant to require solar panels to be fitted on suitable new homes from 2025 under its “future homes standard”, although final decisions are still awaited. The extra cost for housebuilders would be small and the potential savings for homeowners enormous, also considerably reducing the UK’s need for large new power stations.

With sloping roofs clad in thousands of overlapping tiles, the buildings could be mistaken for the world’s most architecturally advanced circus tent. They are, in fact, part of Google’s new Bay View campus, which is due to welcome employees this year – pandemic allowing – and is situated a few miles east of its existing HQ campus in Mountain View. The firm says the finished buildings will have 90,000 tiles which form a “solar skin” roof, which its designers have named “dragonscale” and estimate will generate almost 7 megawatts of power, or 40% of the electricity needs of the campus. It sees this as part of its efforts to hit the pledge made by CEO Sundar Pichai that Google will run every data center and campus on carbon-free energy by 2030. Corporations have never been under more pressure to follow through and make meaningful progress on carbon emissions from regulators and amid greater scrutiny around “greenwashing” from environmentalists – and their own employees. Demand for low-emission offices is larger than it ever has been, according to several US architects the Guardian spoke to. That’s especially true in California, where manifestations of the climate crisis are obvious: hotter summers, drought and an annual wildfire season. “Buildings are awful for the environment,” said Eric Corey Freed, the sustainability director at architecture firm CannonDesign. “If we’re going to solve climate change, we have to fix our buildings.” In the US, buildings consumed around 40% of the country’s electricity in 2020, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration, and are also one of the planet’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gasses, accounting for 37% of the world’s energy-related CO2 emissions. That’s not including all the emissions from refrigerants – chemicals that maintain air conditioning systems and refrigerators – which have a global warming potential that’s hundreds to thousands of times higher than carbon dioxide. Designers must consider the “operational carbon” of running the building and the “embodied carbon” of creating it, such as the emissions from producing materials, constructing the project and transporting waste offsite. Freed is optimistic, however, because the costs of being sustainable are coming down. “Considering solar [panels] for your campus or your building is so much less expensive than it used to be,” added Maria Papiez, the director of sustainable design for EwingCole. “That really was only for the Googles in the past, who had the dollars to do that. And now, it’s the least expensive form of electricity in some places.” As well as the “dragonscale” solar panels, Google’s new campus also plans to have a geothermal battery underground where it will store heat to warm the building, Asim Tahir, the tech giant’s lead on its sustainable energy strategy, told Grist. The idea behind all the Bay View innovations is “to kickstart this market in the US by showing it can be done”, Tahir said. Google has been working on the project with architecture firms Heatherwick Studio and Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) as well as Switzerland-based company SunStyle, which has created arrays of solar panels on multiple buildings in Europe and wants to expand in the US. “I really do like the idea of a tipping point,” said Papiez of EwingCole. “Once we get enough critical mass, there’s this opportunity to really tip in the right direction.” Chris Chatto, a principal at architecture firm ZGF who has focused on sustainability for the past 15 years, says that he has seen a substantial uptick in clients requesting sustainable buildings. “Honestly, the amount of conversations I’ve had in the last three to six months is probably the same amount that I’ve had in the last few years,” he said. ZGF is currently working with Microsoft, which has also made major goals to cut down carbon emissions. “I think in some ways”, he added, “we’ve probably seen more consistent signals and interest from the tech industry on the west coast.” Architect Anthony Brower, a Leed fellow and director of sustainability at architecture firm Gensler has seen this too, beyond just the big tech giants. “Some clients have very general requests,” he said, “They want to see sustainability integrated into their work. Other clients are getting very specific about exactly what they want in a very sophisticated manner.” Recruitment and regulations Aside from contributing to global climate goals, sustainable architecture has increasingly become a recruitment strategy, specifically when competing for Gen-Z workers who deeply care about the climate and want to work for a company that embodies their values. Even Pichai, Google’s CEO, said that shifting to renewables will help the company attract employees. “If you don’t do this correctly, you won’t be able to attract talent,” Pichai told Bloomberg. “When I look at the younger generation, people who are teenagers now, I can’t see them making the choice to work for a company which they feel is polluting.” Freed agrees, noting that employees often enjoy the experience of being in a sustainable building more than a traditional office, even if they don’t know why, in part because sustainable spaces are often filled with light and natural materials. As Freed put it, “The spaces are just better to be in.” But this movement isn’t just about recruiting or doing something ethical. As laws and building codes are updated, companies face mounting pressure to put resources behind sustainable projects. By 2030, California has a goal to bring its greenhouse gas emissions 40% below 1990 levels. Corporations also don’t want to be penalized for refusing to comply with potentially more stringent laws down the line. “There are carbon emission laws where building owners are being required to essentially increase their carbon efficiency … and if they don’t, they’re being fined,” said Chatto, the architect at ZGF. These signals are changing how investors think about their buildings. “At least some of our clients are recognizing they’re going to hold on to the building for 10 years. Then when they want to sell and recoup and make a profit on their investment, it could be a very, very different world 10 years from now,” he said. One of California’s recent building laws may incentivize companies to move away from some of the most polluting building materials. In July, the state gave the green light to mass timber buildings up to 18 stories high. Mass timber – smaller pieces of wood fused into strong slabs – is heralded as a more sustainable alternative to steel and concrete, and has been widely used in Europe for two decades already. Before the code update, California limited mass timber structures for commercial use to six stories, making it impossible for many projects to use. Mass timber presents an exciting prospect in California. The material has a naturally lower carbon footprint than concrete and steel, and even sequesters carbon, pulling it out of the atmosphere, like trees, to turn a building into a carbon sink. California’s first multi-story, fully mass timber building, 1 De Haro, developed by SKS Partners and designed by Perkins&amp;Will, was recently completed in San Francisco. With floor-to-ceiling glass windows paired with raw wood beams and ceilings, the space looks warm yet pristine. The project is zoned to be part office, part space for light manufacturing. With its pledge to become carbon free, Google is attempting a bold feat. The goal is a steep one, especially since it’s not only responsible for the output of its campuses, but massive data centers housing its servers. It’s worth noting that Google’s plan does not account for the company’s scope 3 emissions – emissions that tie back to the company, but that the company may not control. These include the manufacturing, production materials, and transport of Chromebooks and Pixel, according to Grist. Though this isn’t foul play, it’s a shortcoming of the net-zero metric and applies to companies across the board. To move the needle, architects continue to push sustainable workplaces as tools for change. “It’s been an exciting time to be in sustainability”, Freed said, “to see these pressures mounting, and companies now not only have to take it seriously, they want to, because they’re seeing these overarching trends.” • This article was amended on 21 January 2022 to refer to 7 megawatts of power, not energy."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/01/uk-efforts-to-deal-with-energy-crisis-raise-risk-of-missing-net-zero-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-01T00:01:18Z","webTitle":"UK efforts to deal with energy crisis ‘raise risk of missing net zero target’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/01/uk-efforts-to-deal-with-energy-crisis-raise-risk-of-missing-net-zero-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/01/uk-efforts-to-deal-with-energy-crisis-raise-risk-of-missing-net-zero-target","fields":{"headline":"UK efforts to deal with energy crisis ‘raise risk of missing net zero target’","bodyText":"Ministers’ efforts to tackle the energy bills crisis have left the UK at risk of missing a key target to source green power and are threatening the country’s net zero goal, the government spending watchdog has said. The government said in 2021 it wanted all electricity to be generated from low-carbon sources by 2035, a pillar in the plan to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. However, the National Audit Office (NAO) warned on Wednesday that the energy crisis which began in late 2021 and was exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, has meant the government has made little progress in producing a “long-term delivery plan” to boost clean energy sources. The NAO warned that “the absence of a clear plan and the perception that there could be changes in government policies could deter external investors from providing funds for new infrastructure or lead them to increase the rates of return they require, ultimately increasing costs for energy consumers”. Emissions related to UK power generation have fallen by 73% since 1990 with increases in wind and solar power and the phasing out of coal power stations reducing the impact on the environment. However, about 40% of the UK’s electricity is still generated from gas and the owners of gas-fired power plants are still picking up huge subsidies to keep the lights on when wind and solar power drop out owing to weather conditions. Electricity demand is predicted to increase by as much as 60% by 2035 as vehicles and heating are switched from fossil fuels to electricity. The UK has set a target of 2035 for a ban on the installation of new gas boilers, although efforts to encourage households to seek low-carbon alternatives have so far stalled. The government stepped in late last year to subsidise energy bills amid fears that the rise in wholesale gas prices would leave many households and businesses unable to afford bills. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “It is understandable that [the government] has focused on dealing with the immediate energy crisis over the past 12 months. But one consequence of this is that it lacks a delivery plan for decarbonising power by 2035, which is the backbone of its broader net zero ambition.” He added that the longer it took for a plan to be drawn up, “the higher the risk that it does not achieve its ambitions, or it does so at a greater than necessary cost to taxpayers and consumers”. Meg Hillier MP, chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The department for energy security and net zero [DESNZ] does not have a delivery plan for decarbonising electricity. While DESNZ has understandably been focusing on its immediate response to the energy crisis, I’m disappointed by its slow progress and lack of focus on the long-term. Without a delivery plan, it is unclear whether DESNZ’s targets are achievable.” The government has estimated that £280bn to £400bn of investment is needed to decarbonise the power sector, excluding the cost of researching new technologies and constructing new networks. Ministers are also under pressure to respond to Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which has made the US more attractive to international investors looking to fund green energy projects. A DESNZ spokesperson said: “Since the energy crisis caused by [Vladimir] Putin’s illegal invasion our focus has been on delivering essential cost of living support, including paying half a typical household’s energy bills this winter, because this is the primary focus for families across the country. “At the same time, the UK is decarbonising faster than any other G7 country … Our targets are ambitious, however we haven’t taken our foot off the pedal and our commitment to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system by 2035 remains resolute.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-24T20:00:14Z","webTitle":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand solar energy manufacturing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/25/australia-has-a-golden-opportunity-to-expand-solar-energy-manufacturing","fields":{"headline":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand solar energy manufacturing","bodyText":"Australia has a golden opportunity to expand its solar energy manufacturing capacity as the industry booms and nations scramble to cut their over-dependence on China, a report by the Australian Australian PV Institute Institute says. The country is installing 4GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity a year already but meeting just 3% of that from a local supplier, Adelaide’s Tindo Solar. That annual installation tally, though, is predicted to triple by 2050, particularly if Australia becomes a major supplier of hydrogen produced by renewable energy for export. “We have a pressing need, we have the natural resources and we have a very sizeable market,” the report said. “Unless Australia gains control over the most strategic parts of the PV value chain, the development of any ‘green’ export market will be completely dependent on foreign powers.” Renate Egan, the APVI secretary and head of the Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics, said China would remain an important supplier of panels to Australia but it was important to diversify supply, including by using local firms. “You can liken it to Europe’s reliance on gas from Russia,” Egan said, referring to shortages and soaring gas prices after Moscow imposed export curbs in retaliation to sanctions for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The world is relying increasingly on solar energy generation for the energy transition [from fossil fuels],” she said. “They’re becoming aware of the risks … in that over 90% of the tech comes from China.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Covid pandemic helped spur demands for more local manufacturing capability when Australia struggled to secure supplies of vaccines and medical equipment. Ongoing supply chain disruptions, particularly as China maintains its Covid-zero policies, have given added impetus to calls for more domestic production capability. A spokesperson for the industry and science minister, Ed Husic, said solar was “clearly going to be a big part of Australia’s renewable energy future”. “The Albanese government will deliver dedicated support through Powering Australia – a $3bn co-investment stream as part of the National Reconstruction Fund,” he said. “A big part of its focus will be on renewables component manufacturing and low-emissions technologies, including production of batteries and solar panels. “By 2030, the government aims to have 82% renewables in the national electricity market. To achieve that, we will need to produce much more solar capacity on shore as well as having a diversity in our international supply chains.” The present trade tensions between Australia and China exacerbated “the potential threat to supply restrictions or sudden price changes”, the APVI paper said. “Adding to this risk is the growing concern over the possible use of forced labour in parts of China, where much of the silicon, wafers and steel used in PV components are produced,” it said. Egan said Australian technology was used in 90% of PV panels made today, underscoring the country’s scientific pedigree in the field. The country wouldn’t need to make all of the components in modules but could specialise. Local firms could make glass, aluminium frames, polymers or the electronics such as inverters, while leaving production of polysilicon – a key raw material – to others. “I think it’s at the top end of silicon refining and then module assembly,” Egan said. “We need to be making some smart decisions and deploying at scale.” The paper cited existing suppliers including Selectronic – one of the world’s oldest makers of inverters. SunDrive is a firm considering commercial-size silicon-based solar cell fabrication in Australia, while 5B is aiming at fast low-cost PV deployment to supply some of the multi-gigawatt-sized solar farms planned for northern Australia. “To succeed on a global scale, these emerging companies would benefit from market certainty and a coordinated effort to reach scale,” the paper said. Customers could include Sun Cable, a venture supported by billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest, that aims to build a 12,000-hectare solar precinct in the Northern Territory with 17-20GW capacity and 36-42GW-hours of energy storage. Forrest’s Fortescue group said last week it was planning 2-3GW of renewable energy using solar and wind plants between 2024-28. It was also working to identify and resolve bottlenecks in the global supply of decarbonisation technologies and was building the world’s largest electrolyser facility for the production of hydrogen in Gladstone as part of that effort."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/jul/02/lorde-review-a-magnificent-night-out-alexandra-palace-london-solar-power-marlon-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-02T13:00:47Z","webTitle":"Lorde review – a magnificent night out","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jul/02/lorde-review-a-magnificent-night-out-alexandra-palace-london-solar-power-marlon-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/jul/02/lorde-review-a-magnificent-night-out-alexandra-palace-london-solar-power-marlon-williams","fields":{"headline":"Lorde review – a magnificent night out","bodyText":"“E aua,” sings Lorde intently, eyes scrunched shut, a familiar melody playing beneath, “Kohore ana pea aku mata.” This is her single Stoned at the Nail Salon – one of the most thoughtful and moving cuts from her 2021 album Solar Power – as many people will not have heard it before: sung in Te Reo Māori, the indigenous language of Aotearoa (latterly, New Zealand). Duetting alongside her countryman and support act Marlon Williams, this is the first time Lorde has performed the track, titled Mata Kohore, live. And it’s just one of a series of shiver-inducing moments in a set replete with emotion. Tonight’s sold-out Alexandra Palace date marks the very end of Lorde’s UK tour. This time last week, she played the same song – in English – at Glastonbury, flanked by Arlo Parks and Clairo. In this vaulted greenhouse of a north London venue where the midsummer evening light gradually fades into dusk, there is a palpable sense of a performer reaching some kind of sunny upland. But it’s a hard-won victory. There are angry tears, with Lorde speaking passionately about how the recent US supreme court reversal of women’s right to choose had affected her both mentally and physically. The singer urges her fans to let it all out, too. “There is no better public weeping spot than a Lorde gig,” she notes. Wrestling with plenty of “hard feelings” (as one of her song titles puts it), she alchemically processes them into joy tonight – often while sitting atop a narrow staircase. The mood is buoyant, with people bawling the songs back to Lorde and pogo-ing en masse to the pummelling, club-adjacent cuts. It’s a magnificent night out, themed visually around her most recent album, but one that contains just a nanosecond or two of disquiet. Mata Kohore formed part of a Te Reo Māori EP of Solar Power songs released last September, with proceeds going to two New Zealand charities. At the time of release, a debate ensued among Māori language activists as to whether Lorde’s was a tokenistic act or a useful fillip to the language. Even as the hairs stand up on your arms as she and Williams sing it, you wonder whether that very response might be inadvertently biased, romanticising a misappropriation of a cultural practice. Writing in the Guardian, however, Morgan Godfery (Te Pahipoto, Sāmoa), senior lecturer at the University of Otago, defended Lorde’s foray into Te Reo Māori as “a public good”, one made possible by many respected guardians of the language who assisted in the translations. Then there is the matter of this tour’s inventive stage set. It’s a superb concept – a blond wood sundial, echoing the sun theme – that, combined with dazzling lighting, and a band and backing singers in frequent motion, recalls David Byrne’s celebrated no-cables, no-wires American Utopia show. But it also sometimes looks like a physics demonstration about to go wrong. Lorde’s ladder-like staircase is balanced on a large disc that acts like a fulcrum. The disc also doubles as a sun, a screen behind which Lorde can get changed in silhouette. Reversed, it’s a hollow bower in which she can sit. Mostly, though, the effect is that of an MDF seesaw threatening to tip over – as though anyone needed a little extra heart-in-mouth feeling on top of that generated by this artist’s bravura set. Lacking the pounding dance beats of her previous work (2017’s Melodrama) and doubling down on themes of retreat, reassessment and environmental doom, Lorde’s third album – on its release last year – sounded suspiciously like a letter of resignation from pop. On tracks such as California, relayed intensely tonight, the singer bids goodbye to the hard-partying pop star lifestyle, characterising the entire state as a borderline abusive partner. Elsewhere, triggered by the smell of tequila, she looks askance at “supermodels all dancing round a pharoah’s tomb”; she won’t answer the phone “if it’s the label or the radio”. On Oceanic Feeling she yearns for enlightenment and looks forward to a time when she might “take off my robes and step into the choir”. On Stoned at the Nail Salon, there’s a wishbone hanging in her kitchen “just in case I wake up and realise I’ve chosen wrong”. But the no-shoes, no-news mood of the Solar Power album is thrown into sharp relief by its delivery tonight. Previously, Lorde performed more statically, draped in robe-like garments, her microphone stand acting as her only prop. She has spoken in interviews about her anxiety and frequent states of overwhelm; in one of many speeches from the stage, she recalls wearing black all the time as a kind of “armour”. Now, having spent time reassessing – and at the gym – she seems to have made her peace with pop stardom. She plays her most painful song – Writer in the Dark – to honour her distress at the Roe v Wade reversal, but elsewhere, Lorde is a blur of movement, lashing out with an arm on the beat, jumping up and down in place, sweating. She thanks her fans for being there for “all the versions of me”, and reassures us that “I will always be here for all the versions of you”.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) said that government spending on clean energy in response to the crisis would mark a “historic turning point” in the transition away from fossil fuels, in its annual report on global energy. The invasion of Ukraine has prompted an energy crisis around the world, with global gas prices initially surging. The crisis has caused steep inflation that has made households poorer around the world. Governments have been scrambling to find other sources of energy. Some analysts have questioned whether fears over energy security could lead to the use of fossil fuels for longer, slowing the world’s race to net zero carbon emissions. Some countries – including the US and the UK under previous prime minister Liz Truss – have pledged to encourage fossil fuel extraction to try to ease prices. However, Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director and one of the world’s most influential energy economists, said the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion “is in fact going to accelerate the clean energy transition”. The IEA said planned investments in green energy in response to the crisis meant that – for the first time – government policies would lead to demand for polluting fossil fuels peaking this decade. The agency cited notable contributions from the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU’s emissions reduction package, and actions by Japan, South Korea, China and India. Under the new plans investment in low-carbon energy such as solar, wind and nuclear power will rise to $2tn (£1.7tn) a year by 2030, an increase of more than 50% from today. However, annual clean energy investment would have to reach $4tn by 2030 to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a figure that illustrates the scale of the challenge facing governments around the world. The IEA analysis showed that current government policies would still lead to global temperatures rising by 2.5C, which would have catastrophic climate impacts. That would be far above the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The 1.5C target, agreed at the Paris climate conference, would prevent the worst effects of climate breakdown. The analysis adds to a consensus among scientists that governments are not doing enough to prevent climate disaster. A separate UN study, published on Wednesday, also found that government pledges so far to cut emissions will lead to 2.5C of heating. The wave of clean energy investment will also cost Russia $1tn in lost fossil fuel revenues by 2030 compared with before the invasion, Birol said. Russia, previously the world’s largest exporter of fossil fuels, would have a “much diminished role in international energy affairs” as the world’s reliance on burning methane gas for power falls, he added. “The golden age of gas is approaching the end,” Birol said. Birol said the crisis had not changed the IEA’s assessment, first published last year, that all new fossil fuel projects should stop immediately in order for the world to hit net zero emissions by 2050. New oil and gas extraction projects “will jeopardise our climate goals”, he said. He also dismissed criticism from some climate deniers that spending on clean energy had contributed to higher energy prices, saying that argument was “hiding who sparked the energy crisis, which is Russia”. The IEA found that higher shares of renewable energy were correlated with lower electricity prices. “None of the government leaders complained about too much clean energy,” Birol said. “They complain that they don’t have enough clean energy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-15T18:11:38Z","webTitle":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/15/budget-2023-insulation-fuel-duty-uk-net-zero-carbon-goals","fields":{"headline":"Budget does little to meet UK’s net zero carbon goals, say campaigners","bodyText":"The government’s latest budget will do little to meet the UK’s net zero carbon goals, missed opportunities to create a green economy, and would saddle households with high energy bills driven by fossil fuel prices, green campaigners and experts have said. Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, was a self-styled “green Tory” as a backbencher, and in his speech gave a nod towards the UK’s green ambitions with a boost for nuclear power and for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. But missing from the budget was any hint of the hoped-for focus on home insulation, any strengthening of the windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, or removal of the barriers to onshore windfarms. Instead, the continuing freeze on fuel duty will benefit drivers of fuel-guzzling SUVs, and would leave the UK on the starting blocks while other countries – including the US, the EU and China – are racing ahead in creating green jobs, analysts said. Luke Murphy, associate director for energy and climate at the IPPR thinktank, said: “There is a global race to the top in reaching net zero, and the UK now risks falling seriously behind our competitors. The government needs to learn the lessons from the US and Europe, ramp up public investment, and bring forward a green industrial strategy, safeguarding our economy and environment for the future.” Hunt repeated his mantra of four Es for the UK’s future investment – enterprise, education, employment and everywhere. Josh Burke, senior policy fellow at the Grantham Research Institute, part of the London School of Economics, said: “This budget has failed to deliver a long-term, economy-wide investment plan to accelerate the transition to sustainable and resilient growth. The two Es missing from the industrial strategy are the environment and energy.” Ami McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said the focus on small nuclear plants, called small modular reactors, and CCS, both early-stage technologies, missed out far more realistic opportunities to pursue low-carbon power. “This misguided budget shows the stranglehold fossil fuel and nuclear lobbies have on this government. Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?” she asked. “Squandering taxpayers’ money on nuclear reactors that don’t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.” Hunt announced no new spending on home insulation, and did not bring forward spending on energy efficiency allocated for 2025, despite clear research showing that insulation can keep people’s homes warmer amid high energy bills, and calls from the government’s own statutory climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee, to prioritise insulation. Ross Matthewman, head of policy and campaigns at the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, said: “We are disappointed that the chancellor appears to be taking his foot off the pedal. By failing to bring forward planned spending on energy efficiency measures, he has missed a golden opportunity to both reduce energy bills and decarbonise the housing sector.” Transport policy was another missed opportunity, added Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at the New Economics Foundation. Drivers of larger cars are the biggest winners from the continuing freeze on fuel duty, while people on lower incomes are more likely to use lower-carbon public transport. “The government is continuing to subsidise polluting travel and disproportionately benefiting higher earners, with the 13th freeze on fuel duty in a row,” said Stirling. After the budget announcement, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, told MPs he was “busting a gut” to get solar power on rooftops, including those of large buildings such as warehouses. He told the environmental audit committee he was working to remove the requirement for planning permission for solar installations above 1MW, which was inhibiting installations on the roofs of commercial buildings. But he indicated he would not mandate solar power on the rooftops of new houses, as some MPs urged him to do. He said the government would require, in its forthcoming future homes standard, that new homes must produce 75% less carbon dioxide than homes built in 2013, but that ministers would leave up to housebuilders how this was achieved, because mandating particular technologies would “reduce innovation”, he claimed. “There is more than one way to skin a cat,” he told MPs. “The hesitation is over saying ‘this is the only thing you can put in’.” Shapps also promised a far greater green push to come, after the budget. The government is obliged by a high court ruling last year to publish by the end of this month clear plans on how to reach the net zero target. A response to the review of the net zero target by Chris Skidmore, published early this year, will come out at the same time. The announcement, due in a fortnight, will contain plans to boost hydrogen, wind power, solar energy and heat pumps, according to Shapps. “There will be much more I can say then,” he told MPs."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/05/how-one-solar-farm-is-serving-its-local-community-well","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T17:08:27Z","webTitle":"How one solar farm is serving its local community well | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/05/how-one-solar-farm-is-serving-its-local-community-well","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/05/how-one-solar-farm-is-serving-its-local-community-well","fields":{"headline":"How one solar farm is serving its local community well","bodyText":"Barbara Chillman writes from Ramsden in Oxfordshire to say that opposing solar farms need not be nimbyism (Letters, 1 September).

The impact of coronavirus lockdowns on the energy industry led carbon emissions to plummet by 6% on the year before, the sharpest decline since 1945, according to BP’s annual review of the energy sector. But the report says the impact of Covid on carbon emissions needs to be replicated every year for the next three decades if governments hope to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “Yes, they were the biggest falls seen for 75 years,” said Spencer Dale, BP’s chief economist. “But they occurred against the backdrop of a global pandemic and the largest economic recession in postwar history. The challenge is to reduce emissions without causing massive disruption and damage to everyday lives and livelihoods.” The warning echoes a report from the International Energy Agency last month which predicted that the world’s demand for oil would bounce back by 5.4m barrels a day this year, one of the fastest climbs on record, and rebound to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022. BP’s annual energy review, published every year since 1952, is considered influential in the energy industry and helps to inform the company’s strategic decisions. Last year BP set out a plan to cut its oil production and increase its renewable energy generation within the next decade, en route to becoming a net zero energy company by 2050. Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, said: “Yes, the world needs more low-carbon companies. But maybe more than anything it also needs existing energy companies to decarbonise, and in so doing use their scale and expertise to help bring about the deep and complex rewiring and replumbing of the global energy system that the world wants and needs to see over the next 30 years.” BP’s latest energy review found that the world’s total energy consumption fell by 4.5% in 2020, driven mainly by a 9.7% slump in demand for crude, used to make transport fuels, or just over 9m barrels of oil a day. Dale said the collapse in demand was “far bigger than anything seen in history and far bigger than the falls” in other energy sources. Meanwhile the “relentless expansion of renewable energy” meant electricity generated by wind, solar and hydroelectricity plants was “relatively unscathed”, Dale said. The report found that global wind and solar power capacity grew by 238GW in 2020, more than five times greater than the UK’s total renewable energy capacity. The increase was mainly driven by China, which accounted for roughly half of the global increase in wind and solar energy production capacity, but even controlling for that 2020 was a record year for building wind and solar farms. Dale said the trend away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy last year was “exactly what the world needs to see as it transitions to net zero”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/jun/11/lorde-releases-new-single-solar-power-to-coincide-with-solar-eclipse","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-11T01:11:22Z","webTitle":"Lorde releases new single Solar Power to coincide with solar eclipse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/11/lorde-releases-new-single-solar-power-to-coincide-with-solar-eclipse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/jun/11/lorde-releases-new-single-solar-power-to-coincide-with-solar-eclipse","fields":{"headline":"Lorde releases new single Solar Power to coincide with solar eclipse","bodyText":"Lorde has released a new single, Solar Power, just days after announcing the forthcoming release of her long-awaited new album of the same name. The song was a surprise launch from the New Zealander, timed to coincide with the solar eclipse in the northern hemisphere on Thursday. The sunny 3min 12sec pop song was co-written and co-produced with Jack Antonoff, and with its simple, peppy acoustic guitar and percussion is a sharp divergence in sound from Lorde’s previous works. The single comes after cover art for the forthcoming album was released earlier this week, which features the 24-year-old singer springing over a camera on the ground, without underwear. The photograph caused a buzz on social media on Tuesday. Some fans sharing the artwork or memes based on it on Twitter reported that their posts had been taken down for copyright infringement. Solar Power will be the two-time Grammy award-winner’s third album, following 2017’s Melodrama and 2013’s Pure Heroine. Lorde delayed release of Solar Power, which had originally been scheduled for June 2020, after the sudden death of her pet dog, Pearl, in November 2019. It was “indescribably painful”, she said at the time. “A light that was turned on for me has gone out. The bright energy I was trying to communicate to you has gone, for now.” Lorde told Australian youth radio station Triple J on Friday morning that the forthcoming album will be “light, playful and fun”. In an email to fans timed with the song’s release, she described the album’s character in terms of a beach-going girl: “There’s someone I want you to meet. Her feet are bare at all times. She’s sexy, playful, feral and free. She’s a modern girl in a headstock bikini, in touch with her past and her future, vibrating at the highest level when summer comes around. Her skin is glowing, her lovers are many. “The album is a celebration of the natural world, an attempt at immortalising the deep, transcendent feelings I have when I’m outdoors.” Unconfirmed reports circulated on Friday that the single may have been accidentally released early in some regions, after fans reported that it had appeared on some streaming platforms and then disappeared. The release date for the new album has not been confirmed, though the singer has hinted that fans can “look to the natural calendar for clues” for further details."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-21T19:00:37Z","webTitle":"Microbes and solar power ‘could produce 10 times more food than plants’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/21/microbes-and-solar-power-could-produce-10-times-more-food-than-plants","fields":{"headline":"Microbes and solar power ‘could produce 10 times more food than plants’","bodyText":"Combining solar power and microbes could produce 10 times more protein than crops such as soya beans, according to a new study. The system would also have very little impact on the environment, the researchers said, in stark contrast to livestock farming which results in huge amounts of climate-heating gases as well as water pollution. The concept uses electricity from solar panels and carbon dioxide from the air to create fuel for microbes, which are grown in bioreactor vats and then processed into dry protein powders. The process makes highly efficient use of land, water and fertiliser and could be deployed anywhere, not just in countries with strong sunshine or fertile soils, the scientists said. Food security is a “critical issue” for humanity in coming decades, they said, with the global population growing, biofuels competing for land with crops, and about 800 million people already undernourished today. Furthermore, tackling the climate crisis will be near impossible without slashing emissions from animal and dairy food production. Microbes are already used to make many common foods, such as bread, yoghurt, beer and Quorn. But other researchers said converting consumers to eating microbial protein might be difficult and that such foods may not be nutritionally complete. Dorian Leger, at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam, Germany, who led the new analysis, said: “We think microbial foods are very promising and will be one of the major contributors to solving the potential food crisis. “It might pick up quite quickly on the consumer side, but it’s hard to say. “But I do some exercise, and if I was offered a bacterial protein shake now, I would have it.” The team focused on soya beans, as these are linked to the destruction of forests and are mostly fed to animals, but other bacteria produce the main elements of palm oil. “Bacteria are very flexible, so they could eventually be tuned to different products,” Leger said. At least a dozen companies are already producing animal feed from microbes but the bacteria are typically fed either sugars from other crops or methane or methanol from fossil fuels. Solar Foods, based in Finland, is using electricity to create food for humans. The new assessment, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, is the first quantitative comparison of land use and energy efficiency between traditional agriculture and solar-powered microbial production systems. The researchers used data on today’s technologies to calculate the efficiency of each step of the process, including capturing CO2 from the air and processing the microbes into food that people could eat. They found the microbial system used just 1% of the water needed by the crops and a small fraction of the fertiliser, most of which is wasted when used in fields. The analysis estimated that the solar-microbial process could produce 15 tonnes of protein from each hectare (or per 2.5 acres) a year, enough to feed 520 people, which the scientists said was a conservative estimate. In comparison, a hectare of soya beans could produce 1.1 tonnes of protein, feeding 40 people. Even in countries with relatively low sunlight levels like the UK, microbial protein production was at least five times greater from each hectare than plants. The microbial protein would cost about the same as current proteins eaten by people, such as whey or pea, the researchers suggested. But it was several times more expensive than current animal feeds, although future technological improvements are expected to lower costs. Leger said plants’ ability to photosynthesise is remarkable but, in terms of energy efficiency, staple crops only convert about 1% of solar energy into edible biomass. This is because plants have evolved to compete and reproduce as well as just grow, and use less of the solar light spectrum than photovoltaic panels. All the components of the system exist, but Leger said they now need to be tested together and at scale, in particular the capturing of CO2 from the air and ensuring that used solar panels can be recycled. “For human food, there’s also a lot of regulation that needs to be overcome,” he said. Pete Iannetta, at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland, said: ““It’s a really interesting concept – you are divorcing food production from land use, which would mean you could have all that land available for rewilding.” But he said food is not only composed of the main nutrients, like protein and carbohydrate: “There are an awful lot of secondary compounds that are important for your wellbeing.” Iannetta also questioned whether microbial foods would become mainstream: “For example, we have used algae for a long time as a potential food resource, but it’s still not widely accepted.” Dr Toby Mottram, a consultant on agricultural technology, said: “Until the model is tested and costed with a pilot-scale plant, including a lifecycle assessment of [solar panel] production, it is hard to comment on whether it improves on [farming] systems which have been sustained for thousands of years, albeit for a lower population than we are planning to feed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/apr/06/scientists-climate-crisis-ipcc-report","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T12:00:23Z","webTitle":"Scientists have just told us how to solve the climate crisis – will the world listen? | Simon Lewis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/scientists-climate-crisis-ipcc-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/06/scientists-climate-crisis-ipcc-report","fields":{"headline":"Scientists have just told us how to solve the climate crisis – will the world listen? ","bodyText":"Amid the triple crisis of the war in Ukraine, the still-raging pandemic and escalating inflation, climate scientists have just pulled off a truly impressive achievement. They have stood firm and persuaded the world’s governments to agree to a common guide to solving the climate emergency. Despite the despair of mounting global problems, the release of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows some grounds for hope. After the recent reports on the causes and effects of climate change, this one covers solutions – with a summary signed off by the world’s governments. The summary is blunt and clear, and in many places acknowledges realities that scientists and campaigners have known for years but governments often avoided directly admitting. First, it is clearly acknowledged that North America and Europe have made the greatest contribution to the crisis we are living through, by producing by far the most carbon dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution. The report shows that today the average North American emits 16 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year from fossil fuel use, compared to just 2 tonnes for the average African. Consumption by the top 10% of households comprises over a third of global of greenhouse gases, compared to 15% of these gases for the bottom 50% of households. Every government now agrees that the climate crisis is driven by how the world’s wealthy – which includes much of the UK’s population – currently live, consume and invest. This is a major leap forward compared to previous reports. The last IPCC summary on solutions in 2014 labelled population growth as one of “the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion”. Such dangerous misunderstandings are no longer present in the summary report. Seven years on, these old “blame the poor” arguments increasingly seem like a relic of a previous age. The new report is also admirably clear on how far governments are from meeting their commitments signed under the Paris agreement in 2015 and reaffirmed in Glasgow late last year. For all the UK government’s talk of “keeping 1.5 alive” in Glasgow, current climate policies and pledges will not limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, or keep it “well below” 2C, the dual Paris targets. Despite the the complexities of climate science, our course is terrifyingly simple to see: we are currently on track for catastrophic 3C heating. In a world where half of the its population is highly vulnerable to the climate crisis, that spells disaster. Extreme heatwaves, floods and droughts far outside the normal tolerances of cities and towns will destroy lives and livelihoods globally. The knock-on effects of crop failures, migration and economic disruption could then overload political institutions and our abilities to respond to unfolding events. If that feels depressing, there is cause for hope. Governments own this report. They have endorsed it, and they have signed it off. Their citizens can now hold them to account for the failures it details. The most heartening section of the report is on alternatives to fossil fuel use. The overarching solution to our energy needs is to electrify everything we can, from heating buildings to transport, and power everything using clean renewables and storage. We are getting a huge helping hand from great leaps forward in clean technology. Between 2010 and 2019, the report says that the cost of solar energy plummeted by 85%, wind energy by 55% and lithium-ion batteries by 85%. These are staggering figures that point to a radically reshaped energy future. With the tsunami of suffering that is about to engulf UK households from soaring energy costs set by skyrocketing gas prices, everyone in government needs to see this message. There is a cheaper, cleaner way. But the emissions problem is deeper than just failures to invest in low-carbon alternatives. The world already has enough existing and planned high-carbon infrastructure to blast past 1.5C. Retiring big emitters, such as coal-fired power stations, is needed. Plus, planned new oil fields and airports that lock in high emissions need cancelling. This report is essentially a manifesto for ending the fossil fuel age. It will help the growing mass of people fighting against the fossil fuel industry on many fronts – but especially those taking official channels, such as MPs lobbying government not to open new oil fields, lawyers and citizens taking countries or companies to court, or those justifying direct action to stop high-carbon infrastructure being built. The licence for climate action has never been stronger. There are also elements in the report that will be used by the fossil fuel industry to further delay climate action. Central to this is the discussion of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those who bank on business-as-usual will argue that later this century we will be able to suck carbon out of the air, so why bother cutting emissions as sharply as possible today? The answer, in the report, is that carbon removal “currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and sociocultural barriers”. The report rightly says that some carbon removal is needed, but it should never be an alternative to cutting emissions now. It makes clear how unrealistic very high carbon removal pathways are, in stronger terms than ever before. For those who have been working for a better climate, the full 3,000-page report contains an astonishingly frank assessment of the organised efforts used to thwart climate action, noting: “opposition to climate action by carbon-connected industries is broad-based, highly organized, and matched with extensive lobbying”. It may seem ironic that this doesn’t make it into the much more widely read summary, but it is perhaps not surprising. The intertwined relationship between fossil fuels and governments goes deep: last week, for example, we learned that the former UK boss of BP is to be appointed by the government to champion the UK’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Each year that passes adds further reasons to stop using fossil fuels. Last year, it became clear that gas prices would rise sharply, affecting millions. This year, we can add that fossil fuels fund the Russian military and its atrocities. Add these to ending urban air pollution and avoiding hundreds of millions of people suffering heatwaves, drought and floods. And the price? Investing a few per cent of GDP and some new legislation. Climate change can feel complex, but the IPCC has worked hard to make it simple for us. A path still exists to halve emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050, which will probably meet the 1.5C goal. It is a hopeful message. The task now is to make it real. • This article was amended on 18 May 2022 to clarify that population is not discussed in the 2022 summary report, but is discussed in the main report.

The Australian Energy Market Commission said its final decision on changes designed to prevent “traffic jams” of electricity at sunny times in the middle of the day, would also prevent network operators placing a blanket ban on customers sending energy to the grid. Under changes to be announced on Thursday, electricity network companies would have to offer solar customers an option under which they would not face a financial penalty, but would probably face a limit on how much electricity they can export. Other options would involve solar users paying an upfront cost in return for being paid a higher rate for energy exported when demand for grid electricity is higher. One of the goals of the paid option is to make it more attractive for people to invest in batteries, electric vehicles (EVs) and appliances that allow them to timeshift household energy use. The commission said proposed network offers for solar offers would be assessed by the Australian Energy Regulator, which would have to consider the “long-term consumer interest”. Existing solar customers would not move on to the new system before July 2025. The shift follows a pushback against a draft declaration in March that critics said could penalise people who had installed solar in good faith and give too much power to networks in proposing consumer charges. A final decision was delayed due to the extent of public feedback. In a statement released to media ahead of the final announcement, the commission said the changes would impose “tough new obligations” on network companies requiring them to make their businesses solar and battery friendly. It said it was part of a plan to have more solar households, cut greenhouse gas emissions and keep costs down. The commission’s chief executive, Benn Barr, said it had listened to feedback and tightened protections for consumers to ensure people would not have to pay to export solar if they chose not to. He said people could earn by sending electricity to the grid when it was needed, or save by using delay-start functions to set appliances such as dishwashers to run on solar energy in the middle of the day. The commission’s chair, Anna Collyer, said it would turn the “current one-way street delivering power to people’s homes into a two-way super-highway where energy flows in both directions”. “Power network companies will need to deliver services to support solar and they’ll be judged on their performance on how much solar exports they allow into the grid,” she said. “These new measures to drive smart solar are fundamental to enabling a modern electricity grid.” She said the changes reflected widespread concern from industry, consumers and environment groups that the grid would not be able to handle a forecast doubling of household solar power over the next decade. About 2.8m Australian households now have solar systems. At peak moments in the middle of the day, slightly more than half the electricity across the national market is from renewable sources, compared with about 30% across the year. Advocacy group Solar Citizens has been sharply critical of the commission’s proposed change, describing it as a “sun tax”. It argued solar users should be rewarded for helping cut emissions, and that changing the rules after the fact was unfair. But the fairness principle was also invoked by those broadly supportive of the commission’s proposal. The change was a response to proposals from power distribution company SA Power Networks, the Total Environment Centre and welfare organisations the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss) and St Vincent de Paul. Kellie Caught, senior adviser on climate and energy for Acoss, has said the country needed a rapid transition to renewable energy, but increased network costs to deal with the influx of household solar should not be paid by people without panels, including the third of households who rent. She told Guardian Australia last month it was important that people with solar were given a choice over whether they paid to send electricity to the grid at busy times or could accept a limit on how much they exported. State governments raised concerns about the commission’s draft proposal to varying degrees. Victoria and Queensland indicated they did not support export charges. The commission estimated under a worst-case scenario solar owners choosing paid plans would still earn at least 90% of what they do now from their panels. It said it should lead to a power bill reduction for 80% of customers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/01/opposing-solar-farms-to-protect-the-landscape-is-not-nimbyism","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T16:49:40Z","webTitle":"Opposing solar farms to protect the landscape is not nimbyism | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/01/opposing-solar-farms-to-protect-the-landscape-is-not-nimbyism","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/01/opposing-solar-farms-to-protect-the-landscape-is-not-nimbyism","fields":{"headline":"Opposing solar farms to protect the landscape is not nimbyism","bodyText":"The analysis by the planning and development consultancy Turley revealing that an increased number of planning applications for solar farms have been refused in recent years is widely interpreted as evidence of nimbyism, inflicting higher bills on customers and environmental damage (Solar farm plans refused at highest rate for five years in Great Britain, 25 August). But did Turley identify why those applications have been refused? Perhaps there has been an increased number of inappropriate applications trying to jump on the sustainability bandwagon for purely commercial reasons? The village where I live has been the subject of a planning application for a large solar farm squeezed into a gap between an area of outstanding natural beauty, a conservation area and ancient woodland. It has been recommended for refusal by planning officers due to the “significantly harmful” impact it would have on the landscape. When the applicants were asked why they had chosen this location, the reason given was that they needed sites close to settlements to make it cheaper to connect to the electricity network. There are huge areas where solar farms could be built without negatively affecting landscapes or communities, but solar farm promoters are not interested as the necessary network infrastructure is not in place, making sites too expensive to attract investors. Don’t criticise local communities for resisting solar farms in inappropriate places. Instead, push for rational and proactive government policy to facilitate renewable energy schemes that don’t harm our landscape.

However, those thinking about signing up need to be prepared to accept some risk to their cash. This is a lot riskier than a bank or building society savings account. The investments include a scheme that allows people to put money into companies providing African families with access to clean, affordable solar energy, and one involving a company that has found a way to grow “greener” tomatoes in the UK. Energise Africa enables people to invest in bonds issued by solar companies, allowing them to provide “life-changing” solar home systems to low-income families in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For first-time investors, Energise Africa is currently guaranteeing investments up to £100. Launched in 2017, Energise Africa is the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform. This involves putting your money into bonds (mainly unsecured, although some are secured) that are not listed on a public market. The minimum investment is £50. At the time of writing, there were several projects on the Energise Africa website either open for investment or about to go live. There is a 30-month bond from a solar company called Oolu, based in Senegal, with an expected interest rate of 7% a year. Oolu aims to raise just over £112,000 and says the money will help it provide solar home systems to 432 families in Burkina Faso. Meanwhile, a company called Sollatek in Kenya is offering a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 5% a year. It says it is aiming to raise £40,000, so it can make 200 solar home systems available to families in rural Kenya. Also still open to investors at the time of writing was a two-year bond with an expected interest rate of 6% that aims to raise £500,000. It has been launched by a Kenya-based agricultural supply chain company called iProcure. Lisa Ashford, the chief executive of Energise Africa and Ethex, says: “We’ve definitely seen an increase in people investing across both our platforms since the beginning of the pandemic. There are multiple factors at play, including low interest rates, but we’ve seen lots of new customers that want to support initiatives that can have a direct benefit on their community or a positive impact on the environment. The recent UN climate report and events such as the Greek wildfires put this into perspective.” The guarantee on offer to new investors will reassure some, although above and beyond that guarantee, your capital is at risk and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there is some kind of disaster, crisis or bankruptcy, you could lose some or all of your capital and would not be able to get redress from the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Meanwhile, individuals concerned about the environmental cost of food production are being targeted by a new investment offering 8% interest a year. On offer is an opportunity to put money into Sterling Suffolk, a company building and operating carbon-capturing glasshouses that grow “greener” tomatoes. The investment has been launched by the crowdfunding platform Abundance Investment, and the aim is to raise up to £6.75m. In the UK we eat more than 500,000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes each year but only grow 20% of them here. We rely on imports all year round, and this has a high environmental cost. The UK imports most of its tomatoes from countries such as the Netherlands that operate gas-heated greenhouses, or places such as Spain that benefit from lower heating requirements but have other major environmental impacts including transport and water usage. Based in Bramford, near Ipswich, Sterling Suffolk is tackling this issue head-on. Its semi-closed glasshouses are the first of their kind in the UK and use 25% less energy per tonne of tomatoes than other conventional glasshouses while capturing and reusing at least 75% of the CO2 generated from heating, a spokesman says. The minimum investment is £5, and those who put their money in will be buying tradeable debentures, which are like IOUs issued by companies. However, debentures are not covered by the FSCS or the FOS and, again, there is a risk you may not get back the money you invested or make any return on your investment. The quoted 8% return assumes you hold the debentures until maturity in October 2032. According to the offer document, someone investing £1,000 now would be in line to receive a total of £1,555 at maturity – ie their original capital plus £555 of interest income. These debentures are secured, in contrast to some other Abundance investments that are unsecured, and can be sold on to other investors free of charge via the Abundance Marketplace."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-24T01:00:53Z","webTitle":"China ramps up coal power despite carbon neutral pledges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/apr/24/china-ramps-up-coal-power-despite-carbon-neutral-pledges","fields":{"headline":"China ramps up coal power despite carbon neutral pledges","bodyText":"Local governments in China approved more new coal power in the first three months of 2023 than in the whole of 2021, according to official documents. The approvals, analysed by Greenpeace, reveal that between January and March this year, at least 20.45 gigawatts of coal power was approved, up from 8.63GW in the same period in 2022. In the whole of 2021, 18GW of coal was approved. A Chinese Communist party (CCP) five-year plan from 2016 had placed a heavy emphasis on reducing the use of coal and developing clean energy sources. In 2020 Xi Jinping, China’s leader, pledged that the country would become carbon neutral by 2060. This prompted an era of reduced coal power approvals as local governments sought to keep their local economies in check with Beijing’s priorities. A rise in coal power approvals came in 2020 when the five-year plan came to an end, as local governments anticipated even tighter restrictions on coal expansion in the next round. But in 2021, China suffered huge power outages, leading to a dramatic shift in the CCP’s energy priorities. In September the price of electricity soared as factories reopened to service global demand as the rest of the world emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government had capped prices, so many power plants reduced output rather than operated at a loss. China relies on coal for more than half of its energy consumption. As homes in the colder north of the country faced the prospect of a gruelling winter without heat, the government’s rhetoric shifted from reducing coal to prioritising energy security. That resulted in a “myth that if you build more power plants, that will bring more energy security,” said Xie Wenwen, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace. The war in Ukraine, which sent global energy prices soaring, was “another huge event that fuelled the energy security narrative”. Campaigners argue that in order to meet China’s growing energy needs, it is not more coal that is needed, but a more flexible grid. A report published this month by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, noted that technologies for storing clean energy “are not yet mature enough to be deployed at the scale considered essential” for China’s plans to expand the use of renewable energy. More than 75% of China’s coal, wind, solar and hydro resources are in the west of the country, while more than 70% of power consumption happens in central and eastern China. Five provinces on the east coast account for nearly two-fifths of China’s total consumption. Policymakers have yet to find a solution for efficiently rebalancing this problem. Still, in the 14th five-year plan, which covers the period until 2025, the government said that more than half of increased energy demands in that period should be covered by renewables. Between 2010 and 2021, renewable generation increased by an average annual rate of 19.2%, primarily from wind and solar power. But last year Xi said that coal would remain a mainstay of China’s energy mix that “would be hard to change in the short term”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/mar/15/tories-green-crap-david-cameron-boris-johnson","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-15T10:00:48Z","webTitle":"The Tories railed against ‘green crap’.

Why trust them to solve the energy crisis now?","bodyText":"In the grip of the energy crisis, gas prices are already due to increase by 50% in April, and will spike higher later in the year, while the chancellor’s modest mitigations do little for unaffordable bills. Boris Johnson is about to produce an energy strategy to cut reliance on Russian imports and speed UK generation. He wobbles on fracking. But before he boasts some “world-beating” plan, hold on to this salient fact. If the Tories had not blocked progress on renewables and insulation over the last decade, Britain would already be generating more clean energy than the amount provided by the fuels imported from Russia. Tories may recall those sunlit days leading up to the 2010 election when David Cameron, as the green man of folklore, posed in the Arctic cheerily driving a husky team, as he rebranded his party with an oak tree and a Vote Blue, Go Green slogan. His greenery was environmental gauze to signify an end to the nasty party: he did the job pretty well. He did preserve Labour’s green policies initially, but in 2013 Cameron panicked when Labour’s Ed Miliband pledged a price freeze, after energy prices had risen by 37% in three years. Cut the “green crap” Cameron ordered, which was duly splashed across the Sun’s front page. The consequences were far-reaching. Stripping out green subsidies caused the number of homes getting loft or cavity wall insulation to plummet immediately by 92% and 74% respectively: those figures never recovered. He scrapped zero carbon building regulations, so a million homes have been built since 2016 with poor energy standards: our energy bills are £2.5bn higher as a direct result, says Simon Evans of Carbon Brief. Remember Cameron trying to fix a wind turbine to his roof as a charming gesture? Notting Hill in west London wasn’t windy enough. But later he axed the “green crap” levy on energy bills that subsidised wind and solar: that trifling 9% could have been replaced from general taxes. The industry says that onshore wind was on the verge of profitability when Cameron caved in to shire nimbys and effectively banned it, by allowing any objections to bar turbines. Virtually no energy was generated from new onshore wind afterwards. Solar was getting close to viability when his subsidy axe crashed the industry, costing thousands of jobs. Stuck in planning limbo, 649 onshore wind and solar schemes await consent: they could generate more than enough power to replace Russian imports, says Evans. Johnson may well green light them in his new policy but we should remember the lost decade of clean energy. Onshore windfarms have had strong public support in national polling yet small groups in Tory seats held sway. On the Somerset Levels, I argued with a tiny group protesting against four planned wind turbines beside eyesore pylons, the M5 and the Hinkley Point nuclear site, despite the climate crisis having recently caused disastrous local floods. I find wind turbines beautiful, like the wings of benevolent albatrosses sweeping across the sky. But beauty is subjective: their purpose makes them magnificent to me, while anti-greens hate them for their virtue signalling. Though offshore wind has not been as badly affected, uncertainty caused by the Cameron subsidy axe ended the world’s biggest offshore windfarm plan, the £4bn Atlantic Array in the Bristol Channel. Still local protesters, backed by celebrities, fight large solar farms in Suffolk and the necessary electric substations for a huge offshore windfarm that is planned (not very) close to Aldeburgh, with the capacity to power 1.4m homes. Johnson’s plan needs to include a generous bonus to compensate local communities for projects that are benefiting not only the nation but also the planet. Labour pledges a £28bn green recovery, with Ed Miliband laying out his plans for a “clean energy sprint” for a huge expansion in renewables and insulation. That’s the challenge for Johnson to meet: he is yet to spell out the politically difficult staging posts to net zero. His green homes grant scheme failed abysmally through incompetence, a £1.5bn fiasco that the National Audit Office found had insulated fewer than 10% of homes promised. Keeping his Cop26 pledges means rejecting the frackers: Jacob Rees-Mogg in this cabinet, Steve Baker and loud noises off from Nigel Farage. The right’s fracking fascination is a mystery when it would take years for the gas to flow, if it works at all without damage, amid ferocious local opposition. Why aren’t mighty turbines just as excitingly macho? The Renewable Energy Association’s CEO, Nina Skorupska, tells me that the companies she represents, “could construct more than the terawatt-hours imported from Russia within 18 months if the obstacles were unblocked”. Even before the impact of the invasion of Ukraine, gas already cost about four times more than the price of energy from wind and solar. UK windfarms are starting to repay the Treasury, earning more than the contract price agreed for their subsidy. Renewables are faster and cheaper than shale or new North Sea drilling, that would warp future investment towards fossil fuels. The frackers are plain perverse, unless you subscribe to the view that they’re in hock to big oil – or even to Vladimir Putin. Bizarrely, the Mail on Sunday raises questions about Frack Off’s funding and whether its campaigning benefits Putin. Will there be energy rationing, as in wartime, or blackouts as in the 1970s? Turning down thermostats and reducing the national speed limit to 55mph can avoid that. Road pricing needs accelerating, too, in the switch to electric cars. People will only make sacrifices if pain is fairly distributed and the weak protected with a more generous Warm Homes Discount. This Ukraine horror drives climate terror from front pages, but February’s IPPC report shows global warming gathering speed. And yet easing energy shortages by hastening global annihilation is the right’s strange cause. The Tories have conveniently forgotten their own “green crap” contribution to the energy gap.

Seven years later, the forecast would be proven spectacularly wrong when roughly 18 gigawatts of solar capacity were installed in a single year alone. Ever since the agency was founded in 1974 to measure the world’s energy systems and anticipate changes, the yearly World Energy Outlook has been a must-read document for policymakers the world over. Over the last two decades, however, the IEA has consistently failed to see the massive growth in renewable energy coming. Not only has the organisation underestimated the take-up of solar and wind, but it has massively overstated the demand for coal and oil. Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF, says that, in fairness to the IEA, it wasn’t alone. “When I got this job in 2005, I thought maybe one day solar will supply 1% of the world’s electricity. Now it’s 3%. Our official forecast is that it will be 23% by 2050, but that’s completely underestimated,” Chase says. “I see it as the limits of modelling. Most energy system models are, or were, set up to model minor changes to an energy system that is run on fossil fuel or nuclear. Every time you double producing capacity, you reduce the cost of PV solar by 28%. “We’ve got to the point where solar is the cheapest source of energy in the world in most places. This means we’ve been trying to model a situation where the grid looks totally different today.” This rapid radical reduction in the price of PV solar is a story about Chinese industrial might backed by American capital, fanned by European political sensibilities and made possible largely thanks to the pioneering work of an Australian research team. The deep history begins with a succession of US presidents and the quest for energy independence. First was Richard Nixon, who in November 1973 announced Project Independence to wean the US off Middle Eastern oil. Then came Jimmy Carter, who declared the energy transition the “moral equivalent of war” in April 1977 and pumped billions of dollars into renewable energy research, which came to a screeching halt when Ronald Reagan came to power. But by then, interest had been piqued in Australia. The father of PV solar The solar cell was invented when Russell Shoemaker Ohl, a researcher in Bell Labs, noticed in 1940 that a cracked silicon sample produced a current when exposed to light. However, little improvement had been made until the contribution of Martin Green, a young engineering professor working out of the University of New South Wales. Born in Brisbane, Green had spent some time in Canada as a researcher before circling back home in 1974. A year later he had started a PV solar research group working out of a small university laboratory built with unwanted equipment scrounged from big American engineering firms. His first experiments, alongside a single PhD student, involved looking for ways to increase the voltage on early solar cells. “Pretty soon, we started beating all these groups in the US in terms of the voltage we could get,” Green says. “Nasa had a project that had six contractors working on it. We beat them all.” Not long after, Green and his team began to raise their ambitions. Having boosted the voltage, the next step was building better quality cells. Their early efforts broke the world efficiency record in 1983 – a habit the team would continue for 30 of the next 38 years. In the very early years of the industry, the received wisdom had been that a 20% conversion rate marked the hard limit of what was possible from PV solar cells. Green, however, disagreed in a paper published in 1984.A year later, his team built the first cell that pushed past that limit, and in 1989 built the first full solar panel capable of running at 20% efficiency. It was a moment that opened up what was possible from the industry, and the new upper limit was “set” at 25% – another barrier Green and his team would smash in 2008. In 2015, they built the world’s most efficient solar cell, achieving a 40.6% conversion rate using focused light reflected off a mirror. Rise of the Sun King Out of this whirlwind of activity, the Chinese solar industry would be born largely thanks to an ambitious physicist named Zhengrong Shi. Born in 1963 on Yangzhong Island, Shi had earned his master’s degree and come to Australia a year before the Tiananmen Square protests. He had spotted a flyer advertising a research fellowship and talked Green into bringing him on as a PhD student in 1989. Shi would finish his PhD in just two and a half years – a record that still stands today. By the time he became Dr Shi, he had so impressed Green that he stayed on as a researcher. With time, the university was increasingly looking to commercialise its world-leading solar cell technology and struck up a partnership with Pacific Power in 1995. The government utility sank $47m into a new company called Pacific Solar. A factory was set up in the Sydney suburb of Botany and Shi was made the deputy director of research and development where he quickly earned a reputation for resourcefulness and precision. “Zhengrong basically ran the company,” Green says. Shi stuck it out for a few years but in November 2000, he was made an offer. At a dinner held at his home, four officials from the Chinese province of Jiangsu suggested the 37-year-old researcher and Australian citizen return to China and build his own factory there. After some consideration, Shi agreed and ended up settling in the small city of Wuxi where he founded SunTech with $6m in startup funding from the municipal government. Shi’s arrival caused a stir. The ability to cheaply build conventional PV solar panels with 17% efficiency was far beyond what his competitors were capable of. “That was a shock to them,” Shi says. “When they saw we were making solar cells of large area and high efficiencies they said, ‘Wow.’ “The first reaction was: that’s the future. Everybody said that’s the future. But they also said it was one step too early. What they meant was that there was no market for it yet. In China at the time, if you mentioned solar, people thought of solar hot water.” All that would change when Germany passed new laws encouraging the uptake of solar power. Quickly it became clear there was a massive global demand and the world’s manufacturers were struggling to keep up with supply. Spying an opportunity for investment, a consortium that included Actis Capital and Goldman Sachs came knocking to pitch Shi on taking the company public. When the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005, it raised $420m and made Shi an instant billionaire. A year later he would be worth an estimated $3bn and crowned the richest man in China, earning him the moniker “the Sun King”. Having shown the way, the Chinese PV solar industry began a massive expansion. SunTech alone boosted its production capacity from 60 megawatts to 500MW, and then to 1 gigawatt in 2009. The company grew so fast, its supplies of glass, polysilicon and electronic systems needed to build its panels came under strain, forcing it to invest heavily in local supply chains. “And then, you know the rest,” Shi says. Dirt cheap power – at a price As with the rest of China, the rate of technological development in the PV solar business makes for an industry that builds itself up one day, tears itself down the next, and then remakes itself again the day after. With razor-thin margins and cut-throat competition, everyone is always one step away from falling. Around 2012 the world market was flooded with solar panels, sending the price plummeting through the floor, leaving SunTech vulnerable. Already under intense financial pressure, disaster struck when an internal investigation found a takeover bid it had launched had been guaranteed by €560m in fake German government bonds. Upon discovering the bonds didn’t exist, Shi was removed as CEO of his company and a year later SunTech would file for bankruptcy protection when it couldn’t repay a $541m loan that fell due in March 2013. Whatever befell SunTech later, the Macquarie University emeritus professor John Mathews says the company played a pivotal role in changing both China and the world forever. In a quirk of history, what had begun as an American drive to wean itself off oil was eventually taken up by China, which made solar power dirt cheap in the process. “The Chinese approach to renewables is all about energy security,” Mathews says. “At the scale from which they’re building new industries, they would need colossal imports of conventional fossil fuels, which would cripple them economically. “They can get around that problem, which is a geopolitical obstacle, by manufacturing their own energy equipment.” Today Green and Shi keep in touch. Both are working on new projects. Shi is overseeing a new company while 72-year-old Green is looking for new innovations to explore. One such innovation is the stackable solar cell. Though still a niche technology very much in the early stages, the basic idea is to lay a material over a solar cell in order to boost its power output. “We think a 40% module, rather than the 22% you can do nowadays with PERC, is what the industry will be doing once we perfect this stacking approach,” Green says. “We’re just trying to find a new cell that will have all the qualities of silicon that we can stack on top of silicon. “The International Energy Agency now says solar is providing the cheapest energy the world has ever seen. But we’re headed towards a future of insanely cheap energy. “It’s a fundamentally different world we’re moving into.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/21/methane-to-food-waste-eight-ways-to-attempt-to-stay-within-15c","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-21T19:10:39Z","webTitle":"Eight things the world must do to avoid the worst of climate change","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/21/methane-to-food-waste-eight-ways-to-attempt-to-stay-within-15c","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/21/methane-to-food-waste-eight-ways-to-attempt-to-stay-within-15c","fields":{"headline":"Eight things the world must do to avoid the worst of climate change","bodyText":"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published the “synthesis report” of its sixth assessment report (AR6) on Monday. Eight years in preparation, this mammoth report encompasses the entire range of human knowledge of the climate system, compiled by hundreds of scientists from thousands of academic papers, and published in four parts, in August 2021, February and April 2022, and March 2023. The report drew together the most important findings – but also highlighted some key measures that governments and countries must take immediately if we are to avoid climate catastrophe: Reduce methane Sharp cuts to short-lived climate pollutants, methane chief among them, could cut more than half a degree from global heating. Produced from oil and gas operations and coalmines, and from animal husbandry and natural sources – such as decaying vegetation – methane is a greenhouse gas about 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. But it lasts only for about 20 years before degrading into CO2. Durwood Zaelke, a peer review scientist for the IPCC’s AR6 report, and founder of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development in the US, says cutting it is “the best way to slow near-term warming – indeed the only way we know of, short of [geoengineering through] solar radiation management, carbon dioxide removal and methane removal, all of which are still speculative”. Cutting it should be easy: the International Energy Agency found that plugging the leaks from fossil fuel operations was not only low-cost but in most cases actively profitable. Butmany of these operations are in countries with little interest in climate action – Russia is the worst offender, but even in the US, action has been feeble – and despite the Methane Pledge signed by close to 100 countries since 2021, methane emissions continue to rise strongly. The Guardian recently revealed 1,000 super-emitting methane leaks. Stop deforestation Cutting down rainforests destroys some of the world’s biggest carbon sinks and risks taking the world to a “tipping point” at which vast forests such as the Amazon and the Congo become sources of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere instead of absorbing it. The world’s remaining forests are also vital hotspots for biodiversity, so preserving them not only keeps the lungs of our planet alive but is essential to any hope of stemming the catastrophic loss of global species, as well as for Indigenous people who live there. There is hope that the recent disastrous rates of deforestation seen in Brazil will abate under the return of President Lula, but the work will be difficult. The Congo is also still under severe threat, and despite progress in Malaysia and Indonesia the destruction of forests there for palm oil continues. Restore other degraded land, and stop it being turned to agriculture Forests grab the headlines, but many other aspects of natural ecosystems are vital absorbers of carbon, yet are being degraded. Restoring them would benefit nature and the climate. Wetlands and peatlands store vast quantities of carbon, but are under threat as they are drained for agriculture. In the oceans, mangrove swamps and seagrass meadows – which store carbon and can help to reduce the impacts of rising sea levels and storms – have been destroyed. The oceans themselves are huge carbon sinks, but their capacity to absorb and store carbon is increasingly under threat at higher temperatures. Stopping overfishing, for instance by cutting wasteful subsidies for industrial fishing, and allowing natural marine ecosystems to regenerate would restore some of the natural carbon cycle of the oceans. Change agriculture, and change the way we eat Feeding the world’s future population using current food systems will be impossible, but shifting to a more sustainable diet that is rich in plants and short on meat and dairy products would go a long way. Beyond meat-eating, fertilisers release nitrous oxide, a strong greenhouse gas in its own right. Fortunately, modern agricultural methods, using precision farming techniques can offer a way of keeping yields high while reducing the impact on the climate and nature. Finally, reducing food waste will be vital, as globally one-third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted. In poor countries in the global south, the lack of refrigeration is also a key factor in wasting food before it can be consumed, and is worth investment. Solar and wind power Renewable energy in the form of wind and solar power is now cheaper than fossil fuels across most of the world and the IPCC found that solar power, wind power and reducing the conversion of land to agriculture were the three measures with the strongest potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally. The US and the EU are now engaged in a renewable energy arms race, which is likely to spur competition further. China is the one to watch, however, adding almost as much renewable energy to the grid last year as the rest of the world combined. China also has a near-monopoly on some critical minerals used in clean technology, a position in which the US and the EU are belatedly taking interest. Energy efficiency The International Energy Agency found that using energy more efficiently was the single largest potential contributor to reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions. But between 2015 and 2020 improvement in global primary energy intensity slowed, averaging 1.4% a year, down from 2.1% a year over the period 2010-2015. Despite initial signs of a recovery, weak global energy intensity improvements of below 1% a year were observed in 2020 and 2021, as Covid-19 lockdowns bit. This was well below the 4% a year required on average from 2020 to 2030, the IEA warned. Transport is also ripe for change. More efficient public transport systems around the world would benefit people, boost the economy, reduce air pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions, but in too many urban centres this is an area severely neglected by governments. Stop burning coal Switching from coal to gas-fired power would reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally by more than making all buildings energy efficient. But many governments – including China, which recently approved the biggest expansion of coal-fired power plants since 2015, as well as India and Australia – are deeply entwined with coal interests, and have seen coal as essential to national energy security. But it can be done. In developing countries, just energy transition partnerships have begun in South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia to help workers to move out of coal and into highly skilled jobs in renewable energy generation. Put climate at the heart of all decision-making Historically environment ministries have been on the periphery of government, subservient to finance and business ministries. This is no longer tenable. The IPCC issued a plea on Monday for the climate to be at the heart of all government policy, and all decision-making in business. Only by “mainstreaming” climate action, in the unlovely UN jargon, into the decisions of all government departments, and at board level in business, can we hope to make the many changes needed. The good news is that everybody should benefit, from better health and wellbeing, green jobs and a more vibrant economy, and by reducing the threat of climate catastrophe. Dr Hoesung Lee, the chair of the IPCC, said: “Mainstreaming effective and equitable climate action will not only reduce losses and damages for nature and people, it will also provide wider benefits. This synthesis report underscores the urgency of taking more ambitious action and shows that, if we act now, we can still secure a livable sustainable future for all.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/mar/14/sun-cables-giant-northern-territory-solar-project-gets-210m-funding-boost","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-13T16:30:34Z","webTitle":"Sun Cable’s giant Northern Territory solar project gets $210m funding boost ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/sun-cables-giant-northern-territory-solar-project-gets-210m-funding-boost","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/sun-cables-giant-northern-territory-solar-project-gets-210m-funding-boost","fields":{"headline":"Sun Cable’s giant Northern Territory solar project gets $210m funding boost ","bodyText":"The $30bn plan to build a giant solar farm in northern Australia to power Darwin, Indonesia and Singapore has moved a step closer to reality with billionaires Mike Cannon-Brookes and Andrew Forrest contributing to a $210m capital raising. The investment brings to about $250m the money raised to build a 17-gigawatt solar plant on a cattle property at Newcastle Waters, midway between Alice Springs and the Northern Territory’s capital. The project would be a 12,000 hectare solar precinct with 17-20 GW solar generation and 36-42 GWh energy storage to enable 24/7 dispatchable electricity near Elliott, in the Northern Territory. The funding “will take us all the way through to the financial close of the Australia-Asia PowerLink”, David Griffin, Sun Cable’s chief executive, said. “It will also allow us to accelerate development of our broader portfolio,” he said. “Our mission is to supply renewable electricity from resource-abundant regions to growing load centres at scale.” The company plans to explore other “multi-gigawatt” solar plants both in Australia and elsewhere, including other intercontinental power links, based on the know-how developed over the past four years, Griffin said. More details were likely to be announced “some months from now”. “Some of our subsequent projects will also rely on [technology] very similar in concept to the first project,” he said. “There’s a lot of opportunities in this area … but certainly we have more projects emanating from Australia as well.” Griffin said there was no connection between Sun Cable’s plans, and the recent hostile takeover bid by Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures and Canadian asset manager Brookfield of AGL Energy. The two suitors dropped their bid a week ago after AGL rejected a revised offer that valued AGL at just under $8.5bn, although AGL itself is not certain the two won’t be back for another tilt. Sun Cable, declined to provide a breakdown of the contributions from Grok and Forrest’s Squadron Energy to the $210m raising, adding only that the original investors took up their full entitlements. Staff, who now number 80, also joined the list of shareholders, Griffin said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We’re just really stoked to close this round,” Griffin said. “It’s a really significant number and puts us in a really strong position.” Cannon-Brookes said the fundraising brought Australia “one step closer to realising our renewables exporting potential”, while developing a blueprint for other projects. “We can power the world with clean energy and Sun Cable is harnessing that at scale.” “Sun Cable’s vision will transform Australia’s capability to become a world-leading generator and exporter of renewable electricity and enable decarbonisation. I’m proud to be a cornerstone investor in Sun Cable, its team and its vision,” Forrest said. Squadron Energy and Forrest’s Fortescue Future Industries were approached for comment. The latter had a big week, landing Guy Debelle, the current deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia to be its chief financial officer. Debelle, who had been considered to be a frontrunner to replace current central bank governor Philip Lowe, will help steer the company’s plans to produce 15m tonnes of hydrogen produced by renewable energy a year by 2030 for global markets. “Climate change has a broad-ranging impact on Australia, both in terms of geography and in terms of Australian businesses and households,” Debelle said in a statement after his surprise exit from the RBA. “Australia has been an energy exporter for many decades,” he said. “Australia is also endowed with resources that have the potential for us to continue to be an exporter of energy – but renewable rather than emissions-intensive fossil fuels.” Debelle’s now former boss, RBA governor Lowe, told a banking conference on Friday investors wanted a plan on how Australia would transition to a less carbon-intensive economy. “They want to know what the opportunities Australia has and they want to talk about the risks that we have as well,” Lowe said, noting Debelle had resigned “to participate in those opportunities”. Institutions such as the RBA and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority were working on a framework to help markets measure, manage and price the risks as Australia shifted out of fossil fuels, he said. These included assessing climate vulnerability. “We need to provide the people who want to make capital decisions with information, and it needs to be quality information,” Lowe said. “Australia [can] seize the fantastic opportunities we have in this area. That’s a huge challenge for the future.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-10-15T10:28:41Z","webTitle":"Students’ solar-powered camper van turns heads on 1,800-mile road trip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/oct/15/students-solar-powered-camper-van-turns-heads-on-1800-mile-road-trip","fields":{"headline":"Students’ solar-powered camper van turns heads on 1,800-mile road trip","bodyText":"A team of students from the Netherlands are due to complete an 1,800-mile (3,000km) road trip across western Europe in a solar-powered camper van that they designed and built themselves. The Stella Vita is designed for two passengers and has a kitchen, sitting area, bed, shower and toilet. Using solar energy alone, the vehicle can cover up to 450 miles on a sunny day, reaching a top speed of 75mph, as well as powering all the inside amenities, a TV and a laptop. The vehicle has solar panels on the roof that can be expanded into a sun cover when parked. The van can also be charged through electric charging ports. “The technology is there, we just have to change the way we think,” said 20-year-old Tijn ter Horst, one of the Eindhoven University of Technology students onboard. “If 22 students can design and build a vehicle like this in one year, then I’m sure companies could as well.” The road trip, which started in Eindhoven on 19 September and was due to conclude in Tarifa, south-west Spain, on Friday, was part of the students’ self-set challenge to demonstrate the potential of solar energy. This is not the first solar-powered vehicle produced by the university, which first joined Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, a biennial Australian solar vehicle competition, in 2013. “This year there was no competition so the students set their own goals and challenges” said Dr Carlo van der Weijer, who has been the team’s coordinator. While previous Eindhoven teams won consecutive competitions with their five-seater designs, Van der Weijer believes there may be a bigger commercial appetite for the mobile home. Ecologically minded camping enthusiasts might be tempted by an electric van that is not reliant on charging points, which remain scarce in many places, he said. According to the students, the Stella Vita has been a hit on Spanish roads, attracting attention from other drivers, and Van der Weijer said the vehicle was also an option in less sun-exposed locations. “On a cloudy day the vehicle can still produce 60-70% of the energy,” he said. “And even if there is no sun at all, you still have an efficient, normal electric car that you can charge from a charging port.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/may/19/veg-box-riverford-staff-owned-founder-sells-stake-guy-singh-watson","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-19T05:00:20Z","webTitle":"Veg box firm Riverford to be 100% staff-owned as founder sells stake for £10m","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/19/veg-box-riverford-staff-owned-founder-sells-stake-guy-singh-watson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/may/19/veg-box-riverford-staff-owned-founder-sells-stake-guy-singh-watson","fields":{"headline":"Veg box firm Riverford to be 100% staff-owned as founder sells stake for £10m","bodyText":"The organic vegetable box company Riverford is to become 100% owned by its staff after its founder, Guy Singh-Watson, agreed to sell his remaining 23% stake for almost £10m. Singh-Watson, who sold nearly three-quarters of the company to employees in 2018, will take a £9.8m payment over five years and immediately hand full control to a trust on behalf of its 900 staff who each receive an annual profit share and participate in the running of the business. The 63-year-old farmer said the deal, which will take the total paid for his shares in the business to £14m since 2018, did not mark his retirement and that he would continue to be involved in the business as a trustee, non-executive director and spokesperson for the business. “Founders find negotiating this transition to their successors incredibly difficult and painful and most people make a bit of a mess of it,” Singh-Watson said. “Founders can hang around too long, and I don’t want to be that person who needs to be told to go.” He added: “When the business became employee-owned in 2018, I wanted to ensure that the move was a successful one, and that the values of the business were safeguarded by its new owners and governance arrangements. “Since then, it’s been a privilege to witness the business grow in ways we couldn’t have predicted, all while remaining committed to its founding purpose: to balance the needs of customers, suppliers, the environment, and wider society, and provide fair and rewarding employment to our staff.” Singh-Watson said a proportion of the cash he was receiving would be invested in more solar power and agroforestry on his own farms – in Devon and France – with some going to the Ripple Effect charity, which helps farmers overseas, and local community projects in Devon. The sailing and surfing fan said he also planned to spend a bit of his payout on himself, but was “not remotely interested in fancy cars or boats”. “After much consideration and despite the example set by many politicians … I have decided to make no attempts to avoid tax liability on the sale of the shares,” he said. “I’ve not set up trusts to avoid tax, even though much of the money will end up supporting charitable projects. I will pay my tax as others who can’t afford creative accountants do, and I strongly support the idea of a wealth tax.” Singh-Watson said the shift to employee ownership had been influenced by the John Lewis Partnership, the owner of the Waitrose supermarket chain, which his farm once supplied. He expressed dismay that the larger company had been reportedly considering selling a stake to investors in order to raise cash. “I suspect that would be the beginning of the end,” he said, urging John Lewis to stick with employee ownership and downsize rather than borrow large sums. Riverford’s employee ownership deal comes after a tricky few years for the veg box company. Although it enjoyed a boom in orders during the pandemic lockdowns, many customers have since returned to shopping in supermarkets and local stores. Sales slid 12% to £97m and profits, before tax and payment of a profit share to staff, shrank to £3m in the year to the end of last month, from £6.2m a year before amid increases in the cost of produce, labour, distribution and energy. However, the group now delivers 65,000 boxes a week compared with 50,000 when it made the first move to employee ownership, while sales have risen by more than 50% in that time. “Riverford is a powerful example of the potential that can be unlocked through employee ownership,” said James de le Vingne, chief executive of the Employee Ownership Association. Rob Haward, the managing director of Riverford, said staff ownership protected the group’s “values and purpose” in a way that a sale to new owners who might have “quite different motives” might not. “Not being beholden to a small group of shareholders who want a quick return enables us to think long term,” he said, adding that the arrangement “makes for a leaner and more motivated business and the structure helps decision-making”. He said trading had stabilised after the pandemic boom and subsequent retreat and there was now room for growth as concern about “protection of the planet and fair treatment of farmers is coming back into the consciousness of consumers”. However, the group was forced to put up the price of its vegetable boxes by about 5% in October, and Haward said it was likely to have to consider a similar price rise this summer as the cost of producing vegetables had soared."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/apr/20/frightening-record-busting-heat-and-drought-hit-europe-in-2022","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-04-20T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"‘Frightening’: record-busting heat and drought hit Europe in 2022","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/20/frightening-record-busting-heat-and-drought-hit-europe-in-2022","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/apr/20/frightening-record-busting-heat-and-drought-hit-europe-in-2022","fields":{"headline":"‘Frightening’: record-busting heat and drought hit Europe in 2022","bodyText":"The climate crisis had “frightening” impacts in Europe last year, with heatwaves killing more than 20,000 people and drought withering crops, an EU report has found. Its writers said drought was already baked in for many farmers in 2023. The only way to limit the rising damages of global heating was rapidly to cut carbon emissions, they said. The report, from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), said widespread heatwaves had led to Europe suffering its hottest summer on record in 2022, by a large margin. These would have been virtually impossible without global heating and had led to many premature deaths. People in southern Europe endured 70-100 days of heat stress, where the temperature felt like at least 32C, accounting for wind and other factors. In the UK, temperatures passed 40C for the first time. The heat, plus low rainfall, caused drought that affected more than a third of the continent at its peak, the report said, making it the driest year on record. Flows in almost two-thirds of Europe’s rivers were lower than average. High temperatures also meant that the carbon emissions from summer wildfires were the highest in 15 years and the European Alps lost record amounts of ice from glaciers. Overall, Europe experienced its second-warmest year ever recorded, with temperatures rising at twice the global average rate – faster than on any other continent. Over the past five years, the average temperature has been 2.2C higher than in the pre-industrial era. One bright spot in the report was that Europe received its highest amount of solar radiation in 40 years, owing to lower cloud cover, enabling above-average levels of solar-power generation. “The findings are frightening, I have to say, but I think we have to know the truth,” said Mauro Facchini, head of earth observation at the European Commission. “We have more and more extreme events happening in Europe. Every one of us can witness that.” Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S, said: “We are really moving into an uncharted territory.” The report should be seen as “yet another wake-up call to accelerate our efforts” to cut carbon emissions, which also hit record levels in 2022, he said. Scientists recently predicted that the imminent return of the El Niño climate phenomenon would cause global temperatures to rise “off the chart”. Dr Rebecca Emerton, the lead author of the C3S report, said: “We cannot stop these climate impacts – we can only limit [them] by reducing greenhouse gas emissions rapidly.” She said a dry winter and spring in 2023 meant more drought was on the way. “Unfortunately, the impacts are probably already in place for the growing season, so we’re likely to see reduced crop production this year,” she said. Without global heating, droughts such as the record northern hemisphere drought in 2022 would have been expected only once every four centuries. Prof Daniela Schmidt, at the University of Bristol, UK, said: “We are clearly not prepared for droughts like we have seen in the last year, given the losses in agriculture, scorched plants and fish in dwindling rivers. We need to invest to adapt.” The C3S report also examined the Arctic and said Greenland had experienced record-breaking ice-sheet melt during exceptional heatwaves in September, when average temperatures were up to 8C higher than average. A separate report, also published on Thursday, showed that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets had lost ice every year since polar satellite records began in 1992, with the seven worst melting years all occurring in the past decade. The melting drives up sea levels and coastal flooding across the planet. The study, published in the journal Earth System Science Data, found that the polar ice sheets lost 7.6tn tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2020, equivalent to a giant ice cube 12 miles (20km) in height. Scientists predict that if the ice sheets continue to melt at this pace, they will contribute between 15cm and 27cm to global sea level rise by 2100. Prof Andrew Shepherd, at Northumbria University, UK, said: “We are finally at the stage where we can continuously update our assessments of ice sheet [loss] as there are enough satellites in space monitoring them, which means that people can make use of our findings immediately.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/22/450m-boiler-upgrade-scheme-failing-deliver-heating","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-22T06:00:16Z","webTitle":"£450m boiler upgrade scheme for England and Wales is failing to deliver","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/22/450m-boiler-upgrade-scheme-failing-deliver-heating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/22/450m-boiler-upgrade-scheme-failing-deliver-heating","fields":{"headline":"£450m boiler upgrade scheme for England and Wales is failing to deliver","bodyText":"A scheme to encourage households in England and Wales to upgrade their gas boilers to heat pumps and other low-carbon alternatives is failing to deliver after suffering a “disappointingly low” take-up, a parliamentary report has said. Members of the House of Lords environment and climate change committee have written to ministers urging them to boost the profile of the £450m boiler upgrade scheme, after discovering just a third of its annual budget had been used since its launch last May. The committee said that, by the end of January, £49.7m in vouchers had been issued, equating to 7,641 installations, according to Ofgem figures. The scheme has been allocated £150m a year in funds for three years. Ministers first unveiled plans for £5,000 grants to allow people to install home heat pumps and other low-carbon boiler replacements in 2021 as part of a wider heat and buildings strategy design to help Britain meet its net zero goals. The committee said that public awareness of low-carbon heating systems was “very limited” and promotion of the scheme had been “inadequate”. It also blamed a shortage of heat pump installers and “insufficient independent advice for homeowners” for the lack of take-up. The committee claimed that efforts to present hydrogen as a solution for home heating were to blame. “Hydrogen is not a serious option for home heating for the short to medium-term and misleading messages, including from the government, are negatively affecting take-up of established low-carbon home heating technologies like heat pumps,” they said. Proponents for hydrogen technologies have been lobbying government to boost its use across industry and in the home, while a proposed pilot using hydrogen in homes near Ellesmere Port has drawn opposition from locals who fear life as “lab rats”. When the boiler upgrade scheme was announced in 2021, Labour also condemned the plans as “more of Boris Johnson’s hot air”, without sufficient substance. In a letter sent to the net zero secretary, Lord Callanan, the committee warned that if the current take-up rate continues just half of the allocated budget will be used. It said a government target of hitting 600,000 installations a year was “very unlikely” to be met. Lady Parminter, chair of the environment and climate change committee, said: “The transition to low-carbon heat is fundamental in the path to net zero, given that 17% of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from our homes. “The government must quickly address the barriers we have identified to a successful take-up of the boiler upgrade scheme in order to help grow the take up of low-carbon heating systems. It is vital they do so if we are going to meet our net zero ambitions.” If the boiler upgrade scheme fails to succeed, it would represent the latest roadblock on Britain’s stop-start transition to net zero, with policies such as the effective ban on onshore wind and cuts to solar power incentives drawing criticism. • This article was amended on 22 February 2023 to clarify in the text and headline that the scheme referred to applies in England and Wales only, not the whole of the UK."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/01/jaguar-land-rover-owner-seeks-500m-uk-subsidy-to-build-battery-factory","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-01T12:11:33Z","webTitle":"Jaguar Land Rover owner ‘seeks £500m UK subsidy to build battery factory’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/01/jaguar-land-rover-owner-seeks-500m-uk-subsidy-to-build-battery-factory","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/01/jaguar-land-rover-owner-seeks-500m-uk-subsidy-to-build-battery-factory","fields":{"headline":"Jaguar Land Rover owner ‘seeks £500m UK subsidy to build battery factory’","bodyText":"Jaguar Land Rover’s owner, Tata Motors, has reportedly asked the UK government for more than £500m in state subsidies to build a battery factory in Somerset, in a move seen as crucial to the future of the British car industry. Tata, the Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has asked for the money in the form of grants and support packages such as assistance for energy costs and research funding, the Guardian understands. The carmaker is choosing between a potential site in Somerset and another in Spain, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the £500m figure. Spain has been offering large grants to companies considering battery production, in the hopes that it can attract the new industry with the potential for cheap solar power. The decision on where JLR, Britain’s biggest carmaker, sources its batteries is seen as a key test of the strength of the government’s desire to sustain a large car industry. One person with knowledge of JLR’s strategy said it was likely that a final decision would come within the next two months. “We may be already past added-on time in extra time,” the person said. “If JLR, as the UK’s biggest motor manufacturer, can’t make a business case to build electric batteries in this country, who else is going to build batteries in this country?” The UK government had offered JLR a funding package that was larger than those from rivals in the EU, the person said. However, higher energy costs for industry than other European nations were a key issue, given the needs of a gigafactory. Other industry sources have suggested the Tata gigafactory talks are linked to those on support for the conglomerate’s steelworks at Port Talbot. The government has offered £300m to help the works upgrade to lower-emission technology. The Tata Motors chief financial officer, PB Balaji, said last month that the company was planning a plant in India and another in Europe to produce battery cells. JLR was unable to say whether the reference to Europe included the UK. A senior car industry source said there was “no financial logic” to JLR supplying its UK factories with batteries from Spain as the cost of transporting the batteries by sea and road would be likely to negate any savings from cheaper labour. “There is zero arbitrage,” the source said. “I think they are just positioning to get money.” A £500m subsidy would represent a very large investment for the UK government in a single project. Its “automotive transformation fund”, the key vehicle for supporting the UK industry’s shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, is only worth £1bn in total. However, the government is under pressure to show it is committed to a future for the UK car industry, particularly after the collapse of Britishvolt, a startup that was lauded by the former prime minister Boris Johnson before its collapse this year. Some experts suggest the industry, a source of well-paid and secure jobs, especially in the Midlands, will wither without gigafactories to supply car factories. Others dispute that, pointing out that manufacturers including Stellantis and Toyota plan to supply batteries for their British factories from outside the UK.

But customers could face shortfalls, particularly if cold weather coincided with low levels of renewable energy generation. “The risk of gas shortfalls each year from winter 2023 to 2026 in all southern jurisdictions remains under extreme weather conditions and periods of high gas-powered electricity generation, with those risks further exacerbated if gas storage levels are insufficient,” said Aemo’s chief executive, Daniel Westerman. “While production capacity commitments have increased for 2023 compared to the 2022 GSOO and several key infrastructure projects are on track for delivery, there is forecast to be a 16% reduction in production capacity this winter compared to 2022 in Victoria, which increases supply pressure in the southern regions,” he said. Although Australia is one of the world’s largest producers of gas, most of the supply in the eastern states is earmarked for export. The main southern fields in Bass Strait are in decline, and may result in Victoria becoming a net-importer by the winter of 2027, according to Aemo’s projections. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A prolonged and extensive cold snap last winter sent demand soaring and triggered a suspension of the national electricity market. Although gas is generally declining as a fuel for power generation, its high cost relative to historical levels and limited availability can trigger electricity price spikes as happened last year. The impact of the suspension contributed to rises in the proposed default market offers for the coming year of up to a third, regulators reported on Wednesday. Gas demand is forecast to peak more often during winter than summer when there is less solar power and “wind droughts” can set in. Victoria may be the most vulnerable among the states to shortages due to its relatively high dependence on gas space heating. Aemo forecast total available supply from the state’s Gippsland region would drop 13% from 2022’s output of 326PJ of gas to 284PJ this year, and more than halve to 130PJ in 2027. Port Campbell’s output would drop a third this year to 32PJ before more than doubling to 73PJ by 2024 as four new committed wells begin production. “Unless new Victorian supply is developed, Victoria is forecast to become a net importer of gas from winter 2027, as Victorian annual consumption exceeds Victorian production,” Aemo said. “Victorian supply adequacy is projected to tighten in the later years of the outlook period and an annual supply and peak day shortfall is forecast in 2027.” The potential supply gap for Victoria is forecast even though the state’s gas consumption is projected to fall 9.1% by 2027. But investments “are needed in the near term to ensure operational solutions from 2027”, Aemo said. Across all states except Western Australia, Aemo forecasts residential and small commercial gas consumption “to gradually decline in the short term, with more significant fuel-switching in the medium to longer term as the economy transitions to meet net zero emissions goals”. “Overall, electrification is forecast to reduce natural gas consumption from residential and small commercial consumers by 158PJ, down to 75PJ by 2042,” it said. “If the rate of electrification is slower than forecast, the risk of supply gaps increases, further highlighting the uncertainty in the investment needed in gas supply.” Aemo said the assessments assume gas from Queensland’s LNG exporters is made available to the domestic market when required to avert domestic shortfalls."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/2023/jan/05/screen-and-heard-tiktok-changing-pop-shows-rosalia-lorde-1975","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-05T15:00:23Z","webTitle":"Screen and heard: is TikTok changing the way pop stars perform?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jan/05/screen-and-heard-tiktok-changing-pop-shows-rosalia-lorde-1975","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2023/jan/05/screen-and-heard-tiktok-changing-pop-shows-rosalia-lorde-1975","fields":{"headline":"Screen and heard: is TikTok changing the way pop stars perform?","bodyText":"After a punishing two years for the live music industry, pop shows returned with full force in 2022, with many of the world’s top-tier stars jostling to see their fans in a live setting once again. Punters have been faced with an embarrassment of riches, from Harry Styles’ multi-night US arena residencies to Charli XCX’s Grecian rave fantasia to Dua Lipa’s Studio 54-esque disco spectacular. But even if you couldn’t afford the higher-than-ever price tags for big pop shows – the result of a significant labour shortage and the need for artists to recoup losses after two years without touring – it was also easier than ever, in 2022, to experience shows from afar. The year’s most-talked about tours – Lady Gaga’s Chromatica Ball, Lorde’s Solar Power tour, Rosalía for Motomami and the 1975’s At Their Very Best – felt as though they were designed to be shared on social media, with clips from each show proving inescapable on TikTok and Twitter. Each night of Gaga’s tour trended on Twitter; each new 1975 show has led to a flood of new footage of frontman Matty Healy doing all manner of outrageous things from kissing fans to eating raw meat. For fans watching online, the beats of each show became as indelible as the actual hits. Tobias Rylander, who designed the 1975’s tour, says he’s always trying to put together “a show that reads well on social media”. Over his time working with the band over the past decade, he says, his designs have become increasingly “Instagram-ready” – the band’s previous tour, for example, featured vertical screens, “so people could actually hold their phone the way they wanted to and take pretty pictures.” Rylander even says that he tries to design shows “so that any fans googling or YouTubing the show will be able to tell, by the colour of the thumbnail, what year it was and what song it was”. For the 1975 At Their Very Best tour, Rylander and the band wanted to highlight the performers onstage – a shift from the bright LED screens and coloured lights of past shows – so he instead conceptualised a house set lit in white, like a theatre production. Part of this was due to Covid: Rylander says that because lighting technology, trucks and crews are “twice, if not three times” more expensive than pre-pandemic, “we couldn’t afford the big, expensive tech lights”. Rylander and the band were also conscious of their environmental impact, and the house set allowed them to build a show with few bespoke parts that would have to be shipped from continent to continent. Instead, the set is largely built of steel and aluminium, and has created “minimal landfill waste”. Still, one thing didn’t change: “We wanted the set to read well on camera, both moving image and still.” Rylander isn’t the only designer keeping fan footage in mind when working with pop stars. LeRoy Bennett, a lighting and production designer who works extensively with Lady Gaga, as well as Paul McCartney, Ariana Grande and the Weeknd, says that he and Gaga were “absolutely” thinking about social media when designing the Chromatica Ball. “I take that approach quite a bit because social media has become such a big part of the world,” he says. When conceptualising the Chromatica Ball, Bennett was drawn to the “stark, strong, harsh” world of brutalist architecture; the resulting show featured a dramatic grey set bright enough to be perfectly captured for social media and neutral enough for Gaga’s outlandish outfits to stand in stark relief. “The people way at the back have to see the artist – so when you light an artist, you have to pretty much do what you would do for a television show,” he says. “It’s a combination of theatre and TV, and a rock show and a pop show. It lends itself to that social media-friendly atmosphere.” The clean, dynamic design of the Chromatica Ball is mirrored in the sets of Rosalía, the 1975 and Lorde. Rosalía performs on a brightly lit white backdrop against which she and her dancers dance and scoot around the stage. Lorde’s show is architectural and geometric – and plainly striking enough for one fan to get a tattoo of the show’s bold centrepiece. All four shows look great on TikTok. In Rosalía’s, the gigantic vertical screens on each side the stage outright mimic the video-sharing app’s interface. Phones are situated around the stage for her musicians and dancers to broadcast to the screens throughout the show, with certain moments – selfie videos with fans taken from high-up, a spare ballad with a phone propped against the piano lid as she plays – echoing the familiar visual formatting and intimacy of popular videos on the platform. Chiara Stephenson, a stage designer who has worked with Björk and the xx, and who worked on Lorde’s tour, describes herself as a “theatre creature” – she trained under Michael Grandage and Christopher Oram – and says she wanted to bring a “theatrical sensibility” to the Solar Power shows. Unlike Bennett and Rylander, Stephenson says that she wasn’t thinking about social media when working on the tour, despite the telegenic setup. “With the amount of people coming to see the show over the months, you can’t get away with it just being aesthetic,” she says. “What [Lorde] is doing is so rooted and grounded in the music that the law for us was: what’s enhancing the music? What’s telling a story?” Lorde’s intention, she says, was to step away from the gargantuan LED screens that are often standard in pop shows and return to something more analogue, but still distinctive. “I’m most excited, when you’re in an arena or theatre, feeling the three-dimensionality of the light coming through whatever the sculpture or design is on stage,” Stephenson says. “That’s something you can’t ever really capture – I’m delighted that it photographed well, but that wasn’t the guiding reason.” Even so, it’s undeniable that many of the year’s most viral moments on TikTok were derived from live shows this year: Rosalía elaborately chewing gum during her song Bizcochito, Healy relentlessly touching his crotch, Gaga belting a power ballad while wearing an Edward Scissorhands-style claw and standing on a flaming stage. Perhaps these moments are reverse-engineered to go viral or, perhaps, fans are just sharing more content than they used to, thrilled to be back in arenas and metres away from their heroes. “Doing shows after all this time, it’s a joyous moment for the audience,” says Bennett. “People always want to go to see live entertainment. I mean – you can only watch so much TV.” The 1975’s At Their Very Best UK tour starts in Brighton on 8 January"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jan/19/growth-in-rooftop-solar-slows-due-to-lockdowns-and-supply-chain-issues","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-01-18T23:38:42Z","webTitle":"Growth in rooftop solar slows due to lockdowns and supply chain issues ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/growth-in-rooftop-solar-slows-due-to-lockdowns-and-supply-chain-issues","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/growth-in-rooftop-solar-slows-due-to-lockdowns-and-supply-chain-issues","fields":{"headline":"Growth in rooftop solar slows due to lockdowns and supply chain issues ","bodyText":"Rooftop solar took a hit in 2021 with the industry growing a third less than expected thanks to lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, despite still showing strong growth overall. More than 3m households and small businesses across the country now have solar panel systems installed, with the milestone reached in November. According to registration data provided by solar consultancy company SunWiz, 3.24GW of new solar capacity was added across the country last year, representing 10% growth on the previous year. These figures include small rooftop systems of less than 100MW registered by homeowners and small businesses, and do not include large, industrial-scale solar installations. Queensland now has the most installed capacity, with 4,483MW, closely followed by New South Wales (4,256MW) and Victoria (3,839MW). Australia continues to lead the world for solar installations with a total installed capacity of just under 17GW nationwide. The growth rate was lower than in previous years, with 2021 bookended by a surge in installations in March and December, and a drop off in between. Warwick Johnston, managing director at SunWiz, said the third-quarter slump was caused by the pandemic as lockdowns stopped installers from entering people’s homes, while supply chain problems meant wait times and shipping costs grew. He expected these issues to continue in 2022 but for demand to remain strong, as people sought to upgrade their old solar systems to generate enough capacity to support an electric vehicle in the future. “There’s 8.5m dwellings in Australia and we’re reaching a significant fraction of them already,” Johnston said. “Even in economically uncertain times people find that solar is as good an investment they can make. “It’s a safer bet than betting on crypto.” Separate data provided by Tristan Edis, an analyst with Green Energy Markets, showed photovoltaic solar upgrades were much stronger in 2021, and were anticipated to grow through to 2025. Edis said while previous forecasts had anticipated 3,600MW of installed capacity in 2021, roughly a 15% increase compared with 2020, he agreed lockdowns had “put a big dampener on the market”. Despite these short-term constraints, he said it was possible there was an “underlying slowdown” at work as states wound back solar feed-in tariffs that pay people for electricity fed into the grid. “The economics for solar systems have deteriorated across most states over the past two years as feed-in tariffs have been dropping at a faster rate than the purchase cost of a solar system, plus retail electricity prices have begun declining as well,” Edis said. “We have been expecting this would eventually flow through to reduced demand for solar systems, although this slowdown has not come as quickly as we had originally expected, but there are signs that it is now taking place.” Edis said while supply chain issues and a bump in the price of solar panels from manufacturers in China may dent sales in 2022, this was only a “temporary phenomenon” that “shouldn’t affect things beyond this year”. John Grimes, chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, said the industry was still bullish about its prospects. While the anticipated 15% growth rate seen in previous years may continue to be throttled by supply chain issues in 2022, he said demand remained strong. “People trust in solar now. There’s no question about whether it works, or ‘will it cut my power bill?’ – those things have been resolved. The industry’s mature,” Grimes said.

Visible from the I-10 highway, amid the parched plains and sun-baked mountains, it is an improbable sight: a deep blue slick stretching for miles across the Chuckwalla Valley, forming an endless glistening mirror. But something’s not quite right. Closer up, the water’s edge appears blocky and pixelated, with the look of a low-res computer rendering, while its surface is sculpted in orderly geometric ridges, like frozen waves. “We had a guy pull in the other day towing a big boat,” says Don Sneddon, a local resident. “He asked us how to get to the launch ramp to the lake. I don’t think he realised he was looking at a lake of solar panels.” Over the last few years, this swathe of desert has been steadily carpeted with one of the world’s largest concentrations of solar power plants, forming a sprawling photovoltaic sea. On the ground, the scale is almost incomprehensible. The Riverside East Solar Energy Zone – the ground zero of California’s solar energy boom – stretches for 150,000 acres, making it 10 times the size of Manhattan. It is a crucial component of the United States’ green energy revolution. Solar makes up about 3% of the US electricity supply, but the Biden administration hopes it will reach 45% by 2050, primarily by building more huge plants like this across the country’s flat, empty plains. But there’s one thing that the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) – the agency tasked with facilitating these projects on public land – doesn’t seem to have fully taken into account: the desert isn’t quite as empty as it thought. It might look like a barren wilderness, but this stretch of the Mojave is a rich and fragile habitat for endangered species and home to thousand-year-old carbon-capturing woodlands, ancient Indigenous cultural sites – and hundreds of people’s homes. Residents have watched ruefully for years as solar plants crept over the horizon, bringing noise and pollution that’s eroding a way of life in their desert refuge. “We feel like we’ve been sacrificed,” says Mark Carrington, who, like Sneddon, lives in the Lake Tamarisk resort, a community for over-55s near Desert Center, which is increasingly surrounded by solar farms. “We’re a senior community, and half of us now have breathing difficulties because of all the dust churned up by the construction. I moved here for the clean air, but some days I have to go outside wearing goggles. What was an oasis has become a little island in a dead solar sea.” Concerns have intensified following the recent news of a project, called Easley, that would see the panels come just 200 metres from their backyards. Residents claim that excessive water use by solar plants has contributed to the drying up of two local wells, while their property values have been hit hard, with several now struggling to sell their homes. “It has been psychologically gruelling,” says Teresa Pierce, who moved here six years ago. “From the constant pounding of the metal posts to the endless dust storms. I now have allergies that I’d never had before – my arms burn all day long and my nose is always running. I feel like a prisoner in my own home.” Elizabeth Knowles, director of community engagement for Intersect Power, the company behind the Easley project, said it knew of residents’ concerns and was exploring how to move the project further from the community. “Since being made aware of their concerns, we have been in regular contact with residents to listen to their concerns and incorporate their feedback into our planning efforts.” ‘90% of the story is underground’ The mostly flat expanse south-east of Joshua Tree national park was originally identified as a prime site for industrial-scale solar power under the Obama administration, which fast-tracked the first project, Desert Sunlight, in 2011. It was the largest solar plant in the world at the time of completion, in 2015, covering an area of almost 4,000 acres, and it opened the floodgates for more. Since then, 15 projects have been completed or are under construction, with momentous mythological names like Athos and Oberon. Ultimately, if built to full capacity, this shimmering patchwork quilt could generate 24 gigawatts, enough energy to power 7m homes. But as the pace of construction has ramped up, so have voices questioning the cumulative impact of these projects on the desert’s populations – both human and non-human. Kevin Emmerich worked for the National Park Service for over 20 years before setting up Basin &amp; Range Watch in 2008, a non-profit that campaigns to conserve desert life. He says solar plants create myriad environmental problems, including habitat destruction and “lethal death traps” for birds, which dive at the panels, mistaking them for water. He says one project bulldozed 600 acres of designated critical habitat for the endangered desert tortoise, while populations of Mojave fringe-toed lizards and bighorn sheep have also been afflicted. “We’re trying to solve one environmental problem by creating so many others.” Such adverse impacts are supposed to be prevented by the desert renewable energy conservation plan (DRECP), which was approved in 2016 after years of consultation and covers almost 11m acres of California. But Emmerich and others think the process is flawed, allowing streamlined environmental reviews and continual amendments that they say trample conservationists’ concerns. “The plan talks about the importance of making sure there’s enough room between the solar projects to preserve wildlife routes,” says Chris Clarke of the National Parks Conservation Association. “But the individual assessments for each project do not take into account the cumulative impact. The solar plants are blocking endangered species’ natural transport corridors across the desert.” Much of the critical habitat in question is dry wash woodland, made up of “microphyll” shrubs and trees like palo verde, ironwood, catclaw and honey mesquite, which grow in a network of green veins across the desert. But, compared with old-growth forests of giant redwoods, or expanses of venerable Joshua trees, the significance of these small desert shrubs can be hard for the untrained eye to appreciate. “When people look across the desert, they just see scrubby little plants that look dead half the time,” says Robin Kobaly, a botanist who worked at the BLM for over 20 years as a wildlife biologist before founding the Summertree Institute, an environmental education non-profit. “But they are missing 90% of the story – which is underground.” Her book, The Desert Underground, features illustrated cross-sections that reveal the hidden universe of roots extended up to 150ft below the surface, supported by branching networks of fungal mycelium. “This is how we need to look at the desert,” she says, turning a diagram from her book upside-down. “It’s an underground forest – just as majestic and important as a giant redwood forest, but we can’t see it.” The reason this root network is so valuable, she argues, because it operates as an enormous “carbon sink” where plants breathe in carbon dioxide at the surface and out underground, forming layers of sedimentary rock known as caliche. “If left undisturbed, the carbon can remain stored for thousands of years,’” she says. Desert plants are some of the oldest carbon-capturers around: Mojave yuccas can be up to 2,500 years old, while the humble creosote bush can live for over 10,000 years. These plants also sequester carbon in the form of glomalin, a protein secreted around the fungal threads connected to the plants’ roots, thought to store a third of the world’s soil carbon. “By digging these plants up,” says Kobaly, “we are removing the most efficient carbon sequestration units on the planet – and releasing millennia of stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Meanwhile, the solar panels we are replacing them with have a lifespan of around 25 years.” For Alfredo Acosta Figueroa, the unstoppable march of desert solar represents an existential threat of a different kind. As a descendant of the Chemehuevi and Yaqui nations, he has watched as what he says are numerous sacred Indigenous sites have been bulldozed. “The history of the world is told by these sites,” he says, “by geoglyphs, petroglyphs, and pictographs. Yet the government has chosen to ignore and push aside the creation story in the name of progress.” His organisation, La Cuna de Aztlan, acts as custodian of over 300 such sites in the Lower Colorado River Basin, many of which, he says, have already been damaged beyond repair. He claims that a 200ft-long geoglyph of Kokopelli, a flute-playing god, was destroyed by a new road to one of the solar plants, while an image of Cicimitl, an Aztec spirit said to guide souls to the afterlife, is also threatened. “The solar projects cannot destroy just one sacred site without destroying the sacredness of the entire area,” he adds. “They are all connected.” He cites a 2010 report by the California Energy Commission, which includes testimony from the heritage experts Dr Elizabeth Bagwell and Beverly E Bastian stating that “more than 800 sites within the I-10 Corridor and 17,000 sites within the Southern California Desert Region will potentially be destroyed”, and that “mitigation can reduce the impact of the destruction, but not to a less-than-significant level”. The Bureau of Land Management declined a request for an interview. In an emailed statement, its public affairs officer, Michelle Van Der Linden, did not directly address questions about solar plants’ water use, health issues, or ecological and archeological impacts, but said the agency operated within the applicable laws and acts. “The DRECP effort was a multiple-year collaborative discussion resulting in an agreement reached between the BLM, numerous environmental groups, partners and stakeholders, in regards to the application and decision process related to renewable energy projects. Project issues were and continue to be identified and addressed through the National Environmental Policy Act process, which includes the opportunity for public engagement and input and also addresses many of the cumulative impacts and additional environmental, social and economic concerns mentioned.” ‘So many other places we should put solar’ But a more fundamental question remains: why build in the desert, when thousands of acres of rooftops in urban areas lie empty across California? “There are so many other places we should be putting solar,” says Clarke, of the National Parks Conservation Association, from homes to warehouses to parking lots and industrial zones. He describes the current model of large-scale, centralised power generation, hundreds of miles from where the power is actually needed, as “a 20th-century business plan for a 21st-century problem”. “The conversion of intact wildlife habitat should be the absolute last resort, but it’s become our first resort – just because it’s the easy fix.” Vincent Battaglia, founder of Renova Energy, a rooftop solar company based in Palm Desert, agrees. “We’ve been led to believe that all solar is good solar,” he says. “But it’s not when it molests pristine land, requires hundreds of millions of dollars to transmit to city centres, and loses so much power along the way. It is simply preserving the monopoly of the big energy companies.” California recently reduced the incentive for homeowners to install rooftop solar panels after it slashed the amount that they can earn from feeding power back into the grid by about 75%. Forecasters suggest that, after doubling in size from 2020 to 2022, the market for residential solar installations is expected to decrease by nearly 40% by 2024 as a result. Battaglia is optimistic that home energy storage is the answer. “Batteries are the future,” he says. “With solar panels on rooftops and batteries in homes, we’ll finally be able to cut the cord from the big utility companies. Soon, those fields of desert solar farms will be defunct – left as rusting relics of another age.” Back in Lake Tamarisk, the residents are preparing for the long battle ahead. “They picked on a little town and thought they could wipe us out,” says Sneddon. “But they can’t just mow us over like they did the desert tortoises. “They thought we were a bunch of uneducated redneck hicks living out here in the desert,” says Pierce. “We’re going to show them they were wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/10/weatherwatch-when-the-wind-drops-keeping-renewable-energy-supplies-steady","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-10T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: when the wind drops – keeping renewable energy supplies steady","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/weatherwatch-when-the-wind-drops-keeping-renewable-energy-supplies-steady","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/10/weatherwatch-when-the-wind-drops-keeping-renewable-energy-supplies-steady","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: when the wind drops – keeping renewable energy supplies steady","bodyText":"When the weather is calm, wind turbines stop turning. That’s obvious, but as the UK increasingly relies on wind power generation, so an energy crunch looms if the wind doesn’t blow. One way to smooth out the vagaries of weather for renewable energy supplies is a European super powergrid. These so-called interconnectors across national borders are already here. On 1 October, a 720km (450-mile) undersea power cable went live between the UK and Norway, the world’s longest subsea interconnector. This allows Norway to export surplus hydropower to the UK, but if water levels drop in the Norwegian hydro reservoirs during dry weather, the shortfall could be supplemented by wind generation from the UK. An even longer interconnector is proposed between the UK and Iceland, tapping into Iceland’s huge supply of renewable hydro and geothermal energy. North Africa could also be plugged in – there is an ambitious proposal to link the UK to a projected giant solar scheme in Morocco.

The latest energy dynamics report by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) showed wholesale spot prices in the national electricity market (NEM) averaged $83/MWh, down more than a 10th from the December quarter and two-thirds lower than the record average $264/MWh in the June quarter last year. Rooftop solar output alone averaged almost 3GW for the March quarter, up 23% from a year earlier. That increase contributed to a drop in “operational demand” in the NEM to an average of 14.38GW, or the lowest since 2005. Low demand records were set in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. “Growing renewable output across the NEM helped drive a first-quarter record with 12% of dispatch intervals having negative or zero prices,” the Aemo chief executive, Daniel Westerman, said. “Between 9am and 5pm, wholesale electricity prices were negative in South Australia and Victoria 60% and 55% of the time, respectively.” Gas, typically the most costly fuel for electricity generation, provided its smallest first-quarter share of supplies since 2005. Overall gas demand in eastern Australia fell 9%, with domestic consumption dropping to its lowest for any March quarter since 2016, Aemo said. Aemo’s quarterly energy reports offer snapshots of the electricity sector’s trajectory. Rising energy costs in the past year have been one propellant for inflation, while supply has arguably become less reliable as ageing coal-fired power plants close or break down.

Wholesale prices also spiked in February and March in northern regions during late-season heatwaves, revealing shortfalls even after three relatively mild summers in a row. Renewables continue to expand their share of the market, cutting emissions from electricity generation in the process. New and recently commissioned grid-scale solar and wind units lifted generation by an average 330MW and 134MW, respectively, Aemo said. Output averaged 4.65GW, or 11% more than for the March quarter of 2022. For a half hour on 5 March, renewables supplied 65.8% of NEM generation, a record share for that quarter, topping the previous high set a year earlier by 4.4 percentage points. NEM emissions both in total and per MWh declined to record lows for the first quarter of the year. Electricity makes up about one-third of Australia’s carbon pollution, the largest share of the economy. For the quarter, emissions totalled 28.8m tonnes of CO2-equivalent, down by 5.1% from a year earlier. Coal and gas-fired generation dropped 710MW over the year. Gas shed 20%, or 280MW on average from a year ago, to 1.113GW. Black coal-fired generation output eased 1.3%, or 137MW, to about 10.5GW, while brown coal dropped 7.4%, or 293MW, to 3.65GW. The federal climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the report showed the government’s energy price relief plan to cap gas and coal prices in December had “delivered a near-halving of electricity future prices, which are a big factor on future energy bills”. Future prices for the mainland states in the NEM for the 2023-24 financial year peaked at $230/MWh in the December quarter, before ending 2022 at an average $102/MWh, the report said. However, while those future prices averaged $107/MWh during the March quarter, they ended the month on the rise. New South Wales, which will see the Liddell coal-fired power plant close on Friday, posted the largest rise at 31% among the states to $145/MWh. Queensland’s future prices rose 26% to $126/MWh and Victoria’s 25% to $96/MWh, while South Australia’s was little changed for the quarter at $113/MWh. Separately, NSW regulator IPART will lift the price paid to households exporting surplus solar power to the grid by as much as 89%, reflecting higher wholesale electricity prices. Exporters will receive 7.7 to 9.4 cents/kWh in 2023-24 from their electricity retailer. “Wholesale prices have increased significantly over the last year, mainly due to the war in Ukraine which has led to higher gas and coal prices and disruptions in several large coal-fired power plants,” IPART chair, Carmel Donnelly, said. “IPART’s feed-in tariff benchmark is up from around five cents this time last year.” The last big increase was in 2017-18, when IPART effectively doubled the benchmark feed-in tariff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T14:00:06Z","webTitle":"Solar to soon offer grid more capacity than coal, consultancy says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/28/solar-already-australias-largest-source-of-electricity-as-rooftop-capacity-hits-20gw-consultancy-says","fields":{"headline":"Solar to soon offer grid more capacity than coal, consultancy says","bodyText":"Australia’s rooftops now boast 20 gigawatts of solar panels and will soon have the capacity to produce more electricity than the country’s entire coal industry, according to the industry consultancy SunWiz. Almost one in three Australian households have solar photovoltaics – or solar panels – the highest penetration in the world. Queensland had the highest share of solar panels installed on dwellings deemed suitable for the technology with an 82% penetration, ahead of South Australia’s 78%, New South Wales’ 51% and Victoria’s 43%. The take-up of solar PV has quickened. It took about 11 years for Australia to reach its first 10GW of capacity, while the second 10GW took just four years, according to SunWiz. Combining the household solar panel capacity with the 11GW of large-scale solar plants, “solar energy is already Australia’s largest fuel source for electrical power in Australia”, according to Warwick Johnston, the managing director of SunWiz. Once AGL Energy closes the remaining units of its 1680MW Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW’s Hunter Valley next month, rooftop solar alone will have more so-called name-plate capacity than Australia’s remaining coal fleet, SunWiz said. That measure refers to the output a device is intended to be able to produce. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Queensland’s relatively sunny climate has encouraged residents there to host 5.2GW of solar PV, with the 1 millionth rooftop solar panel system to be installed soon. NSW is installing the most additional capacity of any state, with almost 100MW being added monthly, SunWiz said. Rooftop solar is often the largest supplier of electricity during the middle of the day, helping to drive demand in the national electricity market to record lows, including during the December quarter. The relative abundance of solar power, though, is creating challenges for large-scale generators, particularly operators of coal plants that struggle to ramp output up and down to meet fluctuating demand. According to a report by Green Energy Markets for the Clean Energy Regulator, the next 10GW of rooftop solar will take just over three years to be installed. Total installations will near 3GW in 2023 and exceed 3.2GW next year, setting a new annual high after the industry recovered from the Covid-related disruptions to supplies from China. Consumers, too, are increasingly focused on the prospect of power prices rising and staying high, according to Tristan Edis, director of analysis at Green Energy Markets. “The price of a system had gone up quite a bit” in 2021-22, at a time when electricity prices had started to drop, Edis said. “And then kind of all hell broke loose with the forward market,” he said, referring to future prices on the electricity market. The Australian Electricity Regulator in May 2022 lifted its default power prices by as much as 20% in a decision delayed by the Morrison government until after the federal election. Since then, the Albanese government has intervened with price caps for coal and gas in a bid to limit the size of further increases. Households that have solar are also increasingly looking to expand or more likely replace older, smaller units, the Green Energy Markets report said. “Upgrades and replacements accounted for 19% of total PV capacity installed in 2022 and we expect that this will increase to 27% by 2027,” the report said. SunWiz’s Johnston said the market for rooftop solar “is not at saturation point – that’s still a long way off”. More households were also taking up larger solar systems particularly if they planned to add batteries or operate electric vehicles. About 15% of solar system installations now also include batteries, he said. The prospects for large-scale solar, though, were not so promising, at least in the near-term. “The pipeline of solar farms under development has dried up, and we expect it to be the worst year for solar farms since Australia started their rollout in earnest in 2018,” Johnston said. The headline on this article was amended on 1 March 2023 to clarify that while solar now has more capacity than other energy sources in Australia, it is not the largest single source of electricity generation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/23/drax-power-station-profits-nearly-double-call-for-subsidies-cut","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-23T11:06:41Z","webTitle":"Call to cut UK subsidies as Drax power station profits nearly double","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/23/drax-power-station-profits-nearly-double-call-for-subsidies-cut","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/23/drax-power-station-profits-nearly-double-call-for-subsidies-cut","fields":{"headline":"Call to cut UK subsidies as Drax power station profits nearly double","bodyText":"Ministers are under pressure to cut subsidies to the operator of Britain’s biggest power station after it reported an 84% increase in annual profits, helped by high electricity prices. Drax, the power generator that owns the eponymous plant in North Yorkshire, posted underlying profits of £731m for 2022, up from £398m a year earlier. The company also increased its dividend by 11.7% to 21p a share – an £84m payout to shareholders. Drax, which has faced criticism over its use of biomass, has benefited from soaring power prices over the past year. Electricity prices are linked to wholesale gas costs, which have risen sharply since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Will Gardiner, the chief executive, said: “Drax delivered a strong performance in 2022, and played a significant role in ensuring security of supply during a challenging year for the UK’s energy system.” Drax, which supplies up to 6% of the UK’s electricity, and is seen as a source of when weather conditions preclude significant wind and solar power generation. Climate campaigners have accused Drax of greenwashing, arguing its biomass operations, which burn wood pellets to produce electricity, are far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. Most of the wood is imported from North America. The former energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called its business model “not sustainable”. Drax was the subject of a BBC Panorama investigation over alleged forest destruction and has also been accused of “environmental racism”. The power company said it had earned £837m in subsidies in 2020 and £885m in 2021. The level of support fell to £617m in 2022 as electricity prices exceed an agreed “strike price” agreed to encourage renewable investment. This meant Drax paid out £33m to the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a government-owned firm, compared with receiving £231m under the same mechanism a year earlier. However, it still received £650m under an older renewable energy scheme. The thinktank Ember has estimated that, from 2012 until 2027, when the support runs out, Drax would have collected more than £11bn in subsidies. The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: “The government pays significant sums in renewable energy subsidies to bioenergy companies making sizeable profits, despite it releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases and harming forests’ ability to absorb carbon. “This directly costs bill payers and families through their energy bills. In the context of the cost of living crisis, the government should be looking into these subsidies and ensuring they are used for proven renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures, rather than harming nature.” Sally-Ann Hart, a Conservative MP, said: “Burning imported wood pellets for electricity is not cheap for bill payers. Given the growing environmental concerns, ministers shouldn’t commit to new subsidies for this energy source. “We should prioritise investment in clean and cheap energy sources that keep the lights on and bills low while tackling climate change, not an industry which risks fuelling deforestation.” Research by the Cut Carbon Not Forests coalition found that 62% of 2,005 UK adults surveyed thought it was wrong for the government to hand the bioenergy generator large subsidies, particularly during a cost of living crisis. The SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said: “It’s clear that the British public aren’t falling for the myth that biomass is carbon neutral, no matter how many greenwashing PR stunts companies like Drax pull to convince people otherwise.” Drax is the latest UK energy firm to report a sharp rise in profits, after BP, Shell and the British Gas owner, Centrica. Their gains led to renewed calls for tougher windfall taxes. Some of Drax’s operations are covered by the electricity generator levy introduced this year but the company said recognition in the construction of the tax that biomass costs were higher than those of windfarms meant the levy “should not have an adverse impact on biomass generation”. Separately, more than 180 staff at the Drax plant near Selby, in North Yorkshire, have begun a series of strikes that will run through February, March and April after rejecting a proposed pay deal. The company also agreed to extend the life of two coal units through the winter after a government request, amid fears over power cuts. The units have not been called into action but Drax said on Thursday that they “delivered income during the final quarter of 2022”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/25/solar-farm-plans-refused-highest-rate-five-years-great-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-25T11:00:02Z","webTitle":"Solar farm plans refused at highest rate for five years in Great Britain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/25/solar-farm-plans-refused-highest-rate-five-years-great-britain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/25/solar-farm-plans-refused-highest-rate-five-years-great-britain","fields":{"headline":"Solar farm plans refused at highest rate for five years in Great Britain","bodyText":"Solar farms are being refused planning permission in Great Britain at the highest rate in five years, analysis has found, with projects which would have cut £100m off annual electricity bills turned down in the past 18 months. Planning permission for 23 solar farms was refused across England, Wales and Scotland between January 2021 and July 2022, which could have produced enough renewable energy to power an estimated 147,000 homes annually, according to analysis of government figures by the planning and development consultancy Turley. The refusals have jumped significantly since the start of 2021 – the research found only four projects were refused planning permission during 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 combined. Of the 27 declined solar farms between 2019 and 2022, 19 are in Conservative constituencies. Four were in Labour constituencies, three in Scottish National party constituencies, and one in a Liberal Democrat constituency. There are fears such refusals could increase further as the Tory leadership contenders, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have made disparaging comments about solar farms. South-west and eastern England had the highest number of refusals in the last 18 months, with four projects turned down in each region. Wales, the West Midlands and Scotland each had three refusals, while the east Midlands, north-east and south-east of England each had two planning applications turned down. Analysts at the thinktank Green Alliance said the rejected projects were large solar farms at an average of about 30MW each, which may account for the planning refusals as it is easier to get smaller farms approved. However, it added that this should not be a reason to refuse planning permission, as larger solar farms could cut bills further. It said the refused solar farms could have cut about £100m off Great Britain’s electricity bills this year. Dustin Benton, the policy director at Green Alliance, said: “We should be building as much cheap, clean energy as we can to reduce people’s energy bills and cut our reliance on Russian gas. This additional solar power generation, if it displaced gas, would have saved over £100m per year in wholesale energy costs.” “By integrating solar panels into fields, even farmers on high-grade land can continue to grow crops at the same time as enjoying the steady income from solar panels.” If Truss proceeds with her plans to crack down on solar farms she would be going against the government’s energy security strategy published this spring. The strategy set out ambitions of generating 70GW of energy from solar technology by 2035. It also promises to consult on amending planning rules to strengthen policy in favour of development on non-protected land, as well as supporting solar that is co-located with other functions such as agriculture and established energy infrastructure. Emma Kelly, an associate director at Turley, said: “Solar should be a key contributor to the energy market, especially as we look to diversify our renewable energy products to ensure maintenance of supply. “The significant uplift in planning permission refusal for solar farms goes entirely against the proposals laid out in the government’s British energy security strategy. Solar power currently contributes 14GW of energy at present, so we have some way to go before reaching the 70GW target. If Liz Truss goes ahead with her plan, the British energy security strategy will need to be rewritten. “Biodiversity is certainly a factor we need to consider with solar farms whilst the ongoing rise of the cost of energy has shown just how important renewable energy generation is for the future of the UK. A growing trend of refusing planning permission for renewable energy projects that are designed to support energy security is a huge step backwards on our road to net zero.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-24T10:48:04Z","webTitle":"Barcelona school and residents create solar energy community","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona school and residents create solar energy community","bodyText":"A secondary school and a residents’ association have teamed up with Barcelona city council to create a solar energy community with the capacity to grow – rooftop by rooftop – across large areas of the city. The solar panels on the roof of Quatre Cantons secondary school in the former industrial district of Poblenou supply power to the school and 30 households in the surrounding area. Each household has 500W of free electricity at its disposal, equivalent to a 25% cut in their bill. The idea was first proposed in 2019, says Marike Charlier, spokesperson for the residents’ association, and began to become a reality in discussions with the Quatre Cantons school. César Ochoa, a maths teacher at the school who also sits on its sustainability committee, said the school’s desire to cut energy consumption dovetailed with the residents’ plans and, in a first for an energy community of this nature, the council agreed to foot the €94,000 (£80,000) cost of installing solar panels on the school’s roof. The 30 households then became clients of Barcelona Energia, the council-run electricity company, replacing the private company Endesa, although the latter has been slow to cede the connection. “Once it’s operational, the school will get 30% of the electricity generated,” Ochoa says. “That will supply only some of its needs, but this is just a pilot project. Obviously, during school holidays this energy will be available to whoever else needs it.” Solar power went into decline in Spain under the previous conservative government after it imposed a “sunshine tax” on individual consumers or energy communities, which the big power companies claimed were unfair competition. The tax was scrapped under the current government and solar installation is soaring, accompanied by a move towards localised, rooftop installations, such as Quatre Cantons, rather than huge solar parks miles from centres of population. Last year Spain produced about 46% of its energy through renewables but solar (1.8%) still lags behind wind (23%) and hydro (11.4%). Under Spanish law, solar installations can only supply power within a 500m radius (the rule is 2km in France and Portugal) but the idea was always to extend it beyond 500m from the school, says Charlier. She points out that there are 11 other public buildings within 500m (1,640ft) of Quatre Cantons where further installations could radically increase the power available and extend the scheme across the neighbourhood. The city council has set itself a goal of a five-fold increase in solar power across the public and private sector by 2030. “These energy communities are really special and they make it possible to find solutions that wouldn’t otherwise be viable, but it isn’t scalable for the whole city,” says Eloi Badia, councillor for climate change and ecological transition. “In the end, the solution for Barcelona is for everyone to have solar panels on their roof.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/27/australias-corporate-regulator-issues-first-fine-for-greenwashing","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-27T05:21:20Z","webTitle":"Australia’s corporate regulator issues first fine for greenwashing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/27/australias-corporate-regulator-issues-first-fine-for-greenwashing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/27/australias-corporate-regulator-issues-first-fine-for-greenwashing","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s corporate regulator issues first fine for greenwashing","bodyText":"The corporate regulator has issued its first penalty for greenwashing, fining Australian company Tlou Energy $53,280.

Tlou was fined for statements and images contained in two ASX announcements. The statements claimed the electricity the company produced would be carbon neutral, that Tlou had environmental approval and the capability to generate certain quantities of electricity from solar power, that a gas-to-power project would be low emissions, and that the company was equally concerned with producing clean energy through the use of renewable sources as it was with developing its gas-to-power project. ASIC was concerned that Tlou either did not have a reasonable basis to make the representations, or that the representations were factually incorrect. Asic’s deputy chair, Sarah Court, said companies promoting their sustainability and green credentials “must ensure they can support those statements and have a reasonable basis for doing so”. “ASIC is currently investigating a number of listed entities, super funds and managed funds in relation to their green credentials claims,” she said. “Companies are on notice that ASIC is actively monitoring the market for potential greenwashing and will take enforcement action, including court action, for serious breaches.” Asic said Tlou had paid the infringement notices this week.

While stressing that he did not want to be seen as a “doomster or gloomster”, Tony Danker, director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), is to use what the organisation is billing as a “major” speech to call for action on several fronts. The comments, while carefully worded and pitched by the CBI as a positive set of ideas rather than direct criticism, will nonetheless be widely seen as a rebuke to No 10 and the Treasury. Speaking at University College London on Monday, Danker will praise Sunak and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, for stabilising the economy after the impact of Liz Truss’s disastrous autumn mini-budget, but will add that both now need to be more proactive. Public services like the NHS, schools and transport require more investment, Danker will say, according to extracts of the speech briefed in advance, adding: “But there isn’t any more money, because there isn’t any growth.” He will say there is a “denial of where our economy is right now compared to our international competitors” which risked the UK suffering through limited ambition. “The current CBI forecast is that the prime minister should comfortably hit his pledge of getting the economy growing by the end of the year, by 0.1%. But my argument is that if our policies today aim for 0.1% growth, it’s the most we’ll ever achieve.” The speech is particularly damning on green-based growth, with Danker saying that “the UK is falling behind rapidly to the Americans and the Europeans, who are outspending and outsmarting us”. While Sunak has talked up his desire to invest in green technology and renewable energy sources, there is resistance among some Tory MPs to areas such as onshore wind and solar power. In contrast, Labour has promised to invest £28bn a year in climate measures. Inaction means the country is “leaving huge amounts of money on the table”, Danker is to argue, saying that in two years the UK lost a potential £4.3bn in green market share. “While our competitors across Europe, Asia and the US are making their move, and going hell for leather, we seem to be second guessing ourselves and hoping for the best.” He will add: “It’s time for us to take those hard decisions, generating the forward momentum not only to limit recession this year but also get us really growing next.” Another strongly worded section sees Danker argue that while there is a good argument for the UK to diverge from EU regulations after Brexit, scrapping up to 4,000 EU-derived laws by the end of 2023, as promised under the retained EU law bill, was “creating huge uncertainty for UK firms”. He will say: “On the UK’s regulatory divergence from Europe, the government is convinced this is a major opportunity for growth. I agree it can be too. But it’s a bit more complicated than scrapping overnight many of the terms of trade we’ve used for decades. “Do we really want to subject the public – and industry – to another round of mass confusion and disruption, just when we’re trying to exit recession?” EU laws should be reviewed and, where needed, repealed as part of a wider strategy, Danker is to say: “Smartly, not the retained EU law bill’s way – foolishly.” Other concerns to be raised by Danker included the imminent demise of the “super deduction” tax incentive for business investment, and a lack of action over issues affecting employees, including expensive childcare and the need for higher skills."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/23/low-carbon-jobs-fell-after-david-cameron-kibosh-on-green-crap-policies-study","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-23T06:00:15Z","webTitle":"Low-carbon jobs fell after Cameron’s kibosh on ‘green crap’ policies – study","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/23/low-carbon-jobs-fell-after-david-cameron-kibosh-on-green-crap-policies-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/23/low-carbon-jobs-fell-after-david-cameron-kibosh-on-green-crap-policies-study","fields":{"headline":"Low-carbon jobs fell after Cameron’s kibosh on ‘green crap’ policies – study","bodyText":"Job opportunities in Britain’s low-carbon economy have fallen sharply since David Cameron’s government decided to cut policies he described as “green crap”, with fewer vacancies now available as a share of the economy than in 2012, a study reveals. Academics at the London School of Economics’ Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment found the proportion of green job openings being advertised in the UK “declined significantly” after 2012. Analysing the structure of the low-carbon economy using online job adverts, they said the share of green employment opportunities dropped from 1.8% of all openings in 2012, to a low point of just 1.1% by 2018. It then increased to 1.6% in 2021, but remained below the level seen almost a decade earlier. The report highlighted cuts to government support for green projects under Cameron, who was reported to have told aides in November 2013 to “get rid of all the green crap” from energy bills. At the time, his team said they did not recognise the phrase, but did not issue an explicit denial, and it came to symbolise the sea change from his previous claim to be leading “the greenest government ever”. The government then went on to scrap or cut the funding for a wide range of green policies, including support for onshore wind, solar power subsidies and help for homeowners to bring down their energy bills by installing insulation. The report said the fall in green job opportunities “coincided with removal of funding for various supply-and-demand-side energy schemes from 2012-13 and the decline in broader climate policies during this period. “While our analysis cannot attribute a causal link between these trends and policy developments, the decline in the earlier part of the sample period coincides with a decline in policy support for renewables and broader climate initiatives.” It said the more recent increase correlated with renewed government focus on green policies, including Theresa May’s pledge to hit net zero carbon emissions by 2050, her industrial clean-growth strategy and Boris Johnson’s 10-point green plan. Rishi Sunak is under pressure over his support for greening the economy, amid accusations that he lacks the commitment of his predecessor. Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry lobby group, warned last month that Sunak’s government was “going backwards” on plans to build a greener economy, leaving business bosses “confused and disappointed”. Despite successive governments talking up Britain’s potential to become a world-leading green economy, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show the low-carbon and renewable energy sector has failed to grow since 2014. Tallying with the findings of the Grantham Research Institute study, the ONS also said the number of green jobs had slumped over the period. The researchers found that the areas of the UK with the highest proportion of green jobs were located outside the south-east of England. Despite there being a high number of low-carbon job vacancies in London, they represent a relatively small share of the capital’s overall labour market. “These patterns provide some evidence to suggest that the low-carbon transition can provide regionally balanced economic opportunities in the UK,” it said. Analysis by Carbon Brief, a climate information website, found that maintaining the green policies would have reduced energy costs across the UK economy by as much as £8.3bn a year. It said this had left consumers exposed to higher bills amid the cost of living crisis, equating to a cost of about £150 a year for each household. A government spokesperson said: “The UK is leading the world on tackling climate change – in fact we’ve cut emissions by over 44% since 1990 while growing our economy by 76%.

No 10 has approached Meera Vadher to overhaul the prime minister’s image on the environment. Sunak flip-flopped on his attendance of the Cop27 climate summit, environmental groups ridiculed his speech to delegates as “tepid”, and his government has recently become embroiled in a row over solar power on farmland. Vadher, who is expected to start work in the new year, first entered national politics in 2011 as a parliamentary assistant to the then MP Edward Garnier, who now sits in the House of Lords. After spending time in regional politics, including working for the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, she was given a job at the Department for Health and Social Care working on the NHS’s Covid test-and-trace system. After that three-month stint, she began working on the Department for Transport’s green schemes, and was part of the UK’s Cop26 delegation. After just over 12 months in the role, she left to become a management consultant for Flint Global last year, where she advises clients on government policy on green transport. In her social media biography on Instagram, Vadher says she is a vegan with a “strong desire to smash the jargon and simplify politics and current affairs”. She has posted videos with her views on various issues, from Liz Truss’s tenure as prime minister to whether Scotland should have a second independence referendum and energy price rises. In one video, she said: “We are relying even more on our renewable sources, which are expensive.” Carbon Brief analysis, however, has found that wind energy is nine times cheaper than gas. During the Tory leadership contest over the summer, she did not explicitly back a candidate, but posted a photograph of herself arm-in-arm with Sunak. She said: “I’ve had the pleasure of working with Rishi and he’s always nice, always attentive, always into the detail. Seeing him over the past few weeks on a marathon of the country, never flailing, never stressy, always listening, has reminded me what it means to be really good at your job.” No 10 is understood to be already setting up meetings between Vadher and key players from the Boris Johnson era, which had a relatively good reputation on some environmental issues. According to a description of her role seen by the Guardian, Downing Street hopes she will make Sunak sound more authentic on environmental issues and help green policy issues cut through using social media and better messaging. A No 10 spokesperson said they did not comment on individual appointments. Vadher said she has not yet signed a contract and was still employed at Flint Global."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/09/uk-must-act-now-on-renewable-energy-or-risk-being-left-behind","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"UK ‘must act now on renewable energy or risk being left behind’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/09/uk-must-act-now-on-renewable-energy-or-risk-being-left-behind","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/09/uk-must-act-now-on-renewable-energy-or-risk-being-left-behind","fields":{"headline":"UK ‘must act now on renewable energy or risk being left behind’","bodyText":"Ministers must take control of the UK’s energy system, removing the barriers to planning permission and problems with the national electricity grid, to build the windfarms and other renewable power needed to meet net-zero goals, government advisers have warned. Chris Stark, chief executive of the committee on climate change, the statutory adviser, said the task was too urgent to wait until after a general election, expected within the next 18 months. “It would be an enormous mistake to wait until the next general election to introduce new ambitious policy,” he said. He highlighted the planning regime, which effectively prevents onshore windfarms from being built – despite government promises to remove the barriers – and which is one of the factors, along with lack of investment, stymying the construction of connections to the national electricity grid. The planning regime was “gummed up”, Stark said. “The best response is to get the planning regime, the regulatory regime, and the consenting regime sorted out,” he said. Stark urged the government to act within the next few weeks, saying there was a “window” as the chancellor of the exchequer delivers the budget next week, and before the end of the month a report is due from ministers on how they will meet the UK’s climate targets. “That is the window, to signal to the investor community that [the UK is] responding in the right way to this crisis, and have plans in place,” he said. Without clear action from the government, the UK would miss out on vital investment opportunities, he warned, as rivals in the EU, China and the US have been gearing up rapidly for a trade war on green technology. The EU will set out next week plans to achieve its net-zero goals by building up green technology within the bloc, while the US is boosting green industries through its Inflation Reduction Act. The government’s target of decarbonising the UK’s electricity generation fully by 2035, necessary to meet the long-term goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, was achievable, but not without massive changes, the CCC warned. Current policies, and the current planning regime, would not achieve the target, the CCC made clear in a report published on Thursday. “We know how to do this, but the problem is that government is not putting in place the policies needed for it to happen at the pace it needs to,” said Stark. “The system is not ready to deliver change at the scale and pace necessary.” A small amount of gas-fired power – equivalent to 2% of national electricity generation – would still be needed after 2035, the committee found. This is to ensure security of supply in periods of “wind drought”, when windfarms are not producing sufficient electricity. As the UK moves to cleaner electric vehicles and heat pumps, demand for electricity is set to rise, by as much as 50% by 2035. Alongside new windfarms, solar power generation and nuclear plants, the UK will need far more capacity to store electricity. That could take the form of large batteries and hydrogen, which can be generated from electricity and stored until needed. Work on these hydrogen power stations should start now, rather than waiting even a year, the CCC said. The report also called into question the burning of trees in power stations, calling for any power plant using wood to be fitted with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), which must happen “as early as feasible”, and ensure that they are not given contracts to operate without such technology beyond 2027. This would apply chiefly to Drax, the UK’s largest biomass power station. The report set out 25 recommendations, including a new energy infrastructure group, led by a minister, that would take responsibility for decarbonising power; new funding this year to start hydrogen power projects, to be operational by 2030; ensure any new gas-fired power plants are ready for CCS or hydrogen; and to work on CCS technology, including a plan for transporting carbon dioxide. Jess Ralston, head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “There is a huge investment opportunity in a cleaner, cheaper electricity system that isn’t blown about by international gas markets, but government needs a clearer plan for investors to pile in. The additional costs involved in balancing a renewables grid are minimal, particularly when compared to the cost of gas power.” Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP, pointed to the government’s apparent back-pedalling on a promise to lift the ban on onshore windfarms, and failure to mandate solar panels on new houses. “This report confirms that genuine energy security requires embracing abundant and affordable renewables to cut energy bills as well as carbon emissions. But the government’s current energy policy requires wading through treacle in order to do so – through its own painfully poor planning and agonisingly slow delivery,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/14/new-mood-of-seriousness-taken-root-populist-chaos-wont-cut-it-any-more","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-14T08:01:49Z","webTitle":"A new mood of seriousness has taken root.

Populist chaos won’t cut it any more","bodyText":"It’s in its infancy, but it’s hard to imagine how the emergent mood of seriousness about the interlinked threats to our economy, society and democracy cannot but grow stronger. Yes, there was relief at last week’s news that the economy was still growing in the first three months of this year, even if at a minuscule rate. But that was dispelled by the realisation that it is still smaller than before the pandemic three years ago, the worst performance in the G7. Another interest rate increase seems sure to follow after last week’s hike – yet more stress for those having to remortgage their homes, and a further economic dampener. Business and consumer optimism are in short supply. The baleful impact of the cost of living crisis spreads. The new “multibanks”, providing not just food but clothes and furniture to the very needy, are testimony to the extent that hardship is penetrating far up the income scale. This is changing attitudes. On Thursday, the Fairness Foundation, whose editorial advisory committee I chair, releases polling suggesting that Tory voters are as enthusiastic as Labour voters about an imagined society in which most wealth is held in the middle rather than by an elite, as now. Unease about trends in our society are widely manifested. Even the clumsy efforts by the police to maintain law and order at the coronation, summarily arresting not only peaceful republican protesters but unconnected bystanders, brought a surprising degree of condemnation: the embarrassed police were forced into an apology. Suddenly, there is concern that a traditional right to protest is being menaced. Defending civil liberty is becoming a popular cause. The results from the local elections in England speak to this new mood. The populist right was eviscerated: Ukip was eliminated and the Reform party picked up just two seats. Amid all the extrapolations of what the vote meant for a general election, what went too little remarked was how the progressive opposition parties collected 60% of the vote, compared with the Tories’ 29%. Voters are newly serious, with tactical voting now habitual. The vast majority want serious government, and evidence that our obvious ills are being confronted. This is all grist to the mill of MIT professors Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson who, in one of the most important books of the year, Power and Progress, released next Thursday, argue there should be no surprise at how the new seriousness is making votes count. Surveying the last thousand years, they argue that the political struggle has consistently aimed to contain excessive inequality of wealth, and act collectively to share prosperity. It is successive waves of transformative technologies above all that bring the productivity gains that create great wealth, only for it to be captured by the incumbent elite. The amazing thing is that it has taken so long this time for the countervailing forces to manifest themselves – the new rightwing populists managing to capture the unhappiness and express it via Brexit and Trump. But ultimately the nature of the real challenge breaks through. The Industrial Revolution certainly threw up unimaginable wealth via the locomotive, the spinning jenny and the steam engine, but also unimaginable human suffering – in the 1830s, one part of Manchester had 33 toilets for 7,000 people and only half the children survived beyond age five. But the next half of the century saw a fightback, they argue, led by trade unions, friendly societies, co-operatives and the newly formed Liberal party giving organised labour a voice. There were parallel movements in the US – the progressives who broke up the great railway and oil monopolies at the beginning of the 20th century and then Roosevelt’s New Dealers. Wealth has to be shared. In our time, the next challenge is artificial intelligence. The threat may not be tuberculosis or mass unemployment but surrendering control over every dimension of our lives to machines. Either AI can be deployed usefully to serve humanity or become, as it is in China, a super-Orwellian Big Brother and author of a stream of fake but credible news. Technologies are not immutable: they must be shaped to serve us. The authors explain how vital it is to develop a counter-narrative for how technology – ultimately the source of 85% of new wealth – can be used for human betterment. They cite global concern about climate change as one example, with civil society and government pressure advancing technologies like cheap wind or solar power. From breaking up big tech companies to proposing a reinvigoration of industry-wide trade unions to push up wages, they marshal a range of initiatives to fight back, including a wealth tax. AI could be shaped to benefit society at large rather than the bosses of tech giants by creating “data unions” that collectively hold our data to be used only on our behalf. Voters may not know the specifics, but they know that on issue after issue, the Tory discourse of culture wars, shrinking the state and tax cuts is out of time – distractions from the profundity of the multiple crises that confront us. Whether tackling obesity, gambling addiction, online safety or child poverty, the government resiles from any serious duty of care, beating a retreat from decisive action. The country doesn’t even have an industrial strategy to further our embrace of new technologies, as Make UK warned last week, let alone one that would allow those technologies to serve us. For example, it would be good to shape car manufacturing technology for human betterment, but as Adrian Hallmark, CEO of luxury car company Bentley, said last week, no one has chosen to locate an electrical vehicle or battery factory in the UK. As matters stand, Britain won’t have a car industry in 2035, a calamity aided and abetted by Brexit curbing access to EU markets. There is huge concern, and quiet anger, across the country. People are rightly worried about their livelihoods, standard of living and future; the gulf between the gothic pomp of the coronation and their daily experience is yawning. The mood is reflected in the spate of deeply critical books – the FT’s Martin Wolf’s trenchant call for the common good to be urgently reasserted to counter elite greed in The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism, or IFS director Paul Johnson’s powerful dissection of the stupidities of how we organise taxing and spending in Follow the Money. Their arguments need to be put into the mainstream as part of the fightback. Don’t vote for a coalition of chaos, respond the Tories. It’s a slogan that no longer has purchase. They are the chaos. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"film/2023/jan/03/alcarras-review-heartbreak-and-ruin-in-the-catalan-heat","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-03T07:00:38Z","webTitle":"Alcarràs review – heartbreak and ruin in the Catalan heat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/03/alcarras-review-heartbreak-and-ruin-in-the-catalan-heat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2023/jan/03/alcarras-review-heartbreak-and-ruin-in-the-catalan-heat","fields":{"headline":"Alcarràs review – heartbreak and ruin in the Catalan heat","bodyText":"Capitalism never looked more brutal than in this new Catalan-language movie with nonprofessionals from Carla Simón; it is about an extended family of peach farmers in the town of Alcarràs, people whose unhappiness and dysfunction are created by market forces. It was the winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin film festival and is this year’s Spanish entry for the best international film Academy Award. Simón’s debut was the wonderfully tender childhood study Summer 1993 and Alcarràs is her very accomplished follow-up. I felt it didn’t quite have the same immediately accessible richness and sweetness, but this is a really shrewd, empathic and subtle movie which engulfs you in its dust and sweat and heat. Quimet, played by Jordi Pujol Dolcet, is a middleaged farmer who lives with his clan in a rambling rented house with its own swimming pool, surrounded by peach trees, whose delicious fruit he is getting ready to harvest: backbreakingly hard work which he does by hand with family members, together with some African immigrant labour. His wife Dolors (Anna Otín) helps, as does his son Roger (Albert Bosch) – though Dolors has onerous housework and childcare, as well as having to massage Quimet’s aching back, with little thanks from her grumpy and depressed husband. Their teen daughter Mariona (Xénia Roset) is busy rehearsing a dance number for the town’s summer talent show, and their youngest, Iris (Ainet Jounou), likes playing in an abandoned car in the farmland with her cousins Pau (Isaac Rovira) and Pere (Joel Rovira). To Iris’s awestruck astonishment, strange grownups arrive one day and take away her beloved car: this is an awful omen of the problems to come. The supermarkets are offering Quimet insultingly low prices for his produce, and like other farmers he is getting ready for a mass protest. But his landlord, Pinyol (Jacob Diarte) has in any case curtly informed him that all the peach trees are to be ripped out and replaced with solar panels, and if he wants, he can retrain as a solar panel engineer, which is far more lucrative. Quimet’s elderly father Rogelio (Josep Abad) failed to get their land-tenancy in writing: it was merely a gentleman’s agreement with Pinyol’s late father which the son has ignored. This agony tears their family apart: Quimet is enraged that his way of life has been cancelled, but his sister and brother-in-law want to take the solar panel deal and his son Roger is in any case hurt at his father’s contemptuous indifference to all his new ideas on irrigation. And so Quimet, exploited by the landlord class, is also cruel to his own staff, the labourers that he must mostly lay off. Movies about rural ways of life are often supposed to be all about the sacred, seasonal rhythm of reaping and sowing. But here there is no rhythm. There is just one continuous throb of anxiety: whether the crop will fail, whether it will be eaten by rabbits, whether it will be underpriced by the supermarket buyers. And now the whole system has been thrown out. There is a new harvest to be gathered: solar power. Simón’s film asks us: is Quimet right to be outraged or not? Is there something sacred about the planting, growing and selling of peaches? Aren’t solar panels, with their superiority to fossil fuels, just as important? Might Quimet be, in some inexpressibly painful sense, simply loyal to unhappiness, loyal to a business that has not brought him satisfaction? There is something agonising, almost self-harming in Quimet’s protest stunt: he dumps a mountain of his precious peaches outside the supermarket offices: a vast, squelchy pile symbolising his wretchedness and rage. It is a deeply intelligent, humane drama. • Alcarràs is released on 6 January in cinemas, and on 24 February on Mubi."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2023/jan/20/super-tipping-points-climate-electric-cars-meat-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-20T06:00:31Z","webTitle":"‘Super-tipping points’ could trigger cascade of climate action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/20/super-tipping-points-climate-electric-cars-meat-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/jan/20/super-tipping-points-climate-electric-cars-meat-emissions","fields":{"headline":"‘Super-tipping points’ could trigger cascade of climate action","bodyText":"Three “super-tipping points” for climate action could trigger a cascade of decarbonisation across the global economy, according to a report. Relatively small policy interventions on electric cars, plant-based alternatives to meat and green fertilisers would lead to unstoppable growth in those sectors, the experts said. But the boost this would give to battery and hydrogen production would mean crucial knock-on benefits for other sectors including energy storage and aviation. Urgent emissions cuts are needed to avoid irreversible climate breakdown and the experts say the super-tipping points are the fastest way to drive global action, offering “plausible hope” that a rapid transition to a green economy can happen in time. The tipping points occur when a zero-carbon solution becomes more competitive than the existing high-carbon option. More sales lead to cheaper products, creating feedback loops that drive exponential growth and a rapid takeover. The report, launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said the three super-tipping points would cut emissions in sectors covering 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Speedy action is vital to help avoid triggering disastrous tipping points in the climate system. Scientists said recently that global heating had driven the world to the brink of multiple tipping points with global impacts, including the collapse of Greenland’s ice cap and a key current in the north Atlantic. “With time running out, there is a need for action to be targeted,” said Mark Meldrum, at the consultancy Systemiq, which produced the report with partners including the University of Exeter, UK. Each super-tipping point crossed raises the chance of crossing others, he said. “That could set off a cascade to steer us away from a climate catastrophe.” The tipping point for electric vehicles is very close with sales soaring, the report says. Setting dates around the world for the end of sales of fossil-fuel powered vehicles, such as the 2030 date set for new vehicles by the UK and 2035 in China, drives further growth, the report adds. This scale-up means the batteries used will become cheaper and these can be deployed as storage for wind and solar power, further accelerating the growth of renewables. More green energy means lower electricity bills, in turn making heat pumps even more cost-effective. The second super-tipping point is setting mandates for green fertilisers, to replace current fertilisers, which are produced from fossil gas. Ammonia is a key ingredient and can be made from hydrogen produced by renewable energy, combined with nitrogen from the air. Governments requiring a growing proportion of fertiliser to be green will drive a scale-up and cost reductions in the production of green hydrogen, the report says. That then supports long-distance aviation and shipping, and steel production, which will rely on hydrogen to end their carbon emissions. Mandates are being considered with India, for example, targeting 5% green fertiliser production by 2023–24 and 20% by 2027–28. The third super-tipping point is helping alternative proteins to beat animal-based proteins on cost, while at least matching them on taste. Meat and dairy cause about 15% of global emissions. Public procurement of plant-based meat and dairy replacements by government departments, schools and hospitals could be a powerful lever, the report says. Increasing uptake would cut the emissions from cattle and reduce the destruction of forests for pasture land. A 20% market share by 2035 would mean 400m-800m hectares of land would no longer be needed for livestock and their fodder, equivalent to 7-15% of the world’s farmland today, the report estimated. That land could then be used for the restoration of forests and wildlife, removing CO2 from the air. Tipping points already passed within countries include electric car sales in Norway and the plunge in coal-powered electricity in the US in the past decade. “We need to find and trigger positive socioeconomic tipping points if we are to limit the risk from damaging climate tipping points,” said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter. “This non-linear way of thinking about the climate problem gives plausible grounds for hope: the more that gets invested in socioeconomic transformation, the faster it will unfold – getting the world to net zero greenhouse gas emissions sooner.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/feb/26/red-states-lead-usa-renewable-energy-wind-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-26T11:00:19Z","webTitle":"Red states leading the US in solar and wind production, new report shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/26/red-states-lead-usa-renewable-energy-wind-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/feb/26/red-states-lead-usa-renewable-energy-wind-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Red states leading the US in solar and wind production, new report shows","bodyText":"A new report by Climate Central shows how US capacity to generate renewable energy shot up last year – and surprisingly, red states lead the nation in solar and wind power production. National wind and solar capacity grew 16% compared to 2021. All told, renewables generated enough electricity to power 64m American households. The report comes as the Biden administration starts to make billions of dollars available for renewable energy projects. The administration has committed to decarbonizing the grid completely by 2030 and getting the US to net zero emissions by mid-century. “We are moving closer to the goals we need to reach in order to hit net zero,” said Jennifer Brady, a senior data analyst at Climate Central. “We have a free natural resource in the form of weather that can be captured to generate power.” Climate action has often been stymied at the local and federal levels by Republican leaders. But the new report shows Iowa and Oklahoma – all of which have Republican governors and majority Republican state legislatures – led the nation in wind power production, while California and Florida were the largest producers of solar power. Texas is a leader in both solar and wind power. “It’s good to have a national distribution of renewable energy, and seeing states building them up is a positive thing,” said Brady. The growth of renewable energy capacity in these states show the effectiveness of state and federal incentives. There are several reasons why wind energy has grown by leaps in Texas. The state has been proactive in building out transmission lines to bring wind power to businesses and homes, which means future wind farms can easily connect to this grid. These investments allow the state to take advantage of its natural renewable resources. Laws deregulating the energy market in Texas have also been conducive to leasing land for wind turbines; only 2% of the land in Texas is regulated by the federal government. “Texas is rich in wind speed and rich in sun,” said Irfan Khan, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Texas A&amp;M. “While there is a lot of initial investment, after the wind turbines are erected, the cost of wind is cheaper.” In the past five years, the share of wind energy more than doubled from 15% to 34%. Over that same time, gas production has fallen from 49% to 34%. “Texas is a big oil and gas producing state, but I think that wind is being recognized as another opportunity for generating energy that can be a revenue source,” said Eric Larson, a senior research engineer at Princeton University. Elsewhere, state and federal incentives were a major driver for the year-over-year growth in renewable energy generation. In 2018, California mandated that most new single-family and multi-family homes up to three stories must include rooftop solar panels starting in 2020. In 2005, Iowa enacted the highest state tax credit rate for energy generated from wind, at $0.015 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). It is also the only state where the credits are transferable, meaning that tax credit recipients may sell the credit to third parties who can then use the purchased credit to offset their own Iowa taxes. The US generated 683,130 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from solar and wind last year, according to Climate Central’s findings, up from 588,471 GWh in 2021. The report shows that solar generation is understandably highest in the summer, while wind energy peaks in spring and fall. Experts agree that the biggest step to increase wind and solar capacity is building more transmission lines. “It’s extremely important to build transmission lines, because there is more wind energy generation than could be connected to the grid,” Khan said. Wind turbines and solar farms are generally built in rural areas far from where the highest electricity needs are, and require transmission lines in order to supply municipalities with power. “Currently the grid cannot handle all the renewable energy that already exists in Texas, and if we do not have transmission lines to support the renewable energy that feeds to the grid then it’s useless.” As of 2021, there were over 8,100 projects across the US seeking approval to connect to the grid that already operates at capacity. More than 90% of these energy projects in the queue to be connected to the grid are for wind, solar and battery storage. While the Inflation Reduction Act includes $2bn dollars for transmission facility financing, the backlog of wind and solar projects is delaying the switch to renewables that is urgently needed. Some states and local municipalities are implementing microgrids to protect against regional grid outages that have occurred with increasing frequency due to weather disasters and ageing infrastructure. “They’re smaller than the grid and therefore more agile,” said Brady. “A town may create a microgrid that’s more used for backup and be switched on if they need emergency power. But that may be a quicker way to get some of these renewables online.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-05T16:00:25Z","webTitle":"Billionaire investor Křetínský and trader Vitol eye fortune in British power plant subsidies","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/feb/05/billionaire-investor-kretinsky-and-trader-vitol-eye-fortune-in-british-power-plant-subsidies","fields":{"headline":"Billionaire investor Křetínský and trader Vitol eye fortune in British power plant subsidies","bodyText":"The billionaire West Ham United investor Daniel Křetínský and Swiss commodities giant Vitol are among bidders hoping to land hundreds of millions of pounds in subsidies to keep the lights on in Great Britain. National Grid’s electricity system operator is preparing to announce successful bidders in a “capacity market” auction this month for 2026. The annual auction will set a subsidy price to pay owners of power stations and battery storage facilities to cover the cost of being on standby in case of any rapid need for extra electricity. The costs are covered through consumer bills. Existing plants are awarded one-year deals, with new-builds given 15-year contracts to guarantee covering investment costs. Analysis of the public register before the auction shows that 69 new-build gas-fired plants have been proposed for 15-year contracts. Gas accounted for 38% of generation last year – a three-year high as the single largest source of power. The prospect of more fossil-fuel-powered plants may anger green campaigners and those urging the government to move faster in supporting renewables projects. The auction comes as the energy regulator Ofgem draws up proposals to prevent backup generators from raking in “excessive” profits as part of their licence conditions. Energy industry profits are under intense scrutiny amid high consumer bills. Shell caused outrage after unveiling record profits last week, while BP is expected to post fourth-quarter underlying profits of about $5bn on Tuesday. Křetínský, known as the Czech Sphinx for his aversion to publicity, has come to prominence in Britain after taking stakes in Royal Mail, West Ham United FC and the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s. The tycoon’s UK energy assets include the Langage and South Humber Bank gas plants and Lynemouth biomass plant in Northumberland. Křetínský’s EP UK Investments is bidding for 15-year contracts to guarantee supply from three new-build gas units at Eggborough. The North Yorkshire project’s backers argue there is an “urgent need” to replace electricity generation lost from retiring coal and nuclear plants in the UK. EP UK also hopes to land one-year contracts at Langage and South Humber Bank. VPI – owned by Vitol, which has posted rising profits during the energy crisis – wants to secure 15-year contracts to let it build two new gas-fired units at Damhead Creek in Kent. VPI is also bidding for one-year contracts for plants at Immingham in north Lincolnshire, Damhead Creek in Kent, Shoreham outside Brighton, and Rye House in Hertfordshire. Rye House drew scrutiny after it submitted the 20 highest winter bids for power on 12 December, setting new records as National Grid paid out £27m to keep the lights on during cold, still conditions. InterGen, which received an estimated £12.6m on 12 December, is also bidding, for one-year contracts for its sites at Spalding, Rocksavage and Coryton. EP UK’s proposed new-build units at Eggborough could be worth more than £840m in subsidy payments over 15 years while VPI’s plans at Damhead Creek could bring in more than £750m, according to Aurora Energy Research. EP UK’s existing units are expected to be worth more than £64m a year, while Vitol’s trio of plants may account for more than £54m, based on last year’s prices – and prices are expected to rise in this month’s auction, in part due to inflation. Other applications include a Drax project in south Wales and a series of projects in the south-east proposed by Statera Energy. Marlon Dey, head of research for UK and Ireland at Aurora, said: “Gas remains essential for security of supply today, and keeping the lights on during a period of low wind and solar power. There is still a long way to go in order to scale up renewable power to reduce our dependency on gas further. “If gas-fired peaking plants are used sparingly, they will have an important role to play and are not necessarily incompatible with net zero – depending how much they are used.” The government hopes to secure 42GW to 45GW of capacity in the auction on 21 February. Existing plant owners plan to submit bids for 39 gigawatts worth of power, meaning new-build plants must provide 3-6GW – enough to power 2.5m to 5m homes. Last year’s auction set a price of £30.59 per kW hour to secure 42GW of power, at a cost of £2.1bn over 15 years. Separately, National Grid said on Sunday it had asked owner Uniper to put a unit at its coal-fired power plant at Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire on standby in case it is needed on Tuesday during a period of low wind."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/feb/03/us-clean-energy-transition-jigar-shah-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-03T09:00:04Z","webTitle":"The man in charge of how the US spends $400bn to shift away from fossil fuels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/03/us-clean-energy-transition-jigar-shah-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/feb/03/us-clean-energy-transition-jigar-shah-interview","fields":{"headline":"The man in charge of how the US spends $400bn to shift away from fossil fuels","bodyText":"Deep in the confines of the hulking, brutalist headquarters of the US Department of Energy, down one of its long, starkly lit corridors, sits a small, unheralded office that is poised to play a pivotal role in America’s shift away from fossil fuels and help the world stave off disastrous global heating. The department’s loan programs office (LPO) was “essentially dormant” under Donald Trump, according to its head, Jigar Shah, quoting energy secretary Jennifer Granholm’s description of the office, but has now come roaring back with a huge war chest to bankroll emerging clean energy projects and technology. Last year’s vast Inflation Reduction Act grew the previously moribund office’s loan authority to $140bn, while adding a new program worth another $250bn in loan guarantees to retool projects that help cut planet-heating emissions. Which means that Shah, a debonair former clean energy entrepreneur and podcast host who matches his suits with pristine Stan Smiths, oversees resources comparable to the GDP of Norway: all to help turbocharge solar, wind, batteries and a host of other climate technologies in the US. With a newly divided Congress stymieing any new climate legislation in the foreseeable future, Shah has emerged as one of Washington’s most powerful figures in the effort to confront global heating. Shah says such focus on him is “hyperbolic” but the White House is pinning much of its climate agenda on an office that had around 85 people when Shah joined in March 2021. It now has more than 200 staffers as it scrambles to distribute billions in loans to projects across the US. John Podesta, senior adviser to Joe Biden on clean energy, said that the loans office is “essential to the effective implementation” of the administration’s goal to eliminate planet-heating emissions by 2050. “Jigar is laser-focused on working with all levels of government, project sponsors and affected communities to deliver on that mission and realize results for the American people,” Podesta said. “There’s a lot of responsibility that’s been put on to this office, clearly Congress gave us those additional resources,” said Shah, who has been busy connecting the newly enriched loans office with all corners of the emerging clean energy economy, not just wind farms and solar operators. Shah said there was “some rust on the gears” among those tasked with reanimating the office following the tenure of Trump, a president so wary of even the most lo-fi environmental technology that he complained energy efficient lightbulbs made him look orange and became fixated upon the weak flushing ability of water-saving toilets. But the clean energy loans now appear to be gaining momentum, with 125 current applications seeking $119bn worth of loans to act as the “bridge to bankability”, as Shah puts it. About $2.5bn has been given to Ultium Cells to manufacture lithium-ion batteries for electric cars in three states, $700m could go to a project that will mine lithium in Nevada – despite concerns this will negatively affect a rare flower in the region – and more than $500m for the world’s largest facility creating “green” hydrogen, to be used to fuel trucks and industry, in Utah. “We’ve left no stone unturned,” said Shah, who says he understands the mindset of entrepreneurs, having previously founded the renewable energy companies SunEdison and Generate Capital, as well as being the co-host of The Energy Gang podcast. “We’ve called every one of those companies that have been labeled climate tech, whether it’s green chemicals, green cement, green steel,” he said. “It doesn’t matter who it is, we’ve called them and said, ‘Hey, let me introduce you to the loan programs office, so now we can help.’” This new prominence is set to provoke a stinging Republican backlash, however. To conservatives, the loans office, which was founded in 2005, is forever tarred by the much-criticized decision during Barack Obama’s administration to loan $535m to Solyndra, the California solar firm, only for the company to file for bankruptcy two years later, in 2011. The huge new financial arsenal at the office’s disposal risks “Solyndra on steroids”, according to Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the incoming Republican chair of the House energy committee. A group of Republicans led by Rodgers have said the new loan authorities “raise questions about increased risks of waste, fraud and abuse, especially if the administration uses the program for its rush-to-green agenda”. Shah, who could well be hauled in front of Rodgers’ committee this year, said GOP scrutiny is “totally ordinary and expected” and that the loans office is a more rounded and mature entity than during the Obama years when it still, a year before Solyndra collapsed, notably backed an upstart car company called Tesla with a $465m loan. The failure rate of 3.3% for its loans is about that you’d expect from a prudent bank lender rather than a profligate waster of taxpayer money, Shah points out. Some level of risk taking will be required if the US is to quickly scale up the sort of clean energy technologies that are regularly devised by Americans but can struggle to get support from investors, Biden’s allies argue. “Shah will pick some winners and some losers, that’s how it works,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate change adviser, now with the Progressive Policy Institute. “If you don’t pick any losers you haven’t taken on enough risk of picking a big winner. They key is a to pick a few really big winners and with this office there have been more Teslas than Solyndras, by a long shot.” Bledsoe said that the US has traditionally not funneled large amounts of public money into commercializing clean energy technology and “right about now we are wishing we did”, due to the emergence of China as the global leader in solar panel, wind turbine and battery production. The US, after years of happily offshoring such activities, is looking to kickstart domestic manufacturing via the Inflation Reduction Act incentives. “We have to harden our domestic supply chains because we can’t replace oil-based transportation with critical minerals-based transportation and be dependent on foreign nations when we can process those minerals ourselves,” said Bledsoe. While the cost of wind and solar power has fallen dramatically over the past decade – to the point new renewable projects are often cheaper than continuing with existing fossil fuel plants – and electric vehicle sales boomed globally last year, there remains a knot of different causes of the climate crisis still awaiting solutions that are at the tipping point of mass adoption. Heavy trucking, shipping and aviation that can’t run yet on batteries require a new fuel source, perhaps hydrogen (the Department of Energy is actively looking to fund clean-running aircraft) that isn’t as polluting as oil. Industrial processes such as steel and cement manufacturing are nowhere near to being emissions free. Even if the US entirely cleans up its electricity grid, it will need thousands of miles of new transmission lines and integrated large-scale batteries to store and distribute the renewable energy to where it’s needed. The Department of Energy, meanwhile, is putting billions of dollars into efforts to remove carbon directly from the atmosphere or capture it at source and bury it underground, although this barely scratches the surface – a recent report estimates that 1,300 times more CO2 removal from new technologies is needed globally by 2050 to avoid breaching a 2C rise above pre-industrial temperatures. The key to much of this is, as John Kerry, the US climate envoy, put it recently, “money, money, money, money, money, money, money”. Jessica Jewell, an expert in clean energy at Chalmers University, said that even though the cost of solar and wind “has fallen tremendously over the last couple of decades, growth of low-carbon technologies is still not fast enough to reach our climate goals and has yet to make a significant dent in hard-to-abate sectors like industry and transportation”. “There are many clean energy technologies which are still ‘pre-commercial’ which means they cannot compete without significant support,” Jewell added. “Without these technologies, even the growth of wind and solar power may stall or don’t have the required effect on bringing emissions down.” Shah said he is confident major strides are being made on hydrogen fuels and that that it is a “foregone conclusion” that 100m tons of CO2 will be captured and buried by US industry due to carbon management investments. But he thinks much more needs to be done in nuclear, such as the development of small modular reactors, as well as advanced geothermal, where steam from reservoirs of underground hot water is harnessed to run power plants. He frets that the US is short of a million tradespeople to engineer the mass electrification of everything that currently runs on fossil fuels, and that the transmission lines aren’t being built quickly enough. “I think there’s a lot of work to be done in some of those areas,” Shah said. “When you think about the enormity of the challenges that we’re faced with, that are all prerequisite ingredients to a successful climate deployment, there’s a lot of work to do.” Shah, who is 48, was born in Gujarat, India, and moved to the US when be was one. He now has a seven-year-old son of his own who adds a certain urgency to his father’s work. “He is asking me tougher questions every month – he says, ‘Hey, are you doing enough on these issues? Hey, why is there exhaust coming out of the car in front of me? Why don’t they have an electric car?’ I’m like, ‘We’re working on that,’” Shah said. Aside from the pressure exerted by Republicans – and his son – Shah also has to grapple with the existential imperative of a ticking climate timebomb. The last eight years were the hottest ever reliably recorded on Earth but they will appear almost frigid in the future if the US, the world’s biggest ever carbon emitter, doesn’t give up its fossil fuel habit. “You feel that pressure,” Shah said. “I hold myself to outcomes. I don’t hold myself to best efforts. I feel like there’s a lot of people who are like, ‘Well, I gave it my best.’ And I was like, ‘Well, I mean, that’s not enough. You either have reduced climate emissions or you haven’t.’ “And it does weigh on you. I mean, I sleep well at night, I recognize that good sleep is a good thing. But I do put a lot of pressure on myself and my team, because I think we are up to the challenge. And I think that if not us, then who?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/30/hasty-changes-to-rishi-sunak-climate-strategy-reveal-a-warring-tory-party","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T17:05:55Z","webTitle":"Hasty changes to Sunak’s climate strategy reveal a warring Tory party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/hasty-changes-to-rishi-sunak-climate-strategy-reveal-a-warring-tory-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/30/hasty-changes-to-rishi-sunak-climate-strategy-reveal-a-warring-tory-party","fields":{"headline":"Hasty changes to Sunak’s climate strategy reveal a warring Tory party","bodyText":"Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, headed to Oxfordshire on Thursday to visit a development facility for nuclear fusion, the early-stage concept that promises unlimited clean energy at an unspecified future point, if only some hefty physical constraints can be overcome. He was accompanied by Grant Shapps, energy and net zero secretary, for the biggest energy and climate change announcement of his premiership, a comprehensive package of measures encompassing everything from onshore wind and solar power to carbon taxes and heat pumps. “When global energy supplies are disrupted and weaponised by the likes of Putin, we have seen household bills soar and economic growth slow around the world,” said Sunak, of the “powering up Britain” energy package. “We have stepped in to shield people from its worst impacts by helping to pay around half the typical energy bill. But we are also stepping up to power Britain and ensure our energy security in the long term, with more affordable, clean energy from Britain, so we can drive down energy prices and grow our economy.” Yet, only a few days before, the plan was to hold the launch in Aberdeen, the oil and gas capital of the UK. Local businesses had been primed, oil and gas specialists were ready, shoving their minor interests in green alternatives – such as hydrogen – hastily to the fore, for an event to be hailed as “energy security day”. Fossil fuels would be a necessary part of that energy security, they had been assured. And, only a few days before that, the plan was not to foreground energy security at all – the event was to be called “green day”, and the focus would be clearly on renewable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and tackling the climate crisis, as well as bringing down household bills through supporting clean power. Tom Burke, co-founder of the thinktank E3G, and a veteran government adviser, said the whirl of changes in the run-up to the launch were both bewildering and revealing. “This is a level of chaos that reveals the extent of the internal unresolved disputes within the party on these issues,” he said. “There is an anti-green faction in the Tory party, and this chaos has been all about them.” The energy strategy, running to well over a thousand pages across its reams of documents, covers everything from nuclear fusion – which some experts regard as an unconvincing distraction, when technology to cut emissions today should be the priority – to electric vehicle charging points. Sunak had little choice but to publish some form of strategy this week, as last year the high court ruled that the government’s existing strategy to meet its legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050 was inadequate. The judge in the case, brought by Friends of the Earth and other campaigners, ordered a revamp by the end of this month, also the deadline for the government to publish its response to the review of net zero by Tory MP Chris Skidmore, published in January. To complete the package, the chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, decided to publish his strategy for green investment at the same time, setting out how the private sector is expected to fund the comprehensive overhaul of the UK’s economy needed to reach the net zero target. For the government, this marks a major cross-Whitehall operation, encompassing policy that spans the Department for Transport, Department for Levelling Up, Department for Business and Trade, and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, as well as the Treasury and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, and Downing Street. The government’s focus is timely, given rapidly growing concerns that the UK is falling behind internationally, which have been given new urgency by the war in Ukraine and the soaring price of energy. The US is pushing forward strongly with its $369bn Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to make America a superpower for clean energy technologies and offers tax breaks to manufacturers. Europe, after initial outrage that it was losing its green leadership status, is now hard at work on its response. Hundreds of billions of euros of investment are at stake, and the sacred cow of state aid rules is likely to be slaughtered in pursuing them. So the key question is: does the UK’s new energy and climate package measure up to what other countries are planning? For most of the experts and campaigners delivering their verdict on Thursday, the answer was a clear no. Mel Evans, head of climate at Greenpeace UK, summed it up: “Ministers talk about leading the world, but the UK is not even making it to the starting blocks of the green tech race. A good government would go all in on renewable, efficient energy to give millions of people warm homes, clean air, lower bills and a safe climate – but powering Up Britain is a far cry from what this country needs.” Despite the support for offshore wind, the talk of electric vehicles and the focus on carbon capture, there were too many misses. Plans to insulate 300,000 homes were dismissed as puny, compared with the 14m that need upgrades. Onshore wind turbines are still, in effect, banned, despite small changes to the planning rules. Hydrogen is still being touted for home heating, despite studies showing it will not work. Solar panels will not be mandated on new-build housing, and the heat pump scheme is still flawed. Burke laid the blame at the door of a prime minister besieged by a warring party. “This feels like a party that is internally divided, that can’t come up with a coherent story, that can’t even agree what the story is,” he told the Guardian. “And this is what is spooking investors: this anti-green faction of losers who are going to turn the UK into a loser, in the global race for green prosperity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/sep/15/cake-mentioned-10-times-more-than-climate-change-on-uk-tv-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-15T05:00:39Z","webTitle":"‘Cake’ mentioned 10 times more than ‘climate change’ on UK TV – report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/15/cake-mentioned-10-times-more-than-climate-change-on-uk-tv-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/sep/15/cake-mentioned-10-times-more-than-climate-change-on-uk-tv-report","fields":{"headline":"‘Cake’ mentioned 10 times more than ‘climate change’ on UK TV – report","bodyText":"“Cake” was mentioned 10 times more often on UK television shows than “climate change” in 2020, data has revealed. The research showed “banana bread” was a more frequently heard term than “wind power” and “solar power” combined. The report, from albert, a Bafta-backed sustainability project, also found that individual action, such as recycling, was far more frequently featured than issues that are much bigger drivers of the climate crisis such as energy and transport. While terms describing the issue – climate change, climate emergency and climate crisis – had 14,540 mentions, those referring to tackling the problem – climate justice, climate action and climate solution – only had 296 mentions combined. The report was based on analysis of subtitles from almost 400,000 programmes from all the main broadcasters, but did not include news broadcasts. It highlighted some shows that did tackle climate issues, but said the huge reach of TV shows meant the industry was critical to enabling the country to meet its climate goals and needed to do more. Mentions of climate change and global warming fell by 10% and 20% respectively in 2020. Carys Taylor, the director of albert, said: “In any normal year, a drop in climate change mentions would be a worrying headline, but 2020 was no normal year.” She said the coronavirus pandemic had dominated the media and restrictions on filming meant more repeats and shows based on archive footage were shown. “But the TV industry is critical to tackling climate change,” she said. “Every genre and every programme can play its part [and] the creative opportunity for broadcasters to support the transition is immense. This is so profoundly important that, even if it is as simple as mentioning [climate action] in a soap, it’s going to have an effect.” Sandi Toksvig, the president of the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain, said: “We need policies, clever technological advances and brilliant scientists to help us reach net zero, but we also need stories. They can shape us, change us and inspire us. Writers and content makers need to be at the forefront of this battle to save our planet.” Juliet Davenport, the founder of the renewable power provider Good Energy, said: “[TV shows] have a huge power to influence and we need to be telling engaging stories about not only the scale of the challenge but the exciting benefits of the solutions.” TV shows should focus more on the actions with the most impact, said Susie Wang of the public engagement organisation Climate Outreach. “The climate crisis bell has now been rung by the media and we have very high levels of concern – the risk is getting stuck here. We need more stories that prioritise the most effective solutions, such as reducing flights we take, trying to eat a low-carbon diet, and using less energy within our homes. “Lifestyle changes also need to be talked about in terms of how they relate to changes to infrastructure and policies that help people make the shift to lower-carbon living. And we should be talking about inequalities in wealth that mean that some households, on all continents, consume much more than others.” The report analysed the subtitles from all shows in 2020 on the BBC, Sky, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and UKTV. It found climate change was mentioned 12,715 times while cake was mentioned 10 times more often, with 133,437 mentions. Wind power mentions fell 20% in 2020 to 298 times and solar power references were down 23% to 304. In contrast, banana bread mentions rose 37% to 770, while “goldfish” was mentioned on 10,707 occasions. Terms for individual behaviours such as recycling, reusing, and veganism rose in prominence in 2020. But while waste disposal is responsible for only 4% of UK climate emissions, related terms were mentioned 43,715 times. In comparison, energy causes 21% of emissions, but had only 7,418 mentions. “There seems to be a correlation between a greater contribution to emissions and a lower rate of mentions,” the report said. It highlighted shows that tackled climate issues, including the BBC’s The Great British Sewing Bee on the reuse of old clothes and Channel 4’s Meat the Family, which tackled the environmental and ethical issues of livestock farming by pairing families with animals they could then choose to eat or not. Taylor said the last series of the motoring show Top Gear featured an electric vehicle in every episode. “It’s important we don’t tell anyone how to create anything and respect editorial independence,” she said, but added that albert was providing free education and support to empower the industry to make those creative decisions for themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2023/mar/07/gas-industry-lobbying-eu-boiler-phaseout-leaked-emails-suggest","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-07T15:01:48Z","webTitle":" Gas industry lobbying hard against EU boiler phaseout, leaked emails suggest","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/07/gas-industry-lobbying-eu-boiler-phaseout-leaked-emails-suggest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2023/mar/07/gas-industry-lobbying-eu-boiler-phaseout-leaked-emails-suggest","fields":{"headline":" Gas industry lobbying hard against EU boiler phaseout, leaked emails suggest","bodyText":"Europe’s gas industry has embarked on an intensive lobbying operation to try to hinder the phaseout of gas boilers under forthcoming changes to EU legislation, leaked emails suggest. Gas companies want to keep gas boilers in operation to protect their current market, and to enable them to adapt into what they see as potential new “green” gas markets, in biofuels and hydrogen, despite serious concerns over their viability. Leaked emails, obtained by the investigative journalism outlet DeSmog as part of a project funded by Journalismfund.eu, and seen by the Guardian, show the industry attempting to introduce loopholes into the legislation that would allow the continued sale of boilers. The emails, and information from the European parliament on lobbying meetings and conferences, indicate the liquid petroleum gas (LPG) industry has taken the lead on the lobbying effort. LPG is the name given to butane and propane, fossil fuels that are byproducts of oil and gas extraction and refining. The canisters and tanks have been a mainstay of rural communities across Europe that are off the gas grid and have limited heating options. About 16.8 million people in the EU use LPG, about 4% of the population. The LPG industry is represented by Liquid Gas Europe, a trade organisation that has held a series of high-profile events and closed-door meetings with members of the European parliament in recent months. Their focus is on EU legislation known as the energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD), which governs how homes can be insulated and heated across the bloc and which is up for revision. Proposed changes will be voted on by the European parliament next week. One aim of the revision is to encourage the phaseout of gas boilers. Although this is targeted at boilers of a different kind from those that use LPG, the LPG industry perceives any such phaseout as a potential threat to its future. Henry Cubbon, the LPG president at US fuel distributor Propane DCC, told the LPG Congress in Barcelona last June: “The gas boiler is our livelihood – if it gets banned, we have a real problem.” LPG lobbyists also sense an opportunity, the emails and other lobbying efforts reveal. They want the directive to provide for favourable treatment of biofuels, made from waste or other organic materials, and hydrogen as a home heating fuel. That is because they believe they could adapt much of their current infrastructure – including distribution networks and the boilers themselves – to switch from LPG to biofuels and hydrogen, which the LPG industry is calling “renewable gas”. “We are doing a lot of work with regulators to see if we can position the gas boiler as a heating source of the future, powered by renewable gas,” said Cubbon. As the emails and marketing materials show, the LPG industry is basing its lobbying on “the unique needs of rural communities”, which it portrays as underserved and at risk. But this is highly controversial. Experts increasingly believe that hydrogen will prove an expensive red herring for home heating, because the gas is poorly suited for domestic use, and also believe it is unlikely that biofuel production could be ramped up to become a mass-market heating fuel. Experts and campaigners have told DeSmog and the Guardian that this intensive lobbying effort by the LPG industry could derail or damage attempts to switch rural homes to greener long-term alternatives, chiefly heat pumps and rooftop solar power. Jan Rosenow, the director of European programmes at the Regulatory Assistance Project, said: “LPG is a highly carbon-intensive fuel and will need to be phased out. Replacing it with scarce biofuels in the future is not a viable strategy. Sustainable biofuels are in limited supply and should be used where few alternatives to fossil fuels exist.” He said efforts to decarbonise rural homes should concentrate on heat pumps. “Heat pumps are a proven and much more efficient technology that can replace LPG effectively today,” he said. “The continued installation of LPG boilers with the hope that one day they could run on biofuels is fanciful and very risky.” Ewa Abramiuk-Lété, the general manager of the Liquid Gas Europe trade association, said: “The revision of the energy performance of buildings directive opens a unique opportunity for policymakers to set up a path to cleaner and more efficient buildings in Europe. Nevertheless, to achieve these climate goals while ensuring no one is left behind, we are convinced that all low- and zero-carbon technologies have a role to play, especially when they require no changes to existing infrastructures.” She added: “When we look at the current situation in rural areas, renewable liquid gases, such as renewable LPG, renewable and recycled-carbon DME [a gas similar to LPG] have a key role in providing viable and affordable solutions. The EPBD recast should therefore respect the principle of technology neutrality to effectively decarbonise the EU building stock, by introducing a mixed technology approach.” Claims that the LPG industry was assisting in the EU’s decarbonisation efforts were dismissed by Silvia Pastorelli, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace EU. She said: “The gas lobby is only really trying to protect its own bottom line, when it fakes concern for rural communities, and exploits people’s genuine fears about energy poverty. It doesn’t matter what the problem is, their answer is always the same: more fossil fuels.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/12/india-is-quietly-laying-claim-to-economic-superpower-status","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-12T07:00:06Z","webTitle":"India is quietly laying claim to economic superpower status","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/12/india-is-quietly-laying-claim-to-economic-superpower-status","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/12/india-is-quietly-laying-claim-to-economic-superpower-status","fields":{"headline":"India is quietly laying claim to economic superpower status","bodyText":"The rise of China has been the biggest story in the global economy in recent decades. But amid concern about its stumbling property market and global fears about inflation, the emergence of its neighbour, India, as a potential new economic superpower may be going under the radar. You won’t find mention of it in Liz Truss’s blueprint for a “modern brilliant Britain”, but the UK has just been overtaken by India as the world’s fifth biggest economy. The nation of 1.4 billion people is on track to move into third place behind the US and China by 2030, according to economists. And while the world became familiar with Chinese business titans such as Alibaba founder Jack Ma, the staggering wealth accumulated in recent years by Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani has been less well publicised. Adani, in particular, has come to represent India’s growing economic strength thanks to the rapid expansion of his Adani Group conglomerate, which covers everything from ports to airports, and solar power to television. Having entered the global Top 10 when he became Asia’s richest person in February, he is now ranked third with a fortune of $143bn (£123bn) and is closing fast on second-placed Amazon boss Jeff Bezos. India was for many years seen as the poor relation to China, held back by a sclerotic, sprawling state sector and labyrinthine bureaucracy. It still has enormous problems of poverty and poor infrastructure, but it is beginning to emerge as a rival to its large neighbour with the kind of economic growth figures that were once the pride of Beijing. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 13.8% in the second quarter of this year as pandemic controls were lifted and manufacturing and services boomed. Although double-digit growth is unlikely to be repeated in subsequent quarters, India is still on track to expand by 7% this year as it benefits from economic liberalisation in the private sector, a rapidly growing working population, and the realignment of global supply chains away from China. “India has overtaken the UK to become the world’s fifth-largest economy,” says Shilan Shah, senior India economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, citing recent updated figures from the International Monetary Fund. “Looking ahead, India looks set to continue its march up the global rankings. In all, we think India will overtake Germany and Japan to become the third-largest economy in the world within the next decade.” A key part of India’s continued rise will be its ability to grow its manufacturing sector and challenge China as the world’s No 1 exporter. India has already benefited from a large, well-educated, often English-speaking middle-class, helping the country to develop world-class IT and pharmaceutical sectors. It also has strong consumer demand, which accounts for about 55% of the economy compared with less than 40% in China. Now the trick will be to benefit from its youthful working population to position itself as a manufacturing power to rival China, where an ageing labour force and rising pay levels are reducing its competitive edge. With a geopolitical wedge opening up between China and the west, India also has the opportunity to grow in reshaped international supply chains. Nguyen Trinh, emerging markets economist at Natixis bank in Hong Kong, says the outlook is promising for India if it can keep investing. “Indian demand is expected to be strong due to its demographics,” she says, “which is rather favourable with rising working-age population that will push for demand for essentials such as food and energy as well as infrastructure investment. The normalisation of activities post-Covid as well as an increase in government spending, particularly in infrastructure investment, is helping growth. Consumption rose in double digits and investment is accelerating.” As with many aspects of India’s economic rise, Adani’s story is instructive. Now 60, the billionaire dropped out of Gujarat University, moved to Mumbai, and began trading diamonds before expanding into ports, construction and – latterly, but very profitably – renewable energy. These widespread industrial interests have dovetailed perfectly with the country’s thirst for growth and seen his Adani Group holdings on the Indian stock market rocket in value. His main listed company, Adani Enterprises, has grown 50-fold in value in the past five years, while Adani Green Energy, which looks after its push into solar power, has doubled in value in the past year. The group is ploughing $70bn into green energy projects by 2030 with the aim of becoming the world’s largest renewable-energy producer – ironic given the controversy over its plans to expand coal mining in Australia. Another important symmetry comes from Adani’s origins in the western state of Gujarat, which is also the power base of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. Modi’s market reforms, which have included cutting corporation tax from 35% to 25% and opening up India to more foreign investment, have freed up entrepreneurs such as Adani and the man he overtook as the country’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani, head of Reliance Industries, and another Gujarati. Adani is close to Modi who has been known to use the tycoon’s private jet for campaign trips. Nowhere is the local and global ambition of Adani more clearly illustrated than in Mundra, the Arabian Sea port which he wants to become the world’s largest by the end of the decade. With Modi’s government rolling out a 100tn rupees ($1.35tn, £1.1tn) infrastructure programme – it aims to build 25,000km of new roads in the current financial year alone – Adani is well placed to profit at every stage as the necessary raw materials are shipped in, turned into goods and services, and then sent back out around the world through Mundra."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/18/ditching-eu-organic-targets-wont-ease-global-food-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-18T17:19:41Z","webTitle":"Ditching the EU’s organic targets won’t ease the global food crisis | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/18/ditching-eu-organic-targets-wont-ease-global-food-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/18/ditching-eu-organic-targets-wont-ease-global-food-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Ditching the EU’s organic targets won’t ease the global food crisis","bodyText":"You report that the campaign group RePlanet has called for the European Union to ditch its organic targets “in favour of conventional and intensive farming techniques for higher productivity” (Halt use of biofuels to ease food crisis, says green group, 13 July). However, its call is based on a myth: despite receiving less than 1% of global agricultural research funding and just 5% of the $700bn in annual agricultural subsidies, agroecology practices such as organic farming are associated with as good and often higher productivity as well as enhanced biodiversity, resilience to climate shocks such as drought, reduced operating greenhouse gas emissions (a third of which are now produced by the food system) and higher levels of atmospheric carbon absorbed back into soils. With chemical fertiliser prices doubling or trebling, condemning European food systems to dependency on hyper-expensive chemical inputs – much of them imported from major global chemical fertiliser exporters such as Russia and Belarus – makes about as much sense as tying our energy system to hyper-expensive fossil fuels from the same countries when renewables have never been cheaper and solar power is now, according to the International Energy Agency, “the cheapest source of electricity in history”.

The paper by Australian National University engineering researchers found that at the current rate Australia would not reach net zero emissions until well after 2050, the date by which Scott Morrison says he would “preferably” like to get there. Australia installed about seven gigawatts of renewable energy in 2020, continuing a trend in which new clean energy generation roughly equivalent to that produced by a large coal-fired plant is added each year. Andrew Blakers, a professor of engineering, found doubling that annual rate to 14GW could put the country within striking distance of net zero emissions within a couple of decades at limited cost. Under this calculation, the country would have a near 100% clean electricity grid – backed by stronger long-distance transmission, battery and pumped hydro storage and demand management programs – as well as heating and transport systems that ran on renewable energy rather than gas and oil. Blakers said it could cut all emissions from electricity generation, transport and “stationary energy”, which includes most manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors. There would also be no emissions from coal and gas extraction – assuming the export of those fossil fuels ended. “The economics of [solar] and wind are compelling,” the paper said. “Australia is demonstrating that rapid deployment of solar and wind can lead to declining emissions and low electricity prices.” Bakers and his colleagues from the ANU Energy Change Institute, Ken Baldwin and Matthew Stocks, found removing fossil fuel energy would leave about 20% of national emissions to be dealt with, mostly from agriculture, land-fill sites and some industrial processes that are harder to address, such as chemicals manufacturing. He said the rapid transformation was achievable if the country treated electricity as it would highways or the NBN, and focused on the transmission infrastructure needed between the states and from regional renewable energy zones to cities. He said some states had started to support this change but the Morrison government was not doing enough. “We just need a trunk route for electrons,” Blakers said. Not all energy analysts are as optimistic as Blakers and his colleagues about the ease at which the electricity grid can be transformed to run on renewable sources if transmission gridlocks are addressed. Dylan McConnell, from the University of Melbourne’s Climate and Energy College, said the amount of renewable energy required to replace fossil fuel energy sounded right, but the political and economic challenges were significant. He said the cost-benefit analysis of new transmission lines was not straight-forward, citing the blowout in the estimated bill for the now $2.4bn EnergyConnect link between New South Wales and South Australia. The cost of infrastructure and turning over the entire vehicle fleet to electric cars in just two decades should not be underplayed. “[The analysis] is probably technically correct and true for the electricity sector, but it suggests a highly planned economy and that’s far removed from the political reality we live in,” McConnell said. Blakers said greater government intervention would be required, particularly to support the shift to electric vehicles, which trails comparable countries. He said that could involve short-term tax exemptions and mandating EVs for government fleet, a change that would accelerate the creation of a second-hand clean car market. But he said he believed the clean transformation would surprise “on the upside, not the downside”. “The surprise has been on the upside since 2015,” he said. “The cost of solar keeps going down 10% a year.” The expansion of large-scale solar and wind energy was initially driven by a national renewable energy target, which was filled and not replaced in 2019. It has continued due to support from state renewable schemes and major businesses that have embraced net zero emissions targets. But the most rapid growth is in household rooftop solar systems. It has continued to surge while the growth of large-scale installations has levelled off. The pace of renewable expansion is having ramifications for coal-fired power stations, some of which are increasingly financially unviable. EnergyAustralia last week announced it had signed a deal with the Victorian government to shut the Yallourn coal-fired power station in 2028, four years earlier than officially scheduled, but later than many analysts and workers believed likely due to its financial and operational health. A separate report released on Wednesday by the Climate Targets Panel said the Morrison government’s resistance to setting more ambitious emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 would create greater challenges for future governments that would inevitably have to slash emissions. It said the current 2030 target – a 26-28% reduction below 2005 levels – would mean the country would have to cut CO2 by between three and 10 times faster in the following two decades to get to net zero in time for Australia to have played its part. John Hewson, a member of the panel, said it would put a “huge, unnecessary cost” on people in the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/19/fracking-caused-daily-earthquakes-at-uks-only-active-site","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-19T05:00:15Z","webTitle":"Fracking caused daily earthquakes at UK’s only active site","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/19/fracking-caused-daily-earthquakes-at-uks-only-active-site","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/19/fracking-caused-daily-earthquakes-at-uks-only-active-site","fields":{"headline":"Fracking caused daily earthquakes at UK’s only active site","bodyText":"Fracking caused an earthquake every day at the UK’s only active site at Preston New Road in Lancashire, analysis has found. Between 2018 and 2019, the site near Blackpool was responsible for 192 earthquakes over the course of 182 days , according to analysis of House of Commons Library data by the Liberal Democrats. Fracking activity took place for six months, in two separate three-month stints, during that period. On Wednesday, the government could face a rebellion from Conservative MPs after the Labour party forced a parliamentary debate on the controversial energy extraction method. There are understood to be at least 40 Tories who are vocally against fracking, and the Guardian understands a letter, signed by dozens saying they could not support fracking, has been delivered to the business and energy secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Liberal Democrat MP and climate crisis spokesperson, Wera Hobhouse, said: “This is the latest evidence that the Conservative government’s ideological pursuit of fracking is a non-starter. Why are the government so obsessed with dirty, expensive and divisive fracking, when renewables are cheap and popular? “Frittering away money on fracking our countryside for more expensive gas will not help our energy security or the cost of living crisis. The government should listen to local communities and take steps to actually cut bills: through more wind and solar power. It is an open goal for this country, the only ones stopping us from scoring it are the Conservatives.” Labour and the Liberal Democrats are hoping to use fracking as a wedge issue to drive wavering voters away from the Conservatives. Jacob Rees-Mogg has said he will not give MPs a vote on the overturning of the ban on fracking, which is why Labour called the debate. MPs will be making the point that the government should give a free vote on the issue. Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow climate secretary, said: “Today Conservative MPs have a simple choice; do they break the manifesto commitments they made to their constituents and allow the government to impose expensive, unsafe fracking on communities that do not want it, or will they support Labour’s ban on fracking once and for all. “Every Conservative MP who opposes fracking must now put country over party and support Labour’s ban on fracking.” Many of the sites that could be viable for fracking are in swing seats held by Conservative MPs in the “red wall”, which Labour hopes to win back. Lib Dem sources pointed out that fracking could also be considered in the “blue wall” in southern England, in the seats they hope to win. Rees-Mogg has not indicated a U-turn on the lifting of the moratorium on fracking, and has said he would be enthusiastic for shale gas to be extracted in his back garden. He did, however, share in the Guardian last week his belief that oil and gas need to be phased out and that renewables are the future."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/17/liz-truss-animal-welfare-trade-deals-george-eustice","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T10:31:31Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss has refused to enshrine animal welfare in trade deals, says minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/liz-truss-animal-welfare-trade-deals-george-eustice","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/17/liz-truss-animal-welfare-trade-deals-george-eustice","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss has refused to enshrine animal welfare in trade deals, says minister","bodyText":"Liz Truss has refused to recognise the importance of animal welfare in post-Brexit trade deals, the environment secretary has said. George Eustice was speaking at the Conservative Environment Network Tory leadership hustings on behalf of Rishi Sunak, and said he faced “challenges” in trying to get Truss to enshrine animal welfare in trade deals. He said: “He’s got a position that I am much more comfortable with than I suspect will be the position with Liz Truss, and that is the position on international trade: he has made it clear that we shouldn’t compromise on animal welfare standards. “It is fair to say there were some challenges I had in getting Liz Truss to recognise the importance of animal welfare in particular and that we should reflect it in trade agreements.” The hustings was a tempestuous affair, with the international environment minister, Zac Goldsmith, representing Truss. Goldsmith claimed Sunak never showed up to climate-related cabinet meetings as chancellor and said he tried to trim funds for international wildlife programmes. “I do worry based on my experience what a Rishi administration would look like,” Goldsmith said: “Rishi never once attended a single climate cabinet. He simply couldn’t even give a quote for a dusty old government press release when the Dasgupta review [into the economics of biodiversity] came out.” Goldsmith said this was “hugely disappointing”, adding: “There were many times when I have had to fight back efforts from the Treasury who wanted to trim back the international nature budget.” Neither candidate attended the hustings, instead submitting written statements. Truss said she was an “environmentalist before it was cool” and recommitted to implementing a British nature survey, and Sunak promised to invest in carbon capture and storage as well as in renewables. The Green party MP Caroline Lucas accused the pair of “bunking off”, adding: “Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak can’t even be bothered to take to a virtual Zoom stage for an hour on a Wednesday morning to discuss the greatest crisis we face.” Eustice and Goldsmith had to defend their candidates’ respective statements on renewable energy. Truss had previously disparaged the use of solar panels in fields, while Sunak has said he does not want to expand onshore wind. Eustice said he was still supporting Sunak, but hinted they had different views on the topic of onshore wind: “I think he’s going to carry on pretty much everything that we have started and supported barring maybe some changes on onshore wind where he feels maybe it shouldn’t go ahead.” However, he added that because Sunak agreed with the bulk of reforms being put in place, including the agriculture payments system, which would incentivise nature-friendly farming, the former chancellor had his full support. On Truss’s comments on solar, Goldsmith claimed the issue was the echo chamber of Twitter. He said: “This is one of those issues that doesn’t really sit well on Twitter. There is an issue about the use of productive farmland for the generation of solar power. I don’t think a concern about doing so is inconsistent with the ambition to expand the use of solar power.” There were few new policies floated at the hustings, broadcast on YouTube, but Eustice hinted that Sunak would force developers to make homes more water secure. He said: “There’s always pressure from developers – if people want to build more houses, then we have to get better at rainwater capture systems, sustainable urban drainage, and require it through the planning system.” The pair were also challenged by Tory members about their net zero sceptic colleagues, who have pledged support for the leadership candidates. They both disavowed them, with Goldsmith saying the party was a “broad church” but pointing out Truss had signed up to the UK reaching net zero emissions by 2050, and Eustice pointing out that the public generally supported climate measures. Sunak has also committed to maintaining the legally binding net zero target. Eustice said: “To be fair to Boris Johnson despite him having many people around him saying ‘dial back the animal welfare, get the barnacles off the boat’, he did press on. “Whoever wins this, we have to make sure that when we get into the next election we are owning this agenda. Zac [Goldsmith] has pointed out to me previously that ironically despite this tendency when the party comes under pressure and says maybe we should do less on the environment, when it comes to polling the public, the achievements on the environment are spontaneously offered up.” Goldsmith said that Truss would prioritise environmentalist Tories in her administration, including “Simon Clarke, who will almost certainly have a very key job is one of the key people on the environment” and “Kwasi Kwarteng who has come on quite a journey on this issue and has become one of the leading voices on the energy transition”. A spokesperson for the Truss campaign said: “Trade deals are essential for growing our economy and giving farmers the opportunity to sell more of their world class British produce to markets across the world. We have always been clear we will never lower food standards.” Sunak’s team has been contacted about Goldsmith’s comments."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/26/cut-meat-consumption-save-planet-climate-crisis-fossil-fuels","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-26T04:01:51Z","webTitle":"Cut meat consumption to two burgers a week to save planet, study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/26/cut-meat-consumption-save-planet-climate-crisis-fossil-fuels","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/26/cut-meat-consumption-save-planet-climate-crisis-fossil-fuels","fields":{"headline":"Cut meat consumption to two burgers a week to save planet, study suggests","bodyText":"Meat consumption should be reduced to the equivalent of about two burgers a week in the developed world, and public transport expanded about six times faster than its current rate, if the world is to avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis, research has suggested. Rates of deforestation must also be rapidly reduced, and phasing out coal must happen about six times faster than is currently being managed. Heavy industries such as cement and steel are not moving fast enough in cutting their emissions, and the rapid growth of renewable energy and electric vehicle adoption must be maintained. The State of Climate Action 2022 report examined global progress on 40 indicators that would be key to halving global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, in line with the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The researchers found a gloomy picture, with just over half the indicators well off track and five heading in the wrong direction. The indicators of most concern were the use of gas, which is increasing rapidly at a time when it should be reduced in favour of renewable energy; steel-making, where emissions-reduction technology is not being adopted fast enough; journeys taken in passenger cars; the rate of loss of mangrove forests; and emissions from agriculture. Ani Dasgupta, the chief executive of the World Resources Institute, one of the organisations responsible for the report, pointed to the extreme weather seen around the world this year. “The world has seen the devastation wrought by just 1.1C of warming. Every fraction of a degree matters in the fight to protect people and the planet. We are seeing important advances in the fight against climate change but we are still not winning in any sector,” he said. Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, which also helped to produce the report, cautioned over the increasing use of gas for electricity generation around the world. “What’s particularly worrying is the rise in fossil gas power generation despite the availability of low-cost and healthier alternatives,” he said. “The ongoing crisis resulting from shocks like the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shown very clearly how continued reliance on fossil fuels is not only bad for the climate but also comes with serious security and economic risks.” The report, by the Systems Change Lab, a coalition of analyst organisations and charitable foundations, identified some bright spots. Solar power generation increased by nearly half between 2019 and 2021, while electric vehicles accounted for nearly one in 10 passenger cars sold in 2021, double the number the year before. The analysis concluded that far greater investment was required to shift the global economy to a low-carbon footing: about $460bn a year for the next decade in additional funds would be needed, and governments must also stop their favourable treatment of fossil fuels. The authors called for financial institutions to stop underwriting fossil fuel production and carbon-intensive industries. The report’s findings will be presented to governments at the Cop27 UN climate summit, which begins in Egypt next month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/mar/01/morning-mail-voice-misinformation-warning-rooftop-solar-beats-coal-moderate-liberal-under-threat","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-28T20:13:48Z","webTitle":"Morning Mail: voice misinformation warning, solar beats coal, moderate Liberal under threat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/01/morning-mail-voice-misinformation-warning-rooftop-solar-beats-coal-moderate-liberal-under-threat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/mar/01/morning-mail-voice-misinformation-warning-rooftop-solar-beats-coal-moderate-liberal-under-threat","fields":{"headline":"Morning Mail: voice misinformation warning, solar beats coal, moderate Liberal under threat","bodyText":"Good morning everyone.

That would be the shortest possible summary of the thousands of pages of careful assessment in the world’s definitive stocktake of how to limit future climate change. The assessment report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change implies that while limiting global warming to 1.5C is practically out of reach, staying below 2C is possible in practice. And it is no longer just a theoretical possibility as it used to be not too long ago. The IPCC finds that the world’s emissions could be cut in half by 2030 at affordable costs if action is taken right across the board. Of this, 50% could be achieved at relatively low costs of less than US$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, or even with net economic gains. And that is before taking into account the massive benefits from reducing future climate change, and benefits such as cleaner air and better energy supply security. The dramatic reductions in the costs of clean energy technologies over recent years are a gamechanger; for example, the cost of solar energy has reduced sixfold over just a decade. Positive experiences in the implementation of policies to cut emissions are another reason for optimism. So while the urgency to take action has risen, the opportunities to really make a difference are also much greater. The energy and land sectors are the largest opportunities globally. In energy, the story is about solar and wind power displacing fossil fuels, alongside many other ways of cutting emissions. On the land, it is about reforestation and avoided deforestation, better land management, and a shift to low-emissions agriculture. Industry, transport and buildings are also crucial parts of the puzzle. The IPCC also shows that shifts in consumption habits, including changing diets, are also important. Australia is in pole position on all of these. Ours is a high-emissions economy, which means that it is relatively easy to make big cuts. Add to that Australia’s advantage of a practically unlimited low-cost supply of renewable energy and huge opportunities for better carbon management on the land. But the transition will, of course, also bring its challenges, including for Australia. Fossil fuel use declines dramatically in scenarios of strong global climate action. Coal in particular will be on the way out, with the IPCC projecting reductions of 65% to 95% in global coal use by 2050 in 2C scenarios. The numbers for reductions in gas vary greatly between scenarios, and depend heavily on how far below 2C the world may get. How to get there in practice? For implementation of climate policy, this IPCC report assesses practical experience, not theory or modelling. The picture that emerges is a very positive one: the world over, climate laws and policies are on the ascendancy, and most measures that governments have taken are effective. Experience has helped refine policies so they also meet other goals. For example, carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes are routinely designed so that low-income groups are protected from adverse financial impacts, by channelling some of the revenue to them. The IPCC finds that packages of policies are the best way to achieve emissions outcomes. Economic instruments like pricing policies then link up with more specific regulatory policies, and are complemented by support for research and development, regional transition and so forth. While the IPCC does not provide country-specific assessments, the implication for Australia is clear: we need to overcome the current situation where there is merely a patchwork of mostly half-hearted policies, and absence of any policy for many aspects of the economy. What we need is a comprehensive set of policies that guides and incentivises the shift to a net zero economy right across the board. This is what will make the needed investment flow. And climate policy should not be the domain of governments and business alone. The IPCC report finds that to achieve the shift that is needed, climate action must involve civil society. Whether it is unions, NGOs, grassroots organisations, the research sector or business associations, all need to be on board and pull in the same general direction. At this point in the electoral cycle, a question often asked is: what are the implications of the election outcome for climate policy? In the picture that arises from the IPCC report, this should not be a question that needs asking. In a world where addressing climate change is done properly, climate policy is not a question of politics. Rather, it would be a shared fundamental objective – just like national security, decent infrastructure or a well-functioning health and education system. Perhaps by the time of the seventh IPCC assessment report, due in seven years or so, we may be closer to it. Frank Jotzo is a professor at the Australian National University. He is a lead author of the sixth assessment report of Working Group III of the IPCC, and co-author of its summary for policymakers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"travel/2023/mar/27/10-sustainable-festivals-in-the-uk-and-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-27T06:00:40Z","webTitle":"10 sustainable festivals in the UK and Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/mar/27/10-sustainable-festivals-in-the-uk-and-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2023/mar/27/10-sustainable-festivals-in-the-uk-and-europe","fields":{"headline":"Music to eco-conscious ears: 10 sustainable festivals in the UK and Europe","bodyText":"Plastic cutlery, abandoned tents, artists flown in to perform … the traditional music festival has not been a bastion of eco-friendliness. Now several UK and European events are introducing measures to reduce their impact, using locally sourced food, low-emission transport and renewable energy. Sustainability-minded shows range from new-generation affairs, such as Italy’s Terraforma, to veterans like the Isle of Wight festival. Green Gathering, Monmouthshire The family-friendly Green Gathering festival (3-6 August) usually hosts a diverse bill, from sea shanty-loving bands to politically conscious rappers – though 2023’s lineup remains TBC. This year the festival that won the 2023 International Greener festival award (AGF) from environmental non-profit A Greener Future will feature 100% renewable power, veggie food, upcycling workshops and a non-pushy promotion of low-impact living. Shuttle buses from Chepstow railway station, weekend camping from £130 DGTL Amsterdam Two more International AGF awards went to DGTL’s Dutch edition: for green transport and for innovation with reusables (called circularity). The latter is apt for an electronica festival that claims to be uniquely circular among major dance events. This year’s festival will run from 7-9 April in Amsterdam-Noord’s former dockyards. DGTL has a plant-based, waste-free food court and recycles water. Diesel is prohibited and, when necessary, artists – led in 2023 by Honey Dijon and Moderat – fly in using sustainable aviation fuel. Eurostar from London to Amsterdam takes around four hours, weekend tickets from €136 Isle of Wight festival Running from 15-18 June, 2023’s edition of the Isle of Wight festival stars Pulp, George Ezra and the Chemical Brothers. It will also employ a local biogas firm, using turf from the festival site, to generate 950,000kWh of electricity – which is more than 300 households’ annual usage. This initiative accompanies a zero-waste pledge, including the use of compostable tableware. Water pipes are donated to local farms. Free festival buses operate from each island ferry terminal; on the mainland, Big Green Coach will run carbon-neutral shuttles from around Britain, weekend camping tickets from £225 We Love Green, Paris Phoenix, Bon Iver and rapper Orelsan headline We Love Green this summer from 2-4 June. Held in the Bois de Vincennes park in Paris, this sustainability pioneer has operated on renewable energy for more than a decade. Single-use plastics have been outlawed, and the organic food is locally sourced. Artists are lobbied to arrive in a eco-friendly fashion. Eurostar trains take around two hours from London to Paris. There’s no parking, so make for Château de Vincennes station on Metro line 1. Weekend tickets from €159, you must stay off-site Hebridean Celtic festival, Lewis, Outer Hebrides The Proclaimers will conclude 2023’s Hebridean Celtic festival, on the island of Lewis. Taking place from 12-15 July, and also starring celtic-fusion outfit Talisk and trad-rock faves Skerryvore, it’s an event with a green soul. Not only are zero-carbon alternatives favoured over generators – saving the equivalent of 27 return car journeys to Edinburgh – but equipment haulage is minimised and there’s been no single-use plastic since 2018. Caledonian MacBrayne runs car and passenger ferries from Ullapool to Stornoway; you must stay off-site. Weekend tickets from £120 Øya festival, Oslo The Tøyenparken site is so close to central Oslo that 98% of visitors come to Øyafestivalen on foot, by bike or by public transport. This year’s events run from 8-12 August and feature Blur, Grammy-nominated Wizkid and Norwegian singer-songwriter Sigrid. Øya has no fossil-fuel generators and uses the city’s power grid instead. It swerves plastic seating courtesy of its amphitheatre-like hillside location. Rubbish is hand-sorted into 15 categories, and artists travel in reduced-emissions cars. Tøyen metro station is five minutes’ walk away; you must stay off-site. Weekend tickets from £245 Shambala, Northamptonshire According to the Association of Independent Festivals, an estimated 250,000 tents are abandoned at UK music festivals annually – with most of them non-recyclable. None were left at last year’s Shambala, however. Other tenets include meat, fish and dairy milk all being outlawed and a variety of car-free transport schemes. On a rural Northamptonshire estate, the theatrical fiesta is inclusive and anti-corporate. The acts for this year’s Shambala (24-27 August) haven’t been announced yet, though lineups favour genre-hopping up-and-comers over big names. Return coaches and overnight, guided cycling packages run from Birmingham, Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Sheffield. Weekend camping tickets including coach travel from £247 Terraforma, near Milan Taking its name from the process of creating an atmosphere and topography similar to the environment of Earth, Terraforma takes place in a wooded estate about 10 miles north of Milan and features experimental (and often electronic) musicians. The roster for this year (9-11 June) remains under wraps; Lafawndah and MC Yallah dazzled last year. Sustainability is a focus, from wooden stages to recycling stations, biodegradable crockery, electric fleets and low-impact solar-powered lighting. The quickest rail journeys, visit Rail Europe, from London to Milan via Paris take 10 hours. Weekend camping tickets from €175 Love Trails, Gower peninsula Featuring Biig Piig and High Contrast, this year’s Love Trails (6-9 July) mixes coastline jogs, rock climbing, coasteering, swimming and yoga with live acts and DJ sets in the evenings. Based at ruined Weobley Castle on the Gower peninsula, it has introduced chemical-free compost loos, and three-quarters of food suppliers are from south Wales. Visitors can support rainforest-protection schemes and reduce carbon emissions by booking coaches (from Bristol, Cardiff and London) or cycling travel packages. Gowerton railway station is nine miles away. Weekend camping tickets from £179 Pohoda festival, Slovakia The Pohoda festival, which has been running since 1997, has long been green-hearted. Among current initiatives are water-saving vacuum toilets, a mobile solar-power station and 17 waste-separation points. This year it runs from 6-8 July, with Jamie xx, Central Cee and Suzanne Vega typifying an ever-eclectic policy that champions everything from electropunk to chamber music. The current venue is Trenčín airport, outside the northern town of the same name. Trains, visit Rail Europe, take 14.5 hours, via Paris and Vienna, from London to Bratislava, from where express festival services will depart.

The energy startup Xlinks hopes to provide 8% of Britain’s electricity supplies through a 3,800km (2,360-mile) cable linking Morocco with the UK, powering 7m homes by 2030. The project had been expected to begin generating power by 2027. However, that target date now appears unlikely. The Xlinks’ executive chair, Sir Dave Lewis, a former chief executive of Tesco, warned that the recent political turmoil that has seen off three prime ministers in less than six months has stalled its progress. He has been trying to secure a government “contract for difference” – a mechanism under which public subsidies are used to offer low-carbon generators, such as windfarms, a fixed price for power. The arrangement aims to encourage investment by making revenues more predictable. Lewis told the Guardian: “We spent a long time with the then business secretary [Kwasi Kwarteng] who said: ‘We like it a lot but it needs to go through Treasury.’ There was a review with Treasury, Cabinet Office and the business department, which was very positive. “Then we came back to them to start the detail and the political world exploded and, as a result, everything stopped. And everybody has changed, so it’s sort of like you’re starting again. “Time is important for the UK to meet its net zero ambitions, to secure energy supplies and to reduce bills. We have lost a year.” Xlinks was founded in 2019 by its chief executive, Simon Morrish, who has grown the environmental services business Ground Control across the UK. When the Morocco-UK link is complete, Xlinks expects to generate 20 hours of reliable renewable energy a day using the Sahara’s sunshine and breezy night-time conditions. The plan is to build almost 12m solar panels and 530 windfarms over the 960 sq km area of desert. The site, in the Guelmim-Oued Noun region, will also have 20 gigawatt hours of battery storage. The cable transporting power from the site will hug the Moroccan coastline, then pass alongside Portugal, northern Spain and France before looping around the Isles of Scilly to terminate at Alverdiscott in north Devon, where Xlinks has already agreed to 1.8 gigawatt connections. Morocco has an established wind, solar and hydroelectric power industry, and its solar intensity, a measure of generation power, is second only to Egypt and double that of the UK, according to data from Xlinks. The power lines will be laid by the world’s largest cable-laying ship and buried beneath the seabed to mitigate the risk of damage from fishing boats. The company is in the process of studying the seabed and gaining offshore permits. Xlinks hopes to land a strike price of £48 per megawatt hour, lower than the £92.50 agreed for the delayed Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in Somerset. The company argues that despite the scale of the project, it can be more reliable for the security of UK energy supplies than domestic options because UK wind power can be hugely variable. Last week National Grid issued, and later cancelled preparations to launch its emergency winter plan after low wind and solar power left supplies tight. Lewis has personally invested in the Xlinks project, along with Octopus Energy and its founder Greg Jackson. Growing demand for renewable power has stretched supplies across the industry. In response, its sister company XLCC plans to build two factories to manufacture cables in Hunterston on the west coast of Scotland and another at a yet to be announced site in north-east England. The first received planning permission in June, and is expected to create 900 jobs. Lewis, who worked for the consumer goods company Unilever for 27 years, became Tesco’s chief executive in 2014. He quickly had to tackle an accounting black hole and is credited with turning around Britain’s largest retailer before leaving in 2020. He is now chair of Haleon, the consumer goods company spun off from GlaxoSmithKline earlier this year. • This article was amended on 5 and 7 December 2022.

That’s why we proudly offset our network emissions,” the advert declares. Belong reminds customers often on its website that it is Australia’s “first carbon-neutral telco”. An advertising executive said their campaign for the telco showed “that with Belong’s carbon-neutral mobile and internet, you can feel good about scrolling”. That carbon neutrality, like that of its parent company Telstra, is certified through the government’s Climate Active program, but relies almost entirely on buying large quantities of overseas carbon offsets. Companies globally are coming under scrutiny for relying on offsets to meet climate pledges. A UN expert group has said offsets should only be used as a last resort after companies have made actual direct cuts. So how did Belong get to claim it was carbon neutral? According to disclosures made to Climate Active, over three years from 2018/19 to 2020/21 – the most recent periods available – Belong’s in-house efforts (such as optimising heating and cooling systems and upgrading equipment) led to a reduction of just 1,652 tonnes of CO2. But the annual savings actually went down in that time from 816t in the first year to 377t in the third year. Over the same period, the company bought 201,933t of carbon offsets to cover the rest of their emissions. More than 80% these offsets were created in 2014 by a windfarm in China. In a statement, Telstra said Belong’s next report to Climate Active would show a further 4,790t of CO2 of emissions reduction between financial year 2021 and 2022. This reduction reflected “continued progress in targeted emissions reduction activity” towards a target to cut absolute emissions by 50% by 2030. “To date, 14% of this target has been achieved, largely as a consequence of significant investment in energy efficiency.” Belong also offers secondhand phones, allows customers to keep using their own modems and encourages mobile phone recycling. First Nations first? Belong said in a company blog in late 2021 that as it “started moving towards certification” its chief principle was “three words with a lot of meaning: First Nations First”. But that hasn’t been the case when it comes to which offsets the company has chosen. Just 320t – or 0.16% – of its offsets over the three years relate to one Indigenous-led project in Queensland. A Telstra spokesperson said: “The ‘First Nations First’ line is not something that we have ever used in our marketing or advertising and we acknowledge and agree it was wrong for it to be used in this way and given such prominence in the blog.” A statement said Telstra and Belong did “an enormous amount of work with and for First Nations’ communities”, and consults and takes “advice from indigenous stakeholders inside and outside the company, including on our environmental programs”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Telstra’s carbon neutral claim Belong’s owner, Telstra, also uses Climate Active to claim it is a “carbon neutral” organisation. In the six months from January to June 2021, Telstra bought 1.01m tonnes worth of carbon offsets. But apart from buying offsets, what did the company do to cut emissions? Telstra has a target to cut its “absolute emissions by at least 50% by 2030”. The company’s disclosure to Climate Active says it spent $8.6m on “energy and emissions reduction initiatives” to deliver an annual saving of 10,413 tonnes – just over 1% of the cuts the company claimed from buying offsets (for context, Telstra made about $3bn profit that year). Only about 7% of the offsets Telstra bought were Australian, with the bulk of the rest from renewables projects in India. Dr Alex Lo, of Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, published research this month on the use of renewable energy projects as offsets. About 38% of Telstra’s offsets were related to Indian solar energy projects from 2019 and 2020, which Lo says “require scrutiny”. One critical factor for a project to generate carbon credits is it must be “additional” – that is, the project would not have happened without investments through the carbon market. Lo says solar power prices in India dropped by about 85% between 2010 and 2019 while at the same time, international carbon prices were low, “which means credit incomes can hardly be seen as a key driving force of project development”. Telstra said it did “not agree” its carbon offsets were not additional, and the company carried out extensive due diligence. “All Telstra projects are additional,” the statement said, adding it viewed carbon offsets as a “temporary ‘bridge’ measure”. The company said it expects the proportion of offsets linked to renewables to “diminish over the coming years, as we shift our efforts to developing and maturing markets for nature-based solutions”. The company had a target to “enable renewable energy generation equivalent to 100% of our consumption by 2025” and had bought a farm to plant 150,000 native trees and shrubs that would sequester about 160,000 tonnes of CO2 over the next 25 years. Coral claims The shadow environment minister, Jonathon Duniam, accused the government last week of ignoring a report on the health of the Great Barrier Reef from the marine park’s management authority that showed the reef had been in “good health for a number of years now”. The report did say the reef had been through relatively benign years, but warned the threats from the climate crisis were “escalating”. Speaking to Sky News Australia’s Outsiders program, Jennifer Marohasy, an Institute of Public Affairs fellow, said the reef was in great health and questioned reports from John Brewer Reef near Townsville during last year’s mass coral bleaching – the first mass bleaching, authorities said, in a usually cooler La Niña year. Marohasy visited John Brewer in April “to have a look at the corals” and said “by coincidence” scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) were also there conducting an underwater survey. “They reported zero bleaching,” said Marohasy, saying this was despite aerial surveys reporting 60% of corals bleaching at the same site. “It’s crazy,” she said. This was “disinformation” said presenter Rita Panahi. Is it? Aims told Temperature Check they did not carry out any in-water monitoring in April, when Marohasy visited, but had been in the water on 6 March – nine days before aerial surveys recorded 60% bleaching on the reef flat. That in-water survey found “coral bleaching was variable in different parts of the reef”, Aims said, with some parts of the reef showing no bleaching and others between 10% and 30%. The amount of heat stress faced by the corals jumped in the nine days between the in-water survey and the aerial survey. So was it “crazy” that aerial surveys had a different result than in-water checks that involved divers being pulled for two-minute bursts 81 times around the reef’s 15km perimeter? Aims said the same results shouldn’t have been expected, because they came from different times, used different methods and examined different parts of the reef (in-water surveys included deeper corals but aerial surveys only counted corals in the top 6m of water). An Aims statement said: “While there are differences between the results, the in-water survey results on 6 March 2022 correlate reasonably well with the aerial surveys on the 15 March. “It is important to note that peak heat in 2022 for the [reef] occurred on 14 March. If one visited John Brewer Reef in April, about a month after peak heat stress, conditions may have cooled and corals would have been on a path to recovery from moderate levels of heat stress.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2023/jan/11/uae-to-launch-cop28-presidency-with-oil-boss-tipped-for-leading-role","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-11T17:17:46Z","webTitle":"UAE to launch Cop28 presidency with oil boss tipped for leading role","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/11/uae-to-launch-cop28-presidency-with-oil-boss-tipped-for-leading-role","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2023/jan/11/uae-to-launch-cop28-presidency-with-oil-boss-tipped-for-leading-role","fields":{"headline":"UAE to launch Cop28 presidency with oil boss tipped for leading role","bodyText":"The United Arab Emirates will launch its presidency of global climate talks on Thursday, with the head of its national oil company likely to be given the leading role. Sultan Al Jaber has served as climate envoy to the country, and is chief of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc), the world’s twelfth-largest oil company by production, and is hotly tipped to take on the pivotal role of president of the talks. He is also minister of industry and advanced technology for UAE, and head of the Masdar company, which focuses on renewable energy. The Cop28 UN climate summit, which will take place from 30 November in Dubai, will be a crucial conference, determining whether the world can get on track to tackle the climate crisis. This year, nations must conduct a “global stocktake” assessing the current state of climate action and progress on fulfilling the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement. While some countries have submitted national plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions that are in line with the ambition in the Paris agreement of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, many of the world’s biggest emitters have failed to do so, imperilling the climate goals. One of the roles of the presidency will be to hold such recalcitrant governments to account, but many observers fear that UAE, as a major oil producer and with close ties to other producers such as Saudi Arabia, will be reluctant to take them on. At Cop27, held in Egypt last November, there were scores of oil and gas lobbyists from UAE, and Gulf states with strong oil and gas interests were thought to have been among the blockers preventing stronger language on phasing down fossil fuels. One veteran of the talks, who could not be named, said: “[Al Jaber] is straddling two worlds. One of climate negotiations where we have to make a giant leap in emissions reductions and financing the move away from fossil fuel emissions; second, as head of Adnoc. UAE wants to be seen to be leading on food, technology, adaptation and potentially innovative finance but how can they carry that off while being fossil fuel polluters?” Some civil society activists have called for Al Jaber to give up his fossil fuel roles to take on the Cop28 presidency. Tasneem Essop, the executive director of Climate Action Network International, said: “[If Al Jaber is appointed president of Cop28, it will be] imperative for the world to be reassured that he will step down from his role as the CEO of Adnoc. He cannot preside over a process that is tasked to address the climate crisis with such a conflict of interest, heading an industry that is responsible for the crisis itself.” She warned: “If he does not step down as CEO, it will be tantamount to a full-scale capture of the UN climate talks by a petrostate national oil company and its associated fossil fuel lobbyists. Cop26 in Glasgow had 500 fossil fuel lobbyists in attendance, the Cop in Egypt saw a 25% increase in their presence, Cop28 now seems to be open season for vested interests who will no doubt use the climate talks to continue to undermine any progress on climate action. As civil society we [will] demand that Al Jaber does the right thing and either stand aside or step down.” Described as charming and clever by people in climate negotiations, 49-year-old Al Jaber was educated in the US and the UK. While he helped to set up Masdar in 2006, investing heavily in solar power, his role as the national oil company’s group chief executive means he is also responsible for making as much money as possible for UAE from its oil production. In an interview with the National newspaper in the Gulf last September, ahead of Cop27, Al Jaber made the case for a transition away from fossil fuels, but noted that oil and gas would still be needed for some years. “Policymakers are beginning to understand that the energy transition will not happen with the flip of a switch,” he told the newspaper. “You need to maintain the current system, while the world still relies on it, and drive down its emissions, while driving up investment in new energies. Innovative climate action, which involves the fast adoption of renewable energy and other low-carbon sources, has the potential to provide long-lasting energy security. But we are not there yet.” UAE has sought to present itself as a modernising oil producer, improving the efficiency of its production methods, and investing in renewable energy. However, many question whether even an innovative oil economy can fly the flag for the rapid phase-out of fossil fuels needed to stay within the increasingly fragile 1.5C goal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-21T05:00:32Z","webTitle":"Government should have moved earlier to low-carbon, say industry experts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2021/sep/21/government-should-have-moved-earlier-to-low-carbon-say-industry-experts","fields":{"headline":"Government should have moved earlier to low-carbon, say industry experts","bodyText":"Renewable energy and low-carbon heating could do much more to alleviate the gas supply problems of the future – and could have done much to reduce the impact of this winter’s soaring gas prices, if the government had done more to shift the UK’s energy market sooner, industry experts have said. The gas supply crunch has prompted a flurry of government meetings with industry, and reassurances in parliament on Monday from the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, that “there is no question of the lights going out” and that the UK is “highly resilient”. But the supply issue demonstrates that fossil fuels are inherently subject to wild price fluctuations, which happen at least once a decade, according to Roger Fouquet, of the London School of Economics. “Price volatility is an inevitable part of the fossil fuel energy system,” he said. “Renewables do not suffer from these market-related problems.” Switching to renewables reduces the impact of fossil fuel price fluctuation, but the UK is still “particularly exposed to international gas prices”, said Rob Gross of UCL. “Gas power stations set prices [in the UK], particularly when demand is high and renewables output is low. Countries with a lower share of gas in their power mix experience less volatile prices and we should expect that here too.” Dan McGrail, chief executive of RenewableUK, which represents wind energy companies, said the government should learn the lesson for future years. “The first priority for government and the sector is, of course, protecting consumers in response to this price surge. The only way to do that in the long term is to have an energy system powered by cheap renewables, with flexible storage, hydrogen and other low-carbon technologies to meet demand at lowest cost.” He pointed out that it was already cheaper, even before the gas price began soaring, to generate electricity by building a new windfarm than running an existing gas power plant. The growth of renewables has cut the proportion of power the UK gets from fossil fuels from 60% to under 40% in the last few years. McGrail said: “The industry is working with government to accelerate investment in renewables, which is key to ending our reliance on gas for heating our homes and in heavy industries. Alongside massive investment in renewables, we need to shift the dial on electrification and green hydrogen production in the UK to meet net zero at lowest cost.” Solar power has also plummeted in cost in recent years, despite a lack of support from the government, and is forecast to be the cheapest form of power within a few years, surpassing even onshore windfarms. Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade body Solar Energy UK, said solar power could continue to provide electricity through the winter months. Solar currently provides about 4.5% of the UK’s electricity, but he said it was “eminently achievable” to triple that by 2030, at no cost to consumers, if the government would clear the way by removing regulatory difficulties. Heat pumps for homes could also reduce the UK’s reliance on gas, added Jan Rosenow, Europe director at the Regulatory Assistance Project, as they run on electricity, though electricity in the UK is partly generated by gas. “But even if all of the electricity used by heat pumps was generated by gas the much higher efficiency of heat pumps would still result in a reduction of gas use.” However, as Fouquet notes, “wind and solar do suffer from intermittency problems. So, while accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources is welcome for environmental reasons, it is important to develop an energy system that is flexible to these intermittencies.” That can involve investing in large-scale battery storage technologies, which the UK has signally failed to do, or in backup power. Nuclear reactors, though controversial, can supply a steady stream of power to the grid that can counterbalance the intermittency of some renewable energy, but plans by successive governments for more than two decades to build a new fleet of reactors that would replace the UK’s current ageing nuclear plants have been mired in difficulties. The trade union Prospect called on the government to beef up its commitment to nuclear power. Sue Ferns, senior deputy secretary general of the union, said: “This is a wake-up call for the government, which must intervene immediately to ensure short-term security of supply. The current crisis is a product of an over-reliance on imports and weather-dependent renewables leaving us dangerously exposed to fluctuations in global natural-gas markets. The UK must prioritise domestic sources of firm power, particularly nuclear, to ensure a secure, resilient and low-carbon future.” Another vital measure is to reduce the amount of energy that is wasted. British homes are among the draughtiest and least efficient in Europe, but little has been done to improve that. The government introduced an insulation scheme, the green homes grant, last year as part of its much-vaunted push to “build back greener” from the pandemic. Within six months, however, it had all but collapsed owing to poor administration and in March this year it was scrapped by the Treasury, with nothing to replace it. After the current crisis has passed, it will be tempting for ministers to return to normal. But experts contacted by the Guardian warned that this should be a wakeup call to the government to introduce the suite of measures needed to protect the UK’s gas supply and shift the economy to a low-carbon footing. Gross concluded: “Ultimately, it will depend on the level of storage, interconnection and demand management to make best use of renewable resources and break the link between gas and power prices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/01/first-thing-paul-pelosi-attack-suspect-wanted-to-break-house-speakers-kneecaps","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-01T10:50:05Z","webTitle":"Paul Pelosi attack suspect wanted to break Nancy’s kneecaps | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/01/first-thing-paul-pelosi-attack-suspect-wanted-to-break-house-speakers-kneecaps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/01/first-thing-paul-pelosi-attack-suspect-wanted-to-break-house-speakers-kneecaps","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: Paul Pelosi attack suspect ‘wanted to break House speaker’s kneecaps’","bodyText":"Good morning. The man accused of attacking Paul Pelosi, the husband of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told police he wanted to hold the congresswoman hostage and “break her kneecaps”, authorities in California said on Monday. David DePape, 42, confronted a sleeping Paul Pelosi in the couple’s bedroom in their San Francisco townhouse shortly before 2.30am last Friday, according to a federal affidavit filed in court yesterday. Federal prosecutors have filed two charges against DePape, days after police say he broke into the Pelosis’ home and struck the Democratic House of Representatives leader’s 82-year-old husband in the head with a hammer. Paul Pelosi was left seriously injured in the attack and was in surgery for several hours on Friday, as his wife hurried back from Washington DC to the hospital where he was taken. He was operated on for a fractured skull as well as serious wounding to his arms and hands. What else has DePape been charged with? He also faces multiple charges at state level – including attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, elder abuse and threatening a public official. Those charges were filed separately by the San Francisco district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, on Monday. Why is Donald Trump Jr in the news? The former president’s son tweeted a crude meme featuring a hammer with the caption: “Got my Paul Pelosi Halloween costume ready”. The internet backlash was swift but Trump Jr doubled down equally swiftly – posting another, this time clearly homophobic, meme that appears to reference a baseless conspiracy theory about the assault. Elon Musk appoints himself CEO of Twitter as employees brace for mass layoffs Elon Musk has appointed himself chief executive of Twitter and dissolved its board of directors, it was revealed in a company filing on Monday, as Twitter employees brace for extensive layoffs under a restructuring that could target up to a quarter of staff. The Washington Post reported that Musk’s team had been discussing letting go of 25% of the company’s workforce in the first round of layoffs. The reported move comes as the tech billionaire overhauls the company after buying it for $44bn last week. The celebrity lawyer Alex Spiro, a longtime Musk legal representative, led the conversations about the impending job cuts, according to the report. After buying Twitter last week, Musk moved quickly to seize control, firing top managers including the chief executive, Parag Agrawal, head of finance, Ned Segal, and legal affairs and policy boss, Vijaya Gadde. What else is Musk doing? He is considering charging Twitter users $20 (£17.30) a month or $240 a year for a blue tick on their account. Users verified by the platform – who carry a blue tick flagging them as an authentic source – would have 90 days to sign up to Blue or lose their check mark. More than a million Americans ration insulin because of the high cost of the drug Insulin rights activists and those who live with diabetes are calling for meaningful action to address the high costs of of the drug in the US as a study shows the widespread habit of rationing the life-saving medicine. Diabetes is the seventh-leading cause of death in the US, though a 2017 study suggests the number of Americans dying from the illness is far higher due to it frequently being overlooked in causes of death. Humans require insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas to regulate glucose in the blood, to live. A study published on 18 October in the Annals of Internal Medicine by researchers at Harvard Medical School, the City University of New York’s Hunter College and Public Citizen, found that 1.3 million Americans rationed insulin in 2021 because of the high prices. The staggering number represents an estimated 16.5% of the US population with diabetes. The study found insulin rationing was most commonly reported by those without health insurance coverage and individuals under 65 not eligible for Medicare. Black insulin users were more likely to report rationing insulin, at 23.2%. How much is insulin? One vial of Humalog cost $21 (£18) in 1999 and jumped to $332 (£287) in 2019. US list prices for insulin have soared in recent decades, while list prices have remained relatively the same at a fraction of US list prices in every other industrialized country. In other news … Mike Pence has blamed Donald Trump for events leading up to the January 6 insurrection in a memoir that will be published on 15 November. The former vice-president says a meeting at which advisers led by Rudy Giuliani urged Trump to not accept election defeat was “a new low”. The Democratic candidate Elissa Slotkin says abortion is a top issue in Michigan and the fear of a ban will motivate voters to re-elect her. Slotkin is running in one of the country’s most tightly contested seats, as a Democrat who won Trump voters back from the Republican party in 2018 and 2020. Taylor Swift scored 10 out of 10 to become the first artist in history to claim the top 10 slots on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US, with tracks from her latest album, Midnights. Billboard reported yesterday that Swift had surpassed Drake, who had held the previous record with nine of the top 10 songs. A US judge has blocked the $2.2bn planned merger of Penguin Random House, the world’s largest book publisher, with its rival Simon &amp; Schuster. The justice department argued the deal would “substantially” harm competition in the market for the US publishing rights to anticipated top-selling books. South Korea’s prime minister, Han Duck-soo, has called Saturday’s deadly Halloween crush in Seoul a “disastrous accident that should not have happened”, amid growing public anger. Expressing sorrow to bereaved families, he admitted that institutional failures in managing crowds. Stat of the day: the battle to build a $1.5bn solar power field almost the size of Manhattan A massive solar farm, which could have its goal of completion next year delayed because of the lawsuits, has stirred up strong feelings among some in rural Indiana. The opponents of the solar project, a $1.5bn venture appropriately called Mammoth that is expected to span an area almost as large as Manhattan, say they are defying an egregious assault on time-honored farming traditions. However, supporters of the project, expected to be the US’s biggest solar power farm, say those against it are small in number but with deep pockets and able to afford multiple lawsuits. “It’s just throw spaghetti and see what sticks,” the developer said. Don’t miss this: How disasters like the Itaewon crush happen, how can they be prevented and the ‘stampede’ myth More than 150 people have died in a crowd crush while celebrating Halloween in one of Seoul’s most popular nightlife districts. Up to 100,000 people – mostly in their teens and 20s – poured into Itaewon’s narrow, sloping streets for one of the first big celebrations since Covid restrictions were lifted. South Korean authorities have opened an investigation into the disaster. But how do such crowd crushes happen? Experts say they are predictable and preventable. Here is what we can learn from the Halloween tragedy. Climate check: Two-thirds of US money for fossil fuel pours into Africa despite climate goals Joe Biden will head to Egypt next week to tout the US’s re-emergence as a leader on the climate crisis at the Cop27 talks. But he will be landing in a continent that the US continues to pour billions of dollars into for fossil fuel projects, with seemingly no end in sight despite the president’s promises. The US government has funneled more than $9bn (£7.7bn) into oil and gas projects in Africa since it signed up to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Two-thirds of all the money the US has committed globally to fossil fuels in this time has been plowed into Africa, where one in which 600 million people live without electricity. Last thing: Victory for ‘bikini baristas’ as federal court rejects city’s dress code A Washington city’s dress code saying so-called “bikini baristas” must cover their bodies at work has been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court. The decision in a partial summary judgment this week comes after a lengthy legal battle between bikini baristas and the city of Everett, on the outskirts of Seattle, over the rights of workers to wear what they want, the Everett Herald reported. It is difficult to imagine, the court wrote, how the ordinance would be equally applied to men and women in practice because it prohibits clothing “typically worn by women rather than men”, including midriff and scoop-back shirts, as well as bikinis.

I knew that she had flown on a bedazzled horse called Reneigh, dressed as a cyber bee in a nod to the BeyHive, opened with a surprising string of ballads, and perturbed fans by apparently not dancing as much as they’d hoped – or was it that she had a leg injury? I was 1,400 miles away and I didn’t even go looking for this information; it just came to me ambiently as I clicked around my regular diet of culture sites. Vulture, Rolling Stone and Pitchfork were among the outlets liveblogging the show through the medium of embedded TikToks and tweets from those at the Friends Arena. My lucky friend Jeff was one of them, posting from the front row: when I watched his Instagram Stories, I too was close enough to almost get a strand of Beyoncé’s wind machine-blown hair in my mouth during Break My Soul. I don’t mind knowing the ins and outs of the Renaissance tour before it hits London later this month. (Admittedly it’s kind of my job to know.) But for many Beyoncé stans, these dispatches are tantamount to spoilers: as if her hair flicks and song segues were plot points out of the latest Marvel film or episode of Succession. Online, many fans are declaring that they’re muting hashtags and any accounts liable to give the game away before they get their own chance to see her in the flesh; our reviewer, in his five-star rave, spoke to one man who had travelled from Brazil in order to get the freshest possible perspective: “I want everything to be a surprise,” he said. How has spoiler culture come for gigs – which especially at stadium level, are more or less the same every night? In a way, these complaints are a weary acknowledgment of the fact that any conversations about banning phones at shows now seem about as antiquated as the notion that the Gutenberg press was ungodly. That genie is long since out of the bottle: one viral TikTok from last night showed a man who had jerry-rigged his phone to the front of his head so that he could livestream for friends, presumably keeping his hands free to do Lil Uzi Vert’s Just Wanna Rock dance along with Beyoncé. Major tours are now designed for social media: in January, creative director Tobias Rylander told us that his staging, including for the 1975’s current At Their Very Best show, has become increasingly “Instagram-ready”. And superstar social media #content – whether about Beyoncé, Taylor Swift’s current Eras tour, Lady Gaga’s Chromatica Ball – is cheap SEO bait for pop culture websites. What happens on stadium tours has become the latest watercooler moment: what did it mean when Swift and the 1975’s Matty Healy, who are reportedly dating, both recently mouthed “this is about you, you know who you are. I love you” at their respective headline shows? Older music fans might argue that documenting gigs means you’re never in the moment and can’t really enjoy them properly, though for a younger generation, fandom has become a participatory endeavour, particularly at massive pop shows. Filming key moments affirms your presence, but sometimes plays a wider purpose too. In an age of ticketing sale catastrophes, expensive dynamic pricing and the fundamentally limited physical capacity of an arena, many fans can only afford to watch from afar. Although those who bought tickets may argue that spoilers undermine their hard-won investment, those illicitly broadcasting from the room are democratising the experience for those at home. A particularly young generation came of age during the pandemic, where you could only see live music through a livestream, and that expectation of access hasn’t gone away (not least among fans with disabilities, and rightly so). There was outcry when Frank Ocean’s recent set at the first weekend of Coachella wasn’t part of the official livestream, so one teenage musician in the front row took it upon herself to broadcast the whole messy affair. Thousands of viewers tuned in (including, reportedly, Lorde, whose own shows have been pored over in this way). “I felt that I had not only witnessed but participated in something significant – not in spite of but because of the spontaneous stream,” critic Jenn Pelly wrote of the experience in the New York Times. The musician, 18-year-old Morgan Lee, also didn’t seem to mind the virality, and was interviewed by Pitchfork about her experiences. Maybe personal microfame is another motivation (if your clip is the one to go viral, you can always drop a self-promotional link in a follow-up tweet), though creating a communal, open-source archive of an artist’s work seems like the greater project for fans here – the latest iteration of a pastime as old as pop itself, from personal scrapbooks and zines to meticulous Geocities clippings sites. With acts such as Beyoncé and Swift, who seldom give interviews and maintain tight control over their images, it’s in capturing the unscripted moments at shows that we witness previously unseen flashes of personality, like Swift mouthing “what the fuck!” when part of her staging didn’t open on time at a recent show. It can capture moments of artistic evolution onstage: Rosalía debuting her song Despechá, which became the viral hit of last summer before she had even released the recorded version; Lorde telling fans that after the mellow Solar Power, she was approaching writing “bangers” again. For chaotic artists such as the 1975, fan footage captured the vicissitudes of Healy’s mood as he swerved between eating raw meat onstage, kissing fans and admitting, in the wake of a recent scandal, that his “asshole era” was over. You might scoff at the documentation of apparent trivialities, but think how much money Bob Dylan fans spend on his Basement Tapes series to hear micro-variations on a beloved song; how Beatles fans hunger to chronicle every minute of their existence. Fandom is about intimacy. The idea of spoilers raises questions about what the live music experience is in 2023. Part of going to a big pop show used to be about playing into the illusion that this highly rehearsed endeavour was a uniquely individual experience – one that might be undermined by knowing too much in advance. But a setlist isn’t a plot, and any super fan who’s been to see an artist multiple times, whether Status Quo or Harry Styles, knows the joys of witnessing microshifts in how they approach a song, or in the performers’ moods: I once saw the National play five times in six days, my own personal test match of melancholy, and in time, my adrenaline synced to their arrangements. And since pop stars have grown more human in the age of social media, there’s every chance that each date of a big show will reflect where they’re personally at that night, whether they cry, swear or slip up. That’s part of the joy of attending concerts, too: the experience depends on what you bring to it, the air in the room that night: what psychologist Richard Gerrig termed “narrative transportation”. Whenever Swift’s Eras tour hits the UK, the amount of content I’ve already consumed means I won’t be surprised by her outfits or setlist, but I know being there screaming along with my “Swiftageddon” WhatsApp group pals will induce a rare high that no amount of pre-seen TikToks could steal. And often what you’re expecting to have an emotional response to isn’t the trigger at all. When I saw Paramore at London’s O2 Arena recently, I thought it would be Hard Times that got me after I listened to it a lot during some recent … hard times. In fact, it was Hayley Williams doing a high kick that jolted the tears out of me. Why? Who knows! I don’t even remember what song they were playing, but I remember the chest-punching feeling of that moment: a little reminder of being alive that no amount of forewarning can spoil."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2023/may/11/how-the-good-guys-got-it-wrong-on-the-risks-of-gas-cooktops-and-bob-katters-new-vest","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-11T02:56:18Z","webTitle":"How The Good Guys got it wrong on the risks of gas cooktops, and Bob Katter’s new vest | Temperature Check","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/11/how-the-good-guys-got-it-wrong-on-the-risks-of-gas-cooktops-and-bob-katters-new-vest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2023/may/11/how-the-good-guys-got-it-wrong-on-the-risks-of-gas-cooktops-and-bob-katters-new-vest","fields":{"headline":"How The Good Guys got it wrong on the risks of gas cooktops, and Bob Katter’s new vest ","bodyText":"Australian retailer The Good Guys removed an article on its website this week that had described gas cooktops as efficient and affordable without mentioning the growing health and climate concerns of burning a fossil fuel in your kitchen. The article, which was pulled after this column sent in questions, is nevertheless archived and had compared gas stoves to new electric induction cooktops. “Before you decide what to buy, it’s important to understand how these cooktops work, plus the pros and cons of each. Who knows – you might even try something new based on what you learn!” the article said. What readers wouldn’t have learned from the article was anything about the climate-heating emissions from burning gas or the health risks. Eytan Lenko, chief executive of Boundless, an organisation that advocates for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels and electrification, described the article as “extremely misleading” and tagged The Good Guys with his concerns on Twitter before the article was pulled. The growing controversy over the use of gas in homes should have been hard to miss. Some councils and states in Australia are already looking for ways to phase-out or ban gas from newly built homes. In the US, the Consumer Product Safety Commission is currently investigating the health hazards from gas stoves that could eventually see gas cooktops regulated. Across California, according to environment organisation Sierra Club more than 70 cities and counties have introduced building codes to curtail gas use in new homes. Last week New York became the first state in the US to introduce a phased ban on gas for cooking and heating in new buildings. The Good Guys article, dated 28 March, said gas stoves were “fast, efficient and very powerful”. But induction cooktops are considered three times more efficient than gas. Much of the heat from gas is wasted warming the air, rather than the food. Health experts have said using gas for cooking presents a health risk. Dr Christine Cowie, an environmental epidemiologist at UNSW Sydney, said: “Any gas appliances including gas stoves and gas heaters – flued and unflued - will emit noxious gases such as nitrous oxides, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane and formaldehyde. The use of gas stoves and gas heaters have been associated with increased risk of asthma and respiratory symptoms. “Ultimately, we need to move away from using fossil fuels such as gas for heating and cooking in our homes,” she said, adding there were also risks from wood heaters in homes. Studies in the US and Australia have said gas stoves are responsible for about 12% of childhood asthma cases. That burden could be substantially cut with the use exhaust vents, the studies have said. Burning gas also releases CO2, adding to the accumulation of the gas in the atmosphere that’s driving a climate crisis. In a statement, The Good Guys said the company “regularly review and update the product information we publish to help customers choose the product that is right for them. In this case, the information was out of date and has been removed. “We will continue to focus on our customers and ensure we can respond to their changing preferences with more energy efficient products that incorporate the latest innovations.” Charlatans? Last month media watchdog the Australian Communications and Media Authority found four segments on climate change and the Great Barrier Reef from the Sunday morning Sky News program Outsiders had breached industry codes for accuracy and fairness. In a response on the show, presenter Rowan Dean dismissed human-caused global warming as “just a theory” as well as misrepresenting what the watchdog had actually found. Just a bit of background first. The former prime minister Kevin Rudd raised about 80 issues with Acma related mostly to Dean’s “Weather and the Sceptics Ice-Age Watch” segments from late 2021. Dean said of the “80 or so” issues raised by Rudd “90% of the complaints were not proceeded with,” adding: “What does it tell you that in 90% of those issues, Acma did not consider it necessary to proceed further?” So what does it tell us? A statement from Acma said: “The Acma did not dismiss 90% of the allegations. As much of the content across the programs was repeated, there were recurring concerns raised in the 80 allegations. “The Acma looked at all 80 allegations and selected a sample to formally investigate against the relevant codes of practice. We did not come to a view on whether or not those matters which were not investigated complied with the codes of practice.” Dean defended one segment when the Outsiders audience was told that a report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science (Aims) – at the time misnamed as the Australian Maritime Institute – had released a report on conditions across the Great Barrier Reef. In the segment, the audience was told: “They’ve come out and said there’s never been so much coral.” Dean said: “According to the Acma finding, [the statement in program] was not true at the time I made the comments, although it is true now.” Except there was another reason why Acma found Outsiders had breached its code relating to accuracy, fairness and impartiality. That was because while Aims’s 2021 long-term monitoring report had said coral cover was recovering, Acma’s investigation said its report “nevertheless found that the recovery was fragile and at risk and that the longer-term prognosis was uncertain.” “None of this important context was provided,” the investigation said. “A viewer would be left with the idea that the Aims report had demonstrated that the proposition that reef health was at serious risk was a false proposition.” After all that, Dean went on to justify his own position that climate change was “just a theory” and that the “science is never settled” by pointing to scientific and philosophical greats like Galileo, Albert Einstein, Karl Popper and Carl Sagan. Defending his own position, Dean quoted the late American astrophysicist and science presenter Sagan, who once wrote: “Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back… If we can’t think for ourselves, if we are unwilling to question authority, then we are putty in the hands of those in power.” So what did Sagan – this revered figure in science communication – think about climate change? Was he taken in by charlatans? In an amazingly prescient testimony to congress in 1985, Sagan warned if fossil fuel burning continued it could push up global temperatures by several degrees centigrade, melt glaciers and ice sheets and raise global sea levels. He also warned of China’s economic emergence and its appetite for coal, and how a global accord would be needed. “Here is a problem which transcends our particular generation. It’s an intergenerational problem,” he said. “If we don’t do the right thing now, then there are very serious problems that our children and grandchildren will have to face.” CO2 is good for koalas? Visiting a coal mine in Queensland, federal MP Bob Katter sported a new vest with the words: “No CO2, No Tree.. No Tree, No Me” with a picture of a koala in a hard hat. Trees do take in CO2 as they grow and store it. But does that mean adding more CO2 is good for koalas? “CO2 levels are not at risk, but a stable climate is,” said Prof David Bowman, a fire scientist at the University of Tasmania. “CO2 pollution is not good for wildlife because it causes global heating that leads to intense droughts and extreme fires like the 2019-20 bushfires that had disastrous effects on native flora and fauna, especially koalas that live in the flame zone.” Katter also attacked Australian brands Coles and VB for trying to source more of their power from renewables which, he tried to argue on the back of his vest, meant they were getting their electricity from China because this is where many wind turbines and solar panels are made. They should be supporting Australian coal, he said. But analyst Tim Buckley, of Climate Energy Finance, said this ignored how Australian mining also produced half of the world’s supply of lithium used for solar power, as well as other critical metals and minerals like copper, nickel and cobalt."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/10/avoid-using-gas-transition-fuel-move-clean-energy-study-urges","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-09T23:01:23Z","webTitle":"Avoid using gas as ‘transition’ fuel in move to clean energy, study urges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/avoid-using-gas-transition-fuel-move-clean-energy-study-urges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/10/avoid-using-gas-transition-fuel-move-clean-energy-study-urges","fields":{"headline":"Avoid using gas as ‘transition’ fuel in move to clean energy, study urges","bodyText":"Countries should move from coal to renewable energy without shifting to gas as a “transition” fuel to save money, as high gas prices and market volatility have made the fossil fuel an expensive option, analysis has found. Natural gas has long been touted as a “transition” fuel for economies dependent on coal for their power needs, as it has lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal but requires similar centralised infrastructure, and gas-fired power stations take only a couple of years to build. Earlier this year, before Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Commission angered green campaigners by including gas as a “bridge” to clean energy in its guidebook for green investment. High prices for gas, and the plummeting cost of renewable energies such as wind and solar power, have reversed that logic, according to analysis from TransitionZero. The cost of switching from coal to renewable energy has plunged by 99% since 2010, according to its report published on Tuesday. The findings call into question the economic viability of the scores of gas and coal-fired power plants that are planned or under construction around the world. About 615GW of new gas plants, and 442GW of new coal-fired power stations, are planned for construction globally, according to the analysis. Matt Gray, the co-founder of TransitionZero, said it no longer made sense to think of gas as a transition fuel, and countries should opt for renewables in place of coal. “Despite some regional variation, our analysis shows a clear deflationary trend in the cost of switching from coal to clean electricity,” he said. “Independent of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this trend will accelerate, presenting governments with an economic opportunity to protect electricity consumers from continued fossil fuel volatility.” Many countries are reviewing their energy policies in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – which has sent fossil fuel prices soaring and disrupted supplies – and may be considering a reversion to coal. The amount of power generated from coal rose 9% to a record high last year, even before the war in Ukraine, and if the coal-fired power stations now planned are built the world will have little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, according to separate analysis published last month. Gray said that although the economics were firmly in favour of renewable energy, governments must make some policy changes in order to realise the full benefits. These included making it easier to build windfarms and solar power, because acquiring planning permission can take up to 10 years in some regions; removing distorting incentives and tax breaks for fossil fuels; and ensuring electricity markets are properly functioning. The analysis also found that the economics of moving from coal power to renewable energy, without using gas, were most favourable in Europe, where the price of coal has increased, in part because of EU policies and also because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In China and the US, however, domestically produced coal is cheaper than in Europe. Despite the lower price of renewables, China is still planning new coal-fired power stations, and the US could increase its coal use in response to higher demand for gas. In Japan, the price of switching from coal to renewables is higher still, because of “discriminatory regulations and land-use constraints”, and in south-east Asia some countries subsidise coal and gas, distorting the economics of a switch to clean power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T15:25:19Z","webTitle":"De facto ban on solar farms in England to continue, Coffey signals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/17/de-facto-ban-on-solar-farms-in-england-to-continue-therese-coffey-signals","fields":{"headline":"De facto ban on solar farms in England to continue, Coffey signals","bodyText":"The de facto ban on solar farms will be continued by Rishi Sunak’s government, the environment secretary has signalled. Thérèse Coffey, fresh from her visit to Cop27, suggested to parliament that she would be continuing with policy plans initiated under the former prime minister Liz Truss, which would block solar power from most farmland. Under Truss, Defra officials were looking at how to redefine “best and most versatile” land (BMV), which is earmarked for farming, to include the middling-to-low category 3b. Land is graded from 1 to 5, and currently BMV includes grades 1 to 3a. Planning guidance says that development on BMV land should be avoided, although planning authorities may take other considerations into account. This would mean 60% of all agricultural land would be off-limits to solar farms. It was hoped the Sunak government would reverse this decision, as to reach net zero targets, the country needs a huge expansion of renewables. However, when asked by the shadow climate minister Kerry McCarthy on Thursday, Coffey signalled she would be keeping the policy. She said: “It’s really important we make the best use of our land to have that food security … It’s also really important when considering land use to consider the best place to put renewable energy, which by and large most people would agree, let’s use our best agricultural land for farming and make use of brownfield sites for a lot of these energy projects, too.” Backing her up, in response to the Conservative MP Siobhan Baillie, who is campaigning against solar in her Stroud constituency, the environment minister Mark Spencer said: “She should be assured that my officials are working closely with other departments to ensure the right balance between boosting food production and energy security.” McCarthy told the Guardian: “It is beyond belief that this government is still considering blocking new solar developments during an energy crisis. This will drive up bills, risk our energy security and prevent us meeting our crucial climate targets. “From the ban on onshore wind to blocks on solar, every week it becomes clearer that Rishi Sunak is a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age. Labour’s plan would cut energy bills for good, creating thousands of good, green jobs and making Britain a clean energy superpower.” The solar industry was also unimpressed by the statements. Chris Hewett, the chief executive of Solar Energy UK, told the Guardian: “Since the resignation of Liz Truss and Ranil Jayawardena, all the ministerial statements from the departments that matter on energy policy, the Treasury and BEIS [Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy], have all been explicitly supportive of more renewables and specifically solar farms. “This gave the impression that anything that happened under Liz Truss’s brief tenure was to be disregarded, including the leaked proposals for changes to land classification leading to a de-facto ban on solar farms. “The new prime minister’s support for renewables at Cop27, as a means to deliver economic growth and energy security, reinforced that message. It is concerning that Thérèse Coffey has not clarified the position of her own department but existing policy already balances energy and food security effectively.” Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, James Cartlidge, said the new government was “serious about delivering cheaper, cleaner and more secure power” and would include solar farms in future auctions for “contracts for difference”. He added that the existing English planning system was “designed to take account” of the need to balance “community interests, food security and securing a clean, green energy system for the future”. Sunak has previously shown antipathy towards solar panels, and during the summer in his first run for leader he promised that “good agricultural land” would not be used for renewables. When asked if Coffey’s remarks meant she would be pushing for the block on solar farms, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to give an on-the-record comment but confirmed they had been looking at options to support farming and energy security while protecting nature and delivering on net zero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/nov/17/after-mike-cannon-brookes-shake-up-agl-now-faces-the-challenge-of-pivoting-away-from-power-stations","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-17T03:25:59Z","webTitle":"After Mike Cannon-Brookes’ shake-up, AGL now faces the challenge of pivoting away from power stations | Tristan Edis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/17/after-mike-cannon-brookes-shake-up-agl-now-faces-the-challenge-of-pivoting-away-from-power-stations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/17/after-mike-cannon-brookes-shake-up-agl-now-faces-the-challenge-of-pivoting-away-from-power-stations","fields":{"headline":"After Mike Cannon-Brookes’ shake-up, AGL now faces the challenge of pivoting away from power stations","bodyText":"Mike Cannon-Brookes and his collaborators have succeeded in sending shock waves throughout the boardrooms of major companies around Australia. His campaign, via shareholder activism, has resulted in a mass clean-out of the board of directors of Australia’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, AGL Energy. Perhaps more importantly it has resulted in AGL management substantially accelerating their exit out of coal. AGL’s decision to close Loy Yang A power station by 2035 probably helped precipitate the decision of the Victorian Labor party (facing an election on 26 November) to commit to seeing all coal power closed by 2035, and an expansion of renewable energy to 90% of the state’s power supply. Critically, board directors and chief executives of other major Australian companies can now see clearly that if they fail to take climate change issues seriously, they risk an investor backlash that could put them out of a job. Some environmentalists will still remain unsatisfied because AGL’s current climate transition plan is not consistent with an emissions reduction pathway to contain global warming to 1.5C. While Cannon-Brookes has succeeded in getting all four of his board nominees elected, significant challenges remain in the way of a further acceleration in coal closure. The Russian-induced spike in the international prices of gas and coal has flowed through to Australian power prices. Because AGL’s Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations receive coal that is not tied to international prices, these power plants are likely to be incredibly profitable right now. For how long international prices remain elevated is difficult to predict, but as the profits flow through to financial results, it will be hard to persuade a majority of AGL shareholders to bring forward the closure dates. The other issue is that there are genuine constraints and uncertainties surrounding the expansion of renewable energy in this country. The process for connecting new solar and wind power plants to the grid is not working well. Many large projects over the past two years were physically completed but then left for months either idle or heavily constrained. New transmission lines are also necessary but they are expensive, time consuming and can face significant community resistance. There are also disputes over who should pay for them. Thankfully, Australia is not the only country looking to rapidly expand the use of wind and solar power, and batteries and electric vehicles. But this has meant prices have risen and wait times on orders have blown out. We also need more people, particularly those skilled in electrical engineering as well as software. Within a five-year time frame, things look very difficult. But over a 10-year period it will become far easier – provided we maintain a concerted and coordinated effort. It’s not the AGL board’s job to solve these problems – that needs to be led by governments. Instead, they need to consider how to profitably respond. This isn’t as simple as just building lots of new renewable energy power plants and batteries. Households and businesses are adding solar to their rooftops at a rapid pace. In the near future, it’s likely they will also begin adding large energy storage devices within their cars which can discharge power into the grid (known as vehicle to grid). Given we sell around 1m new cars a year, and assuming they each could export the same amount of power as a typical solar system – 5kW – that’s an additional 5,000MW of dispatchable power every year. That’s more capacity than AGL’s Loy Yang A and Bayswater combined. The Victorian and Queensland state governments are proposing to build and own several thousand megawatts of their own generation. While superannuation funds are also keen to invest in new renewable energy. The future for companies like AGL is in software and trading rather than power stations. In 10 years many people will own more power capacity on their roof and their car than they can possibly make use of. To make good use of this spare capacity will require someone who can effectively coordinate it in a way that makes this appealing and easy for the customer. History suggests most companies fail in such major strategic pivots against less experienced but more technologically savvy new entrants. So the new refreshed board faces a very challenging task. • Tristan Edis is a director with energy advisory firm Green Energy Markets"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"news/2020/nov/20/weatherwatch-a-bumper-year-for-solar-power-thanks-to-sunny-spring-and-lockdowns","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2020-11-20T21:30:34Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: a bumper year for solar power, thanks to sunny spring and lockdowns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/nov/20/weatherwatch-a-bumper-year-for-solar-power-thanks-to-sunny-spring-and-lockdowns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2020/nov/20/weatherwatch-a-bumper-year-for-solar-power-thanks-to-sunny-spring-and-lockdowns","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: a bumper year for solar power, thanks to sunny spring and lockdowns","bodyText":"This year’s electricity output from the solar panels on the house roof is already well past the previous record since their installation 10 years ago. Part of the reason is the exceptionally sunny spring, plus the lack of pollution following lockdowns. Particularly significant in Bedfordshire is the curtailment of air traffic that in certain weather conditions used to leave contrails crisscrossing an otherwise clear blue sky. A decade ago photovoltaic solar panels were expensive and generous government feed-in tariffs were needed to encourage the industry. Those who took the plunge should have got their money back by now and, if my local estate agent is to be believed, added several thousand pounds to the value of their property. Solar panels give a home an income, often more than £1,000 a year. Panels are so cheap now that it is commercially viable to build solar farms in sunny spots without subsidy and get a good return on capital. Many businesses and local authorities aiming to become carbon neutral are adding them to offices, shops and factories. But without help the home installations market dried up, just when smart technology and batteries in the loft would make a massive difference to energy demand.

Previous Labour nature policies have been “trite”, MPs have said, arguing that the social justice case for climate and nature needs to be made more clearly by the party. The Labour Climate and Environment Forum (LCEF) launches on Tuesday in parliament and is now signing up MPs, councillors and peers. The group argues “that tackling the climate and environment emergency is an issue of social justice and economic prosperity that should sit comfortably at the heart of the movement as a core Labour value”. Members plan to write open letters to the Labour leadership on environment policy, and organise backbenchers to have coherent messaging. They also want to ensure all policy areas from planning to transport have an environmental agenda. LCEF has already produced some research that found voters warmed to Starmer; after hearing him talk about the environment, people were more than 12 percentage points more likely to think Labour was the best party for the economy. MPs have spoken of frustration at the success of the Conservative Environment Network, a group of more than 150 Tory parliamentarians that has managed to push a coherent message on nature and the environment in the party. Many Labour figures think they should be the natural party of climate, nature and social justice, but have been overtaken in terms of rhetoric by the Conservatives. Helmed by the former Labour policy adviser Paul McNamee, the new group is hoping to do the same for Labour, which has been accused by wildlife and climate campaigners of not having a coherent policy on nature, and abandoning plans for a “green new deal”. Its flagship climate and energy policies have been criticised as weak by the leftwing group Momentum and some trade union figures. MPs who have already signed up include Kerry McCarthy, the shadow climate minister, and Darren Jones, who chairs the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee. McCarthy said that although in general Tory commitments on the environment and nature were “quite shallow”, they had “managed to create quite a noise around it”. She said: “You hear Conservative MPs talking about green issues a lot and I think the danger is with Labour is that we can end up just talking to ourselves and maybe talking internally to stakeholders, without actually going out and making the case to the public.” While she praised Starmer and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, for mentioning green issues in major speeches last year, she said the environmental message was in danger of getting lost. “When Ed [Miliband] was leading [the party], there was no doubt in his green credentials, but he found he spent an awful lot of time talking about, say, immigration or things without a particularly green angle,” she said. “This is about just making sure that they’re trying to think of better ways to put it across, making sure there’s a buzz around it and that people feel confident knowing what our policies are and what we would actually be looking to do.” While the party has announced some policies such as a publicly owned green energy company, McCarthy admits it has a blind spot on nature. “I think we want to go into the election with a very clear offer, I mean, with the 2019 election, and that was a rush job anyway, we weren’t really expecting it. But the one thing I can remember is there was this whole battle about how many trees we’re going to plant. And it almost seemed like that was the whole nature side of the election campaign.” The party should naturally have a stronger message than the Conservatives, McCarthy added. “We are naturally far better on these issues, because we’re not up against these vested interests. So against this sort of ideological example, the sort of Jacob Rees-Mogg approach, for want of a better phrase, that argument that was against environmental protection, against red tape. And we’re against the nimbyism around things like onshore wind, for example, or solar power.” However, she said: “I just feel like there’s in some ways a bit of a lack of confidence, speaking about it sometimes and this group should help us get out there.” McNamee, who has worked for wildlife organisations including the RSPB, sought advice from the Conservative Environment Network when setting up the group. “Particularly in the climate movement, there’s a recognition that the Conservative Environment Network exists, and they’ve done an extremely good job at keeping net zero and climate at the heart of the government,” he said. McNamee says the Labour group aims to assure the leadership that “climate and nature policies are actually extremely popular with the general public. It’s not this kind of fringe issue that it was once viewed to be.” He added: “The thing about climate and environment is the solution to it is going to sit across several government departments – it’s housing, and it’s planning and it’s transport. It’s going to need a real effort from across government. Climate action is no longer just about addressing climate and environmental impact. It’s absolutely key to the future economy of this country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/california-power-cuts-heatwave-climate-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T20:07:32Z","webTitle":"California urges residents to cut power use as searing heatwave grips US west","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/california-power-cuts-heatwave-climate-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/california-power-cuts-heatwave-climate-crisis","fields":{"headline":"California urges residents to cut power use as searing heatwave grips US west","bodyText":"California has urged residents to cut power use as a searing heatwave settles over the state and stretches power supplies to a breaking point, in the latest sign of extreme weather conditions in the US west. Temperatures in the most populous state are forecast to climb to well above 100F (38C) during the afternoon. To prevent power outages, state officials asked residents and businesses to turn off lights and appliances and preset their thermostats to 78F (26C), especially during the critical hours between 4 and 9pm local time when demand typically peaks and solar power generation beings to ebb. It’s been a brutal summer so far in the US west, where wildfires and severe drought have emerged as a growing threat. As spells of excessive heat become more frequent, the strain on power and water utilities will become more acute, scientists say. Just yesterday, the federal government ordered water cutbacks across several western states to protect the beleaguered Colorado river. California’s grid operator made similar power usage requests during the summers and falls over the last two years, when the region experienced several bouts of record-breaking hot weather. Power systems withstood heat waves in 2021 but rolling blackouts for two days in August 2020 left about 400,000 households without power. On Wednesday, the California grid operator projected power demand would peak at 44,919 megawatts (MW), the highest since September 2020 when usage hit 47,236 MW. One megawatt can power around 1,000 US homes on a typical day, but only about half that on a hot summer day. As a result, power prices during the day in southern California and in Washington state could climb to their highest points since September 2021. The heat on Wednesday is also raising the risk of wildfires. The Wishon fire, a 350-acre blaze in the Sequoia national forest, was 35% contained On Tuesday, the US government warned that more drastic cuts in water usage were needed to protect dwindling supplies held in reservoirs that are crucial to the well-being of seven western states. Two reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have fallen to just above one-quarter of their capacity this summer. If they fall much lower, the lakes will be unable to generate hydroelectric power for millions on the west, authorities say. In Big Bar, an unincorporated area of northern California for instance, temperatures could reach 110F (43C) on Wednesday while farther north, residents in Electric City, Washington, could see 105F, the National Weather Service said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-30T16:55:46Z","webTitle":"Net zero strategy shows UK will miss 2030 emissions cuts target ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/30/net-zero-strategy-shows-uk-will-miss-2030-emissions-cuts-target","fields":{"headline":"Net zero strategy shows UK will miss 2030 emissions cuts target ","bodyText":"The UK government has said it is still on track to meet its international climate commitments under the Paris agreement, as analysis of its energy plans suggested more drastic policies would be needed to make the required carbon cuts. Ministers announced the UK’s revamped net zero strategy on Thursday, with a raft of documents exceeding 1,000 pages, setting out policies on sectors from biomass to solar power, and from electric vehicles to nuclear reactors. It came as Rishi Sunak headed to Oxfordshire to visit a development facility for nuclear fusion, accompanied by Grant Shapps, the energy and net zero secretary. The prime minister said: “People should be really proud of the UK’s track record on all of this. If you look at it, we’ve decarbonised faster than any other major economy. Our carbon emissions have been reduced by over 40%, much more than all the other countries that we compete with.” Shapps later told Sky News: “We all know that electricity can be a big way to decarbonise, but we also know these are big changes. So this is not a sort of rip-out-your-boiler moment. This is a transition over a period of time to get to homes which are heated in a different way and also insulated much better.” The government’s analysis, however, shows that its new policies will meet only 92% of the emissions cuts required and, without further changes, the target will be missed. At the heart of its strategy is the UK’s legally binding requirement to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and its commitment under the Paris agreement to a plan – called a nationally determined contribution, or NDC – to cut emissions by 68% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. The 2030 pledge, boasted of as “world-leading” in the run-up to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, is vital to get the UK on track to meet the long-term goal, and will be closely scrutinised by other governments. Within the dense pages of analysis and recommendations, the official assessment of the NDC stood out: “We have quantified emissions savings to deliver 88 megatonnes or 92% of the NDC. We are confident that the delivery of emissions savings by unquantified policies detailed in this package will largely close this gap and the government will bring forward further measures to ensure [it] will meet its international commitments if required.” However, Chris Venables, the head of politics at Green Alliance thinktank, said: “Our analysis shows that even that 92% is a very generous reading. It is hard to celebrate an announcement that says itself it’s not enough. The bottom line is that this plan doesn’t plot a route to net zero. There are only so many times we can claim climate leadership while falling short of our own targets.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate and net zero secretary, told MPs: “A target for less than seven years’ time, and they [the government] are miles off … all of the policies, all of the hot air, don’t meet the target they promised on the world stage.” A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero told the Guardian: “We remain committed to delivering our international commitments, including the 2030 NDC under the Paris agreement which we fully expect to meet. We are on track to deliver our carbon budgets, creating jobs and investment across the UK while reducing emissions. Our carbon budget delivery plan is a dynamic long-term plan for a transition that will take place over the next 15 years, setting us on course to reach net zero by 2050.” A few of the winners … Electric vehicles Car manufacturers must ensure a proportion of their sales are of electric vehicles – 22% of cars and 10% of vans by 2024 – under a zero emissions vehicle mandate, though campaigners said the proportion had been set too low. About £800m in capital funding is being made available for electric vehicles, and there will be a boost to EV charging infrastructure. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Much of the government’s strategy for continuing with fossil fuel development – with decisions on potential new oil and gas fields imminent – rests on the deployment of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide in geological formations under the North Sea. The government shortlisted eight projects to move ahead in its funding scheme, including one backed by oil giant BP, and expects to make £20bn of investment available over 20 years in CCS. Hydrogen and nuclear The government named 20 new hydrogen projects that are on track to receive a share of £240m, to help the development of a fuel the government sees as central to the UK’s low-carbon future. It comes despite doubts among experts over some of its applications – particularly in home heating – and some of its sources, as fossil fuel companies are looking to hydrogen to allow them to continue drilling. Great British Nuclear will be a new organisation intended to come forward with small nuclear projects that the government believes will be key to its aim of generating a quarter of the UK’s electricity from nuclear by 2050. And some of the gaps and the losers … Onshore wind The government dashed hopes that its new strategy might lift the ban on onshore windfarms in England. The lack of action has frustrated leading academics and green groups because onshore windfarms could begin powering the grid far sooner than nuclear reactors, and would help to reduce energy bills. Dr Daniel Quiggin, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said onshore wind could bring greater real emissions reductions than removing emissions from the air via carbon capture technology. Grid connections While the government hopes to boost renewable power generation, and nuclear energy, there was little detail on how to solve one of the most pressing problems for the UK’s ageing electricity network. New windfarms and other sources of power, and the battery storage facilities needed to smooth out the intermittency of renewable power, can wait years for the grid connections they need, partly owing to the difficulty of getting planning permission and partly to a lack of grid capacity. Andy Willis, the founder of Kona Energy, said: “Without significant grid connection reform, the vast potential of clean energy development will linger, trapped behind red tape and bureaucratic delays.” Farming There was little reference to agriculture, even though farming and food prices are highly sensitive to energy costs and agriculture is one of the biggest single sources of UK emissions. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was involved in the Whitehall discussions around Thursday’s announcements, but a key land use strategy is not due until the end of June. Then, both the future of farming emissions and the potential for growing trees and restoring landscapes to store carbon – and offset the UK’s remaining emissions by 2050 – will be addressed. Biomass There was drama on the stock market on Thursday as shares in Drax, which operates the UK’s biggest power station burning biomass, fell early on after the government appeared to reject its plea for increased subsidies for a project to capture and store the carbon dioxide from its wood burning. But Drax quickly pointed out that the main decisions on subsidies will follow later, by the end of June, when a biomass strategy is promised. The market confusion arose, the company claimed, because the government had separated its process for supporting hydrogen, gas and CCS projects from its consideration of biomass subsidies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-28T22:00:09Z","webTitle":"Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip review – behold, TV’s glorious new power throuple!","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/28/trailblazers-a-rocky-mountain-road-trip-review-behold-tvs-glorious-new-power-throuple","fields":{"headline":"Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip review – behold, TV’s glorious new power throuple!","bodyText":"It is an odd throuple, as Ruby Wax admits early on in her new three-part travel series, Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip (BBC One). “You might be thinking, what am I doing in the middle of the wild west with a Spice Girl and an actress?” she asks; presumably Wax, Melanie Brown and Emily Atack aren’t usual holiday mates. The answer is, of course, to pay tribute to a near-forgotten 19th-century female explorer named Isabella Bird, who made her way, on her own, across the Rocky Mountains in 1873. Bird is a personal hero of Wax’s, although why Brown and Atack are here is glossed over. They are trailblazers, too? That’ll do. It doesn’t really matter, because together they make for entertaining company. Wax reminded viewers of her calibre as a TV host with last year’s When Ruby Met ... retrospective, and she does have an uncanny ability to harness chaos at the same time as cause it. This makes her very watchable. Atack says she needs to get off Instagram and see the world, while Brown is there seemingly to keep an eye on Wax’s driving skills. If anyone remembers Maureen from Driving School, the comparison is not unfounded. They bicker like an old married couple (“Piss off, Ruby!”) and there is a familial dynamic here. It’s not unexpected when Atack calls one of them “mum”. The plan is that the women will take the same path Bird did, before veering off into other bits of Colorado to do a travelogue tinged with adventure, self-discovery and even self-care. I say self-care tentatively, because I know it has Gwyneth Paltrow connotations, and this isn’t as woo-woo or self-indulgent as that. But Bird was 41 and in ill health when she left Britain for an adventure in the hope that it would cure her maladies. Her health was much restored by her travels and she became famous in Colorado as “the Englishwoman who rode as well as a man”. This programme doesn’t make a song and dance of it, but Wax, 69, Brown, 47 and Atack, 32, have a number of conversations that suggest they are trying to make sense of how women should and could live today. This is intriguing for a number of reasons. One is that they come at it from different generations. Atack worries that her eggs are “dying”; Wax wonders what her life would have been like if she hadn’t felt the obligation to have children. The other is that they are entering into a traditionally macho, male world, although they do meet a number of female ranchers, who now make up one-third of all ranchers in the region. They wrangle cattle, climb mountains, visit bars and eat prairie oysters – which are emphatically not from the sea. More accurately, Atack eats them, and doesn’t much recoil when she’s told what they are. “The bollocks of an oyster?” she replies, which can be added to Jessica Simpson’s buffalo wings in TV’s history of unlikely cuts of meat. There’s a stagey scene in which the trio enter a small-town shop/bar, and the locals stop and stare, though I suspect the presence of a camera crew might have gone some way to grabbing their attention. Once they stop making Deliverance jokes, it gets much better. There are two standout sections, both of which involve less of the celebrity stuff, and more of them getting the stories of ordinary people. The first is Linda, who used her downtime during the pandemic to write a romantic fan-fiction style novel about Bird and her rumoured amour Mountain Jim, a “one-eyed desperado”. She seems delighted by how fantastically racy her own work is, as Wax reads selected parts, then goes on to describe the mountains as “like the kiss of a lover”. I want her to join the Trailblazers for the rest of their trip. The other highlight sees them spending time with Tim, a self-declared “mountain man”, who lives in a remote cabin only accessible by snowmobile for six months of the year. He talks about running it on solar power and spring water, the bears that have appeared on his porch, and taking from the land only what you need to survive. His personal history is moving and Wax teases it out of him beautifully. Then she hides in his wardrobe while Mel B breaks his desk. Atack, somehow ending up in a Saffy-from-Ab-Fab role, is dutifully collecting firewood and kindling outdoors. The mix of chaos and calm is entertaining and soothing. They gather round the fire and peace settles upon them. Judging by the teaser for next week, it doesn’t last long."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-01T20:00:33Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2022/may/01/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• An article about the UK government’s new energy strategy said targets for onshore wind and solar power generation would be raised in a push for 95% of electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030.

Due to a Russian withdrawal of supply, Europe is scrambling to get its hands on enough gas to get through its forthcoming winter. This has flowed through to an astronomical climb in the wholesale price of gas in Australia: 400% over 12 months. In addition, because coal can be substituted for gas, its international price has also risen by around the same proportion. This has also flowed through to Australian wholesale contract electricity prices, which are up by about 300% on where they were 12 months ago. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup State and federal energy ministers recently vowed to “consider all options to take strong action to bring down power prices”. The federal government is hinting this will involve imposing price controls on gas producers. While our European and north Asian gas customers will be aggrieved, they’ll probably understand. This will help reduce the pain, particularly on manufacturers. But there are constraints on how far these controls can go. They will still leave us with expensive gas – likely to be more than double its long-term historical levels. In addition, this will still leave us with extremely expensive electricity, because a large part of the increase in electricity prices is due to very high coal prices. Ministers must realise that you can lower people’s bills not just by influencing price, but also helping reduce householders’ need for energy by enhancing energy efficiency. The standard of Australian rental housing is nothing short of a national disgrace. It commonly snows over winter time in Britain and the Netherlands. So why do they need less gas to heat their homes than houses in Victoria? And why do a larger proportion of people in Australia die of cold than in Sweden? This is serious health issue as well as one of economics. While the vast majority of owner-occupied housing in Australia is insulated, much rental housing lacks even basic levels of ceiling insulation. Across Australia many rental properties lack any kind of heater, and so must rely on energy-guzzling plug-in heaters that struggle to heat a home. The Victorian government is the only one that has moved to regulate in this area by requiring that rental properties must install an “energy-efficient” heater. So what did this mean? A gas appliance with an energy rating of two stars out of six. You’d struggle to even find a gas heater with a worse rating than that to purchase. About 30% of all Australian households have solar power, yet within rental properties it is closer to 5%. The most vulnerable members of our community, the ones for whom an energy bill represents a major expense, are likely to rent their homes. They don’t have any say on the heater, the insulation, the water heater, or installation of a solar system –which are the main determinants of home energy consumption requirements. That’s the landlord’s decision. The cold-hearted reality here is that the landlord doesn’t pay the energy bill and so in most cases isn’t worried about these features. A house with good ceiling insulation, draught-proofing, an energy-efficient reverse cycle air conditioner, and a solar system or energy-efficient water heater is likely to have an energy bill $800 to $1,200 less than a similar house without these features. These bill savings completely dwarf anything that might be provided through gas price controls. Property investors for the most part have done extremely well over the past five years. Capital gains of $100,000 or more would not be uncommon in many Australian cities. Is it unreasonable to insist that they undertake upgrades costing around $10,000, to ensure their tenants can afford to heat their home and have warm water? To remove the financial sting to landlords, the federal government can provide concessional finance through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. But providing a home that is healthy and affordable to live in should not be optional. This was always a problem, but it has become incredibly more pressing given the energy price rises we are now witnessing. • Tristan Edis is a director with energy advisory firm Green Energy Markets"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/26/wash-blow-dry-and-15-degrees-please-hairdressers-trained-to-talk-about-climate-action","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-25T19:00:58Z","webTitle":"Wash, blow dry and 1.5 degrees please: hairdressers trained to talk about climate action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/26/wash-blow-dry-and-15-degrees-please-hairdressers-trained-to-talk-about-climate-action","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2023/mar/26/wash-blow-dry-and-15-degrees-please-hairdressers-trained-to-talk-about-climate-action","fields":{"headline":"Wash, blow dry and 1.5 degrees please: hairdressers trained to talk about climate action","bodyText":"Inside this chic Sydney hair salon, the chat between stylists and clients could be much the same as in any other hairdressers around the world. Some small talk. The ubiquitous and occasionally mundane chat about holidays and traffic. For regulars, the conversation can move to the deeply personal before you can say semi-tint or shag cut. In fact, there is only one easily missable clue in the front window that conversations inside Paloma might, when the occasion arises, be a bit different. A poster reads: “This salon chats about love, life &amp; climate action.” “The weather is the hook. You can take a cue from that,” says Prof Lesley Hughes, one of two climate scientists who have helped run workshops to give hairdressers the tools for times when the conversation turns to the existential. “You can show the science until you’re blue in the face but what can be more effective are people who you trust talking about it. It’s important to show it’s not a subject to be afraid of.” More than 400 hairdressers have attended workshops as part of a project called A Brush With Climate being driven by Paloma’s owner, Paloma Rose Garcia. During the sessions, hairdressers hear the basics of climate science and get to role play how conversations might go. They also take one of the posters back to their own salons. “We’re relationship builders,” says Garcia. “We suggest some easy ways to introduce climate to the conversation and the biggest one is definitely the weather. But we encourage all the hairdressers to make it their own story.” Some guests, she says “feel helpless and they’re a bit embarrassed that they don’t understand the science”, but want to know more. Mostly, clients accept the basis for climate action but don’t know what to do next. Garcia tells a story about one regular client, a mother of two. After having the climate chat and talking about solar power and ethical banking, she left happy. “She came back eight weeks later and she’s made all these changes. She was really proud. But also she’d been talking to all her girlfriends about it too. It might just be a 20-minute conversation but it can be really powerful.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads Jose Bryce Smith is founder of haircare company O&amp;M with a focus on environmentally friendlier and healthier products with less chemicals. She’s partnering with Garcia to build the project. They’re already fielding calls from the industry in the UK who want to know more. “Some women keep their hairdressers for a long time and they’ll tell them their secrets – they’re the unpaid therapist,” says Smith. Not every chat – or even most of them – will be about climate change, say Smith and Garcia. As pseudo-experts in human social interactions, hairdressers tend to know when it’s time to go quiet or change the subject. “For women, hair is so much a part of our identity and there’s a lot of trust that goes into that. You’re letting someone touch your hair and so you have to like them. That trust allows them to start that conversation. “There have been so many salons affected by fires and floods in the last few years in Australia. We could see what was happening to small businesses and how they were being affected by climate change – they’re casualties of what’s happening.” Social researcher Dr Rebecca Huntley, author of How To Talk About Climate Change in a Way That Makes a Difference, also talks to the hairdressers at the workshops. Huntley says hairdressers can reach important segments of the Australian public – people who make up about 40% of the population and are either concerned or cautious about climate, but don’t dismiss it or deny it’s a problem. “We know those people tend to avoid newspapers or books or any information really that broadcasts itself as being about climate change,” says Huntley. “But when we ask those people who they want to hear from about climate change they often say their friends and family. They’ll say climate change is a problem and they want to do more, but they want to hear that from people who are personally relevant to them and are relatable.” Huntley says as far as making a difference goes, having conversations about climate – if there are enough of them – can make real change. “The more that we make talking about climate change something that we just do all the time, the more likely it is we create a broad social mandate for climate action.” There is evidence, too, that hairdressers and beauticians have a unique role in societies. Dr Hannah McCann, a senior lecturer in cultural studies at the University of Melbourne, is researching the social and emotional role that hairdressers have with their clients. She says the hours at a time spent together, and the fact there’s plenty of touching, makes the relationship different from almost any other. “It’s both social, with the chit-chat, but also people can end up disclosing a lot of things. I’ve theorised that’s because of the intimacy. You might talk to your Uber driver, but they’re not touching your hair.” McCann has been interviewing hairdressers since 2017 and says clients will disclose personal secrets in the salon – including miscarriages, mental health problems or violence in relationships – that they won’t reveal to anyone else. “Often you can be in there for a long time, but it is a place where there is touch. There’s an intimacy that’s different – and people go back so the relationships build over time,” she says. She says in 2019 and 2020, hairdressers were having a lot of conversations about the black summer bushfires that ravaged much of Australia’s east coast. “People would be expressing some climate anxiety about the things that are happening. They’ve talked about events like bushfires and it would be good to have some skills to navigate those conversations.” McCann says in the long-term, the industry needs to acknowledge the social role hairdressers play – and the burden they carry when conversations do become emotionally heavy – and to train apprentices on how to help and cope themselves. The Brush With Climate project may have come along at just the right time – not only because at the 2022 federal election a record number of independent candidates (all female and all very pro-climate action) were elected to parliament. “There’s been a dramatic change in the industry in the last eight years or so,” says Paul Frasca, the co-founder of Sustainable Salons, an Australian “profit-for-purpose” company that recovers recyclables such as shampoo bottles and hair and uses them to create new closed-loop products. “There’s a bit of a green army of hairdressers and beauticians that are really passionate. But some hairdressers are scared to talk about sustainability and climate change because they don’t know enough. That’s what’s really great about what Paloma is doing.” Among the 1,500 businesses served by Sustainable Salons, Frasca says “dozens” were ravaged in the country’s recent horror fires and devastating floods. He says in surveys of the industry, there’s a common story. Hairdressers are often young mums and their children are learning more about environmental issues and climate change. And they want to see action. “These children are coming home and they’re yelling,” says Frasca. “Hairdressers are signing up to this because they want to be on the right side of history.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2023/may/22/first-thing-us-debt-ceiling-talks-productive-as-biden-and-mccarthy-to-meet","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2023-05-22T08:59:13Z","webTitle":"US debt ceiling talks ‘productive’ as Biden and McCarthy to meet | First Thing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/22/first-thing-us-debt-ceiling-talks-productive-as-biden-and-mccarthy-to-meet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2023/may/22/first-thing-us-debt-ceiling-talks-productive-as-biden-and-mccarthy-to-meet","fields":{"headline":"First Thing: US debt ceiling talks ‘productive’ as Biden and McCarthy to meet","bodyText":"Good morning. Joe Biden and the House Republican speaker, Kevin McCarthy, have held a “productive” phone call on the continued impasse over the debt ceiling and promised to meet today after the president returned to Washington. McCarthy, speaking to reporters after the call, said there were positive discussions on solving the crisis and that staff-level talks were set to resume later on Sunday. Asked if he was more hopeful after talking to the president, McCarthy said: “Our teams are talking today and we’re … meeting tomorrow. That’s better than it was earlier. So, yes.” Biden, who arrived back at the White House late yesterday evening after his trip to Japan, said the call with McCarthy had gone well. “We’ll talk tomorrow,” he added. Speaking from the G7 summit in Japan on Sunday, Biden said he would be willing to cut spending together with tax adjustments to reach a deal, but that the latest offer from Republicans on the ceiling was “unacceptable”. What will happen if a deal isn’t struck? Less than two weeks remain until the 1 June deadline, upon which the Treasury department has said the federal government could be unable to pay all its debts. Without raising the debt limit, the US government will default on its bills, a historic first, with likely catastrophic consequences. Federal workers would be furloughed, global stock markets would crash and the US economy would probably drop into a recession. US and Papua New Guinea sign security agreement amid Pacific militarisation concerns The US has signed a new security pact with Papua New Guinea amid concerns inside the country about increasing militarisation as the US competes with China for influence in the Pacific. The state department said the agreement would provide $45m to help improve security cooperation, including protective equipment for the PNG defence force, plus help in mitigating the effects of climate change, tackling transnational crime and HIV/Aids. But a draft copy of the defence cooperation agreement leaked last week sparked concern in PNG about the extent of US military involvement in the country, with reports it gives US personnel and contractors legal immunity, allows aircraft, vehicles and vessels operated by or on behalf of the US to move freely within its territory and territorial waters and exempts US staff from all migration requirements. Students at several universities have held protests at campuses against the signing of the agreement, amid concern it would upset China. What has PNG’s prime minister said? James Marape denied that US staff would have legal immunity and said no amendments would be made to the constitution or laws of the country. He said the country faced significant security challenges. “I need to strengthen and protect my country’s borders and ensure the safety of my people,” he said. “So this has nothing to do with geopolitics, this cooperation will strengthen our defence and help build our capacity.” Bakhmut remains ‘epicentre’ of combat, Ukraine’s armed forces say Fighting is continuing in Bakhmut, Ukraine’s armed forces have said in their morning update, after Russia claimed to have completed the “liberation” of the eastern city over the weekend. Ukrainian officials rejected the claims. “[In Bakhmut] the enemy continues to lead offensive actions. Fighting for the city of Bakhmut continues,” the armed forces said, adding that over the past day Russian forces had “unsuccessfully tried to recover lost positions south of the [nearby] settlement of Ivanivske”. Russia had also carried out airstrikes on Bakhmut. It has been impossible to verify the conflicting statements over the devastated city, which has assumed symbolic importance as a measure of which side has the resilience to prevail in the war overall. Confusion has reigned over the situation in Bakhmut after the Russian claim, which cannot be verified independently. Ukrainian officials said they still had a foothold in the city and were encircling it, while the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said at a G7 summit in Hiroshima on Sunday: “Bakhmut is not occupied by Russian Federation as of today. There are no two or three interpretations of this.” What else happened at the G7 summit? The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not meet at the G7 summit. Lula da Silva said he was “upset” they did not manage to meet, adding his Ukrainian counterpart seemed uninterested in negotiating peace with Russia. Why is China upset? Beijing has accused the G7 nations of collaborating to “smear and attack” China, after the weekend summit issued a communique that warned Beijing over its “militarisation activities” in the Asia-Pacific region. After the summit, China summoned the Japanese ambassador to register an official protest, and warned the UK to stop “slandering” the country to avoid further damage to bilateral relations.

Climate check: How solar farms took over the California desert: ‘An oasis has become a dead sea’ Deep in the Mojave desert, a sparkling blue sea shimmers on the horizon. Visible from the I-10 highway, it is an improbable sight: a deep blue slick stretching for miles across the Chuckwalla Valley, forming an endless glistening mirror. But something’s not quite right. Closer up, the water’s edge appears pixelated, with the look of a low-res computer rendering, like frozen waves. Over the last few years, this swathe of desert has been steadily carpeted with one of the world’s largest concentrations of solar power plants, forming a sprawling photovoltaic sea. On the ground, the scale is almost incomprehensible. The Riverside East Solar Energy Zone – the ground zero of California’s solar energy boom – stretches for 150,000 acres, making it 10 times the size of Manhattan. But experts warn environmental damage means it is ‘solving one problem by creating others’. Last Thing: Couple who helped Koreans stranded in US blizzard feted as heroes in Seoul A US husband and wife who sheltered 10 South Korean travelers in their home during a deadly snowstorm last Christmas have gone to Seoul and been feted as heroes. Alexander and Andrea Campagna went to South Korea’s capital as part of a 10-day tour of the city organized as a token of gratitude for the husband and wife who opened up their home in Buffalo, New York, to strangers in need. “To see everyone in Korea again is such a blessing,” Andrea Campagna, 43, told reporters in Seoul in reference to those whom she and her husband aided. “They ended up in the right place at the right time. Now we have people we can call friends for a lifetime.” The blizzard on 23 December that brought together the Campagnas and their newfound Korean friends was brutal. Officials said more than 22in of snow fell in Buffalo that day, and 40 people died for reasons linked to the blizzard, which the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, memorably described as “a war with Mother Nature”.

But hardly anyone is swimming or sunbathing. Fuga Island is not a holiday destination. The residents of the remote community of just over 2,000 on the northern tip of the Philippines are farmers and fishermen – growing palay and corn; raising native chicken, pigs and goats; and catching their bounty from the sea. However, things are changing on Fuga Island. These days a detachment of marines watches its coastline closely. The coast guard also regularly patrols the area, and might soon build a station there. They could soon be joined by US troops, too. To understand why requires only a brief look at the map. Fuga lies less than 400km (250 miles) from Taiwan and is situated in waters connecting the South China Sea to the Pacific Ocean, an area that is critical to the defence of the Philippines itself. As tensions rise in the region, its location means Fuga Island is in demand. The land mass is part of Cagayan, one of the provinces identified as a potential site to host the US military under a deal called the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which allows joint training, construction of temporary facilities, and storage of equipment and supplies. Unlike his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, President Marcos Jr has taken a stand against China’s aggression in the South China Sea, strengthening diplomatic and security ties with the US, Australia and Japan. The Philippines has reported dangerous manoeuvres by the China Coast Guard in the Spratly Islands, and in February accused Beijing of pointing a military-grade laser at a coast guard vessel. Amid the escalating rhetoric, Marcos has agreed to expand from five to nine the number of its sites that the US military can access under the EDCA. Discussions are still under way on which sites to choose, but local military analysts say Fuga offers the most strategic value. Unlike other islands in the area, Fuga has the topography to accommodate an airport and a seaport. “We want the marines and the coast guard here to protect the island. If it’s just us village officials, we cannot cover the entire area,” says Melchor Visario, the village chief on Fuga. He governs six communities scattered around the island, managing its meagre resources. He has been entertaining more visitors in recent years, as attention on the island grows. “We haven’t heard about the Americans coming here … They are also welcome.” While the likelihood of China’s military invading Taiwan remains a point of debate, the fear that Chinese forces would one day occupy Fuga is very real to its residents. “We are part of the Philippines. Where do we run? We will die if we are going to fight them ourselves,” says Marlon Erice, 46, a resident. “We will be safe here [with the security forces].” China wanted Fuga first It was Beijing, not Washington, that first saw Fuga’s potential. In 2019, Chinese company Fong Zhi Enterprise Corporation entered into an agreement with the private company that holds the title to the island, Fuga Island Holdings Inc, to build a “smart city” there as part of a $2bn project. However, the plan caused uproar in the Philippines security establishment, which was concerned about giving the Chinese an observation post within the country’s borders. The military quickly reached an agreement with regional leaders to establish a navy base on Fuga. The smart city project did not materialise, but several other China-funded projects were planned for the province, including manufacturing facilities, a high-tech industrial park, and an airport expansion, among others. Four years later, it may be the US’s turn to have a presence on the island. Fuga Island has undoubted strategic value to either superpower, as well as the Philippines. It is adjacent to two key passages – the Luzon Strait and the Bashi Channel – which provide access to the South China Sea and the Pacific. “[The US military deal] will allow the navy to monitor vessels and traffic and provide a base of operations for naval and air operations in the northern border,” says retired Rear Admiral Rommel Jude Ong, who is now a professor of praxis at the Ateneo School of Government in Manila. “The PLA [People’s Liberation Army] navy used this route during the recent Taiwan crisis,” he says, referring to China’s exercises near Taiwan in August 2022. Alex Vuving, a professor at the Daniel K Inouye Asia-Pacific Centre for Security Studies in Hawaii, says a location in the northern Phillipines would give the US access to Taiwan and the South China Sea, “two major places on the lifeline of Asia and the frontier of the great power competition of our time”. With the military comes vital supplies Despite their fears of China’s ambitions for the region, residents are enjoying the new attention the neglected island has been receiving. “Services are coming to us unlike before,” says Visario. The difficulty of sea transport means the remote island has to rely on its own resources as much as possible, especially during the windy months from September to December when small boats cannot sail to the mainland. It has an elementary school and some internet service, though it is usually patchy. Medical facilities are a boat ride away. There’s an old airstrip on the island, but it is owned by a private company that holds the title to the island and it’s not clear if it remains operational. However, the regular trips of the navy and coast guard have guaranteed more regular supply runs. The marines brought a power generator. They turn on the TV for the early evening news, drawing nightly crowds at their base. Homes on the island rely on small solar-power units to run lights and charge phones. Government workers arrived last year to teach the women dressmaking. The women now wish to get training on baking for those months when no one can travel. “We are afraid [of conflict erupting] but maybe it won’t happen,” said Ruby Visario, the wife of the village chief. ‘Curse of geography’ In March 2022, Appari, the municipality in which Fuga lies, hosted war games by the Philippine and US militaries on its shores. Helicopters, amphibious assault ships and a surface-to-air missile defence system were put on display to exhibit a coastal defence strategy, enthralling residents. The war games offered a “foretaste of EDCA”, says Father Manuel Catral, parish priest in Aparri. He says the locals welcomed the presence of the US troops and he himself was quite impressed with the hardware they brought. However, he says there needs to be more conversation if an EDCA facility is going to be built and US troops are to stay longer. Some of the fishing grounds were closed during the war games to protect residents. “We haven’t really talked about it. But is that what’s going to happen under EDCA?” he says. “That will be an important issue for the people.” In April, the Philippines and the US will carry out their biggest ever joint military exercises, called “balikatan” or “shoulder-to-shoulder” drills. The war games are designed to project stability and deterrence but tensions are rising in the region, the US military grows more pessimistic about avoiding a Chinese invasion of Taiwan in the next few years, and new military alliances such as Aukus are being formed to counter Beijing. As the uncertainty spirals, and the risks of a miscalculation increase, one thing is clear to retired Rear Admiral Ong: the Philippines cannot avoid getting involved if the Taiwan crisis erupts into a conflict. “It’s the curse of geography.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/feb/25/this-is-how-we-defeat-putin-and-other-petrostate-autocrats","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-02-25T11:18:13Z","webTitle":"This is how we defeat Putin and other petrostate autocrats | Bill McKibben","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/25/this-is-how-we-defeat-putin-and-other-petrostate-autocrats","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/25/this-is-how-we-defeat-putin-and-other-petrostate-autocrats","fields":{"headline":"This is how we defeat Putin and other petrostate autocrats","bodyText":"The pictures this morning of Russian tanks rolling across the Ukrainian countryside seemed both surreal – a flashback to a Europe that we’ve seen only in newsreels – and inevitable. It’s been clear for years that Vladimir Putin was both evil and driven and that eventually we might come to a moment like this. One of the worst parts of facing today’s reality is our impotence in its face. Yes, America is imposing sanctions, and yes, that may eventually hamper Putin. But the Russian leader made his move knowing we could not actually fight him in Ukraine – and indeed knowing that his hinted willingness to use nuclear weapons will make it hard to fight him anywhere, though one supposes we will have no choice if he attacks a Nato member. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t ways to dramatically reduce Putin’s power. One way, in particular: to get off oil and gas. This is not a “war for oil and gas” in the sense that too many of America’s Middle East misadventures might plausibly be described. But it is a war underwritten by oil and gas, a war whose most crucial weapon may be oil and gas, a war we can’t fully engage because we remain dependent on oil and gas. If you want to stand with the brave people of Ukraine, you need to find a way to stand against oil and gas. Russia has a pathetic economy – you can verify that for yourself by looking around your house and seeing how many of the things you use were made within its borders. Today, 60% of its exports are oil and gas; they supply the money that powers the country’s military machine. And, alongside that military machine, control of oil and gas supplies is Russia’s main weapon. They have, time and again, threatened to turn off the flow of hydrocarbons to western Europe. When the Germans finally this week stopped the planned Nordstream 2 pipeline, Putin’s predecessor, Dmitry Medvedev , said, “Welcome to the new world where Europeans will soon have to pay 2,000 euros ($2,270) per thousand cubic meters!” His not very subtle notion: if the price of keeping houses warm doubles, Europe will have no choice but to fold. Finally, even the Biden administration – which has been playing its hand wisely in the lead up to the invasion – is constrained by oil and gas. As we impose sanctions, everyone’s looking for an out: the Italians want to exempt high-end luxury goods and the Belgians diamonds, but the US has made it clear that it doesn’t want to seriously interrupt the flow of Russian oil for fear of driving up gas prices and thus weakening American resolve. As one “senior state department official” told the Wall Street Journal this week, “doing anything that affects … or halts energy transactions would have a great impact on the United States, American citizens and our allies. So our intention here is to impose the hardest sanctions we can while trying to safeguard the American public and the rest of the world from those measures,” the official said. It’s obviously not an idle fear: as of this morning Tucker Carlson was attacking Russia hawk Lindsey Graham for supporting a conflict that will bring “higher gas prices” while he has a “generous Congressional pension”. If you’re an apologist for fascism, high gas prices are your first go-to move. So now is the moment to remind ourselves that, in the last decade, scientists and engineers have dropped the cost of solar and windpower by an order of magnitude, to the point where it is some of the cheapest power on Earth. The best reason to deploy it immediately is to ward off the existential crisis that is climate change, and the second best is to stop the killing of nine million people annually who die from breathing in the particulates that fossil fuel combustion produces. But the third best reason – and perhaps the most plausible for rousing our leaders to action – is that it dramatically reduces the power of autocrats, dictators, and thugs. Imagine a Europe that ran on solar and wind power: whose cars ran on locally provided electricity, and whose homes were heated by electric air-source heat pumps. That Europe would not be funding Putin’s Russia, and it would be far less scared of Putin’s Russia – it could impose every kind of sanction, and keep them in place until the country buckled. Imagine an America where the cost of gas was not a political tripwire, because if people had to have a pickup to make them feel sufficiently manly, that pickup would run on electricity that came from the sun and wind. It would take an evil-er genius than Vladimir Putin to figure out how to embargo the sun. These are not novel technologies – they exist, are growing, and could be scaled up quickly. In the years after Hitler invaded the Sudetenland, America turned its industrial prowess to building tanks, bombers, and destroyers. In 1941, in Ypsilanti, the world’s largest industrial plant went up in six month’s time, and soon it was churning out a B-24 bomber every hour. A bomber is a complicated machine with more than a million parts; a wind turbine is, by contrast, relatively simple. In Michigan alone (“the arsenal of democracy”), a radiator company retooled to make 20m steel helmets and a rubber factory retooled to produce the liners for those helmets; the company that made the fabric for Ford’s seat cushions stopped doing that and started pushing out parachutes. Do we think that it’s beyond us to quickly produce the solar panels and the batteries required to end our dependence on fossil fuel? It’s not easy – among other things, Russia has a good deal of some of the minerals that help in renewable energy production. (Nickel, for example.) But, here again, the example of the second world war is helpful – with the Axis in control of commodities like rubber, we quickly figured out how to mass produce substitutes. It’s true that we could produce carbon free energy with nuclear power too, as long as we were willing to pay the heavy premium that technology requires – and right now Germany is probably regretting its decision to hastily shut down its reactors in the wake of the Fukushima accident. But if you think about the scenario now unfolding across Europe, you’re reminded of another of the advantages of renewable power, which is that it’s widely distributed. There are far fewer central nodes to attack with cruise missiles and artillery shells – targeting reactors is pretty easy, but driving your tank across Europe from one solar panel to the next so you can get out to smash it with a hammer is comical. At the moment, big oil is using the fighting in Ukraine as an excuse to try to expand its footprint – reliable industry ally Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, went on Fox this week to argue that stopping the Keystone XL pipeline had empowered the Russian leader, for instance, and the American Petroleum Institute today called for more oil and gas development. But this is absurd – we may need, for the remaining weeks of this winter, to insure gas supplies for Europe, but by next winter we need to remove that lever. That means an all-out effort to decarbonize that continent, and then our own. It’s not impossible. We have to do it anyway, if we’re to have any hope of slowing the climate change. And we can do it fast if we want: huge offshore windfarms in Europe have been built inside of 18 months without any wartime pressure. We should be in agony today – people are dying because they want to live in a democracy, want to determine their own affairs. But that agony should, and can, produce real change. (And not just in Europe. Imagine not having to worry about what the king of Saudia Arabia thought, or the Koch brothers – access to fossil fuel riches so often produces retrograde thuggery.) Caring about the people of Ukraine means caring about an end to oil and gas. Bill McKibben is the Schumann distinguished scholar at Middlebury College.

It has taken one of the oldest presidents in American history, who has been in politics for over half a century, to return the nation to an economic paradigm that dominated public life between 1933 and 1980, and is far superior to the one that has dominated it since. Call it democratic capitalism. The Great Crash of 1929 followed by the Great Depression taught the nation a crucial lesson that we forgot after Ronald Reagan’s presidency: the so-called “free market” does not exist. Markets are always and inevitably human creations. They reflect decisions by judges, legislators and government agencies as to how the market should be organized and enforced – and for whom. The economy that collapsed in 1929 was the consequence of decisions that organized the market for a monied elite, allowing nearly unlimited borrowing, encouraging people to gamble on Wall Street, suppressing labor unions, holding down wages, and permitting the Street to take huge risks with other people’s money. Franklin D Roosevelt and his administration reversed this. They reorganized the market to serve public purposes – stopping excessive borrowing and Wall Street gambling, encouraging labor unions, establishing social security and creating unemployment insurance, disability insurance and a 40-hour workweek. They used government spending to create more jobs. During the second world war, they controlled prices and put almost every American to work. Democratic and Republican administrations enlarged and extended democratic capitalism. Wall Street was regulated, as were television networks, airlines, railroads and other common carriers. CEO pay was modest. Taxes on the highest earners financed public investments in infrastructure (such as the national highway system) and higher education. America’s postwar industrial policy spurred innovation. The Department of Defense developed satellite communications, container ships and the internet. The National Institutes of Health did trailblazing basic research in biochemistry, DNA and infectious diseases. Public spending rose during economic downturns to encourage hiring. Even Richard Nixon admitted “we’re all Keynesians”. Antitrust enforcers broke up AT&amp;T and other monopolies. Small businesses were protected from giant chain stores. By the 1960s, a third of all private-sector workers were unionized. Large corporations sought to be responsive to all their stakeholders – not just shareholders but employees, consumers, the communities where they produced goods and services, and the nation as a whole. Then came a giant U-turn. The Opec oil embargo of the 1970s brought double-digit inflation followed by the Fed chair Paul Volcker’s effort to “break the back” of inflation by raising interest rates so high the economy fell into deep recession. All of which prepared the ground for Reagan’s war on democratic capitalism. From 1981, a new bipartisan orthodoxy emerged that the so-called “free market” functioned well only if the government got out of the way (conveniently forgetting that the market required government). The goal of economic policy thereby shifted from public welfare to economic growth. And the means shifted from public oversight of the market to deregulation, free trade, privatization, “trickle-down” tax cuts, and deficit-reduction – all of which helped the monied interests make more money. What happened next? For 40 years, the economy grew but median wages stagnated. Inequalities of income and wealth ballooned. Wall Street reverted to the betting parlor it had been in the 1920s. Finance once again ruled the economy. Spurred by hostile takeovers, corporations began focusing solely on maximizing shareholder returns – which led them to fight unions, suppress wages, abandon their communities and outsource abroad. Corporations and the super-rich used their increasing wealth to corrupt politics with campaign donations – buying tax cuts, tax loopholes, government subsidies, bailouts, loan guarantees, non-bid government contracts and government forbearance from antitrust enforcement, allowing them to monopolize markets. Democratic capitalism, organized to serve public purposes, all but disappeared. It was replaced by corporate capitalism, organized to serve the monied interests. Joe Biden is reviving democratic capitalism. From the Obama administration’s mistake of spending too little to pull the economy out of the Great Recession, he learned that the pandemic required substantially greater spending, which would also give working families a cushion against adversity. So he pushed for the giant $1.9tn American Rescue Plan. This was followed by a $550bn initiative to rebuild bridges, roads, public transit, broadband, water and energy systems. And in 2022, the biggest investment in clean energy in American history – expanding wind and solar power, electric vehicles, carbon capture and sequestration, and hydrogen and small nuclear reactors. This was followed by the largest public investment ever in semiconductors, the building blocks of the next economy. Notably, these initiatives are targeted to companies that employ American workers. Biden has also embarked on altering the balance of power between capital and labor, as did FDR. Biden has put trustbusters at the head of the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the justice department. And he has remade the National Labor Relations Board into a strong advocate of labor unions. Unlike his Democratic predecessors, Biden has not sought to reduce trade barriers. In fact, he has retained several from the Trump administration. But unlike Trump, he has not given a huge tax cut to corporations and the wealthy. It’s also worth noting that in contrast with every president since Reagan, Biden has not filled his White House with former Wall Street executives. Not one of his economic advisers – not even his treasury secretary – is from the Street. I don’t want to overstate Biden’s accomplishments. His ambitions for childcare, eldercare, paid family and medical leave were thwarted by Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. And now he has to contend with a Republican House. Biden’s larger achievement has been to change the economic paradigm that has reigned since Reagan. He is teaching America a lesson we once knew but have forgotten: that the “free market” does not exist. It is designed. It either advances public purposes or it serves the monied interests. Biden’s democratic capitalism is neither socialism nor “big government”. It is, rather, a return to an era when government organized the market for the greater good.

Chris Skidmore, the head of the government’s net zero review, said he aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the UK’s net zero ambitions. The 323-page net zero review covers the whole of the UK’s economy, as well as the impacts on individuals and communities. Everything from the funding for net zero schemes to the need for regulation, parliamentary scrutiny, data, and research and development is examined, along with sectors of the economy from energy and transport to housing and farming. There are 130 recommendations, ranging from the highly specific, such as bringing forward the end of routine flaring by oil and gas companies from 2030 to 2025, to vaguer hopes, such as central and local government working more closely together. Some of the main recommendations cover: Energy The government should consider replacing the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas with a net zero fund that ringfences the proceeds for investment in offshore wind and other low-CO2 projects. Nuclear power should have a clear strategy, and the government must “double down on achieving the UK’s nuclear baseload requirement”, including small modular reactors and “a fleet of projects”, though the review does not specify how many new power stations should be built. Hydrogen should have a 10-year delivery plan, set out by the end of this year, that will require decisions on funding and technology, including hydrogen for home heating. Ministers should also “consider” requiring fossil fuel producers to “take back” the CO2 produced from burning their fuels, by storing 10% of it underground, using carbon capture and storage technology. Ofgem’s remit should be expanded to include the net zero target. Homes The boiler upgrade scheme should be extended, and people given incentives to buy heat pumps. Skidmore publicly called for “a rooftop revolution”, though some of the recommendations are slightly weaker – for instance, that there should be a consultation on whether new homes should be fitted with solar panels, and a supply chain built up for renewables. Farming Environmental land management schemes, the replacement for the EU farm subsidy system, should be laid out in detail this year, the review recommends, which will come as a relief to farmers concerned about the vagueness of current government plans. Nature-based solutions, which help to increase the UK’s carbon sinks, should also be encouraged. The review also calls for a biomass strategy, without setting out what should be in it. Research and development By this autumn, the government should set out how to create incentives for research and development into new low-CO2 technologies. Three new demonstrator projects should be established. Finance The UK could become “the most competitive financial centre” for raising capital for the green transition, so the government should review opportunities for the banking sector and how to encourage investment. There should also be clear rules on how companies should report their climate impacts. What was missing? Onshore wind and solar farms The review suggests taskforces should be set up for the deployment of onshore wind and solar power, rather than calling for clear targets on onshore windfarms and solar farms in England. These have been controversial questions, as some Tory MPs are opposed to onshore windfarms – despite widespread public support for them – and solar farms. Insulation and home heating Although home heating accounts for 14% of the UK’s emissions, and is one of the biggest cost-of-living concerns amid soaring gas prices, the review stops well short of recommending the sort of nationwide house-by-house programme of upgrades that campaigners have been calling for, or setting out clear options on how to encourage homeowners to upgrade their energy efficiency. No new gas boilers should be installed from 2033, the review said, but that is just two years earlier than the government’s current target of 2035. Those hoping for a clear endorsement of hydrogen for home heating, however – which some hydrogen companies and Tory MPs want but which economists and energy experts say is uneconomic and physically unviable – will also have been disappointed. While not ruling out hydrogen for home heating, the review is notably lukewarm: by the end of this year, the government should update its analysis of hydrogen for home heating “to ensure that the case for economic optimality and feasibility still holds”. Behaviour change To meet the UK’s net zero targets, people will have to change their behaviour, from driving less to eating less meat. These changes should be healthier and better for most of us, but they will require some effort. There are recommendations on eco-labelling and a CO2 calculator for consumers, but beyond that, the review has nothing to say on how consumer behaviour should change, or how the government should encourage behaviour change. Transport Emissions from transport have scarcely budged in a decade, and it is now the biggest single contributor to the UK’s carbon footprint. Yet the review gives a scant five recommendations on the issue, two of which are for shipping and aviation. Public transport merits not a single recommendation, reflecting the absence of government strategy on the subject. On electric vehicles, the report recommends equalising VAT on public and private electric vehicle chargings – useful, perhaps, but not likely to have any significant impact. Meanwhile, why is there is no mention of the rollout of a nationwide system of charging points experts say is needed? Verdict What seeks to be a comprehensive review actually contains huge gaps, reflecting the Tory party’s seeming paralysis over basic issues that need to be grasped, from finding a way to finance the insulation British housing desperately needs, to building out onshore wind, and the absence of any real plan for transport or behaviour change. As a basis for action, this report passes too many bucks to be truly effective – but as an assessment of the government’s failures by a party loyalist, it is devastating."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/dec/13/saddler-to-supercharger-tenterfields-tesla-site-sparks-local-debate-on-evs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-12T14:00:02Z","webTitle":"Saddler to supercharger: Tenterfield’s Tesla site sparks local debate on EVs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/13/saddler-to-supercharger-tenterfields-tesla-site-sparks-local-debate-on-evs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/dec/13/saddler-to-supercharger-tenterfields-tesla-site-sparks-local-debate-on-evs","fields":{"headline":"Saddler to supercharger: Tenterfield’s Tesla site sparks local debate on EVs","bodyText":"The network of electric vehicle (EV) ‘supercharging’ stations in rural New South Wales is expanding, with a multibay site about to open in the New England town immortalised in the Peter Allen song, Tenterfield Saddler. Yet high diesel costs, anti-renewables sentiment, EV affordability, and calls for more local parking in Tenterfield, all suggest the era of the country fuel stop isn’t about to disappear quietly. The uptake of EVs in rural Australia is projected to lag behind cities until at least 2050. But in October, the NSW state government announced $39.4m for Ampol, BP, Tesla, the NRMA and others to co-fund and build 86 “fast and ultra-fast charging bays” compatible with all EV types, many across the regions. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The new stations promise to be much faster than the current network of “destination chargers” which have significantly longer recharge times than the 15 minutes claimed by the new 175-350kW superchargers. Tenterfield’s first supercharger was installed by Tesla, which has further sites planned in Armidale and Muswellbrook, giving more options for EV drivers using the New England Highway. During the construction of the four-bay site in Tenterfield’s shopping centre, debate raged on social media about its use of spaces in a 70-bay car park, fire risks of EVs – particularly batteries – and the need in a region of just 6800 residents. Tenterfield mayor Bronwyn Petrie, who published the initial post, acknowledges there has been a “mixed reaction” to the Tesla site, which she says didn’t require council oversight as it was installed on privately owned land. “Some people support the electric vehicle charging and they realise it is an opportunity. Other people find it somewhat hypocritical that electric vehicles are being charged using a fossil fuel energy source.” Petrie believes it’s important to have fossil fuel and renewable energy, “but we have to be very honest in our approach to that and acknowledge the fact that the renewables are at present heavily subsidised and they do use a lot of non-renewable components”. Energy minister Matt Kean’s announcement about the funding for the superchargers stated that they will be fully powered by renewable energy. Calls for an end to fossil-fuel subsidies were resisted by many nations at Cop27 in November, including Australia. Although he believes “climate change is real”, Simon Hicks, farmer and coalmine worker from Sandy Flat, south of Tenterfield, says he bought an EV because “I was interested in the technology, not because I felt morally obliged to be saving the planet”. He and husband, Greg May, bought a Kia EV6 in Armidale this year. The couple runs Donegal Farmstay, which had a destination charger for guests to recharge in about six hours. “I’ve since upgraded to another charger that talks to my solar system and basically skims off excess solar power rather than feeding it to the grid,” Hicks says. During work trips to the Hunter valley, he relies on fast chargers at Scone, Tamworth, Armidale or Glen Innes to top up, using the waiting time for shopping trips. However, there’s no backup if these single-bay chargers are not working. Apps like Plugshare and A Better Route Planner (ABRP) allow Hicks to stay informed about the recharging network, particularly when drivers report which sites are occupied and functioning. He estimates the Tesla superchargers will be similar to those he uses in Queensland, which take about 20 minutes and cost 60 cents/kWh. “When they put one in Armidale and they make the Tamworth one available for non-Tesla users, I’ll probably be going there so that I can get my top-up a bit quicker.” Hicks likes the idea that whether it’s solar or wind power, “or even coal in the meantime … I’m powering the car from Australian resources”. Tenterfield artist Luanna Legge has concerns about the lack of shade at the supercharger site, considering EV batteries carry an advisory for use in high temperatures, and the loss of parking. “It’s detracting from the amenities we already had,” she says. Despite her concerns about Tesla’s monopoly in the marketplace, Legge says she isn’t against renewables but is watchful of diminishing accessibility in the town’s shopping centre, particularly for those with limited mobility. “[The supercharger] might make Tenterfield more desirable for visitors, but it’s ignoring the needs of people who live here all year round.” Environmental credentials encouraged Tenterfield’s Glenrock Gardens owners Chris and Annie Jones to buy a Tesla Model S for its long-distance reliability. “They’ve continued to grow and support their vehicles,” Chris says, adding that driving an EV in the country means being prepared. “It’s a bit like if you’re heading out west in a vehicle, you’ve got to make sure you’ve got the right bits and pieces to survive with flat tyres and spares and that sort of thing.” He calls an occasional 20-minute recharging stop “a minor inconvenience”. “I just think that having a charging station here is a real plus. “If people were coming this way and thinking, ‘Well, I’ve got to charge up’, they won’t stop in Warwick or Stanthorpe or Glen Innes, they’ll stop in Tenterfield.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter Join the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/30/giving-up-on-15c-climate-target-would-be-gift-to-carbon-boosters-says-iea-head","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-30T06:00:10Z","webTitle":"Giving up on 1.5C climate target would be gift to carbon boosters, says IEA head","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/30/giving-up-on-15c-climate-target-would-be-gift-to-carbon-boosters-says-iea-head","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/30/giving-up-on-15c-climate-target-would-be-gift-to-carbon-boosters-says-iea-head","fields":{"headline":"Giving up on 1.5C climate target would be gift to carbon boosters, says IEA head","bodyText":"The world can still limit global heating to 1.5C, and to claim that the target is now out of reach is to play into the hands of fossil fuel proponents, the world’s leading energy economist has warned. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, the global authority on energy, slammed scientists and activists who have claimed that the recent Cop27 UN climate summit killed off hopes for the crucial 1.5C limit. “It is factually incorrect, and politically it is very wrong,” said Birol. “The fact is that the chances of 1.5C are narrowing, but it is still achievable.” Birol said that the claims that the 1.5C limit was dead were coming from an “unusual coalition” of scientists, activists and fossil fuel industry “incumbents”. “I find the emerging chorus of this unusual coalition of people saying 1.5C is dead factually and politically wrong,” he told the Guardian. “They are jumping to conclusions that are not borne out by the data.” He added that the claims were “unhelpful” to efforts to shift the global economy to a low-carbon footing. “They are making a mistake. Proponents of the existing energy systems will be the beneficiaries if the obituary of 1.5C is written,” he warned. Investors and financial institutions could be put off by a chorus of claims that 1.5C was dead, he added. “They will react with lower ambition,” he warned. Birol pointed to the surge in clean energy investment this year, in the wake of the Ukraine war and soaring fossil fuel prices. He added that countries’ current targets on reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions would result in a temperature rise of 1.7C, if all pledges were fulfilled, which was within striking distance of the 1.5C limit. “It is factually wrong [to say 1.5C is dead] and we are an evidence-based organisation,” said Birol. “What I look at are the numbers. To say that 1.5C is dead and that we will never reach a peak [in emissions] before 2030 is dogmatic and in my view not a data-driven conclusion.” The goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with repeated scientific advice, came under attack from some countries at the two-week Cop27 summit in Sharm el-Sheikh earlier this month. In the final hours, attempts to strengthen the 1.5C limit were denied, owing to opposition from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, along with, at some points, China, Brazil and a few others. A resolution to phase down fossil fuels, proposed by India and backed by at least 80 countries, was also removed from the final text. In the end, participants such as the UK and the EU, which were pushing for a stronger commitment on 1.5C that would require countries to come forward with firmer policies to meet the goal, said they were “disappointed” with the result. Alok Sharma, the UK’s president of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow last year, which focused on the 1.5C limit, expressed his frustration in the closing speeches of the conference. He said: “I said in Glasgow that the pulse of 1.5 degrees was weak. Unfortunately, it remains on life support. And all of us need to look ourselves in the mirror, and consider if we have fully risen to that challenge over the past two weeks.” Birol acknowledged that the outcome of the summit was weak on the 1.5C goal, but said countries must still keep pushing for it. “Looked at from the point of view of energy, it would not be accurate to say that the global energy sector received a strong signal from Cop27,” he conceded. “In the absence of such a clear signal, the message to key actors may seem a bit confused.” But he said the economics of the transition to clean energy were clear, with wind and solar power now cheaper than fossil fuels across much of the world, and that more countries were seeking to expand clean energy sources as a matter of national security and of industrial policy. He pointed to global clean energy investments of $1.3tn, and said that with current policies, clean energy investments would reach $2tn a year by 2030, which would be an increase of about 50% from the beginning of the decade. That amount of investment needs to double again, however, to stay within 1.5C. “That is extremely challenging, but it is not out of reach,” Birol said. Last year, the IEA, regarded as the global gold standard for energy data and policy advice, warned that no new fossil fuel development and exploration should take place if the world was to remain within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The organisation also predicts that global greenhouse gas emissions will peak in 2025. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body of the world’s leading climate scientists, has said emissions must be reduced by 45%, compared with 2010 levels, by 2030 to stay within 1.5C of pre-industrial temperatures. The Cop27 summit also produced agreement on a fund for poor countries afflicted by the worst ravages of extreme weather, known as loss and damage. Birol said this was “a great achievement” and that countries must now concentrate on filling the fund. “I would very much like to see money flowing into this fund as soon as possible, and in as meaningful sums as possible,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2020/aug/23/israel-moots-plan-to-buy-solar-power-from-former-enemy-jordan","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2020-08-23T13:32:00Z","webTitle":"Israel moots plan to buy solar power from former enemy Jordan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/23/israel-moots-plan-to-buy-solar-power-from-former-enemy-jordan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2020/aug/23/israel-moots-plan-to-buy-solar-power-from-former-enemy-jordan","fields":{"headline":"Israel moots plan to buy solar power from former enemy Jordan","bodyText":"Israel is considering buying solar power from its neighbour and former enemy, Jordan, in a potentially historic deal that could help the country meet ambitious new renewable energy targets. In a letter seen by the Guardian, energy minister Yuval Steinitz told environmental activists the ministry supported a pilot initiative in which Jordan would transfer 25 megawatts to Israel’s national grid, enough to power several thousands of households. EcoPeace, an organisation of Israeli, Jordanian, and Palestinian environmentalists, has been pushing for the project, arguing that Jordan’s access to large amounts of land and sunshine means it could sell electricity to Israel cheaper than the country could produce it. “Electricity has never crossed the Israeli border from any neighbouring country,” said Gidon Bromberg, the Israeli director of EcoPeace. “We are calling for a Middle East green deal.” The advocacy group had shared the letter with the Jordanian government in the hopes of an agreement. The kingdom already buys natural gas from Israel despite domestic opposition against deals with a former foe. Jordanian renewable businesses had also expressed interest, EcoPeace said. However, the environmentalists warn that recent Israeli threats of annexing parts of the Palestinian territories have halted progress, and could scupper their plans if they materialise. The Guardian contacted Jordan’s foreign and energy ministries for comment but received no response. In June, Israel’s energy ministry unveiled an 80bn shekel (£18bn) proposal to increase the percentage of its renewable energy to 30% by 2030, a goal seen as demanding considering the country’s lack of available free land. Despite year-round sunshine and a global reputation for hi-tech green innovation, Israel remains sorely behind other developed countries in clean energy use. At the end of last year, the country was producing about 5% of its electricity from solar energy, with the majority derived from coal and cleaner – but still a fossil fuel – natural gas. Portugal, despite its weaker economy, produces around 30% of its power from renewables. Achiam Tigger, the CEO at Negev Energy Operation and Maintenance, who runs an Israeli solar power plant, said reaching the government’s renewable energy targets would not be “a piece of cake”. Outside his office in the Negev desert, a vast sea of concave mirrors concentrate the sun’s energy into pipes of oil leading to a gigantic molten salt battery. The mirrors rotate throughout the day to capture the best sun rays, while the heated salt battery can provide energy at night. Tigger’s plant forms part of the Ashalim megaproject that also includes the world’s tallest solar tower, which at a distance appears just above the horizon like a rising second sun. On closer inspection, the 250-metre concrete pillar resembles a blinding Eye of Sauron. More than 50,000 mirrors, gathered around the base amphitheatre-style, redirect sunlight to a boiler at the top of the tower. The boiler is jet black, but the intensity of the reflected solar energy makes it too dazzling to look at directly. Inside, superheated steam is created to spin turbines at vast speeds and produce electricity. A third plot nearby uses thousands of photovoltaic (PV) panels, the types of which are seen on household roofs, converting sun rays directly to electricity. While an attention-grabbing symbol of the country’s energy ambitions, the three projects that began commercial operations last year provide just about 2% of Israel’s total energy supplies. “It’s a challenge,” said Tigger of government targets but added it would be possible for Israel to boost its solar power with cheap, PV panels that can be rolled out quickly. Recent government tenders for large-scale PV solar farms have given him hope. “We do see a lot of moving projects … but to say that it will not be challenging to meet these dates and percentage, that would not be true.” This is why EcoPeace argues a deal with Jordan could help reach targets. Bromberg, the environmentalist, said current domestic plans were “nowhere near enough to get to the 30% target.” He said businesses interested in building the power plant in Jordan are citing production prices of just three US cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with five in Israel. “That’s the cheapest daytime electricity from any source,” he said. EcoPeace believes that by bringing together Israel and Jordan on renewables, it will serve to boost the peace agreement. The group also envisions Israel selling Jordan water as part of future deals, although it acknowledges that the potential Israeli annexation has deeply soured the relationship. “The tensions and issue of annexation have held up discussions,” said Bromberg. “But we are hopeful.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/oct/03/winter-europe-cost-of-living-crisis-la-nina-eu-meteorological-agency","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-03T16:00:47Z","webTitle":"Colder early winter in Europe could worsen cost of living crisis, say forecasters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/03/winter-europe-cost-of-living-crisis-la-nina-eu-meteorological-agency","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/oct/03/winter-europe-cost-of-living-crisis-la-nina-eu-meteorological-agency","fields":{"headline":"Colder early winter in Europe could worsen cost of living crisis, say forecasters","bodyText":"Europe is likely to experience a colder, drier and less windy early winter, according to meteorologists, as the UK energy regulator warned there is a “significant risk” of gas shortages this winter. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), an independent intergovernmental agency, cautions that predicting winter conditions is “notoriously difficult” in early October. But it says a cold, still and dry snap in November and December, which would worsen the cost of living crisis, is more likely, because of this year’s La Niña – a powerful weather pattern influenced by cooler temperatures in the Pacific. Carlo Buontempo, the director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is run by the ECMWF on behalf of the EU, said: “La Niña tends to cause disruption to westerly winds, creating high pressure over Europe, which is what the models are showing for the beginning of winter. “In these conditions, there is a chance of easterly winds leading to lower than usual temperatures. There is a higher than usual chance of having a cold outbreak at the beginning of winter.” But he cautioned that more reliable data on what would influence winter conditions would only become available in three to four weeks. The forecast comes as Ofgem warned this winter could see of a “significant risk” of gas shortages, which could also hit electricity supplies. In a letter first reported by the Times, the watchdog said that “due to the war in Ukraine and gas shortages in Europe, there is a significant risk that gas shortages could occur during the winter 2022-23 in Great Britain. As a result it is a possibility that GB could enter into a gas supply emergency.” Ofgem’s head of wholesale market management, Grendon Thompson, said a gas supply emergency could force gas-fired power stations to close. Rules governing the energy industry mean that any plants that are cut off would then have to pay large penalties for failing to deliver electricity. In a request to modify existing rules, the energy producer SSE highlighted the large imbalance charges and credit-cover requirements that generators face if they are forced to switch off. Thompson accepted SSE’s request to urgently examine the risks related to rules. Buontempo pointed out that in previous years gas prices had risen or fallen on the basis of midterm forecasts – but only those made in early November when winter predications could be made with greater certainty. “What the models show at this stage is a slightly higher chance than usual of having a cold outbreak in November and December,” he said. “We are using data coming from the UK’s Met Office and also Météo-France, the Deutscher Wetterdienst, the CMCC in Italy and contributions from Japan, Canada, and the US. All these models show a higher than usual pressure at the beginning of winter in Europe. “The fact that all the models shows a disruption in the westerly flows give us some confidence.” Buontempo said if forecasts were correct, the colder temperatures would increase the reliance on gas, while stiller and dryer conditions would reduce the contributions of wind and hydro-electric power. Solar power would also be boosted if the forecast was correct, he said. The only good news was that in a typical La Niña year, weather patterns tended to change in mid-winter to bring warmer westerly winds for the later half of the season, Buontempo said. To underline the uncertainty the University of Reading’s Department of Meteorology is predicting that, taken as a whole, this winter could be milder than average based on predicted temperatures from November to February. Tom Morgan, a forecaster at the Met Office, said there was a “possibility of a La Niña winter unfolding”. But he added: “Whether that actually results in a cold winter for the UK is still very uncertain. Sea temperatures around the UK are well above average at the moment.” Buontempo said higher sea temperatures would not warm Europe if the wind changed and brought colder air from central Asia and Siberia. • This article was amended on 4 October 2022 to remove a suggestion that the ECMWF is a European Union agency.

But experts warn that ransomware attacks – which are part-ransom, part-blackmail, part-invocation of squatters’ rights – are becoming more frequent, while the mostly Russia-based hackers are growing more sophisticated with their methods. They have hit solar power firms, federal and local government agencies, water treatment plants and even police departments across the US. As the nation’s eyes were focused on the pipeline attack this week, another hacker group was busy targeting Washington DC police – striking at law enforcement in the American capital. But it was the pipeline attack that had the most impact, emerging from the dark web and sending tens of thousands of Americans to panic-buy gas for their cars. The 5,500 mile-long pipeline, which carries 45% of the east coast’s fuel supplies, announced on Saturday that it had been forced to shut down after attackers used the internet to seize control of the fuel-pumping operation. On Wednesday, Colonial Pipeline said it had “initiated the restart” of operations, reportedly after paying a $5m ransom fee. But that didn’t stop hours-long lines continuing to form at gas stations in the south-east US, as fuel began to dry up and the price of gas hit its highest point in years. A group of cybercriminals called Darkside has taken responsibility for the ransomware attack, which works by hacking into a company, or government’s, network, and scrambling the data. The hacker then posts a note in the system demanding payment. If the organization pays up, the hacker hands back control. “The analogy would be I break into your house, and once I get access to your house, I change all of the locks, and lock you out of your own house,” said Eric Cole, author of the book Cyber Crisis and founder of the Secure Anchor cybersecurity company. “And then I say: ‘Hey, unless you give me money, I’m not going to give you the keys to your house.’” The Colonial Pipeline debacle is merely the latest in a spate of ransomware attacks, which include the targeting of a water treatment plant in Florida, and the Texas-based SolarWinds IT company. US police forces have also been a focus. The Babuk group, another Russian cyber gang, is currently holding up the Washington DC police department, threatening to release stolen data unless law enforcement cough up an unspecified amount of money. The Presque Isle police department was attacked in April, police in Azusa were hit in March, while the city of Baltimore suffered a costly attack in 2019. As the number of attacks rise, Darkside has become one of the more prominent groups, and Cole said it has managed to “commercialize cybercrime”. “They’ve been in operation for over three years, they started around 2018, and they typically focus on lower end ransoms,” he said. “The average Darkside attack would ask for anywhere from $80,000 to $100,000 ransom, and they would typically do eight to 10 of these attacks a month, so they were bringing in about $12m a year. “But we’ve noticed in the last couple of months they started targeting and going after bigger organizations. Colonial really shows their change in business model – where now instead of going after 12 small entities they go after one big one.” The Washington Post reported that 26 government agencies have been hit by ransomware since the beginning of the year. The number of private companies targeted is difficult to calculate, given no company wants to reveal to the world, and to other would-be attackers, that they will pay up if compromised, but it’s likely the number of reported attacks are just the “tip of the iceberg”, one expert said. In most cases, organizations have little option but to pay the ransom. After the city of Baltimore was attacked in May 2019, it decided not to pay the ransom of 13 bitcoins, which at the time came to roughly $91,000. It was a noble move, but not a financially successful one – Baltimore ended up spending more than $18m on recovery. The FBI and other security experts say Darkside is made up of a group of criminals based in Russia, but little is known beyond that. Joe Biden said there is “no evidence” that the Russian government is behind the attack, despite the ransomware that targeted Colonial Pipeline being based in Russia, and Darkside itself reinforced the idea that they are motivated by profits rather than geopolitics, when the group issued a statement this week, describing itself as “apolitical”, and saying: “Our goal is to make money.” With the Colonial Pipeline attack, Darkside took advantage of the pandemic, Cole said. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the pipeline was managed on a closed system by workers onsite. The need to social distance to prevent the spread of the disease led to Colonial Pipeline staff working remotely, using the internet – which ultimately enabled attackers to gain access to computer systems. Colonial Pipeline did not reply to a request for comment. Mark Stamford, CEO of the OccamSec cybersecurity company, said “the criminal business model around ransomware has changed”, and groups like Darkside are becoming more sophisticated. “The way ransomware used to work, you’d get a message that pops up on screen, saying: ‘All your data has been encrypted, send me, for example, 20 Bitcoins, and I’ll send you the encryption key,’” Stamford said. “Now we’ve gone from ransom attacks to sort of extortion. What happens now is that I will get the ransomware into your environment and encrypt your data, but what I’ll also do is exfiltrate the data out of your network. “So now it’s encrypted in your network, so you have to pay me a ransom, but I’ve also got a copy of your data that I can then use to extort cash out of you.” But groups like Darkside don’t just profit from their attacks. Frequently they will also sell ransomware software to would-be cyber-attackers on the dark web, meaning the number of attacks is likely to increase. “You’ve got this bad guy marketplace,” Stamford said. “Where I can go and buy a piece of ransomware – and what’s even more impressive is there’s tech support around this ransomware, so I can call someone and say: ‘I used your ransomware, it didn’t work, can you give me some tips to make it work?’” As Colonial Pipeline scrambles to regain control of its systems, and as the name Darkside reverberates around the US, Stamford said one theory among cybersecurity watchers is that this could even be a promotional effort by the cybercriminal group. “This is a good bit of marketing for them,” Stamford said. “If you’re in the business of selling ransomware this is a really good way to go to the world and say: ‘Look, our stuff’s cool, and it works.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/sep/07/gas-drive-will-not-solve-energy-crisis-liz-truss-told","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-06T23:01:32Z","webTitle":"Gas drive will not solve energy crisis, climate advisers tell Liz Truss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/sep/07/gas-drive-will-not-solve-energy-crisis-liz-truss-told","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/sep/07/gas-drive-will-not-solve-energy-crisis-liz-truss-told","fields":{"headline":"Gas drive will not solve energy crisis, climate advisers tell Liz Truss","bodyText":"The government’s independent climate and infrastructure advisers have delivered an unprecedented rebuke to Liz Truss for focusing on attempts to increase the UK’s gas production to bring down energy prices instead of policies to reduce demand. From her first hours in the job, the prime minister has prioritised a series of measures on energy policy to head off the cost of living crisis. She will unveil a cap on energy price rises – though without extending the windfall tax on producers – freezing the average household energy bill at £2,500 a year. She has also signalled a push to extract more gas and oil from the North Sea, accelerate the new licensing of North Sea oil and gas fields, and lift the moratorium on fracking, to try to increase gas production. On Wednesday, the former Conservative environment secretary Lord Deben and Sir John Armitt, who chair the Committee on Climate Change and the National Infrastructure Commission respectively, wrote to Truss warning that ramping up gas production would not solve the problem. They wrote: “The UK cannot address this crisis solely by increasing its production of natural gas. Greater domestic production of fossil fuels may improve energy security, particularly this winter. “But our gas reserves – offshore or from shale – are too small to impact meaningfully the prices faced by UK consumers.” The letter marks the first time the chairs of the independent advisory bodies have written jointly to a prime minister. They advised Truss, along with the incoming chancellor and business secretary, to focus instead on bringing down energy demand from consumers and businesses. “Energy security and reducing the UK’s exposure to volatile fossil fuel prices requires strong policies that reduce energy waste across the economy and boost domestic production of cheap and secure low-carbon energy,” they wrote in the letter, seen by the Guardian. This would necessitate policies such as home insulation, requiring public agencies to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings, setting up an energy advice service for consumers, and increasing renewable energy generation, particularly onshore wind and solar power. “Renewables are the cheapest form of electricity generation. Onshore wind and solar have the potential to be deployed fastest and thus reduce our reliance on natural gas sooner,” they wrote. Truss has said little so far on how she would improve home insulation, as the scrapping of the green homes grant last year has left the UK without a nationwide insulation scheme for those on average incomes. She has vowed to remove green levies, potentially including those that pay for insulation for poor and vulnerable households. During her campaign for the Tory leadership, she also firmly rejected lifting the barriers in the planning system to onshore wind and solar farms. At least 15 million homes require energy efficiency improvements, but the most recent year in which a large number of homes were insulated was 2012. Since then, the “stop-start nature of energy-efficiency policy is hampering development of the supply chain,” the letter said. The Committee on Climate Change warned earlier this year that increasing the production of gas from the North Sea was unlikely to bring down gas prices and could endanger the UK’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. Deben and Armitt wrote that up to three-quarters of UK households are threatened by fuel poverty. “The OBR expects natural gas to remain expensive, at three to four times the average pre-invasion [of Ukraine] price, until 2027. Ninety per cent of the recent increase in the energy price cap is driven by changes in the price of gas. Addressing our dependency on fossil energy offers us the best way out of these crises,” they wrote. “The best policies for the consumer are those that support lasting energy security and a low-carbon, low-cost energy system. The independent analysis of our respective organisations is that this will deliver a long-term return on investment and set the UK on a path to prosperity.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/jun/11/lordes-comeback-single-is-a-lesson-in-letting-pop-stars-take-their-time","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-11T14:56:11Z","webTitle":"Lorde’s comeback single is a lesson in letting pop stars take their time","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/11/lordes-comeback-single-is-a-lesson-in-letting-pop-stars-take-their-time","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/jun/11/lordes-comeback-single-is-a-lesson-in-letting-pop-stars-take-their-time","fields":{"headline":"Lorde’s comeback single is a lesson in letting pop stars take their time","bodyText":"Lorde has said she was “waiting for the right moment” to release her comeback single, Solar Power, and opted for 11 June to coincide with the year’s only solar eclipse (although leaks may have forced her hand). Her chosen date resonates beyond the obvious thematic associations of her hazy, sun-worshipping comeback single and its cheeky cover art. Pop stars, especially young women, are expected to be available, relatable, always on. Lorde has defied this with an old-school release rate (just three albums in nine years) and such a low-key public presence that a recent update of her Instagram account on which she reviews onions rings generated headlines. (She benefits, too, from New Zealand’s minimal paparazzi culture.) The rare arrival of new music from the 24-year-old, last heard from in 2017, has come to feel like its own celestial event. With Solar Power, Lorde both welcomes you into her world and revels in that distance. Produced – as was 2017’s Melodrama – by Jack Antonoff, it might be her most universal song, hippy in sound and spirit, and a world away from its nocturnal predecessors. Its loose percussive gait and acoustic simplicity evoke George Michael (both Faith and Freedom 90), Screamadelica-era Primal Scream and the Stones (Sympathy for the Devil), stirring a summer-of-love mood replete with appropriately cultish intimations (“I’m kind of like a prettier Jesus,” she sings, with knowing silliness). She makes no apologies to curmudgeonly heat-haters, luxuriating in those days on the beach – an in-between space, and corresponding state of mind – where bodies soften and time turns to syrup. (English is no match for the French word for basking in the sun, lézarder – to be like a lizard.) Familiar and charmingly dippy, it’s an invitation to the world’s least exclusive party – the joy of feeling the sun on your face and sensing your defences melt (a particularly potent pleasure this year). Yet sung in pop’s most conspiratorial voice – that sweet, scratchy whisper – Lorde conjures its transformational magic anew. It evolves her sensitivity as a songwriter, one obsessed with investigating the transformative forces that accompany each new phase of life: imagination on her debut, 2013’s Pure Heroine, liberating the bored teenager from her suburban, southern-hemisphere existence; drugs and recklessness on Melodrama, to exorcise heartbreak and find revelations in the highs; here simply tripping on nature and expanded horizons, an ease that only comes with age. (Each album era has made a parallel journey from the suburbs to the city to the coast.) Her affinity for giving each album era a chromatic identity leaps out too, in the “acid green, aquamarine” and “cheeks in high colour, overripe peaches”. These are the distinctly satisfying particularities of Lorde’s songwriting that few of her imitators have been able to replicate. It’s impossible to miss how much of pop in 2021 sounds like her earlier work, from the skeletal, percussive production of Royals to the cresting vocal harmonies most conspicuous on the recent debut album by Olivia Rodrigo. There’s a little of the latter on Solar Power, but it’s otherwise a distinct reinvention, one that gleefully puts a gap between Lorde and everyone else in terms of her creativity and as an obsessed-over figure: “I throw my cellular device in the water / Can you reach me? No, you can’t,” she sings with a sly laugh (one that recalls the delicious asides in Melodrama track The Louvre). A newsletter sent to fans announcing Solar Power’s release revelled in the knowledge that most of her fans will hear it as we head into summer, while at home in New Zealand winter is on the way, making the song its own source of apricity. The video is a who’s-who of the Ponsonby scene – imagine Bad Blood with intimidatingly cool Auckland influencers. Lyrics about being photographed by her boyfriend and leading kids to the beach to hear her secrets affirm Lorde’s admirable faith in her own magnetism. (See our 2017 interview: “I want to be Leonard Cohen. I want to be Joni. Fucking. Mitchell.”) She draws a distinct line in the sand around her territory, protecting the freedom, privacy and time that are most likely the true source of her renewable energy – precious commodities in the pop world that the industry could do better to protect."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2022/jun/17/post-your-questions-for-orbital","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-17T12:07:27Z","webTitle":"Post your questions for Orbital","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/17/post-your-questions-for-orbital","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/jun/17/post-your-questions-for-orbital","fields":{"headline":"Post your questions for Orbital","bodyText":"Whenever you ask Glastonbury veterans for some of their favourite memories, one name comes up time and again, particularly among gnarled-looking ravers: Orbital. Their 1994 set is seen by many as the moment when Glastonbury fully grasped dance music. Rave culture was in the bones of the hippies who attended the festival (or snuck in at least), and Underworld’s Experimental Sound Field in 1992 brought repetitive beats into the overall musical mix – but this Orbital set was a mainstream moment, hosted for 40,000 people at the NME Stage. With their bobbing head torches and already sizeable bank of anthems – such as the chunky breakbeats of Are We Here? and the brightly melodic rave of Chime – they converted a small religion’s worth of people to dance music, and the next year Glastonbury had a devoted dance stage. This was just one milestone in one of the most storied careers in British dance music. The Hartnoll brothers started out in the late 80s in their dad’s home office under the stairs of the family home, and quickly notched up chart hits as the acid house scene went overground. They were engaging with the climate crisis earlier than most musicians, recording The Girl With the Sun in Her Head with solar power provided by Greenpeace; scored three back to back Top Five albums in the mid-90s; and took high-profile commissions for movie themes, such as their rework of The Saint and a spin on an Angelo Badalamenti theme for The Beach. They split up in 2004 and reformed in 2008, performing at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Paralympic Games in tandem with Stephen Hawking donning a pair of their trademark head torch-specs. Then, in 2014, they split again in a very final-sounding announcement, having fallen out with one another. “We ended up not speaking to each other for almost five years,” Phil Hartnoll said later.

The hustings event on Thursday in Cheltenham, a key Tory-held marginal seat, also saw the foreign secretary effectively rule out any increased windfall tax on energy firm profits, as she hit out at the “depressing” sight of fields used for solar power. Sunak’s vehement comments came after Truss, in her own Q&amp;A session at the event, reiterated her belief that tax cuts should be the main response to soaring bills. Truss told the audience of Tory members this would always be her “first port of call”, followed by a focus on longer-term energy supply issues such as support for fracking and nuclear power. Also promising she would not call an election before 2024, Truss said she could provide other assistance, but gave no details, saying she “can’t write the chancellor’s budget” before even being elected as prime minister. “If the answer to every question is raising tax, we will choke off economic growth, and we will send ourselves to penury, and I think that’s a massive problem,” she argued. Speaking after her, Sunak castigated Truss for what he said was a lack of action to help people who would not benefit from her planned reduction in national insurance contributions, including pensioners and those not in work. “We are going to, as a Conservative government, leave millions of incredibly vulnerable people at the risk of real destitution,” the former chancellor said. “And I think that’s a real moral failure.” To do this would mean “the country will never, ever forgive us”, he added. Truss also said she would “absolutely” not support a wider windfall tax, saying: “I don’t think profit is a dirty word.” She added: “I think it’s a Labour idea. It’s all about bashing business, and it sends the wrong message to international investors and to the public.” Asked about an early election, she pledged: “I will not have an election before 2024. I think that’s a very important point, because we’ve got to deliver for people.” Quizzed about agricultural land, Truss hit out at its use for solar panels: “I think one of the most depressing sights when you’re driving through England is seeing fields that should be full of crops or livestock, full of solar panels.” She added: “I’m not against solar panels per se. There are plenty of commercial roofs in Britain where we could be putting solar panels. But where they shouldn’t be is on agricultural land that should be used for food production.” Sunak, widely seen as lagging well behind Truss among Tory members, pitched his appeal as a PM who could appeal to floating voters. Cheltenham is currently held by Tory MP Alex Chalk, who introduced Sunak, but with a majority of less than 1,000 over the Liberal Democrats. Asked how he could win over waverers, Sunak explicitly contrasted his style against that of Boris Johnson: “What they want is a government that works competently, seriously, with decency and integrity at the heart of everything it does. “That’s the kind of government I’m going to lead, and that’s how we’re going to win the election.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/oct/10/ministers-hope-to-ban-solar-projects-from-most-english-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-10T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"Ministers hope to ban solar projects from most English farms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/10/ministers-hope-to-ban-solar-projects-from-most-english-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/oct/10/ministers-hope-to-ban-solar-projects-from-most-english-farms","fields":{"headline":"Ministers hope to ban solar projects from most English farms","bodyText":"Ministers are planning to ban solar farms from most of England’s farmland, the Guardian can reveal. The new environment secretary, Ranil Jayawardena, is understood to oppose solar panels being placed on agricultural land, arguing that it impedes his programme of growth and boosting food production. To this end, say government sources, he has asked his officials to redefine “best and most versatile” land (BMV), which is earmarked for farming, to include the middling-to-low category 3b. Land is graded from 1 to 5, and currently BMV includes grades 1 to 3a. Planning guidance says that development on BMV land should be avoided, although planning authorities may take other considerations into account. Currently, most solar farms are built on and planned for 3b land, so this move would scupper most new developments of the renewable energy source. Extending BMV to grade 3b would ban solar from about 41% of the land area of England, or about 58% of agricultural land. Much of grade 4 and 5 land is in upland areas that are unsuitable for solar developments. During her speech at the Conservative party conference last week, the prime minister, Liz Truss, reeled off a list of “enemies”, including green campaigners, who make up what she characterised as the “anti-growth coalition”. However, green campaigners say blocking the building of renewables would make her government part of such a group. Chris Hewett, chief executive of the trade association Solar Energy UK, said: “The UK solar sector is alarmed by attempts to put major planning rules in the way of cheap, homegrown energy. Solar power is the answer to so many needs and policy demands: it will cut energy bills, deliver energy security, boost growth and help rural economies. Ranil Jayawardena’s opposition to solar farms must surely make him part of the anti-growth coalition.” To get this policy over the line, Defra would have to get signoff from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. It is understood that BEIS ministers are against the move, as they are trying to show that they are not only deregulating the oil and gas industry and fracking, but also renewable energy. However, No 10 is understood to be sympathetic to the idea, with Truss having vowed to block solar farms on agricultural land during her election campaign. Dustin Benton, policy director at the thinktank Green Alliance, said: “It would be odd to redefine ‘best and most versatile’ agricultural land to include soils that aren’t of high quality, just to block solar farms. It sounds like a tactic that the ‘anti-growth coalition’ might employ. “The UK desperately needs to expand renewables so we don’t have to pay the extortionate cost of gas. Solar is one of the fastest energy sources to be deployed, so we should move quickly to build more in light of the gas crisis.” Andy Mayer, chief operation officer at the Institute of Economic Affairs thinktank, said: “The government cannot on the one hand declare war on ‘the anti-growth coalition’, while on the other enforcing a right to veto developments, or waste time and money with excessive regulation. “Farmers and green entrepreneurs are itching to provide solutions to the false claim that energy and food security cannot coexist. The City of London is ready to fund them. Long-term solutions to grid congestion and storage are possible. Market reform can provide a level-playing field for competition. Communities can benefit through more personal rewards from permitted development. “That is what a supply-side revolution to encourage growth while supporting a transition to a cleaner greener future looks like. Not rigid rules, plans and targets that confuse, contradict and encourage opposition to change.” Ed Miliband, shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, said: “If the government goes ahead with blocking solar energy, it will be yet more unilateral energy disarmament from a government that has a 12 year record of driving up bills by blocking clean power. The blame for this plan lies squarely with the prime minister who has repeatedly opposed solar energy, the cheapest, cleanest, quickest form of power–and it will be the British people who pay the price in higher bills, higher gas imports and energy insecurity.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs refused to deny this change was on the cards, simply saying the government had been looking at options to support farming and economic growth while protecting nature and delivering on net zero."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T09:31:06Z","webTitle":"Wife of Malaysia’s jailed ex-PM handed 10 years in prison for bribery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","fields":{"headline":"Wife of Malaysia’s jailed ex-PM handed 10 years in prison for bribery","bodyText":"The wife of the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for soliciting and receiving bribes in exchange for government contracts, one week after her husband was sent to prison for corruption linked to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal. Rosmah Mansor, 70, had pleaded not guilty to three charges of soliciting bribes and receiving 6.5m ringgit (£1.3m) in exchange for helping a company secure a contract to provide solar power to schools. The high court judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan said prosecutors proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. The judge added that her defence was “bare denial and unsubstantiated”. Rosmah also faces a fine of 970m ringgit. She can seek bail while she appeals against the judgment. The verdict on Thursday comes just over a week since Najib began a 12-year sentence for breach of trust, abuse of power, and money laundering in a conviction linked to the 1MDB scandal, one of the world’s biggest financial frauds. Najib and Rosmah have faced various charges since he lost an election in 2018 amid public anger over huge corruption during his administration. In the aftermath of their election defeat, the couple sought to leave the country by private jet, according to a flight manifesto leaked at the time. They were banned from travelling by the country’s then leader, Mahathir Mohamad. Police raids on several properties linked to Najib revealed further details of their opulent lifestyles. Police seized hundreds of designer handbags, including 272 Hermès bags estimated to be worth nearly $13m, as well as 1,400 necklaces, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras. Rosmah’s corruption case is not related to the 1MDB scandal. Prosecutors had argued Rosmah exerted influence over government spending, despite having no official position, and helped a company secure a 1.25bn ringgit contract to provide solar energy panels to schools on Borneo. They accused Rosmah of seeking a bribe of 187.5m ringgit and receiving 6.5m ringgit from an official of the company that won the project in 2016 and 2017. Her former aide, who was jointly charged with Rosmah but later testified for the prosecution, portrayed her as an influential figure who was often lobbied by businesspeople seeking government contracts. The aide testified Rosmah was feared by civil servants and requests from her staff were often carried out quickly. Witnesses said a special department, called First Lady of Malaysia, was set up to handle Rosmah’s affairs. The court heard she spent 100,000 ringgit a month to hire online propagandists to deflect criticism of her lavish lifestyle, the Associated Press reported. Rosmah has said she was framed by her former aide as well as government and company officials involved in the project. Najib is being held at the country’s largest prison in Kajang, which holds up to 5,000 prisoners. The prisons department has denied claims that VIP inmates were granted more comfortable living arrangements, such as air conditioning and access to TV and internet. His daughter, Nooryana Najwa, was mocked on social media this week after she reportedly lamented that her father would be missing his usual Starbucks order. She said on Instagram that she could not face ordering from the chain because she knew her father, stuck in prison, would be missing his caramel macchiato. Some responded online by announcing they would make sure to buy the drink the next day. Najib faces four other corruption cases. Rosmah also faces 17 charges of money laundering and tax evasion for illegally receiving 7.1m ringgit between 2013 and 2017 in a separate case linked to 1MDB, though her trial has not yet begun. The 1MDB scandal has led to corruption investigations around the world, including the US, Singapore, and Switzerland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-05T14:34:04Z","webTitle":"Cold snap poses first test of Britain’s efforts to prevent winter power cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/05/cold-snap-poses-first-test-of-britains-efforts-to-prevent-winter-power-cuts","fields":{"headline":"Cold snap poses first test of Britain’s efforts to prevent winter power cuts","bodyText":"As the first big snowfall of winter threatens to drop this week, it’s not only the forecasters and road gritters who will be twitchy: Britain’s energy executives and policymakers are on tenterhooks. Many Britons who have held off putting on the heating, afraid of the bulging bills that could follow, may be forced to nudge the thermostat up, putting a strain on the country’s power supplies. National Grid has warned that a confluence of scenarios including a cold snap and a cut-off of Russian gas to Europe could lead to power cuts. Is this the first piece of that grim jigsaw? An initial assessment appears far more positive than two months ago. Other European countries have filled their gas storage facilities more rapidly than expected, meaning UK competition for supplies has reduced. In fact, Europe’s storage is so full, some tankers carrying liquified natural gas (LNG) have even been idling in European waters, waiting for prices to bounce back. Mother Nature has also played a part: the mild start to winter reduced demand, with some bosses reporting consumption had fallen more than 10% on last year. But while temperatures have been unseasonably warm, wind speeds have been more concerning. Last week dunkelflaute (German for a “dark lull”) conditions – with barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days – left gas as a key power source. National Grid data showed the fossil fuel was responsible for as much as 60% of Great Britain’s electricity generation for much of last week, far higher than its average of about 40% at this time of year, while wind was only 7%. The conditions were concerning enough for National Grid to flirt with using its demand flexibility service, which incentivises businesses and consumers to shift their power usage, although ultimately it stopped short. Freezing conditions predicted in Europe for mid-December are also driving sentiment. Gas accounted for 49% of electricity generation on Monday, while wind was far healthier than last week at 25%, with nuclear and biomass providing a steady 12% and 6% behind that. However, the cold weather was enough to get energy traders moving – the price of gas for delivery on Tuesday rose 6% to 340p, nearing a three-month high set earlier this month. Rising prices also have implications for the government’s energy price guarantee, which covers the cost for suppliers between wholesale prices and a fixed cost. The higher gas prices are, the bigger the eventual bill for the government. Nathan Piper, an oil and gas analyst at Investec, says: “It could have been a false dawn thinking we had sorted out the gas issue earlier in autumn. If we get cold and still winter conditions there could still be issues – that’s why we have seen gas prices go up.” He says market watchers now believe gas prices will peak next winter, because of the uncertainty over how Europe will replace the six months of significant Russian gas supplies that were available this year. One of Britain’s strengths is its diversity of energy supplies: gas from the North Sea and Norway, and LNG from around the globe, notably the US and Qatar. In electricity, there is wind and solar, nuclear, biomass – particularly from the heavily subsidised Drax power station in North Yorkshire – and a small amount of coal. Government efforts to boost supplies this winter have included paying to keep coal units set for retirement on standby. (These have not yet been exercised). The revived gas storage facilities at Centrica’s Rough – shut down after the government refused to support it – have also been called into action, although Britain’s gas storage is far lower than other European countries. A factor to watch will be the role of interconnectors – the vast undersea cables carrying gas and electricity to and from Britain, Belgium and France. Britain has built goodwill over the summer, providing LNG to Europe; however, any suggestion France could be short of energy supplies this winter could test relations already dented by Brexit. Although France was not as reliant as its neighbours on Russian gas, problems getting several nuclear power stations back online after maintenance have reduced its electricity production. If Emmanuel Macron’s government limited supplies to Britain to protect its own citizens, it would risk a valuable long-term relationship (upcoming World Cup quarter-finals notwithstanding). “It may not come down to resource nationalism,” Piper says. “If France doesn’t have the power to export, then the situation could get tight.” Issues with hydroelectric power imports from Norway this year have also caused concern. The prospect of snowy conditions will also train minds on a much-debated £18m government campaign to encourage households to cut their energy usage. The debate over whether to launch a public information campaign has pitched Conservative ideology over “nanny state intervention” against practical calls to save energy and money. It is expected before Christmas, months after similar drives in elsewhere in Europe, which have led to a 15% cut in consumption. Simon Virley, a vice-chair and the head of energy and natural resources at KPMG, says: “As we approach the first significant cold snap of the winter, improving energy efficiency and reducing demand couldn’t be more important – both to get bills down and to ensure people can heat their homes properly. “The government has now signed off an energy efficiency campaign but the overall aim of getting demand down by 15% by 2030 is less ambitious than in many European countries which are already on course to achieve that this winter.” Snowfall this week could prove the energy industry’s first big test of an extraordinary winter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2022/aug/29/artemis-1-nasa-rocket-to-moon-2022-mission-launch-time-what-carry-cargo-into-space","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-29T02:57:41Z","webTitle":"Artemis 1 rocket: what will the Nasa moon mission be carrying into space?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/aug/29/artemis-1-nasa-rocket-to-moon-2022-mission-launch-time-what-carry-cargo-into-space","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2022/aug/29/artemis-1-nasa-rocket-to-moon-2022-mission-launch-time-what-carry-cargo-into-space","fields":{"headline":"Artemis 1 rocket: what will the Nasa moon mission be carrying into space?","bodyText":"At three metres tall, Nasa’s Orion capsule is roomier than Apollo’s capsule and seats four astronauts instead of three, but for Monday’s test flight it will have a payload ranging from a mannequin named Helga to bits of Apollo 11’s engine and the odd stuffed toy. For the flight, a full-sized dummy in an orange flight suit will occupy the commander’s seat, rigged with vibration and acceleration sensors. The “commander” was named Moonikin Campos in a public contest, in honour of Arturo Campos, a Nasa engineer who helped save Apollo 13 from disaster by working out how to jury-rig its partly crippled electrical system to bring the astronauts home. Two other mannequins made of material simulating human tissue – heads and female torsos but no limbs – will measure cosmic radiation, one of the biggest risks of spaceflight. They are named Helga and Zohar. One torso is testing a protective vest from Israel. Unlike the SLS rocket underneath it, Orion has launched before, making two laps around Earth in 2014. This time, the European Space Agency’s service module will be attached for propulsion and solar power via four wings. Besides three test dummies, the flight carries a slew of deep-space research projects. Ten shoebox-size satellites will pop off once Orion is hurtling towards the moon. These “cubesates” were installed in the rocket a year ago, and the batteries for half of them couldn’t be recharged as the launch kept getting delayed. Nasa expects some to fail, given their low-cost, high-risk nature. The radiation-measuring cubesats should be OK, along with a solar sail demonstration targeting an asteroid. Orion will carry a few slivers of moon rocks collected by Apollo 11’s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin in 1969, and a bolt from one of their rocket engines, salvaged from the sea a decade ago. Aldrin isn’t attending the launch, according to Nasa, but three of his former colleagues will be there: Apollo 7’s Walter Cunningham, Apollo 10’s Tom Stafford and Apollo 17’s Harrison Schmitt, the next-to-last man to walk on the moon. Snoopy plush toys are a Nasa institution, stemming from the name of the Apollo 10 lunar module that flew to the moon to test descent and landing procedures but never got to land itself. A Snoopy toy went on the Columbia space shuttle, and this time the cartoon character will be accompanied by Shaun the Sheep, to recognise the involvement of the European Space Agency. Their official purpose is to demonstrate zero gravity, by floating around. Orion will carry Biological Experiment-01 containing experiments on seeds, fungi, yeast and algae. Also on board is a voice recognition demonstration called Callisto, developed jointly by Amazon, Cisco Systems and Lockheed, that will test how Amazon’s Alexa works in a space capsule and how such a system might be used by future astronauts. The dummy astronauts’ official “flight kit” includes thousands of other items, many of which will become “flown in space” mementos back on Earth. They include seeds that will be planted to become “moon trees”, a Dead Sea pebble, mission patches, stickers, USB drives and national flags. Some Lego has even made it onboard.

Germany’s economic minister warned of “catastrophic” industrial shutdowns, fraying supply chains and mass unemployment. France’s president urged citizens to turn down the heating. Spain asked why countries that hadn’t got hooked on Russian gas should bail out neighbours who had lectured them about fiscal discipline in the past. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, meanwhile, gleefully predicted that Europeans would be “freezing in their homes” because they hadn’t thought through the consequences of throwing their support behind Ukraine. “The cold is coming soon,” he said, menacingly, in June last year. But as the European Union enters the last month of the meteorological winter in 2023, signs are becoming clearer that its members have weathered an historic crisis – and not just because “General Frost” has proved a milder adversary than Medvedev predicted. Within eight months of Russian troops setting foot on Ukrainian soil, the bloc of 27 European states replaced about 80% of the natural gas it used to draw through pipelines with Russia, by rapidly building up new infrastructure for liquid natural gas, finding creative ways to help each other out amid shortages, and successfully pursuing energy-saving policies. The Netherlands, for example, the EU’s largest natural gas producer, had relied on Russian gas for 15-20% of its supplies as it wound down its huge Groningen field, but doubled its LNG import capacity with storage and regasification units in Rotterdam and Eemshaven. It used the extra capacity to meet domestic demand – which it managed to reduce by 22% compared with previous years’ averages – and supply surplus gas to the Czech Republic, Germany and France. As elsewhere, consumer energy prices soared, but were subsidised and capped. “There was a point last autumn when I worried that some European governments would respond to the crisis by prioritising their own energy supplies and stop sharing with their neighbours, which would have been economically and politically devastating,” said Simone Tagliapietra, an energy expert at the Brussels-based thinktank Bruegel. “But Europe managed to avoid the temptation of protectionism and managed to keep its internal market intact.” Gas spot prices dropped to about €55 a megawatt hour (MWh) on Monday, a level last seen before the start of the war in September 2021, down from €330/MWh at the end of last August. Over the course of the whole of last year, gas demand in the European Union was 12% lower than the average from the period 2019 to 2021, Bruegel estimates. Germany, always destined to bear the brunt of Putin’s gas blackmail effort due to its high reliance on energy exports from Russia, managed to use 14% less gas in 2022 than it had done on average in the years from 2018 to 2021. It enters February with its gas storage tanks 80% full, compared with 36% at this point last year. Even though high gas prices have taken their toll on German industry, the damage has so far not been catastrophic. While GDP in Europe’s largest economy fell by 0.2% from October to December, the government last week improved its forecast for the coming year, predicting the recession to be “shorter and milder” than expected. The Nordic countries were even more successful at reducing gas consumption, with Denmark cutting total demand – for power generation, industry and domestic heating – by 24%, Sweden by 36% and Finland by a mighty 47% (although natural gas accounted for only 5% of its overall energy needs). Last summer, some southern European states had initially signalled reluctance to equally share the burden of energy saving. Spain agreed to a 7-8% reduction in gas use after arguing that the uniform 15% target was simply not fair on countries which, like itself, were not heavily dependent on Russian gas and that had “done our homework” when it came to diversifying energy supplies. Yet it didn’t shy from the task. In July, the socialist-led coalition government announced a series of measures intended to help reduce the country’s energy consumption and its use of Russian oil and gas. Many of the initiatives were based on thrift and common sense. The measures, which will remain in place until this November, set strict limits on air conditioning and heating temperatures in public and large commercial buildings. Under the decree, heating in shopping centres, cinemas, theatres, rail stations and airports should not be set above 19C in winter and air conditioning should not be set below 27C in summer. As a result, Spain ended up meeting the very target to which it had been reluctant to commit: between August and November, the country reduced its demand for natural gas by 15% compared with the level of consumption for the same period in the last five years. In France, the energy-saving effort became an uphill struggle because several key French nuclear reactors were undergoing maintenance or safety work just as they were needed more than ever. From the start of May to the end of October, about half of France’s 56 reactors sat idle due to repair works, turning the country from Europe’s biggest electricity exporter into a net importer. One of the countries upping its electricity exports to France in that period was Germany, which in turn imported more gas from its western neighbour. After French local officials had prepared contingency plans for the worst-case scenario of power cuts in December, the situation has stabilised. By mid-January, 73% of France’s nuclear fleet was back in operation, helping it to regain its spot as the EU’s top exporter of electricity. When nuclear plants struggled, renewables came to the rescue. According to an analysis by thinktank Ember Climate, the European Union in 2022 drew 22% of its electricity from solar and wind power, with renewables surpassing gas for the first time. Remarkably, Sweden, with an energy mix long-dominated by nuclear and hydropower, became Europe’s largest power exporter in 2022, selling 20% of its output abroad – in part thanks to the rapid growth of onshore wind. Wind is now Sweden’s third-largest source of electricity and scheduled to expand further. Finland’s wind power capacity increased by 75% last year alone, allowing the country to increase energy self-sufficiency “at a really good pace”, officials said. Plans to expand renewable energy production have, in fact, been radically accelerated by the energy crisis in all three Nordic countries, with onshore wind and solar power now forecast to more than double by 2030 and wind the dominant energy source. Ultimately, Vladimir Putin’s energy war decision will have helped put Sweden on track to produce 65% of its energy from renewables by the end of the decade, Finland 51%, and Denmark 55%. A year of rethinking energy supplies has not made Europe cleaner across the bloc. In Poland, which still relies on coal for much of its heating needs, the government has introduced a coal allowance and frozen electricity prices for individual households. After small and medium-sized businesses were struggling with energy bills multiple times the size of those in previous years, the government introduced a freeze for them. The crisis has meant a slowdown in plans in numerous countries to phase out coal, with the issue slipping further down the agenda in Poland, while in Bulgaria MPs voted recently to postpone plans to phase out coal-powered plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2022/may/27/lorde-live-review-edinburgh-usher-hall","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-27T11:13:38Z","webTitle":"Lorde review – introspection and euphoria in strikingly theatrical show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/27/lorde-live-review-edinburgh-usher-hall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2022/may/27/lorde-live-review-edinburgh-usher-hall","fields":{"headline":"Lorde review – introspection and euphoria in strikingly theatrical show","bodyText":"“If you’re looking for a saviour, that’s not me,” Lorde sings, wide-eyed and solemn.

Ella Yelich-O’Connor’s fans have been fervent since her pithy, precocious debut, 2013’s Pure Heroine; 2017’s bruising, vivid Melodrama only deepened that devotion. Last year’s Solar Power felt like a rebirth, exchanging shattering synths and late-night hedonism for sun salutations and softly strummed guitars. Radiant Laurel Canyon harmonies foreground lyrics concerning climate change and wellness practices instead of dancefloor dramas, but on stage these disparate albums find common ground in themes of escapism and utopia. Mood Ring, a beatific, sinister song about “trying to get well from the inside” brings new colour to 2017’s Sober, a dizzying, self-aware party track that seeks relief in “liquor-wet lime”. Still, Lorde concedes that her diaristic songwriting feels like time-travel – “it can give you whiplash” – and sometimes the contrast is just too sharp. The elegant meander of closer Oceanic Feeling lacks direction when it follows the gut-punch euphoria of earlier single Green Light. A stunning, sundial-shaped stage, with an outstretched ladder balanced between glowing orbs, works hard to restore balance. Lorde climbs out on a limb for Fallen Fruit, a gauzy eulogy that imagines humans departing the Earth with just a “pocketful of seed”, but sits in the crawlspace below for the crushing intimacy of Stoned at the Nail Salon, a first-person ballad about ageing and fame. Solar Power’s eponymous, tongue-in-cheek lead single, in which Lorde dubs herself a “prettier Jesus”, was considered smugly unrelatable by some. But to see her convince a Scottish crowd of the universality of a long, hot summer spent in a “damp bikini” confirms that where Lorde leads, her flock will follow. With the room bathed in warm, healing light, she coos in delight: “What did I do to deserve you?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2022/aug/02/oil-firms-seem-more-interested-in-shareholders-than-net-zero","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-02T14:55:27Z","webTitle":"Oil firms seem more interested in shareholders than net zero","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/02/oil-firms-seem-more-interested-in-shareholders-than-net-zero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/aug/02/oil-firms-seem-more-interested-in-shareholders-than-net-zero","fields":{"headline":"Oil firms seem more interested in shareholders than net zero","bodyText":"Oil companies are partying like it’s 2008. As during the global financial crisis that took hold that year, economies face the prospect of deep recessions but oil companies are reaping record profits. BP on Tuesday became the latest in the procession to post bumper results, with its best quarter since record earnings in 2008, just as the financial system collapsed. This time around, the finances of the oil and gas giants have benefited from the higher prices resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, just as consumers in the UK and elsewhere face sky high energy bills and a broader cost of living crisis. There were calls for windfall taxes back in 2008, as now, but some things have changed. The climate emergency has risen up the agenda, and been signed into law. That has forced oil companies into investments in renewable energy and other net zero-compatible projects that would have been laughed out of a supermajor’s boardroom in previous decades. Even the US giants ExxonMobil and Chevron – laggards in an industry of laggards – have been forced to admit begrudgingly that some form low-carbon technologies are going to be necessary. BP chief executive Bernard Looney knows how to talk the talk. Speaking to analysts on Tuesday he repeatedly highlighted BP’s lower-carbon investments. On their own they can make for impressive reading – BP is a leader in UK electric car charging, for instance – but a quick look at oil company investments makes for less flattering reading. Alok Sharma, a member of the UK cabinet (albeit a lame-duck one), on Tuesday highlighted a comparison between BP’s share buybacks, worth $3.5bn (£2.9bn) this quarter alone, and its planned spending on low-carbon energy for the whole year of $2.5bn. We should be able to “see if their actions match their rhetoric”, he wrote. BP, its FTSE 100 rival Shell, the US companies ExxonMobil and Chevron, and France’s Total between them made underlying profits of nearly $100bn in the first half of 2022 – triple their earnings in the same period in 2021. The same companies have so far announced shareholder returns (via dividends and share buybacks) for this year worth $52bn – more than half their profits for the first half. Returning money to shareholders can have upsides for the broader population, as savers and pension funds will be large beneficiaries. But share ownership is dominated by the wealthiest, and a stream of dividends will do very little indeed to help poorer households in the UK or elsewhere cope with soaring energy prices. Energy prices will remain high up the political agenda around the world. The issue is likely to be at the top of the in-tray for the UK’s new prime minister once the Conservative party chooses between Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak. The average energy bill in Great Britain could reach more than £3,600 a year this winter, according to the latest estimates. Shell’s boss, Ben van Beurden, last week said he “cannot perform miracles” to bring on new energy supply and lower bills for households. But the history of renewable energy technology – such as the astonishing increase in wind and solar power as costs fell – suggests that miracles are not necessary: what is required is the will to invest in a speedier transition. Finance bosses are taught that they should return cash to shareholders when they are unable to make more money themselves with new investments. The pace of buybacks and dividends during 2022 suggests that oil companies are content to hand more cash to investors rather than invest more to speed up the net zero transition."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-31T16:00:22Z","webTitle":"Hopes for power and purpose from an energy industry in flux","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/31/hopes-for-power-and-purpose-from-an-energy-industry-in-flux","fields":{"headline":"Hopes for power and purpose from an energy industry in flux","bodyText":"A tall white rig punctures the Cornish skyline, offering a hint of a new industrial era at a site near Redruth, once a copper mining capital. This year, the first power produced by a geothermal plant in the UK is expected from a project three decades in the making. The United Downs project aims to produce constant low-carbon electricity for the grid, and heat for homes, from hot rocks. Geothermal energy is an established power source in volcanically active areas of the globe, often near tectonic plate boundaries. However, it can also be used in other areas if the rock temperature is high enough, and the rocks are permeable enough for water to circulate. The project is developed by Geothermal Engineering and has received funding from the EU and Cornwall county council. Its introduction to the electricity generation mix will come in a year which could prove defining for a British energy industry that has spent the past 12 months in crisis mode. Here’s what other changes and challenges the sector can expect in 2023: Renewed impetus for renewables The importance of renewable power sources was underlined in 2022. The invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices soaring and left countries paying through the nose for gas to replace Russian supplies, and hit household and public finances. Expect a fresh focus on new renewable projects this year, in part as a result of the lifting of the ban on onshore wind in England. Meanwhile, Scotland’s largest offshore windfarm – the £3bn Seagreen project, a joint venture between SSE Renewables and France’s TotalEnergies – is expected to be fully operational by the summer. An even bigger windfarm, at Dogger Bank 80 miles off the north-east coast of England, should also deliver its first power by the summer. And another SSE project, Coire Glas, is taking shape: it will be the first large-scale pumped hydroelectric storage scheme for more than 30 years and should provide a significant backup when wind and solar power are not available. It could also prove a crucial year for executives behind the £18bn project to connect Britain with a huge wind and solar farm in the Sahara through an undersea cable. They hope to secure a “contract for difference” with government – meaning they would receive public subsidies to give them a fixed price for power – as the clock ticks on the project. Nuclear vision The £30bn Sizewell C nuclear power station development in Suffolk became emblematic of the political tumult of 2021 – as the planning decision on its future was repeatedly delayed, before eventually being given the green light by Boris Johnson. It then looked in doubt amid Liz Truss’s mini-budget chaos before the government announced a £700m cash injection which also eased out China General Nuclear. This year, bankers will hope to finally land other backers to complement developer EDF and the government in the project. Could British Gas owner Centrica commit to investment? Rolls-Royce will hope to gain some momentum behind its long-awaited small modular reactor programme. Fossil fuels hang on The role of polluting fuels in Britain’s energy mix was high on the agenda in 2022, as fossil fuel firms faced a windfall tax on their Ukraine-inflated profits but were asked to step in to ensure security of supplies this winter. The government is set to award 130 new licences for North Sea oil and gas exploration by the summer, although the move faces a legal challenge. The futures of the huge Cambo and Rosebank fields remain uncertain but could get the green light this year. Green campaigners will also hope to see more progress in the transition away from coal after the approval of the first new coalmine for three decades, in Cumbria, and deals to keep coal plants running this winter. Britain has committed to end the use of coal power by October 2024. Regulations revamp The biggest redesign of the electricity market in a generation began this year in the form of the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema). A key part of the work will be de-linking gas and electricity prices as Britain shifts towards renewable power. Green energy suppliers have bemoaned the link between the surging cost of natural gas, after the invasion of Ukraine, and high power prices. Policymakers are attempting to create a market better suited to a greater proportion of renewables, by improving grid connections for windfarms and battery storage sites. Significant proposals for reform are expected in 2023. Heavy industrial companies are hoping new regulations, designed to encourage investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, are completed to ease the path to decarbonisation. Generation flex Industry watchers have long predicted that consumers could take a more active role in Britain’s energy network. This year saw the introduction of a National Grid scheme, first trialled by Octopus, which saw households paid to turn limit energy usage at peak times. And with electric vehicle ownership increasing, the potential is growing for drivers to play a part in storing and pushing power back to the grid with car batteries. Octopus’s bosses will hope it can keep pushing innovation in these areas while integrating Bulb, the bust energy supplier which it has acquired in the face of a legal challenge from rivals. Counting the cost The biggest unknown for the energy industry this year is how gas prices will fare. While prices have begun easing in recent weeks thanks to warmer than average weather, wholesale natural gas costs are forecast to remain high across Europe in 2023, with few cheap options to replace the huge volume of Russian fuel lost to the market. Those prices will affect the cost of the energy price guarantee, the government’s measure to protect households from huge bills, which becomes less generous from April. However, signs of a global recession could further pull down the price of oil and fuel. Ministers may feel the energy crisis is under control, but it looks far from over. • This article was amended on 4 January 2023. An earlier version referred to volcanic activity “near to tectonic plates”. However, plates cover the surface of the earth, so volcanic areas are on, rather than near, plates.

The group of energy companies announced the proposal over a 15,000 sq km area that could have a 50 gigawatt capacity and cost $100bn. An area bigger than the size of greater Sydney has been identified in the south-east of Western Australia with “consistently high levels of wind and solar energy”. Guardian Australia understands the Western Green Energy Hub (WGEH) could cost about $100bn. The project’s 50GW capacity compares to the 54GW of generation capacity of all the coal, gas and renewables plants currently in the national energy market, which includes all states except WA and the Northern Territory. Australia’s biggest coal plant is just 2.9GW. InterContinental Energy, CWP Global and Mirning Green Energy Limited announced plans for the mega project on Tuesday, saying it wants to build the scheme in three phases to produce up to 3.5m tonnes of green hydrogen or 20m tonnes of green ammonia each year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Australia understands the consortium is looking to produce the first fuels from the project by 2030, and will look to construct an offshore facility to transfer fuels onto ships. The consortium – which includes an Indigenous-owned energy company – said it wanted to tap into a global market for green hydrogen it expects will be worth US$50tn by 2050. About 30GW of the hub would focus on wind, with the rest coming from solar power. Hydrogen and ammonia produced at the hub would be destined for use in power stations, shipping, heavy industry and aviation. The hub would be larger than a 45GW renewables project announced by German company Svevind Energy and planned for Kazakhstan, reported to be the world’s biggest renewables project proposed so far. Last month, Australia’s environment minister Sussan Ley rejected a plan for a 26GW hub in the north of WA for “clearly unacceptable” impacts on threatened migratory species and internationally recognised wetlands. In a statement, Trevor Naley, chairman of the Mirning Traditional Lands Aboriginal Corporation and a board member on the consortium, said: “As First Nations land owners, the Mirning people are excited to hold such an integral and defining stake in this historical partnership with WGEH. This partnership, through robust governance and a seat at the table for Mirning people, will provide opportunities never before available to Indigenous corporations.” Brendan Hammond, chairman of WGEH said the proposal was “historic on two fronts” for its scale and its partnership with traditional owners. “It is an honour and a privilege to be involved in this groundbreaking project,” he said. WA’s hydrogen minister Alannah MacTiernan told the West Australian the proposal was “truly massive” and said the state was positioned to be a major contributor to global decarbonisation. The newspaper said the consortium had secured a licence from WA’s McGowan government to complete site surveys and research to pursue a business case for the project."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2023/jan/28/no-sunlight-soil-vertical-farming-stacked-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2023-01-28T19:00:28Z","webTitle":"No sunlight, no soil – no worries as vertical farming looks stacked with promise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/28/no-sunlight-soil-vertical-farming-stacked-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2023/jan/28/no-sunlight-soil-vertical-farming-stacked-farms","fields":{"headline":"No sunlight, no soil – no worries as vertical farming looks stacked with promise","bodyText":"Not far from the fertile farmlands known as Australia’s salad bowl, rows of fruit and vegetables are being cultivated without sunlight or soil. Perfect-looking strawberries, tomatoes, baby cos lettuces and coriander grow under moody purple fluorescent lighting. Here in the research wing of a 4000 sq metre facility at Arundel on the Gold Coast, the intensity and timing of light, the humidity of the air, and the nutrients in the water supply are all intricately controlled. Founded in 2017, indoor vertical farming company Stacked Farm bills itself as being able to produce fresh fruit and vegetables year-round, using less water than traditional farming and without the need for pesticides. In months, its leafy vegetables will hit the shelves of major supermarkets around the country. Stacked Farm, the biggest player in Australia’s vertical farming industry, says the technique can produce more crops more quickly and in less space than traditional agriculture requires. Vertical farming refers to indoor farming in controlled environments, usually in the absence of soil and natural light, and involves well-established horticultural techniques. Stacked Farm, for instance, uses a form of hydroponics, growing its plants in rockwool, a material similar to an insulation batt, while a channel of water flows underneath. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup As weather events around Australia become more extreme and threaten food supply chains, the reliability of indoor farming may become an increasingly alluring choice. But the approach has been criticised for the high energy inputs it requires, with industry players even saying they are not trying to do away with outdoor farming altogether. Vertical farming: towers of produce American academic Dickson Despommier first floated the idea of vertical farming more than two decades ago, envisaging city skyscrapers filled with produce to feed tens of thousands of urbanites. Efforts to put vertical farming into practice began around 2010 in the US where there have been major produce supply challenges, says Paul Gauthier, a professor of protected cropping at the University of Queensland (UQ). A decade on, commercial vertical farming is now booming in the US and Europe, but locally the industry is lagging behind, in part because Australia has historically been food secure. “Australia has plenty of space, a low population density, a fairly stable climate and significant expanses of agricultural land. It simply does not have the same pressures on agriculture as do other countries,” says Floris Van Ogtrop, an associate professor at the University of Sydney. “This has meant that investment in vertical farming … in Australia is not comparable to other countries.” Paul Millett, co-founder of InvertiGro, an Australian firm that specialises in stackable vertical farming modules, agrees. “We’re kind of hamstrung in a way because we’ve been blessed with our abundance of fresh produce,” he says. “However, particularly in the last couple of years with Covid and floods and fires, we’ve had lots of supply chain challenges, and people have seen shelves empty of lettuces.” With the extreme weather set to continue, Australian firms are starting to go commercial. From July, Stacked Farm will begin commercial-scale farming using a fully automated process from seeding to bagging, says Michael Spencer, the firm’s chief commercial officer. Half of the floor space at Arundel will soon be filled with 10-metre high growing modules, each housing 15 levels of produce. Spencer estimates the facility will be able to produce between 400 and 440 tonnes of produce a year, depending on the crop. Two larger farms, in Melbourne and Sydney, are planned for in the coming years. Stacked Farm has already signed supply deals with wholesalers such as MorCoFresh, which supplies chains such as Grill’d and Guzman y Gomez, and PMFresh, whose salad bags can be found on the shelves in major supermarkets. InvertiGro – which produces stackable vertical farming modules “almost like Lego” – has also established contracts with food distributors and retailers such as Woolworths, Millett says. It has grown more than 200 crops to date, including leafy greens, berries, soft fruits and vegetables, and the firm is also experimenting with growing medicinal cannabis, flowering crops and fodder for livestock feed. One advantage of indoor farming is that the conditions can be optimised to shorten the time to harvest. “For leafy greens, we’re getting a crop … at least every four weeks or thereabouts,” Millett says. Spencer cites a similar length at Stacked Farm, with a growth cycle taking between 14 and 30 days for leafy greens. “For traditional farming, depending on the region and if the climate is [good], you get anywhere from five to six harvests a year,” he says. “In indoor farming, we’re now getting roughly 17 harvests … out of that same period.” There is also the benefit of a reduced need for water, which is traditionally lost to evaporation or runoff. Spencer says Stacked Farm uses 95% less water than farming in a field. “Every time water moves through the system, it’s captured and re-used. The only water that leaves the facility is in the plant itself.” UQ’s Gauthier is researching vertical farming for crops that may become more difficult to grow outdoors in future. “The areas of land on Earth where we can grow coffee and cacao are shrinking because of climate change,” he says. Currently in a field, the time from seed to harvest for cacao is about three years, whereas, “In vertical farming, it will take 12 months”. The energy issue But vertical farming has an achilles heel: energy consumption. “Depending on which study you read, if a mix of energy from the grid would be used, the CO2 equivalents and nitrogen equivalents of producing lettuce in a vertical farm can be up to double that of conventional agriculture,” Van Ogtrop says. However, he adds, the figures can sway in favour of vertical farms if they are run on renewable energy. Solar power could help bring down energy costs, Spencer, says, but is not a panacea. “Large scale farms will have solar on each roof. To give you an idea, it might support 10 to 15% of our needs.” Millett concedes that energy cost is a key consideration. “It’s about minimising the amount of energy that goes into a lettuce or bunch of basil. It’s optimising the lights … only with the intensity and colour spectrum that they need.” Other drawbacks of vertical farming include the use of synthetic fertilisers, which either come from energy intensive processes or are mined, Van Ogtrop says. Though there is interest in recycling nutrients from sources like food waste, such processes are still in their early days. Van Ogtrop adds that the growth materials used, such as coconut coir, rockwool, peat moss and perlite, “are often not sourced sustainably or ethically and may have downstream environmental or health impacts”. And there is also the risk of pests ruining a crop, Millett says, adding that one benefit of the InvertiCube’s modular set-up – each has walls and glass doors – means it has greater resistance to pests than other forms of vertical farming. Ultimately, Stacked Farm wants to fill supply chain shortages rather than do away with outdoor fields. “We’re not here to displace traditional farming,” Spencer says. Van Ogtrop agrees with Spencer, believing that, “Vertical farming is not going to replace broad-acre farming for growing our grains and legumes.” “Much of our fruit and veg will still be grown under the sun and in soil, which is why it is super important that we invest in sustainable agriculture and do all we can to mitigate climate change.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-03-29T16:25:38Z","webTitle":"UK rules out windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to help fund energy bills","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/mar/29/uk-offshore-wind-power-renewable-energy-kwasi-kwarteng","fields":{"headline":"UK rules out windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to help fund energy bills","bodyText":"The business secretary has effectively ruled out a windfall tax on North Sea oil firms to fund discounted energy bills but promised much greater investment in solar panels, wind and nuclear to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas. Speaking amid reports of a cabinet split over landmark energy security plans due to be published within days, Kwasi Kwarteng offered up a tax on oil companies, backed by Labour, as the one policy that definitely will not find favour with ministers. “We believe a windfall tax would be a tax on jobs, would destroy investment and would add to the uncertainty in oil markets,” he said. “It would be completely the wrong message to send investors.” Labour has said the pain inflicted on households by the soaring price of oil and gas could be eased by a tax on the companies that sell it. But Kwarteng has said such a move would penalise anyone with a pension invested in those companies. “It’s a retro measure which completely doesn’t understand what business is all about,” he said. Kwarteng, who was answering questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday, was repeatedly asked if the government had further plans to help households struggling to pay their energy bills. A cap on bills is due to rise by £693 to an average of £1,971 on 1 April, with prices predicted to soar as high as £3,000 at the next price cap increase in October. Kwarteng said “nobody knows” how high prices will go and pointed only to measures announced in chancellor Rishi Sunak’s spring statement, which has been derided for the limitations of its plan to help people cope with the cost-of-living crisis. While the business minister said oil firms would not be hit with a windfall tax, he did unveil a pledge to boost renewable energy sources. The government is aiming to triple the number of solar panels, more than quadruple offshore wind power and double onshore wind and nuclear energy by 2030, in a move that could lower bills for consumers and reduce the UK’s reliance on foreign energy suppliers such as Russia. Kwarteng put forward the targets as part of Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) plans for inclusion in the upcoming energy white paper. The paper has faced delays because the cost of approving at least six nuclear power stations as part of an expansion of the UK’s renewable energy strategy has been debated at the Treasury. Ministers are also divided over plans to back onshore wind. BEIS’s targets include increasing solar power from its current capacity of 14GW to 50GW, offshore wind from 11GW to 50GW, onshore wind from 15GW to 30GW, and nuclear power from 7GW to 16GW, according to the Financial Times. Solar power and onshore wind generation have, to date, not had official government growth targets. Earlier this month, Kwarteng said developing the UK’s energy independence was a matter of national security. Boris Johnson has set out a 10-point plan that includes a target for the UK to get all of its electricity from low-carbon sources by 2035. The expansion of wind and solar farms is likely to be opposed by some residents and campaign groups. Johnson, who has said his personal preference is to expand offshore wind power generation, is considering plans to offer residents affected by the construction of energy farms or nuclear power plants financial incentives to win them over. On Tuesday, SSE, the electricity generator and network company, upgraded its profit forecasts after changes to weather conditions improved output from its renewable energy generation sources. The company – which raised adjusted earnings a share from guidance to between 92p and 97p, up from 90p – also said its thermal and hydro plant benefited from the disruption to oil and gas markets as a result of the war in Ukraine. “SSE’s integrated and balanced business model has performed well in turbulent market conditions,” said the SSE finance director, Gregor Alexander, who added that capital expenditure for the year to the end of March would exceed £2bn. “Our significant investment programme will make a huge contribution towards both net zero and energy security.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2020/may/18/weatherwatch-covid-19-lockdown-boosts-uk-solar-power","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2020-05-18T20:30:38Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: Covid-19 lockdown boosts UK solar power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/18/weatherwatch-covid-19-lockdown-boosts-uk-solar-power","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2020/may/18/weatherwatch-covid-19-lockdown-boosts-uk-solar-power","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: Covid-19 lockdown boosts UK solar power","bodyText":"The disappearance of aeroplane contrails and a reduction in air pollution has allowed much stronger sunlight to reach the ground and resulted in bumper production of solar power.

With solar panels at ever lower prices and large-scale battery storage now a viable option, there are record numbers of subsidy-free, commercial-scale solar farms in the planning pipeline.

The prime minister – who had been criticised for saying he was too busy with domestic commitments to attend – also adopted precisely the same language on renewable energy that Labour leader Keir Starmer has been using for months, declaring that he now wanted to turn the UK into a “clean energy superpower”. Sunak’s efforts to present himself as a world leader on the environment and a champion of clean energy brought deep scepticism as political leaders, diplomats and NGOs gathered in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for the latest UN-led attempt to tackle global heating. Writing in today’s Observer, Starmer ridicules Sunak, branding him “a fossil fuel prime minister in a renewable age”, who still wants to ban more onshore windfarms and who has opposed solar projects. Prof Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, who is at the summit, said: “He has already exhibited his disinclination to make the UK a leader in the global fight against human-induced climate change by initially refusing to come to Cop27 and hand over the presidency from Cop26 to Egypt at Cop27. His actions to allow drilling for more fossil fuels in the North Sea are exactly the opposite of leadership.” During his leadership campaign against Liz Truss, Sunak vowed to maintain planning rules that effectively prevent any more onshore wind farms and also criticised solar power. But in a speech at the summit on Monday, Sunak will say: “Fighting climate change is not just a moral good – it is fundamental to our future prosperity and security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and contemptible manipulation of energy prices has only reinforced the importance of ending our dependence on fossil fuels. “We need to move further and faster to transition to renewable energy, and I will ensure the UK is at the forefront of this global movement as a clean energy superpower.” With most experts believing that the UK cannot become a “clean energy superpower” without more onshore as well as offshore wind, Downing Street denied that Sunak was preparing to change policy on onshore wind. A government source said that the emphasis would be on expanding offshore wind for the time being. As the UK hands over the Cop presidency to Egypt, Sunak will also urge leaders not to backslide on the promise of Cop26, where countries came together to sign the landmark Glasgow climate pact. The PM decided to attend the meeting last week only after criticism from other countries, and after the Observer revealed that his predecessor but one, Boris Johnson, was planning to go, threatening to upstage him. Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, said: “If Sunak wants the UK to be a global climate leader, he needs to rule out new oil and gas drilling, invest in home insulation, and back the demands of developing nations for a loss and damage finance facility. He should increase taxes on the profits of the fossil fuel giants to help pay for it, alongside giving extra support to households struggling with their bills. This is the only way we can deliver climate justice and build the trust that’s sorely lacking in international climate talks. People will soon forget what the prime minister said at this summit, but they will long live with the consequences of his actions.” Leading climate experts and campaigners fear the summit could fail before it even starts if countries do not agree to put the loss and damage suffered by the poorest countries at the heart of the talks. Huq said: “I am hopeful that there will be progress at last on finance for loss and damage at Cop27. There are discussions on whether to include it in the Cop agenda or not. Failure to include it will mean the Cop failing before it even starts officially.” If the issue is to be discussed, under the UN rules, an agenda item must be agreed at the opening session. There is willingness among developed and developing countries for such an item, but the Observer understands that some large developing economies are shying away from the issue. Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, called for developed countries at the talks to take a lead. “Rich governments must engage in a constructive manner to address the ongoing injustice of climate-induced loss and damage, by committing to deliver support to those being impacted and by phasing out fossil fuels,” he said. “This is the Cop where polluters must be put in the dock and be held accountable.” Cop27, the latest edition of the annual UN climate talks, is taking place amid high geopolitical tensions over the Ukraine war, soaring energy and food prices and a cost of living crisis around the world. Even the Egyptian hosts have admitted this will be the most difficult set of talks in at least a decade. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said in an interview on the eve of the talks that there was a gulf between the rich – which had caused the climate crisis but failed to cut greenhouse gas emissions – and the poor, which were suffering the impact but lacked the financial resources to protect themselves."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"fashion/2022/nov/19/fashion-brands-grapple-with-greenwashing-its-not-a-human-right-to-say-something-is-sustainable","type":"article","sectionId":"fashion","sectionName":"Fashion","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-18T14:00:29Z","webTitle":"Fashion brands grapple with greenwashing: ‘It’s not a human right to say something is sustainable’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/nov/19/fashion-brands-grapple-with-greenwashing-its-not-a-human-right-to-say-something-is-sustainable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/fashion/2022/nov/19/fashion-brands-grapple-with-greenwashing-its-not-a-human-right-to-say-something-is-sustainable","fields":{"headline":"Fashion brands grapple with greenwashing: ‘It’s not a human right to say something is sustainable’","bodyText":"In Singapore at the start of the month, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition – a non-profit alliance that makes up over half the global apparel and footwear industry – convened for their annual meeting. There was one big question on attendees’ minds: how would the coalition respond to claims of greenwashing? In June, the use of a tool the coalition had spent a decade building in order to measure the industry’s environmental impacts was paused after the Norwegian Consumer Authority issued a warning that it could not be used to support sustainability claims. By then some major players – including Adidas and Kering – had already opted out of using the tool, called the Higg MSI, with Kering citing concerns about the accuracy of the data. The coalition’s cause was further hindered by the release of a Stand.earth report that revealed that despite pledging to reduce emissions, the fashion industry’s carbon footprint has increased and continued to grow. Out of the ten companies assessed, nine were Sustainable Apparel Coalition members. The fashion industry is responsible for between 2-8% of global greenhouse gas emissions and despite a recent rise in products being described as sustainable and pledges to curb emissions, according to the World Resources Institute the sector’s environmental footprint is expected to grow by 60% by 2030. There is a broad greenwashing crackdown across the fashion industry, as regulators around the world try to figure out how to address misleading environmental product claims. For example, describing polyester products as “recycled” when the material cannot be reused again at end of life. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning At the end of November, the European Union will announce rules on how brands should back up green claims, and regulations are expected to follow. In Australia, the ACCC is conducting sweeps to uncover deceptive environmental and sustainability marketing claims. The Norwegian Consumer Authority’s guidelines highlight a key issue for fashion brands. While there is significant business potential in marketing yourself as environmentally friendly, proving those claims is far more difficult. More and more consumers want to know how sustainable their consumption choices are. A recent UK survey by Deloitte found that 34% of shoppers had stopped purchasing products from certain brands due to environmental or ethical concerns. Greenwashing has been rife in the fashion industry “for a long time” says Maxine Bédat, the director of the New Standard Institute. It’s only with a shift in methodologies and “better data that we’re going to be able to see if, as an industry, we are making any progress or not”. “Wrong data is worse than no data,” says Tonje Drevland, the head of the Norwegian Consumer Authority’s supervisory department. “You have to know that what you’re saying is correct. You have to have facts supporting what you’re saying.” At the SAC’s annual meeting, Norway’s guidelines were portrayed as an opportunity to work collaboratively to improve the Higg tools, and to look for ways to make systemic change, including embracing circularity and renewable energy. “I don’t think that these are bad conversations to be having,” Amina Razvi, the CEO of SAC, told Guardian Australia. “I think they’re good because it will push both the industry and policymakers and regulators to figure out what is that aligned position … that allows the industry to actually move forward.” However Jeremy Lardeau, the VP of the Higg Index raised concerns. “Is it practical and feasible to implement the NCA guidance on every product in this industry to calculate a product footprint? Not really. Right? It goes back to the complexity of the supply chain, and the availability of data.” Drevland is blunt about criticism of their feasibility. “It’s not a human right to say something is sustainable,” she says. “Maybe if you want to do sustainable fashion, you have to change your business models. If you want to make sustainability claims, you have to get control over your supply chains.” Bédat believes data would be improved if there was an onus on companies to report on what was happening in their own supply chains. “Companies are not required to do this work … and that dynamic needs to shift in order to improve the tools.” Alden Wicker, editor in chief of EcoCult, agrees that more specific data is of better use for consumers. She says there are other Higg tools (there are five in total) that offer better insights into a product’s environmental impact. She points to the Higg Facility Environmental Module, which measures the impact of the factories where products are made. “I would rather know which factory a shirt was made in … tell me if the T-shirt is made in a facility with solar power, or if the cotton comes from a co-op that uses fewer pesticides and petroleum-based fertiliser.” While the coalition waits for regulators to clarify how the industry’s impacts should be measured and communicated to consumers, they have enlisted the accounting firm KPMG to carry out a third-party assessment of the Higg Index. The SAC is also working with standards and certification non-profit Textile Exchange to do more research to create more datasets. The time-consuming nature of collecting data and waiting for regulators to make decisions leaves consumers looking to make more sustainable purchases somewhat adrift. “Honestly, I wish we lived in a world where consumers didn’t have to go so deep on clothing production in order to make ‘good’ or ‘ethical’ purchase,” says Wicker. “It should just be a given that you’re not contributing to deforestation or water pollution, should you want to grab a T-shirt from the store.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/02/eu-must-act-now-on-catastrophic-energy-price-spike-says-european-council-chief","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-02T17:00:04Z","webTitle":"EU must act now on ‘catastrophic’ energy price spike, says European Council chief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/02/eu-must-act-now-on-catastrophic-energy-price-spike-says-european-council-chief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/02/eu-must-act-now-on-catastrophic-energy-price-spike-says-european-council-chief","fields":{"headline":"EU must act now on ‘catastrophic’ energy price spike, says European Council chief","bodyText":"The EU must “make up for lost time” in finding urgent answers to an energy price spike that is a “catastrophe” for households and businesses, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, has said. Michel, who chairs EU leader summits, said the bloc needed to address the question of price caps, an idea backed by many EU member states. In scarcely veiled criticism, he said the European Commission had been too late in coming up with proposals on the price crisis despite repeated calls from EU leaders for action. “There is not a day to lose,” said Michel, who urged the EU executive to put “concrete proposals on the table” as soon as possible and not wait until 14 September when the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is due to give her annual state of the union speech. On Monday Von der Leyen said the commission was preparing plans to separate power prices from the soaring cost of gas, in an effort to ensure electricity prices reflected cheaper renewable energy. Her remarks triggered a sharp fall in the wholesale price of gas. EU energy ministers will hold emergency talks on 9 September, but it is not expected they will have official proposals to discuss. Michel, who has chaired several EU debates on energy, made clear his dissatisfaction with the timing in an interview with European newspapers, including the Guardian. “We have to address the question of the price caps,” he said. “That is not new, we do not start this debate today. That is why we invited the commission several times in the past to put concrete proposals on the table to help the member states decide. “An ideological debate on instruments is not enough. We need concrete and operable proposals on the table in order to deliver.” Commission insiders suggested the European Council leader was not in the picture on recent developments and his comments reflected the inbuilt tensions between the two presidents of sometimes rivalrous EU institutions. Michel also said it was time to discuss decoupling gas from electricity prices. In the EU, electricity prices are determined by the price of the most expensive fuel, usually gas. This arrangement has generated profits for renewable energy firms that can generate cheaper electricity from wind and solar power. A leaked paper proposes a price cap on “inframarginal electricity generation technologies” – renewables that have lower costs than gas – as part of a series of measures to confront all-time record gas and electricity prices. The windfall generated by this policy (the difference between the cap and market rate) would be used to subsidise poorer households. The paper also calls for measures to reduce electricity demand. The document, seen by the Guardian, carries a disclaimer that it is not a European Commission policy note, nor approved by top officials in charge of EU energy policy. The surge in energy prices has been triggered by a drastic cut in gas supplies from Russia: in June 2022 these were less than 30% of the average between 2016 and 2021. Michel warned that EU institutions risked losing support without urgent action. “It is really important that we do not forget that for our citizens, our families, our businesses, our SMEs – for them, the increase of the price of gas and electricity is a catastrophe.” Fears of a hard winter ahead have raised concerns about potential waning EU support for Ukraine, as the brutal war against the Russian invasion grinds on while Kyiv goes bankrupt. Michel said he was confident the EU would soon agree €9bn (£7.8bn) of financial assistance for Ukraine, which falls far short of Kyiv’s estimated €5bn a month funding needs. So far the EU has released €1bn of the promised €9bn, after internal wrangling over how to share the cost between member states, and the right balance between grants and loans. “This is urgent for us to deliver,” Michel said, adding that he was confident “we will be able to implement what we have promised”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/may/11/global-renewable-energy-industry-grew-at-fastest-rate-since-1999-last-year","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-11T06:00:09Z","webTitle":"Global renewable energy industry grew at fastest rate since 1999 last year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/11/global-renewable-energy-industry-grew-at-fastest-rate-since-1999-last-year","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/may/11/global-renewable-energy-industry-grew-at-fastest-rate-since-1999-last-year","fields":{"headline":"Global renewable energy industry grew at fastest rate since 1999 last year","bodyText":"The world’s renewable energy industry grew at its fastest pace since 1999 last year, despite the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, and may have established a standard for growth in the future, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The global energy watchdog revealed that the delivery of renewable energy projects, including windfarms and solar power projects, grew by 45% last year in a step change for the global industry. Wind power capacity doubled over the last year, while solar power grew by almost 50% more than its growth before the pandemic, due to the growing appetite for clean energy from governments and corporations. The clean energy boom has prompted the IEA to revise its renewable energy forecasts for the coming years up by about 25% from its previous growth estimates due to the faster than expected expansion of renewables in China, Europe and the US. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said governments need to “build on this promising momentum” by putting in place policies that “encourage greater investment in solar and wind, in the additional grid infrastructure they will require, and in other key renewable technologies such as hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal”. “A massive expansion of clean electricity is essential to giving the world a chance of achieving its net zero goals,” Birol added. China remains at the heart of the renewable energy industry’s growth after accounting for more than 40% of the global growth in the market for the last few years. It is also one of the largest suppliers of the raw materials needed to make wind turbines and solar panels including silicon, glass, steel, copper and other rare earth materials. However, China is also the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases because of its use of coal-fired power plants to meet the country’s rising energy demand. The country’s president, Xi Jinping, has pledged that China will become carbon neutral by 2060, but experts have warned that it will need to develop enough renewable energy to shut down nearly 600 of its coal-fired power plants in the next 10 years to meet this target. The passing of a key industry deadline for state subsidies in China is expected to cause the country’s renewable energy growth to slow in the years ahead. But the IEA believes booming demand for clean energy across Europe and the US will keep the global industry’s annual growth close to last year’s level. Heymi Bahar, the IEA’s lead author of the report, described last year’s renewables boom as “unprecedented” because although it matched the rate last seen in 1999 the industry has become far larger in the last two decades. He said record levels of government auctions for new renewable energy projects combined with a rising number of companies seeking to switch to renewables powered the “exceptional increase”, which is set to become “the new normal for renewable energy”. “The momentum is there from business and government,” he added. The IEA’s latest forecasts do not take into account the new US president, Joe Biden, whose administration is expected to spur an even faster rate of renewables growth. Biden has pledged to cut US emissions by half in the next 10 years. In the UK, the growth of the offshore wind industry is forecast to account for a quarter of the world’s offshore wind capacity by 2022, making it the only country in the world to have more wind power generated off its coast than on its land. • This article was amended on 12 May 2021 to clarify in the subheading that the 45% figure refers to the rise in the rate of new capacity, rather than a rise in new capacity."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/apr/01/florida-solar-energy-bill-financial-incentive","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T09:00:17Z","webTitle":"Florida Republican bill ‘basically erases’ state’s only pro-solar energy policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/florida-solar-energy-bill-financial-incentive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/florida-solar-energy-bill-financial-incentive","fields":{"headline":"Florida Republican bill ‘basically erases’ state’s only pro-solar energy policy","bodyText":"In one of America’s sunniest states, a Republican-led Senate recently passed a bill that could hamper the growth of solar energy by removing a popular financial incentive among consumers. Environmentalists are decrying the measure, arguing that the expansion of rooftop solar is a necessary step in the fight against the climate crisis. The bill was passed in Florida, as another extremely sunny state, California, considered a similar update to its solar policies. “This is a bill that basically erases the only pro-solar policy in Florida,” said Heaven Campbell, state program director of the non-profit Solar United Neighbors. The new legislation in Florida would impact a policy known as net metering, through which solar power users who sell excess energy back to the grid in exchange for a billing credit. If signed into law, HB-741 would cut this incentives for rooftop solar owners, and allow utilities to charge fees that would raise the cost of switching to renewable energy. During the day, solar panels can produce energy beyond what is needed to power a home. Under the current net metering policy, the billing credits earned by solar users are applied to energy used at night or when it’s cloudy. They can also offset costs of installing rooftop solar. The legislation, sponsored by Senator Jennifer Bradley and Representative Lawrence McClure, would allow utility companies to “recover its lost revenues” from customers and, starting 2024, the rate of reimbursement would decline for new solar-panel owners. Critics of the bill warn that it would halt the growth of solar industry in the state and reinforce Florida’s dependency on fossil fuels. Roughly 90,000 customers or about 1% of all customers across the state have rooftop solar. Florida is the second-largest producer of electricity in the nation after Texas, with 75% of its in-state electricity coming from natural gas. Records obtained by Miami Herald and Floodlight reveal that Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) state’s largest power utility, had drafted the bill. FPL’s parent company also made a $10,000 contribution to Sen. Bradley’s political committee, bringing to question the impartiality of this legislation. FPL’s parent company has said that the contribution was not made “with the expectation of favor”. In a statement to the Guardian, FPL wrote: “We’ve been engaged in constructive dialogue with numerous lawmakers regarding this important issue. Ultimately, lawmakers decide the exact language that will be included in a bill.” In response to the Miami Herald and Floodlight’s investigation last year, a spokesperson for FPL said the utility does not oppose net metering, but that “we simply believe rooftop solar customers should pay the full cost of this investment”. Supporters of the bill largely view net-metering as a financial burden to non-solar customers. When introducing the bill on 11 January Bradley argued that under the current policy, people who can’t afford solar panels are subsidizing the cost for those who can. However, filings by FPL and Gulf Power Company show that 67 and 59% of their net metered customers respectively are low-to-moderate income, with most homeowners financing rooftop solar through loans. The bill would require customers with solar to “pay the full cost of electric service” and not be “subsidized by the public utility’s general body of ratepayers”. But with such a small number of rooftop solar owners in the state, critics wonder if this is the case of utility companies claiming a monopoly on solar. “It’s becoming more and more clear that FPL views all solar that happens outside of their control as not just lost revenue, but a lost opportunity for ownership,” Campbell said. FPL has 50 solar farms across the state, and is acquiring more land to install 30m solar panels by 2025. In a statement to the Guardian, FPL wrote: “We believe our customers and our state benefit the most when the largest amount of solar is installed at the lowest cost. Large-scale, universal solar is the fastest, most cost-effective way for us to bring more solar to Florida, while keeping bills low for customers over the long term.” Another potential revision to net metering is underway in California, the nation’s leading solar power state. The state utility commission proposed reducing subsidy rates for rooftop solar and adding a monthly charge for new solar owners. Some environmentalists have supported changes to California’s net metering policy, calling them “cost-effective and equitable”. As is the case in Florida, the California proposal is backed by the state’s utility companies Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. In 2016, following similar net-metering legislation in Nevada, many solar companies ceased their business in the state."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/may/24/climate-change-crisis-culture-politics-technology","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-24T11:00:51Z","webTitle":"The climate crisis requires a new culture and politics, not just new tech | Peter Sutoris","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/24/climate-change-crisis-culture-politics-technology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/may/24/climate-change-crisis-culture-politics-technology","fields":{"headline":"The climate crisis requires a new culture and politics, not just new tech","bodyText":"We are living through what scientists call the Anthropocene, a new geological age during which humans have become the dominant force shaping the natural environment. Many scientists date this new period to the post-second world war economic boom, the “great acceleration”. This rapid increase in our control over the Earth has brought us to the precipice of catastrophic climate change, triggered a mass extinction, disrupted our planet’s nitrogen cycles and acidified its oceans, among other things. Our society has come to believe that technology is the solution. Electricity from renewable sources, energy-efficient buildings, electric vehicles and hydrogen fuels are among the many innovations that we hope will play a decisive role in reducing emissions. Most of the mainstream climate-change models now assume some degree of “negative emissions” in the future, relying on large-scale carbon capture technology, despite the fact that it is far from ready to be implemented. And if all else fails, the story goes, we can geoengineer the Earth. But the problem with this narrative is that it focuses on the symptoms, not the causes of environmental decay. Even if the technologies on which we pin our hopes for the future deliver as expected and do not lead to much collateral damage – both of which are huge assumptions – they will not have fixed our mindsets. This is a crisis of culture and politics, not of science and technology. To believe that we can innovate and engineer ourselves out of this mess is to miss the key lesson of the Anthropocene – that dealing with planetary-scale processes calls for humility, not arrogance. Our civilisation is underpinned by extractivism, a belief that the Earth is ours to exploit, and the nonsensical idea of infinite growth within a finite territory. Material possessions as markers of achievement, a drive to consume for the sake of consumption, and blindness to the long-term consequences of our actions, have all become part of the culture of global capitalism. But there is nothing self-evident about these things, as indigenous peoples teach us. Many indigenous groups got to know their natural environments intimately and sustained themselves over millennia, often despite harsh conditions. They came to understand the limits of what these environments could support, and they grasped that caring for the environment was simultaneously an act of self-care. Pacific islanders would designate no-go areas of the ocean to avoid overfishing, while high-altitude farmers in the Andes would rely on terraces that reduced erosion to grow their crops. It is not a coincidence that as much as 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity is located within territories inhabited by indigenous peoples. Rebuilding our relationship with our planet does not mean abandoning the many achievements of our civilisation. Some of our technological innovations can help us treat the symptoms of the environmental multi-crisis. But addressing the causes means abandoning some of the assumptions on which our current society is built: infinite growth, the instrumentalisation of the natural environment and speciesism. What does this look like in practice? Changing the collective mindset of a civilisation calls for a shift in values. It means educating our children about humility and connectedness, rather than vanity and individuality. It means changing our relationship with consumption, breaking the spell of advertising, manufactured needs and status. It means political organising, generating demand for a politics that sees beyond the nation state, and beyond the lifespan of the currently living generations – Wales has already started, with its Wellbeing of Future Generations Act. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown just how fragile and myopic our civilisation is. While technology has played a huge role in finding a way out of the pandemic through the development of vaccines, it has also highlighted humanity’s limitations as our societies became paralysed in the face of forces of nature more powerful than ourselves. And our chaotic response showed that technological prowess is no substitute for good political leadership. We must face up to the harsh reality that for all its achievements, our civilisation is deeply flawed. It will take a reimagination of who we are to truly solve this crisis.

Insulating Britain’s draughty homes would cost the government just over £1bn a year in grants plus a similar amount in subsidised loans, while a 50% cut in stamp duty could encourage people to install low-carbon heat pumps when they move house, according to the proposals from Onward. Ministers could also increase the uptake of electric vehicles and other green technologies through “salary sacrifice” schemes, and reduce the number of car journeys through “nudges” such as personalised public transport plans that inform people of their local public transport timetables and cycle routes. However, while both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are committed to the UK’s legally binding target for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, both want to curtail solar power and onshore windfarms, and support fracking and increased fossil fuel production. While Sunak has promised government support for insulation too, neither has set out a detailed plan on the issue, or on net zero generally. Alex Luke, author of the Onward report, said it was “natural” that the candidates were focused on immediate issues such as the cost of living crisis, but said the quest for net zero must be “a key priority” for the next prime minister. “I’m glad to see both candidates committed to the net zero target, but we need to hear more from both on how exactly they will do that,” he said. “It’s clear that retrofit [of homes, for energy efficiency] will need to be a massive part of reaching the net zero target.” He pointed out that polling showed net zero was still a top five issue for most Tory voters, and a top four issue for the wider public. The Onward report, Going Green, which will be published on Monday, found that an insulation programme for 15m households offering a combination of government grants and loans subsidised with very low interest rates through the government’s Infrastructure Bank would cost the Treasury about £31bn in total by 2050, plus about £40bn in total by 2075 in subsidising low interest rate loans. Homeowners would save about £20 a month on their bills after the cost of repaying the loans each month at current energy prices, and far more if prices leap again as expected this autumn and next spring. Luke said a previous attempt to do this, the “green deal” programme introduced under the coalition government but scrapped in 2015, had failed owing to “astronomical” market-based interest rates of more than 10%, which meant people barely saw any overall saving. Onward also suggested that “nudges” could play a key role in changing consumer behaviour, which will be needed to reach net zero. Luke said local authorities could offer personalised transport and commute plans. He pointed to a trial in Ipswich, costing £27 a person, which gives personalised information on public transport, walking and cycling routes, which resulted in an 11% fall in car journeys and a 14% increase in walking and cycling. Luke added: “None of these nudges are a panacea, or an excuse for not thinking seriously about investment [in reaching net zero]. But they are small-scale interventions that are low-cost, that have an impact and bring about change.” The government pulled the plug on its incentives to buy electric cars earlier this year, resulting in an uncertain outlook for the sector. Take-up of the cars had increased markedly, but they are likely to remain more expensive to buy than fossil fuel cars for the next decade, according to Luke. A government spokesperson said: “The UK is leading the world on climate change. We have driven down emissions by 44% since 1990 whilst growing our economy – more than any other G7 country – and are taking action to help people make greener choices. “We have committed over £6.6bn to decarbonise homes and buildings, which includes our £450m boiler upgrade scheme to increase the uptake of heat pumps. Further, we have invested £2.5bn to accelerate the rollout of zero-emission vehicles and charging infrastructure across the country.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","type":"article","sectionId":"mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future","sectionName":"Mitsubishi: Tech that drives a better future","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T00:18:40Z","webTitle":"A ‘battery on wheels’: why EVs can do more than just take you places","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/mitsubishi-tech-that-drives-a-better-future/2022/oct/14/a-battery-on-wheels-why-evs-can-do-more-than-just-take-you-places","fields":{"headline":"A ‘battery on wheels’: why EVs can do more than just take you places","bodyText":"It’s interesting to think of the sun as a kind of vast, patient teacher, waiting for us to work out just how useful it can be, aside from giving us light and making everything on Earth grow.

The arrival of the latest generation of smart vehicles, such as Mitsubishi’s Outlander Plug-In Hybrid EV (PHEV) – which can switch between its petrol engine and battery-powered twin electric motors – provides the opportunity to power our lives with clean energy. Imagine a world in which you can charge up your car’s batteries using your solar panels, and then use that power not just for transport, but to run your house for several days – free and clean. Mitsubishi’s PHEVs are at the cutting edge of the latest car tech thanks to vehicle-to-load (V2L), vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capabilities, all of which have the potential to transform how we use energy and shine a light on the fact that EVs and PHEVs are, essentially, powerful battery packs on wheels. While V2L will let you charge or operate an appliance via your EV or PHEV’s battery – a blessing if you want to take a fridge, or even a TV, with you when camping – V2H is another thing entirely, allowing you to use the car’s battery to power your home. Laura Jones, a senior analyst at the Australian National University’s College of Engineering and Computer Science, working across its battery storage and grid integration program, believes people need to reframe how they view their vehicles. “If you look at how we use our cars, they tend to spend most of their time parked,” Jones says. “So using V2H is a way of making it so that the car can work for you, even when you’re not driving it.” Using a bi-directional charger that can put energy in your car and then take it back out again, you can power your home via V2H, or help stabilise the electricity grid during periods of high demand, via V2G. “With V2G, if you lose a generator or load somewhere in the energy system, the vehicles will start charging or discharging to counteract that disturbance,” she says. “It’s a pretty critical service for keeping the system stable, because electricity has to match generation and demand continuously in real time.” The concept of V2H and V2G becomes even more attractive when you use free, renewable solar energy, which can be harnessed to charge your EV or PHEV, which in turn powers your home, reducing your energy and fuel bills to zero. “You’ve just got to look at how much solar there is out there,” Jones says. “We’ve got 40% [of homes with] rooftop solar or more in Queensland and South Australia – on a world scale, that’s huge.” Mitsubishi has combined the benefits of V2H, V2G and solar power to create the future-focused Dendo Drive House concept, a home-energy ecosystem that comprises an EV/PHEV, a bi-directional charger, solar panels and a home battery. Tim Clarke, eMobility strategy manager at Mitsubishi Motors Australia, says the Dendo Drive House concept was created to showcase the capabilities of existing technology. “We have such abundant renewable-energy resources in this country, so it totally makes sense for us to use that,” he says. “A home energy system that allows you to capture and store renewable energy when it is abundant, and then use it when you need it in your home or in your car is a great fit for Australians. It will challenge us to think about our day-to-day lives and how energy can be integrated into that.” For those with range anxiety around EVs, Clarke points out that PHEVs, such as Mitsubishi’s Outlander, are a best-of-both-worlds solution, because they can run in pure EV mode, or engage their petrol-electric hybrid drive system for longer trips. “We feel that PHEVs are a really a good solution for Australia right now; the new Outlander Mitsubishi Plug-in Hybrid EV has a 20kWh battery that allows you to travel 84km in all-electric mode, which covers most users’ daily commuting requirements,” he says. “In Australia, we have some of the longest distances between populated areas in the world, and we don’t have charging infrastructure in a lot of those places. Because PHEV is an EV for daily commute, and a petrol-electric hybrid for long distances, current charging infrastructure inadequacies are not an issue. It really gives you the best of both worlds.” With the ability to provide energy to your home or even emergency power in a disaster-relief scenario (all by harnessing free solar, if you so choose), today’s EVs are not only helping consumers with rising energy costs, but also helping the planet. As the sun might say, it’s a bright idea.

With energy prices already soaring and bills set to rise even further this year, it suggests Cameron’s decisions to effectively end onshore wind projects in England, cut solar subsidies and slash energy-efficiency schemes played a large part in rising bills. It comes with the government preparing to announce its much anticipated energy strategy this week, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further drives up energy prices. It is expected to push measures such as solar and onshore wind power generation, as well as North Sea oil projects. However, there are concerns that the Treasury is holding back more radical action. Many of this week’s measures could reverse action taken by the coalition government. Analysis by Carbon Brief looked at the cumulative effect of ending onshore wind subsidies, cutting energy efficiency funding and scrapping a programme to make all new homes carbon neutral. It also factored in cuts to solar energy subsidies. With the energy price cap already at £1,277 a year and rising to £1,971 in less than a fortnight and an expected £3,000 in October, the analysis found that maintaining the green policies would have reduced energy costs by £8.3bn a year for the economy overall, part of which would equate to £150 a year per household. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, said: “The government said they were ‘cutting the green crap’ but it was a disaster - with bills for working families much higher as a result. This demonstrates once again that going green is the right way to have energy security, cut bills, and tackle the climate crisis. “However often this government tries to relaunch their failed energy policy, they cannot be the solution to the crisis they created because they continue to face both ways on crucial issues like fracking and refuse to invest at scale at the solutions we need, including energy efficiency.” Dr Simon Evans of Carbon Brief, who conducted the analysis, said: “Cutting the so-called ‘green crap’ has left UK households highly exposed to soaring global gas prices and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Energy efficiency and cheap renewables are the fastest and most effective ways to cut gas imports – and household bills.” Cameron won the Tory leadership by forging an eco-friendly reputation, pictured with huskies on an early trip to the Arctic in 2006 and later installing a wind turbine on his house but reports emerged that he had told aides to “get rid of the green crap” in 2013. At the time that the remarks emerged, Cameron’s team said they did not recognise the phrase, but did not offer an outright denial. Then, a series of policies designed to push energy efficiency and renewable energy was scaled back. The number of homes having their lofts or cavity walls insulated each year dropped by 92% and 74% in 2013 respectively and has never recovered. Subsidies ended for onshore wind turbines, and planning reforms made them harder to build. Meanwhile, solar power was excluded from government support in 2015. Ministers have been battling for weeks to find ways of taking the pressure off energy and fuel costs. Boris Johnson travelled to Saudi Arabia this week to call for cheaper oil prices, while ministers have made clear that onshore wind and solar power generation will be prioritised in their plans. However, chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected more radical plans such as cutting VAT on fuel bills or delaying a planned national insurance increase to help with household costs. Government officials said that a package worth billions had already been designed, including a £150 council tax rebate for many households in England from April and a £200 energy bill loan in Great Britain in October. A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: “We have consistently backed renewable energy sources including both onshore and offshore wind, delivering a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid since 2010. “We are also accelerating our progress in upgrading the energy efficiency of England’s homes, investing over £6.6bn to decarbonise homes and buildings and bringing in higher minimum performance standards to ensure all homes meet EPC Band C by 2035. We are also insulating millions of consumers from high gas prices through the energy price cap.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-01T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"Back online: the retired gas storage site now able to power 1m homes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/dec/01/back-online-the-retired-gas-storage-site-now-able-to-power-1m-homes","fields":{"headline":"Back online: the retired gas storage site now able to power 1m homes","bodyText":"“Do you hear that?” asks Chris O’Shea, putting a finger in the air and looking out over a tangle of pipes and workers in orange hi-vis overalls. A deep whirr punctures the calm of the east Yorkshire coast, as a huge engine powers up and prepares to suck thousands of cubic metres of gas from deep beneath the North Sea. It is the first time that stored gas from Rough, a vast sandstone reservoir, has been pumped into the grid since 2017. Then, British Gas owner Centrica deemed its storage function “uneconomical”, and the government ignored calls to step in. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its throttling of Europe’s gas supply, has changed all that, and allowed the 37-year-old storage facility to make an unlikely comeback. “I promise this wasn’t staged,” says O’Shea, who is standing on a platform 100ft above the maze of metalwork that is the Easington gas terminal, which sucks the gas from Rough. It is six months since the then business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng asked if Centrica could reopen Europe’s largest storage facility. The site, which has only been used to produce local gas for the last five years, is now 20% full, enough to heat about 1m homes. Its reopening means the UK now stores nine days’ worth of gas, up from six, but still the lowest in Europe. Rough has been called into action because of “Dunkelflaute” conditions blanketing northern Europe: barely any wind or solar power available to generate electricity on grey, still days. These conditions have thwarted O’Shea’s efforts to fly by helicopter to the Rough platform, 18 miles offshore. He recounts trips offshore in early roles at the oil giant Shell,mistaking a tunafish for a shark on a rig trip in Nigeria. He is dressed in a trademark bright blue hoodie, with “join our Centrica pathway” on the front and “#netzerobattalion” on the back. Blink and you’d miss the millionaire executive with skin in the game of nearly every evolving energy story this week (see: costly bills, Sizewell C, Bulb’s takeover, windfall taxes, power cut frets). The reopening of Rough is a line in the sand for O’Shea, who has championed owning energy generation assets over simply being a retail supplier since taking charge in April 2020, reversing former boss Iain Conn’s strategy. The dash for gas after Russia’s invasion has raised questions as to why Britain has so little gas storage, and why ministers allowed Rough to halt its storage activities. Centrica had decided in 2017 that substantial investment was needed to make it safe at high pressures, with government support, to make it last a further 40 years. “Hindsight is a wonderful thing,” says O’Shea. “If we knew then what we know now, would it have been a different decision? Possibly.” Storage sites make money by taking in gas when prices are low, typically in the summer, and pumping it back out when prices are high. But the fall in gas prices in recent weeks has meant Centrica has been able to refill relatively cheaply. Investec analysts estimate reopening Rough could be worth as much as £5m a day. Rough sits below the resource-rich southern North Sea, where rigs routinely compete with windfarms and fishing boats for space. The sea is 36m deep, and Rough is 3km below that. A 30km-square sandstone reservoir, it is twice the size of Lake Windemere. It is connected to pipelines via 24 ever-narrowing straws. On the surface is a rig capable of housing more than 100 workers. Despite Britain’s drive to wean itself off fossil fuels, it is viewed as a giant insurance policy for the energy network. Executives argue its mere presence as part of the gas network “takes the froth” off prices. Centrica says it could have saved customers £2.4bn, or £88 each, last winter had it been active then. The FTSE 100 firm has funded this winter’s call to action, but O’Shea wants government support to secure its future. He estimates it would cost £150m to double its capacity to 60bn cubic feet by next winter. Longer-term, £1bn is needed to ramp up its methane capacity, and £2bn to fit the toughened steel needed for what Centrica hopes will be its next stage of life: the world’s largest hydrogen storage facility. The refit could take five to seven years if it is kept open during the work. “In order to invest, companies need to understand they can make a return and at the moment there is no confirmed model for hydrogen. We don’t need any government money and have never asked. We’re looking for the right regulatory framework,” he says. O’Shea hopes a “cap and floor” model guaranteeing revenues in tough times and returning windfall profits to taxpayers can be created for hydrogen. Is the current focus on gas obscuring the need to focus on green energy? “I think that long-term security of supply and decarbonisation can actually be complementary. They’re not mutually exclusive,” he says. He argues hydrogen is vital for decarbonising industrial Humberside and Teesside – the worst polluting areas of the UK and home to sites such as Scunthorpe steelworks. Entering Easington, it is easy to see the hallmarks of state ownership (British Gas was privatised under Margaret Thatcher in 1986). Over the fence lie the assets separated off in privatisation, now with fellow FTSE 100 company National Grid, that handle gas from Norway and the North Sea. On the wall, a projection shows the live status of each piece of machinery from the “pig tray” (a big bowling ball that squeezes liquid out of the pipeline) to the “slug catcher”, which helps further purify the methane. Ministers hope Rough’s extra supplies can complement other measures to reduce pressure on the energy supplies this winter – from putting coal plants on standby to National Grid incentivising firms and consumers to cut energy usage. The British Gas pilot of this scheme launches on Thursday. Called Peak Save, consumers with smart meters can receive about £4 for every unit of electricity they save compared with their normal usage. About 100,000 households are likely to participate and could save £100 between December and March, it estimates. “This approach to help manage residential electricity demand is likely to become a major feature of the market in years to come,” O’Shea says.

An Oxford-based solar technology firm hopes by the end of the year to begin manufacturing the world’s most efficient solar panels, and become the first to sell them to the public within the next year. Oxford PV claims that the next-generation solar panels will be able to generate almost a third more electricity than traditional silicon-based solar panels by coating the panels with a thin layer of a crystal material called perovskite. The breakthrough would offer the first major step-change in solar power generation since the technology emerged in the 1950s, and could play a major role in helping to tackle the climate crisis by increasing clean energy. By coating a traditional solar power cell with perovskite a solar panel can increase its power generation, and lower the overall costs of the clean electricity, because the crystal is able to absorb different parts of the solar spectrum than traditional silicon. Typically a silicon solar cell is able to convert up to about 22% of the available solar energy into electricity. But in June 2018, Oxford PV’s perovskite-on-silicon solar cell surpassed the best performing silicon-only solar cell by reaching a new world record of 27.3%. The perovskite-coated panels will appear different too. Instead of the blue tint usually associated with traditional silicon panels, Oxford PV’s panels will appear black and blend in better with rooftop slates. The mineral perovskite, also known as the crystal calcium titanate, was first discovered by a Russian mineralogist in the Ural mountains in 1839. In the last 10 years, scientists around the world have been locked in a race to engineer chemical compounds based upon the perovskite crystal structure but that are able to generate more renewable electricity at a lower cost. Dr Chris Case, the chief technology officer at Oxford PV, said using perovskite represents “a true change” for solar technology, which has remained relatively unchanged since the silicon-based panels developed in the 1950s. “Silicon has reached its culmination of capability,” he said. “There are residual improvements to be made, and cost of production opportunities, but from a performance standpoint it is at its efficiency limit. The perovskite material is something totally innovative for solar.” The company won £100,000 of funding from the UK government in 2010, before attracting equity investment from Norwegian oil giant Equinor, Legal &amp; General Capital and the Chinese renewables giant Goldwind. Frank Averdung, Oxford PV’s chief executive, said the company will be able to steal a march on the first commercially available solar panels which use perovskite to improve solar generation against the company’s rivals. “There are other companies working on perovskite, of course, and these other companies will eventually have a commercial focus, but none of these companies has the same focus on the combination of silicon and perovskite which we do,” he said. • This article was amended on 19 August 2020 to better describe perovskite."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/14/demand-for-oil-threatens-african--economies","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-14T06:00:32Z","webTitle":"Increasing demand for oil and fuel threatens African nations’ economies, analysis finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/14/demand-for-oil-threatens-african--economies","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/14/demand-for-oil-threatens-african--economies","fields":{"headline":"Increasing demand for oil and fuel threatens African nations’ economies, analysis finds","bodyText":"Expanding oil and gas exports would threaten the economic stability of many African countries, new analysis has found, despite soaring fossil fuel prices. Demand for fossil fuels is likely to fall sharply in the medium term, according to a report published on Monday by the Carbon Tracker thinktank. That makes relying on gas exports to fuel economic growth a short-term, risky strategy, while boosting solar power would prove a better long-term bet, the analysis found. Although gas prices are high now, and the top five oil and gas companies alone have made profits of more than $170bn so far this year, gas revenues would fall by half by 2040, and the gas market would see record low prices owing to shrinking demand, the report forecast. That would leave Africa with huge investments in gas infrastructure, but no export market, if countries pursued a “dash for gas” now, the analysis found. Kofi Mbuk, senior clean tech analyst at Carbon Tracker and lead author of the report, warned that companies investing in fossil fuels in Africa would be left with stranded assets. “The energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables is inevitable and irreversible,” he said. “The growth in energy demand globally and regionally is now being met by renewables and squeezing out fossil fuel demands. In Africa, and across emerging economies, solar and wind offer the best route for economic development.” The future of Africa’s vast gas reserves is a major topic at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt, now in its second week. Although not formally on the agenda for the UN talks, the conference is buzzing with talk of Africa’s potential as a gas exporter. Countries including Nigeria, Senegal, Mozambique, Congo-Brazzaville, Equatorial Guinea and Algeria have sizeable gas reserves, as does the Cop27 host country, Egypt. There are more than 600 fossil fuel executives and lobbyists at the talks, and a host of African heads of government who attended the leaders’ summit segment of the summit last week were keen to use the opportunity to strike gas deals. Macky Sall, president of Senegal, told the Guardian at the talks that it was wrong for developed countries to try to urge African leaders not to drill for gas when the west had grown rich on fossil fuels. “Why not Africa?” he asked. “Why should we not do the same?” Other leading figures have also voiced support for Africa to exploit its gas reserves. Tony Blair, former prime minister of the UK, told the Guardian: “They’ve got to be able to get gas. Gas for them is going to be a transitional fuel. Large numbers of people are burning wood for their fuel, which is bad for emissions but also bad for their health. For a transitional phase, they’re going to need to develop their gas resources.” This could save reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to some alternatives, he argued. “If you could swap, for example, heavy-duty diesel for gas, that would be highly beneficial for those countries. And in time you will have the potential for the development of hydrogen off the back of it [gas],” he said. Before the talks, the Sudanese-British billionaire Mo Ibrahim also called for Africa to exploit its resources. “We need a balanced and fair policy for everybody. Gas can be useful to our transition. [Developed countries who say otherwise] are hypocrites,” he told the Guardian. There are 600 million people in Africa without access to electricity. “How can we even think of development if people don’t have power?” he asked. “How can we have education, hospitals, business, companies, social life, TVs, tablets, computers, whatever?” Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of former world statespeople and business leaders, told the Guardian in June she supported the expansion of gas in Africa to provide access to modern energy for the 600 million people across the continent currently without it. Gas could provide clean cooking fuel as an alternative to biomass and paraffin, which currently kill thousands through indoor air pollution, especially women and children, she told the Guardian. “Africa is trying to get its voice out about its needs for just, equitable energy, and of course that implies some use of gas as a just transition,” she said. Egypt, host of the Cop27 summit, is understood to be eager to expand its gas industry, positing it as a help to European countries struggling with supplies to replace imports from Russia. However, many African climate experts and activists are speaking out against the expansion of gas on the continent. They argue that African’s poor are unlikely to see any benefit from the gas, which is likely to be exported abroad to the highest bidder by multinationals, with profits siphoned off to the countries’ elites. “The “dash for gas” in Africa is dangerous and shortsighted,” wrote a coalition of dozens of African climate groups in an open letter as part of a campaign called “Don’t Gas Africa”. Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said Africa’s plentiful solar and wind resources offered a better route to energy than investing in gas. “For far too long, Africa has been controlled by outside interests – a resource pool for extraction and export, and a dumping ground for the practices and technologies no longer wanted elsewhere,” he said. In its report entitled African Sun: Why solar not gas offers the continent the best economic opportunity in the transition, published on Monday, Carbon Tracker argues that Africa could be an exporter of solar energy, rather than gas. “Electricity will be the backbone of Africa’s economic future, with solar leading the way,” the report predicted. “Even though prior to the Ukraine conflict, solar was competitive with coal and gas for power generation, the conflict means that the continent should, more than ever, build solar as a means to decrease its dependence on its global commodity market and achieve a secure and affordable source of domestic energy. Further acceleration of cost reduction will put Africa in a unique position as a beneficiary from one of the best abundance of solar potential on the planet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-20T05:00:03Z","webTitle":"Energy bills may rise if government gives Drax more support, say MPs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/sep/20/energy-bills-drax-carbon-emissions","fields":{"headline":"Energy bills may rise if government gives Drax more support, say MPs","bodyText":"MPs have warned consumers may end up paying higher bills if the government rushes into providing further state support for power station owner Drax. As part of Liz Truss’s £150bn energy bills freeze, renewable and nuclear power generators are being asked to supply electricity below current market rates. Officials have begun to “negotiate” with generators on older wind, solar and nuclear contracts, which have benefited from windfall gains as the price of gas has soared, to persuade them to switch to newer, less lucrative deals, which lock in lower prices in return for guaranteed long-term income. It is understood Drax, which owns the vast power station complex in North Yorkshire and is Britain’s single biggest source of carbon emissions, could also negotiate over units 2 and 3 at its plant, which receive renewable obligation certificate (ROC) payments for burning biomass wood pellets, making them eligible for the scheme. Generators are not obliged to negotiate with the government as the scheme is voluntary. Drax has not yet confirmed whether it plans to rework its contract. It said it is “working in partnership with the government to find ways in which we can support the country during the energy crisis this winter”. However, there are growing fears that the government is in a weak negotiating position as generators will need to be convinced to forgo high prices that are unlikely to abate for some time, meaning officials could rush into deals that later prove a poor deal for taxpayers if the spike in wholesale gas prices quickly subsides. The thinktank Ember calculates that, from 2012 until 2027, when Drax’s ROC subsidies end, it will have collected more than £11bn in government payouts. It is understood the new contracts could stretch to between 10 and 15 years, opening up the possibility that Drax could land a further decade of state support. The company has drawn criticism from scientists and campaigners who have argued that burning wood to produce electricity is far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis. Nuclear power station owners Centrica and EDF are keen to enter the initiative and have already begun talks with ministers. The initiative was formally unveiled hours before parliament was suspended due to Queen’s mourning period. Charlotte Nichols, the Labour MP and member of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, said: “It is vital that the terms of these renegotiated contracts receive proper parliamentary scrutiny, as it risks locking in higher prices over the longer term and continuing excessive subsidies for technologies we are moving away from as we head towards our net zero targets. “Such long-term financial decisions cannot simply be made unilaterally as a kneejerk response to our current energy crisis, and must be properly debated, with alternatives considered, before any decisions are made that cannot later be unpicked. Particular scrutiny needs to be given to any deal with Drax given the existing levels of government support.” The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: “The government is right to be looking at ways to bring down energy bills. But they should avoid locking bill payers into expensive new 15-year contracts to subsidise sources of energy with dubious environmental credentials. Instead, we should focus on building new renewables which are nine times cheaper than gas.” The Friends of the Earth head of policy, Mike Childs, said: “During a cost of living crisis and with wind and solar power so cheap, it’s astonishing that the government is considering spending more public money on Drax. “If the company is to receive more subsidies, the government must at the very least ensure full transparency and proper parliamentary scrutiny.” Truss and the chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, have opposed windfall taxes, however the EU’s decision to impose an emergency levy may increase pressure on Truss to follow suit. The Times reported that some power generators believe a windfall tax would be better than being pushed to sign cut-price contracts. Drax said in July that profit before tax had jumped to £200m in the first half of the year, up from £52m in the same period a year earlier, aided by high electricity prices. It upgraded annual profit forecasts, and has signed a deal with National Grid to keep its coal-fired operations open through the winter. In the past 12 months, its stock has risen 63% to 709p, valuing the company at £2.84bn, after peaking at 831p in April. Kwarteng said last month, when he was business and energy secretary, that the importing of wood to burn in Drax power station “is not sustainable” and “doesn’t make any sense”. A Drax spokesperson said: “Drax is working in partnership with the government to find ways in which we can support the country during the energy crisis this winter. “We also plan to invest £3bn by 2030 in critical renewable energy infrastructure projects, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and pumped hydro storage, which will support energy security as well as jobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-09T16:40:17Z","webTitle":"A greener greenhouse: solar panels trialled on Wimbledon berries farm","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/09/solar-panels-trial-wimbledon-berries-kent-hugh-lowe-farms","fields":{"headline":"A greener greenhouse: solar panels trialled on Wimbledon berries farm","bodyText":"Tennis fans tucking into strawberries at Wimbledon this month may find their fruit has an unusual origin – a solar-powered greenhouse. Transparent panels have been attached to the sides of glasshouses in Kent as part of a trial to build up solar power supplies without using more land. Hugh Lowe Farms, which supplies fruit to the annual tennis tournament and major supermarkets, is hosting the study by researchers at the University of Greenwich. The trial, which has received £250,000 in government funding, began late last year and has taken on more significance since the energy crisis and the war in Ukraine threw a spotlight on domestic energy supplies. It is hoped the energy generated can be used to power automatic watering and temperature-control equipment, as well as housing for workers on farms. Ministers are keen for Britain to ramp up energy production, and have set a target of increasing solar output five-fold to 70 gigawatts by 2035. Dr Elinor Thompson, a photosynthesis researcher from the University of Greenwich who is leading the research, said the initiative was a “no-brainer”. “It looked like a great collaboration before the energy crisis. Over time it’s become incredibly pertinent to produce your own power. Farms are often in remote locations so it’s useful to have your own power source as well as helping the planet,” she said. The idea may also appease residents who object to the sight of solar panels covering the countryside, and allow farmers to use space that might have been allocated for panels to grow crops. Thompson said: “The public understandably never want to see land covered in solar panels so this is a pragmatic way to retrofit solar on to existing structures. “It’s helping farms to reduce their carbon footprint, which supermarkets are keen to see, and the government also wants the UK to reduce its carbon footprint as a whole.” The vertical photovoltaic panels are semi-transparent and affixed to the sides of the glasshouse, allowing some light through to the fruit, as well as through the roof. The trial will on Friday be extended to flexible panels attached to the side of polytunnels. The study concludes next spring and a further stage of research to prove the technology can replicated at a larger scale could follow. Thompson said the fruit was unaffected by the presence of the existing panels and that she hoped to ultimately study the impact of new coloured panels on the fruit. She said that light coming through orange-coloured panels could lead to leafier plants. Hugh Lowe Farms’ managing director, Marion Regan, said the company was attempting to cut its emissions. “Generating electricity in field while growing crops will help achieve our goals,” she said. The government’s energy security strategy, published in April, set out plans for a major acceleration in homegrown power through renewables including solar, onshore wind and nuclear power."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/nov/29/why-laax-could-be-switzerlands-greenest-ski-town","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-29T07:00:20Z","webTitle":"Why Laax could be Switzerland’s greenest ski town","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/nov/29/why-laax-could-be-switzerlands-greenest-ski-town","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/nov/29/why-laax-could-be-switzerlands-greenest-ski-town","fields":{"headline":"Why Laax could be Switzerland’s greenest ski town","bodyText":"There’s a sense of healing among the pines and tangled roots. Skulking somewhere in the snowy woodlands is an Alpine ibex, a distinctly Viking-horned goat, once hunted to extinction in Switzerland before being reintroduced a century ago. Hidden in the forest, an endangered black grouse is whistling as it forages for dwarf shrub needles. Fresh fox-print trails wind through stone pine and spruce, though the grey wolf and bat-eared lynx that have begun to return to these mountains are more elusive. I’m in Laax in Graubünden (70 miles south-east of Zurich), the Swiss Alps’ traditional home of winter sports, but it’s a ski holiday that most people wouldn’t recognise. The down-to-earth resort pitches itself as Switzerland’s most sustainable playground and I’m exploring from on-high on the new Senda dil Dragun (Way of the Dragon) treetop walkway. The raised, mile-long pathway towers 28 metres above the pillowy snow drifts and I keep my eyes peeled, scouting for ghostly predators and their prey. Though there might not be dragons, the woods are home to an ark’s worth of Alpine species, from chamois and mountain hare to marmots and ptarmigan. In the stillness I spy a red deer through a knot of snow-laden pines. The quiet drama is just as nerve-tingling as any black run. Regardless of what you see, the walkway’s purpose is to help educate and connect visitors with the valley’s larger rewilding story and the evergreen forests away from the piste map squiggles. Once the preserve of loggers and hunters, a dozen evergreen forests around the resort have been left to rewild by an alliance of wildlife, cantonal and government authorities, including the country’s Federal Office for the Environment, and species like endangered wood grouse are now making a comeback. Spend a few days in the area and you may also hear stories or see a pack of free-roaming wolves, which have returned to the upper mountains from Italy and are now protected and considered a native species. Certainly, the mountains are the reason people started coming to Laax 60 years ago, when the first ski lift opened in 1962. On the piste map, the resort fractures into a series of snow-globe bowls, spurs, cleft valleys and off-limits forest sanctuaries – all in the shadow of the Vorab Glacier and fanged tops of Unesco site Tectonic Arena Sardona. But unlike so many other sophisticated Swiss ski towns, the youthful main centre is a purpose-built affair jam-packed with eco design – and there’s been a concerted effort to ensure visitors can explore the mountains in as environmentally friendly a way as possible. In recent years, all lifts have been run on CO2-neutral hydro and solar power. Water stations are plentiful and free, as are e-shuttles around the resort. Artificially produced snow is CO2 neutral and every restaurant has a bird-friendly windshield; stunned jays and woodpeckers are a problem here. There is a free repair service for ski clothing to extend its lifecycle and the latest addition is vertical gardens on ski-lift base stations, to help nurture bee, bird and insect life year round. The planet-loving ethos extends as far as the food, too: on my first night, hunkered beneath a huge solar rooftop at Riders Hotel, I’m served a three-course vegan menu; the beetroot steak feels sacrilegious in the spiritual home of capuns, meat wrapped in spaetzle dough. It’s all quietly impressive for a town with a population of less than 2,000. “Sustainability is an obsession here,” says Martina Calonder of Weisse Arena Gruppe, the company operating the wider Flims Laax Falera resort. “We can’t save the Vorab Glacier. It’s too warm already and we’re losing it. But what we can do is create awareness throughout the resort, hoping people learn from our example.” The resort’s most intriguing proposition is the Last Day Pass, a CHF80 (£70) donation for a supplementary lift ticket that skiers will probably never be able to use for the “day that will hopefully never come”, as Martina puts it. Launched in 2020, the concept sees the proceeds of every lift pass sold “offsetting” 1,000kg of CO2 by supporting climate-protection projects that work to slow down the melting of glaciers by 10 minutes. Meticulous timekeeping is a tradition in Switzerland, after all, and the current last day is calculated to be 7 April 2056. “It shows skiers how they can make a difference,” adds Martina. “Even in a small way.” A bonus for winter visitors is that this is one of Switzerland’s most snow-sure spots. From Crap Sogn Gion station there’s a top-notch run in every direction, and for snowboarders there is the world’s biggest halfpipe, plus an Olympic-sized kicker, and five snow parks. It’s a tough call, but the black grand prix run from the 3,000-metre Vorab Glacier is hard to beat. Below in the valley, fellow skiers are tiny dots. The litmus test for Laax as a superlative green destination might well be the Weisse Arena Gruppe’s latest blue-sky idea: Flem Express, the world’s first on-demand cable car. Always, gondolas have spun from first run to last light, but here engineers have invented a demand-driven, energy-reducing way to get riders into the mountains. Currently, six stations are being built between the neighbouring village of Flims and the upper amphitheatres of Tectonic Arena Sardona, with skiers (and hikers and bikers in summer) able to choose where they want to go and when, with unoccupied gondolas detached from the line. It is Uber with cable cars, like something brainstormed by a Silicon Valley tech innovator, and it is expected to open in late 2023 to connect to the wider Laax playground. On my last night I snow-shuffle around the residential area of Laax Murschetg, where buildings are made from local slate and wood – cuboid Rocks Resort looks like pieces from a scattered Jenga tower. The views of the Lepontine Alps are bang-on, as are the restaurants and bars squirrelled into the surrounding precinct. At Grandis Ustria da Vin, it’s raclette with foraged mushrooms and the cheapest of the cellar’s 800 wines. Then, it’s negronis in Tankstelle, an upcycled vintage clothing store and bar. A suitably stylish yet simple end to a break in a resort that understands the challenges of climate change better than most. The trip was provided by Flims Laax Falera. Doubles at Riders Hotel from £150, room only. Further information from myswitzerland.com. Travelling from Zürich to Laax by public transport takes just over two hours.

But he should take heart: Truss may not be long for No10, and Charles may look at recent events and conclude that no-one listens to her anyway. If so, there are plenty of opportunities now for him to turn the archaic House of Windsor into an institution fit for an age of climate breakdown, poverty and deep inequalities. Ascent to the throne means no more speeches about emissions or off-the-cuff remarks about nature destruction. But his new position actually makes it easier for him to lobby prime ministers, even Truss while she lasts, at confidential weekly meetings and to lead public opinion by personal example – something that even a government hostile to his convictions about the environment may not be able to control. From now on, what the King says is less important than what he is seen to do. He now runs a multibillion-pound private corporation and has one of the world’s greatest personal fortunes. How our billionaire king spends his money and what he does with his vast properties and land holdings may fundamentally change the way Britain sees itself – and how the world regards us. Royal finances are arcane, mostly anonymous and often blurred between public and personal wealth. The royal cash cow is now the Duchy of Lancaster, an 18,000-hectare (44,000-acre) trove of rich farm and moor lands, chunks of central London, and net assets of £652m. From this he will take around £24m a year. In addition, he inherits – and will pay no tax on – his mother’s vast private financial investments, her many privately owned palaces, castles and mansions, as well as the royal art collection and myriad private jewels. With his own mansions, farms and houses, and the former Queen Mother’s £50m estate, he now has a private fortune worth nearly £500m, which earns him possibly £25m a year. Beyond that, he receives a quarter of the profits made by the crown estate, the monarch’s property corporation which owns nearly 8,000 sq km of farmland and is valued by Forbes at more than $17bn (£16.3bn). It is no wonder that Charles backs renewable energy. Aside from vast acres of wild lands suitable for onshore wind, the estate owns most of the British foreshore to a distance of 12 miles – perfect for selling leases for offshore wind, tidal and wave power. It might not go down well to do a Patagonia and try to give it all away to fight climate breakdown. But he could start his green reforms of the monarchy by publicly divesting the institution of all fossil fuel interests. Again, we do not know what these investments amount to, but it is likely to be in the many hundreds of millions of pounds. Far from diminishing his wealth, the Treasury might even see divestment as a shrewd move if Britain is to reach net zero emissions. So what could a green king actually do without enraging a government? He could start by offering to the state or the National Trust most of his cold, largely empty, useless castles, palaces and mansions, such as Balmoral and Sandringham. He could then slash the estimated £90,000-a-month heating bills of any that are left – Windsor or Sandringham, for example – by investing heavily in heat pumps, solar power and insulation and then switching his bills to renewable energy providers such as Ecotricity or Good Energy. The next move of a green king would be to radically change the way the monarchy moves. Here Charles could clear out the old rollers and Bentleys, go entirely electric and take to bicycles and rail like other modern monarchies. Soon he will be able to buy an electric plane for short-haul flights, but for now he could offset all journeys. That leaves the King with a lot of valuable earth that is barely used. If he was brave and fair-minded he could offer the 16 private hectares (39 acres) of Buckingham Palace to London as a new public park, possibly reserving part of it for rewilding or allotments. In the same spirit, he could give ramblers open access to all royal lands and press the Duchy of Lancaster to go organic and achieve net zero within 10 years. Selling off the family silver is traditionally reserved for governments, but Charles could happily dispose of most of the many thousands of great diamonds, rubies and other jewels that have been handed personally to royalty over 200 years without anyone caring. The billions of pounds raised from such a sale could be used to establish academies of sustainable farming or permaculture in the Commonwealth countries from which most jewels were looted in colonial times and many of which are still struggling to feed themselves. Aside from shedding most of his relations, abandoning archaic British empire medals and generally living less lavishly, he could start hosting vegetarian banquets and end hunting on all royal lands. At which point, he could do the decent thing and abolish himself. John Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Attention has turned to the closure of the Rough gas storage facility in the North Sea in 2017, which left the UK with only enough storage to meet the demand of four to five winter days. But while gas is being phased out, Britain’s growing reliance on renewables, such as offshore wind and solar, does not solve the problem of intermittency – what happens when the wind does not blow or the sun does not shine. The key to securing enough affordable, low-carbon energy is more storage to make the most of the renewable energy available. A storage boom has been forecast over the coming decade as governments race to meet their climate targets. Within the next five years, the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects global power storage capacity to expand by 56% to reach more than 270 GW by 2026, driven by a growing need to create flexible electricity systems which rely more on renewable sources. Well-established lithium-ion batteries are expected to dominate, according to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, but their capacity is measured in hours rather than days. New energy technologies, which can store energy for longer periods, have found renewed favour within the power industry as the winter energy crisis has unfolded. Here are four long-range energy storage options which could help to keep the lights on in the future: ‘Gravity’ storage Hydropower has acted as a form of energy storage in the UK for decades. The principle is simple: electricity is used to pump water upwards into a reservoir when the market has ample power available. When electricity supplies become tight the water can be released at short notice to flow over a generating turbine to create electricity for the grid to use. A new breed of pumped storage could play an even greater role than the giant hydropower plants of the past. Engineers believe they could unlock hundreds of potential sites across the UK, which would be quicker and cheaper to build than traditional hydropower dams. By using a mineral-rich fluid, which has more than two-and-a-half times the density of water, projects could generate the same amount of electricity from slopes which are less than half as high. Typically, pumped hydropower is stored within the range of five to 175 hours, compared with the most-used lithium-ion battery technology which can usually store less than four hours’ worth of electricity, according to the IEA. One report by the Paris-based agency found that India dominates the expansion of pumped hydropower storage thanks to projects using its existing large reservoirs. Another form of “mechanical energy storage” which could play a greater role in the future involves harnessing “gravity energy” to create electricity by using electric winches to hoist 12,000-tonne weights to the top of a disused mine shaft when there is plenty of renewable energy available, then dropping the weights hundreds of metres down vertical shafts to generate electricity when needed. These innovative storage projects are unlikely to replace the UK’s need for batteries, but they could help the country meet its climate targets at a lower cost. Concentrated solar power storage In the heat of the Nevada desert US engineers have already begun pioneering new technology which stores energy generated by renewables as heat. The Crescent Dunes project uses the heat of a vast solar farm, concentrated using mirrors, to heat molten salt to temperatures of up to 560C. The salt is able to maintain this temperature until electricity is needed. Then, the heat is used to run a conventional steam turbine which generates enough electricity to power 75,000 homes long after the sun has set. The IEA expects China to lead the expansion of concentrated solar power storage thanks to a generous subsidy scheme, which is poised to continue until the end of this year. Beyond China, the United Arab Emirates is expected to roll out the second-largest volume of new capacity globally. There are also similar projects emerging across Australia. Concentrated solar power is typically stored for between five to 15 hours, according to the IEA, more than three times the duration of traditional lithium-ion batteries. Unlike batteries, which have a finite number of charge/discharge cycles, the molten salt, or molten silicon, can be used indefinitely and can be recycled when the units reach the end of their 20-year service life. Green hydrogen Demand for hydrogen made from water and renewable energy is expected to boom in the decades ahead as governments plan to replace the fossil fuels used in power plants, factories and heavy transport with the clean-burning, green alternative. But green hydrogen can also be used as a form of energy storage. “When the wind is blowing but the grid is oversupplied with renewable energy you can store energy in a battery for about an hour,” said Dr Graham Cooley, the chief executive of ITM Power, which makes the electrolysers used to produce green hydrogen. “But if you want to store energy for days or even months you need something new.” In the past, the UK’s electricity system operator has been forced to pay renewable energy developers to switch off their wind turbines or solar farms to avoid overloading the grid with green electricity when power supplies outstrip demand. But using sunny weekends and windy nights to run electrolysers and create green hydrogen could help countries make better use of their wind and solar farms. Cooley said ITM Power faces growing demand for its electrolysers, which are built at a factory in Sheffield, in part because the cost of producing green hydrogen has come down radically in line with the falling cost of renewable energy. It helps that more energy companies are interested in avoiding the record market price for fossil fuel gas too, he added. ‘Cryogenic’ batteries Within the coming months one of the world’s biggest liquid air, or “cryogenic”, batteries will begin operating near Manchester in the UK after its developers promised it could help store renewable energy for weeks rather than hours. The project is being developed by Highview Power. It plans to use renewable electricity to chill air to -196C, transforming it into a liquid that could be stored in large metal tanks for weeks. When needed, the liquid can be turned back into gas, and used to turn a turbine and generate enough electricity to power up to 200,000 homes for five hours. The full-scale “cryobattery” will have a capacity of 50MW or 250MWh over a five-hour release time, and follows the success of a 5MW pathfinder project built next to a landfill site in Bury, Greater Manchester, in summer 2018. Highview has plans to build its long-duration batteries in the US and Chile, and earlier this year set out plans to develop seven new liquid-air projects in Spain at a cost of about $1bn (£735m). Its UK project will be the first. • This article was amended on 10 January 2022 to correct a misspelling of Graham Cooley’s surname and to clarify that while solar power is stored in molten salt in the Crescent Dunes project, it can also be stored in molten silicon.

About 290GW of new renewable energy generation capacity, mostly in the form of wind turbines and solar panels, has been installed around the world this year, beating the previous record last year. On current trends, renewable energy generating capacity will exceed that of fossil fuels and nuclear energy combined by 2026. New climate and energy policies in many countries around the world have driven the growth, with many governments setting out higher ambitions on cutting greenhouse gas emissions before and at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last month. However, this level of growth is still only about half that required to meet net zero carbon emissions by mid-century. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, said: “This year’s record renewable energy additions are yet another sign that a new global energy economy is emerging. The high commodity and energy prices we are seeing today pose new challenges for the renewable industry, but elevated fossil fuel prices also make renewables even more competitive.” According to the IEA report, published on Wednesday, renewables will account for about 95% of the increase in global power-generation capacity from now to the end of 2026, with solar power alone providing about half of the increase. Raw material prices have risen as the world has emerged from the Covid pandemic and on the back of the energy price rises around the world. These price increases have cancelled out some of the cost falls of recent years in the renewable sector. If they continue next year the cost of wind power will return to levels last seen in 2015, and two to three years of cost falls in solar power will be wiped out. Heymi Bahar, lead author of the report, said that commodity prices were not the main obstacles to growth, however. Wind and solar would still be cheaper than fossil fuels in most areas, he noted. Permitting was the main barrier to new wind energy projects around the world, and policy measures were needed to expand use of solar power for consumers and industry. “We need a gear change to meet net zero,” he said. “We have already seen a very important gear change in recent years but we need to move up another gear now. It is possible, we have the tools. Governments need to show more ambition, not just on targets but on policy measures and plans.” China installed the most new renewable energy capacity this year, and is now expected to reach 1,200GW of wind and solar capacity in 2026, four years earlier than its target of 2030. China is the world’s biggest carbon emitter, but the government was reluctant at Cop26 to commit to the strengthening of its emissions-cutting targets, which many observers had hoped for. China is targeting a peak in emissions by 2030, which many analysts say is much too late if the world is to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the Paris agreement target that was the focus of the Cop26 talks. Birol said China’s rapid expansion of renewable energy suggested the country could reach an emissions peak “well before 2030”. India, the world’s third-biggest emitter, also experienced strong growth in renewable energy capacity in the past year, but its target – set out at Cop26 – of reaching net zero by 2070 is also regarded as too weak by many. Birol said: “The growth of renewables in India is outstanding, supporting the government’s newly announced goal of reaching 500GW of renewable power capacity by 2030 and highlighting India’s broader potential to accelerate its clean energy transition.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/jun/23/most-new-wind-solar-projects-cheaper-than-coal-report","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-06-23T09:28:40Z","webTitle":"Most new wind and solar projects will be cheaper than coal, report finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/23/most-new-wind-solar-projects-cheaper-than-coal-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/jun/23/most-new-wind-solar-projects-cheaper-than-coal-report","fields":{"headline":"Most new wind and solar projects will be cheaper than coal, report finds","bodyText":"Almost two-thirds of wind and solar projects built globally last year will be able to generate cheaper electricity than even the world’s cheapest new coal plants, according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). The agency found that the falling cost of new windfarms and solar panels meant 62% of new renewable energy projects could undercut the cost of up to 800 gigawatts (GW) worth of coal plants, or almost enough to supply the UK’s electricity needs 10 times over. Solar power costs fell by 16% last year, according to the report, while the cost of onshore wind dropped 13% and offshore wind by 9%. In less than a decade the cost of large-scale solar power has fallen by more than 85% while onshore wind has fallen almost 56% and offshore wind has declined by almost 48%. Francesco La Camera, Irena’s director general, said the agency’s latest research proved the world was “far beyond the tipping point of coal”. He said: “Today renewables are the cheapest source of power. Renewables present countries tied to coal with an economically attractive phase-out agenda that ensures they meet growing energy demand, while saving costs, adding jobs, boosting growth and meeting climate ambition.” In Europe, the cost of a new coal plant would be well above the cost of new wind and solar farms including mandatory carbon prices. The report found that in the US renewable energy could undercut between three-quarters and 91% of existing coal-fired power plants, while in India renewable energy would be cheaper than between 87% and 91% of new coal plants. Replacing hundreds of existing coal plants with unsubsidised renewable energy sources could save $32.3bn (£22.8bn) every year in energy system costs and avoid about 3 gigatonnes of CO2 annually, the report said. The carbon saving from phasing out 800GW of coal power capacity would be the equivalent of shaving 9% from the world’s energy-related emissions last year, according to the report, or 20% of the carbon savings needed by 2030 to help limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The report predicts the cost of renewable energy will continue to fall in the coming years. Over the next two years three-quarters of all new solar power projects will be cheaper than new coal power plants, and onshore wind costs will be a quarter lower than the cheapest new coal-fired option. “The trend confirms that low-cost renewables are not only the backbone of the electricity system, but that they will also enable electrification in end uses like transport, buildings and industry and unlock competitive indirect electrification with renewable hydrogen,” the report said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/apr/05/community-batteries-what-are-they-and-how-could-they-help-australian-energy-consumers","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-04-04T20:00:17Z","webTitle":"Community batteries: what are they, and how could they help Australian energy consumers?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/05/community-batteries-what-are-they-and-how-could-they-help-australian-energy-consumers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/apr/05/community-batteries-what-are-they-and-how-could-they-help-australian-energy-consumers","fields":{"headline":"Community batteries: what are they, and how could they help Australian energy consumers?","bodyText":"In what might be the most attention the battery world has had since Elon Musk built South Australia’s giant battery, Labor has announced that if they win the next election they will front up the cash to install hundreds of “community batteries” across the country. But what is a “community battery” and how do they work? What’s the deal? The kind of batteries that are used to support the electricity grid come in different shapes and sizes. There are the ones used to support electricity generation, like Elon Musk’s big battery at Hornsdale in South Australia, which is used as frequency support. There are mid-size batteries that are used in rural areas to isolate networks and provide a backup power supply in case the power goes out. Then there are the little community batteries that can be scattered around cities and shared between households in a particular neighbourhood or street. It’s this kind that is the focus of Labor’s proposal. The basic idea of these community batteries is to allow households that generate their own solar power to pool their excess electricity in shared storage for later use. Why might you need one? In Australia one in every six households have solar, but only one in 60 have battery storage. For individual households, a community battery is a good way to lower costs by shifting the cost and the risks from installation, maintenance and replacement onto a private company or council to take care of. For the people who run the electricity grid, these batteries are extremely useful. From the network perspective, rather than ripping out the existing cables and installing a larger one to deal with issues around peak demand, it is cheaper and more effective to put in a battery. This also helps deal with voltage and capacity issues created by concentrations of rooftop solar. How does it work? In principle, these batteries work like Dropbox except for electricity – though as the idea is being developed across a number of pilot programs the precise specifics tend to vary. Sizes range from 100kW to 1MW and could be the size of a fridge or shipping container. Each household is then offered a certain amount of storage so that as energy is generated during the day, a portion of excess power is stored. During times of peak demand, this power can then be drawn on to power homes in the evening or support the grid. There have been proposals to use the batteries in electric vehicles in a similar way but the advantage of a community battery is that both users and those who run the grid know exactly where it will be at any given time. Has it been done anywhere in Australia? Several trials are currently being run around the country. Among the most prominent is one by Western Power and Synergy in Western Australia, which has began its third trial late last year. Over east in New South Wales, Ausgrid has begun its own Beacon Hill pilot program among 600 houses in Sydney’s northern beaches area. This is expected to be the “first of many”. What will it cost to use? The Australian Renewable Energy Agency recently commissioned some researchers from Australia National University’s battery storage and integration program to investigate the financial prospects of community battery projects. Dr Lachlan Blackhall, who heads up the team, says it’s not possible to estimate costs with any certainty as the technology is still developing, along with the business models. It largely depends on who is operating the battery, whether they are a for-profit company, what model they operate under and what the battery is being used for. “The key takeaway is that community batteries deployed at scale would provide cost savings for consumers,” Dr Blackhall said. What is Labor talking about doing? Promising cash. Should it win the election, Labor says it will spend over $200m to install 400 community batteries across the country to service 100,000 households. Labor says this will help encourage households to invest in solar panels."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2023/feb/09/sri-lanka-at-its-best-eco-ethical-community-holiday","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2023-02-09T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"Jungles, jackfruit and community tourism: this is Sri Lanka at its best","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/feb/09/sri-lanka-at-its-best-eco-ethical-community-holiday","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2023/feb/09/sri-lanka-at-its-best-eco-ethical-community-holiday","fields":{"headline":"Jungles, jackfruit and community tourism: this is Sri Lanka at its best","bodyText":"There is a moment of absolute stillness – the battered football whizzing through the air, all eyes following it, before it crashes down into the glass case and tiny gasps escape little mouths. Thankfully, it rolls off, leaving the glass and the encased Buddha statue unharmed. We are playing football on a dusty, sunbaked escarpment with a group of farm children, and amid the excitement I almost destroy the village’s religious relic. But the game goes on, with limbs flying everywhere, toes (mine) getting stamped on and the football continuing to fly skywards. We are here to meet some of the 30 or so children who are part of Classroom in the Wild, a community outreach project initiated in 2014 by Chamintha and Rajindra Jayasinghe, founders of Ayu in the Wild Holidays, to create opportunities for children in Sri Lanka’s most disconnected communities. For these children, a lack of access to learning English has stifled their progress, and for many of them joining their parents to work the land will be their only viable option. We meet them at their school – a hut accessed by a single road through rice paddy fields, around four miles from the world heritage site of Sigiriya. It is a wild, inaccessible area that takes up to four buses and a tuk-tuk ride to reach, which has resulted in some teachers refusing to come. The journey is long, even though we are staying fairly close, but the rewards are great and it leads to one of the most enriching experiences we have on our family holiday. There is a lot of giggling and shyness at first, even from our own children (Seb, eight, and Jemima, four), but there is an opportunity to play some word games, and then the ice is well and truly broken when we start to play football. There are bursts of conversation in between matches and we learn that the children are mainly from families who farm vegetables and work in the paddy fields; that they have been learning how to cohabit in these rural surroundings with elephants (the children live in a community where human-elephant conflict is rife); and that their lessons continued during the pandemic – each Saturday morning they logged into just one smartphone for an online lesson. As we leave, Sithumi, 14, stands up in front of the class and in pristine English tells us how much they have enjoyed the day, and asks us to come back again. Chamintha first came across the children when she was travelling with her husband and saw them playing cricket with a deflated football. She says the visit to the school remains one of their most sought-after experiences, and it is easy to understand the reasons – it gives us an opportunity to really connect with a local community and gain an insight into their lives in a way that would be almost impossible in the confines of a hotel or visiting tourist attractions. In addition to supporting the weekly spoken English classes by fully funding the teacher and lesson planning, Ayu in the Wild employs a naturalist who regularly hosts discussions between travellers to develop the children’s vocabulary and confidence in speaking with foreigners. “We believe tourism must be a catalyst in inclusive development. Classroom in the Wild connects disconnected rural communities,” says Chamintha. “Prior to Covid-19, Sri Lanka was heading towards over-tourism. This project showcases the value of small-scale immersive tourism and the emotional and intellectual impact on guests. We believe kids can be the greatest advocates of change,” she adds. The ethos of Ayu in the Wild Holidays is community-based tourism, and from the moment we land at Colombo airport and meet our guide, Dhanu, we know that this will be a trip where we will see a different Sri Lanka, and why at this moment that is more important than ever. We arrive when it is relatively peaceful and calm, but the country is in turmoil, having defaulted on its debts for the first time in its history, as it struggles with a devastating economic and political crisis. This is against the backdrop of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, the 2019 easter bombings and the pandemic, all of which ravaged the country’s tourism industry. We still decide to travel, and arrive in the early hours of the morning in late May 2022. Heavy rain batters the roof of the van as we veer off the main road and down what appears to be a dirt track. On the other side is the veranda of the Wallawwa, a restored 200-year-old manor house between Negombo and Colombo. We are handed freshly squeezed lychee juice and immediately forget any trepidation we’d felt just hours earlier as we receive the warmest of welcomes, with everyone telling us how grateful they are that tourists are still coming to the country. “Tourism is as vital to the island’s economy as cricket is to the island’s spirit,” says Chamintha. “In December last year, tourism bounced back phenomenally with the end of the pandemic, and that’s the kind of welcome that will greet a visitor, with hard-working guides, drivers, hosts and local vendors still smiling – still welcoming, despite reeling from the spiralling cost of living and a loss of income. We’re a pretty resilient bunch,” she adds. At the Wallawwa we see this resilience first-hand, with the staff making our stay comfortable despite the national unrest. There is a beautifully kept jungle pool hidden among mango and weeping fig trees, and the hotel grows much of its produce in its vegetable garden, with water for the guests’ showers pumped from the garden’s wells, and solar power in use. On our first evening, amid a din of insects and birds, the children play boules on the green, and we tuck into black pork and sweet, sticky prawns; colourful curries of jackfruit and aubergine; fragrant dhal and cheesecake with a rosewater and tamarind sorbet. The food is wonderful. After dinner, Neil, the manager, teaches us how to play carrom, a tabletop game in which players flick disks to the corners of the board. “Focus,” he says, just before my husband whacks the small wooden disk, sending it ping-ponging across the cedar-wood board, missing its target. We travel around Sri Lanka in the company of our guide Dhanu and driver Eddie – who combine enthusiasm, knowledge and such warmth towards our children that they feel like family by the end of the trip. What was the biggest adrenaline hit of the holiday was a constant source of debate: was it the wind-buffeted dawn ascent up Sigiriya rock; giant fruit bats hanging from the trees in Kandy; the sustainable wild elephant safari; snorkelling along a coral reef in bath-water warm seas; or a mountain path view of a crested serpent eagle taking off and cruising the thermals across the tea-field valleys below? Between the jaw-dropping encounters with nature we take a breath with a four-day stop at the Uga Bay hotel in Pasikuda (studios from £130 a night) – on the island’s east coast – and have a holiday within a holiday. The hotel is bigger than other places we have stayed at, with its rooms arranged in an arc facing the pristine, white beach, but there is an underlying commitment to the local environment and their communities. Water-filling stations are placed around the property to reduce plastic waste; solar panels are used; the hotel is moving towards only working with ethical whale-watching companies that responsibly approach whales and dolphins; and it has announced a commitment towards bringing more women into its workforce. There is a similar ethos at the final stop on our trip at Living Heritage Koslanda (forest pavilion cottages from £195 a night), a hotel in a wooded valley with its own waterfall and kitchen gardens, which employs mainly local people, most of whom are female. The hotel was initially the vision of Sri Lankan film director Manik Sandrasagara, who dreamed of creating an eco-resort in “one of the most sacred and secret places on Planet Earth” while protecting its natural biodiversity. The hotel was completed by his wife Lucy in 2012, four years after his death. “It has been an incredibly difficult few years, but despite everything we continued with Manik’s dream, and what we have is something completely unique, says Lucy. “It is a place like no other.” In the space of two weeks, we feel we’ve packed in about four different, breathtaking holidays in their own individual climates. We leave already plotting which bits we would want to see more of on our return, and it has alerted us to the importance of travelling with tour companies who have community at the forefront, reinforcing a sense of cultural identity and providing opportunities for sustainable development.

Energy UK, the trade body for the sector, said its proposals could cut £18bn a year from energy bills, including £11bn for businesses. This could deliver a saving for households of between £150 and £250 a year. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is understood to have met members of Energy UK to discuss the proposal and is said to be considering it seriously as an option to present to the next prime minister. The Conservative party will announce the result of a vote for its new leader on Monday, with Liz Truss widely expected to win the mandate. The voluntary scheme would work by separating the cost of electricity from sources such as nuclear, solar and windfarms from the sky-high prices being paid for electricity generated by burning gas in power stations. Gas prices have more than tripled since Russia began reducing the volumes pumped into Europe in the months before its invasion of Ukraine. At the moment, the way electricity auctions are designed means the price of all electricity is closely pegged to the price of gas. Under the proposals – first suggested by the UK Energy Research Centre – nuclear power stations and renewable electricity generators would be encouraged to sign up to a new type of contract. These contracts for difference (CfDs) would mean selling their electricity at a lower price, but one that was fixed and guaranteed over a number of years. Many older nuclear, solar and wind generators are on renewable obligation (RO) contracts, under which they sell at the current wholesale rate. The market structure has led to those on RO contracts benefiting from higher prices, potentially making windfall profits. Energy UK is urging ministers to make it possible for RO contracts to be exchanged for CfDs. Adam Berman, Energy UK’s deputy director, said: “The current energy market doesn’t allow customers to fully benefit from the cheapest form of electricity – domestically produced low-carbon generation. “This scheme would be a significant first step to decoupling gas from retail electricity prices. “Removing the link between gas and retail electricity prices will be complex and take time, but this solution provides a quick fix for up to 40% of our generation capacity.” The energy industry regulator, Ofgem, is also looking to reform the market in the long term to delink the price of electricity from gas. Several European countries are considering a similar move. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, said on Thursday the Treasury was examining several options to help consumers this winter. This could also include the Bank of England providing support to energy suppliers for hedging costs, which could allow consumer bills to be reduced. The energy supplier Ovo has put forward an alternative solution which would involve reducing the price of energy for domestic users, but only for a limited amount of units per household. Energy consumption beyond that level would be charged at a higher price. Why is the price of electricity pegged to gas? Typically, electricity prices reflect gas prices. This is because the types of energy needed to produce electricity for the UK are ranked, with renewables and nuclear prioritised ahead of coal and gas. The price of electricity is set every half hour by the margin cost of the last generating unit to be switched off to meet demand, typically gas. This pushes up electricity prices when wholesale gas prices rise. What is an energy contract for difference? Under these contracts, electricity plants are paid a flat rate for what they produce over 15 years. That rate is the difference between the “strike price” – an agreed price which reflects the investment in green technology – and the “reference price”, which is a reflection of the wholesale market price for electricity in the UK. If the market price is higher than the strike price, the Low Carbon Contracts Company, which is wholly owned by the government, ensures these savings are passed on to consumer bills. If the market price is lower, the LCCC makes up the shortfall. The government uses this system, introduced in 2017, to support the development of low-carbon electricity generation projects with high upfront costs and long lifetimes to protect developers from volatile wholesale prices. However, only about 15% of the total fleet of renewable power projects have a CfD; most are remunerated through the older Renewables Obligation Certificate payments. What are renewables obligation certificates? Under the renewables obligation model, designed for wind and solar, power generators receive the value of their electricity on the wholesale market, as well as an additional subsidy. Therefore, generators on these contracts have benefited from the soaring gas prices so far this year. • This article was amended on 1 September 2022.

Almost a century after Virginia Woolf wrote those words for her 1927 novel To The Lighthouse, a commemorative plaque is to be installed on the house in the Cornish town of St Ives where she spent her childhood summers and was inspired by views of Godrevy lighthouse in the bay. It is the result of years of campaigning and fundraising by Professor Maggie Humm, vice-chair of the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain, who says the property, Talland House, is a “crucial part of the Woolf story”. Humm, who lives in London, said that after four years of pressing the town council, the local MP and heritage groups in St Ives, it was eventually agreed that a permanent marker should be placed on Talland House. It is scheduled to be unveiled on 11 September. “It was 20 years ago that the founding members of the Woolf Society first made approaches about a plaque on the property, but it came to nothing. About four years ago, I started the campaign again. Then the town council finally got on board, and since then they’ve been brilliant,” said Humm. To The Lighthouse is a modernist novel in which the Ramsay family and their eight children rent a summer home on the Isle of Skye – echoing Woolf’s own early life – with the ever-present promise of a visit to the lighthouse off the island as the narrative thread to which Woolf stitches the thoughts and observations of the mother, Mrs Ramsay. Woolf thought it “easily the best of my books”, and it outsold all her previous works when released in 1927 through Hogarth Press, run by Woolf and her husband, Leonard. The New York Times called it “a brilliantly ambitious analysis of domestic psychology”. The book’s lack of any real plot has meant it’s generally considered unfilmable, although there was a BBC TV adaptation in 1983, starring Rosemary Harris, Michael Gough, and a young Kenneth Branagh. Through crowdfunding, almost £4,000 was raised for the plaque through donations from Woolfians across the world, especially in the US and Europe. The plaque design is similar to the Blue Plaque scheme run in London by English Heritage, but in the Cornish flag colours of black and white, saying that Woolf spent each summer in the house between 1882, the year of her birth, and 1894. Talland House was bought by Woolf’s parents, Julia and Leslie Stephen, and they began holidays there the year she was born. “They went every year until Woolf’s mother died,” said Humm. “You can imagine the journey from Paddington in London to St Ives every summer with eight children and all their luggage.” Talland House sits above Porthminster beach, and across the bay, three miles out, sits Godrevy lighthouse, built in 1858 to warn shipping of the treacherous Stones reef. When Woolf was a child, it would have been manned by lighthouse keepers, but the 26-metre tower was automated in the 1930s, and since 1995 has been operated entirely by solar power. Although To The Lighthouse is set in the Hebrides, it is Godrevy on which the lighthouse is based, and on which the young Woolf would have gazed every day from Talland House during the summers her family spent there. Talland House is now apartments but is a source of pilgrimage for Woolf fans. The gardens have recently been restored by heritage horticulturist Polly Carter to exactly as they would have looked during Woolf’s time. A St Ives council spokesperson said: “While St Ives is well known for its connection with the visual arts and important 20th century painters and sculptors, this will mark our connection to important writers who also left their mark on west Cornwall.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/nov/07/i-am-going-to-cop27-in-egypt-but-can-the-un-climate-conference-deliver","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-06T16:30:25Z","webTitle":"Greta Thunberg isn’t alone in rejecting the UN climate conference, but we still have to be there","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/07/i-am-going-to-cop27-in-egypt-but-can-the-un-climate-conference-deliver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/nov/07/i-am-going-to-cop27-in-egypt-but-can-the-un-climate-conference-deliver","fields":{"headline":"Greta Thunberg isn’t alone in rejecting the UN climate conference, but we still have to be there","bodyText":"Greta Thunberg is not a fan of Cop27, the climate conference that got under way in Egypt overnight on Sunday. She reckons it’s just a chance for the powerful to get away with “greenwashing, lying and cheating”, and that the annual summits of national governments, policy experts, spruikers and hangers-on aren’t working. She’s not going. She might be right not to go. As a privileged middle-aged man from a generation that has failed to do enough to address the climate crisis – more than half all historic emissions have been in the past 30 years – I’m not here to say she’s wrong. There is plenty to be cynical about. The Egyptian hosts have named Coca-Cola, which uses fossil fuels to produce about 120bn throwaway plastic bottles each year, as a sponsor of the conference. In Kenya, a civil society group has pointed out that nearly half of the plastic bottle waste in its country can be traced back to Coke. It’s a similar story across the developing world, where plastic rubbish clogs cities and waterways. There is a tradition of this sort of thing across 27 years of UN climate summits. As reported in last year’s Australia v The Climate podcast series, some conferences have been sponsored by coal companies. Last year, an Australian government pavilion in Glasgow gave over its main display space to Santos, a still-expanding oil and gas company. The problems going into Cop27 are broader than this. Tens of thousands of people are expected in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, but protesters are not welcome. Instead, civil society has been offered a pen far from the conference centre where they will be allowed to express their views behind a fence in the desert sun. Activists estimate Egypt has 60,000 political prisoners. In the lead-up to the event, civil society groups have been calling for the release of Alaa Abd El-Fattah, a pro-democracy activist who has spent most of the past decade in prison and has been on a hunger strike since April. At the time of publication, the Egyptian government hasn’t responded. Meanwhile, youth activists from across Africa, from some of the countries most sharply affected by the climate crisis, say they have struggled to get passes to what is supposed to be the African Cop, reinforcing a perception that UN climate conferences are an event for the wealthy and comfortable. Hopes for progress at the talks themselves are limited and have fallen since the relative high of Cop26 in Glasgow last year. Then, countries agreed to limit global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – an advancement on the landmark 2015 Paris agreement – and acknowledged that meant immediately considering how to ratchet up action this decade. But 2022 has not delivered on that promise. Only 24 countries have updated their voluntary pledges to the UN, and only India and Australia have taken noteworthy strides forward, the latter from a very low base. This will again be a focus in Sharm el-Sheikh, alongside an emphasis on the need for financial support for developing countries. The world agreed more than a decade ago that at least US$100bn a year was needed to help developing countries cut emissions and adapt to unavoidable change, but hasn’t yet met this goal. A related, and possibly bigger, issue at Cop27 will be loss and damage from climate disasters in societies that have not caused the problem. Climate justice demands the wealthy step in to ensure communities can continue to develop and improve lives, not just struggle to survive. Whether Cop27 can deliver on these issues is unclear, but pessimism over whether major progress is possible in the next fortnight is justified. The Egyptians have described the event as an “implementation Cop”, which suggests bedding down what has already been agreed. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis have distracted international attention while also likely accelerating the shift away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy. What is certain is that the fortnight-long talks will be fraught – they always are – and at some point become frantic as delegates from nearly 200 countries try to reach consensus on meaningful change that vaults the negotiations forward or, failing that, prevents them from falling apart. I’ll be in Sharm for the sprint to the line in the second week. I’ve been asked a few times why I’m bothering, given the logistical challenges, the ethical questions hanging over the summit and all the caveats about what will be achieved. It’s a fair question. From an Australian perspective, this is the first Cop appearance by the Albanese government, which has promised a wholesale transformation in how the country contributes to the global climate effort. As observers have told Guardian Australia, Australia has gone from being a global laggard under Scott Morrison to now being in the middle of the road. Politically, it is a big shift, but it will be asked to back up its new rhetoric by committing to do more than it has promised so far. The Australian delegation led by the climate and energy minister, Chris Bowen, can expect questions about what it is prepared to support on finance and loss and damage. Will it, for example, rejoin the green climate fund that Morrison quit during an on-air chat with Alan Jones? The scrutiny will be heightened due to Australia’s bid to host Cop31 in 2026, an ambitious goal that may pit it in competition with Germany and Switzerland. Expect there to be focus on Australia’s support for an expansion in fossil fuel exports, which is at odds with its policies promising to ramp up domestic action. How Pacific islands representatives, the Albanese government’s potential partners in the hosting bid, respond to that will be key. All of this is worth documenting. More broadly, there is a responsibility on journalists who can get to Cop27 to interpret and relay the often highly technical discussions at the conference for those who can’t be there. For all the justified criticism that 27 years of UN climate conferences have not solved the problem, they have made a difference. The Paris agreement has been genuinely transformative, prompting an escalation in national commitments that have reduced forecasts of future heating by 1C – just nothing like enough, yet. It also forced a change among investors and businesses. There is still no shortage of corporate and political greenwashing, but there is less outright denial. As the cost of acting falls – solar power is now considered the cheapest form of energy in human history – excuses for inaction are melting away. The role of the journalist in all this should, of course, be to hold everyone involved to account. And, in turn, to be held to account by their audience. The bottom line is that none of us should look away. It matters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/jul/18/uk-energy-cheaper-rates-electricity-bills","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-18T11:22:47Z","webTitle":"UK energy users could be offered cheap rates when demand is low","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/18/uk-energy-cheaper-rates-electricity-bills","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/jul/18/uk-energy-cheaper-rates-electricity-bills","fields":{"headline":"UK energy users could be offered cheap rates when demand is low","bodyText":"Consumers could be offered cheaper rates to use energy when demand is low or the wind is blowing, under proposals drawn up by the government. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on Monday launched a 12-week consultation on the “biggest electricity market shake-up in decades” in response to sky-high bills and Britain’s move towards renewable energy sources. One proposal suggests the introduction of incentives for consumers to draw energy from the grid at cheaper rates when demand is low or if the weather is particularly sunny and windy, saving households money. Officials said such a move could send “sharp” signals to encourage consumers to be more flexible in their usage and seek cheaper, greener energy at certain times. The initiative would minimise network costs by bringing electricity demand closer to supply. If introduced, the policy would build on a scheme being developed by National Grid to tackle prices this winter. It plans to reduce the risk of blackouts by paying consumers to use less electricity at peak times. The Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (Rema) consultation also proposed a “decoupling” of gas prices from electricity prices to ensure the benefits of cheaper wind and solar power reach consumers. At the moment, the wholesale price of gas effectively determines how the price of electricity is set regardless of whether the energy is produced via renewables – which are often at a lower, set price. This mechanism has forced up costs for green energy suppliers since the start of the energy crisis, in which almost 30 suppliers have gone bust, as well as for households. The price of offshore wind power in the UK has fallen to an all-time low and new contracts should add about 7 gigawatts of clean power capacity to Britain’s turbine fleet by 2026 – enough to power 5m homes. More than a quarter of the UK’s electricity comes from renewable sources. However, rising gas prices, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, have increased prices across the board and deepened the cost of living crisis. The government also plans to consult with the industry on whether to implement a form of localised pricing in the UK. Such a system could result in large cities such as London being split into zones with different pricing structures, or residents in different regions paying varying rates from each other. The pricing structure could depend on the availability of nearby local renewable power sources, although the idea is in its early stages. Any such system may have to allay concerns that consumers in some parts of the country could receive much higher energy bills than those elsewhere. The consultancy firm Cornwall Insight found 63% of energy industry professionals agreed there was a need for drastic reform of the electricity market. However, 61% were against moving the market towards setting wholesale prices on a local basis because of concerns over disruption to existing and planned investments. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “We’ve just seen the price of offshore UK wind power fall to an all-time low and gas is a shrinking portion of our electricity generating mix, so we need to explore ways of ensuring the electricity market is adapting to the times. “That includes ensuring the cost benefits of our increasing supply of cheaper energy trickle down to consumers, but also that our system is fit for the future – especially with electricity demand set to double by 2035.” Any changes are unlikely to take place until at least late next year. Ministers are still examining the state of the energy market before this winter amid fears a shortage of gas in Europe could cause high prices or a supply squeeze in the UK. Separately on Monday, National Grid released its annual Future Energy Scenarios report, which sets out how the UK can reach its target of net zero carbon by 2050. The company said it wants to run a fully decarbonised electricity system by 2035. It suggested measures including a regional approach to decarbonising residential heating systems; increasing the availability of flexible “time-of-use” tariffs; and improving large-scale geological hydrogen and electricity storage projects."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/04/labour-takes-inspiration-from-cameron-and-osborne-with-two-pronged-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-04T14:00:51Z","webTitle":"Labour takes inspiration from Cameron and Osborne on economic attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/04/labour-takes-inspiration-from-cameron-and-osborne-with-two-pronged-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/nov/04/labour-takes-inspiration-from-cameron-and-osborne-with-two-pronged-strategy","fields":{"headline":"Labour takes inspiration from Cameron and Osborne on economic attack","bodyText":"George Osborne is an unlikely inspiration for Labour strategists but as the party plans the next stage of how to tackle the government’s autumn statement, there is something there from his playbook. Two shadow cabinet ministers said the party can learn from how badly tarnished Labour had been by attacks from David Cameron and Osborne. It was a two-pronged approach, blaming Labour for the economic damage and saying only the Conservatives had a plan. Labour now uses the inverse: the Conservatives “crashed the economy” and it is the party with the long-term economic plan, a favourite phrase of Osborne. But there are some crucial differences that senior officials are keen to underline – Osborne used the ploy as a way to get the public onboard with austerity and to put Labour under pressure to accept spending cuts as a necessity. “This is not about proposing the same solutions, it’s showing we are different, you can trust us on public services, on climate change,” one shadow Treasury source said. “Their answer was austerity but that is not our answer. “Labour will talk about growing the economy because when Labour was in government, we did that before. And it meant that we had better public services and wages were higher.” But as well as growth, questions on tax policy are likely to dominate in the coming months. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are working on a big policy intervention that will be a major overhaul of the tax system, including examining wealth taxes which are likely to form part of the manifesto offer. “Fundamentally, Labour should be looking to completely rebalance the tax system towards wealth and assets,” one shadow minister said. “But the internal work on that is not over.” Economic credibility is the main issue for Starmer and Reeves, and where Sunak has given the Conservatives a boost in the most recent polling. In the latest Opinium survey, the Conservatives have regained a lead as the best party to manage the economy. But Labour are still a healthy 16 points ahead in the polls overall and praise from the Tesco chair, John Allan, that Labour is “the only team on the field” when it came to the growth plan was “like gold dust”, an ally of Reeves said. The party has a “grid” of big endorsements from business leaders and new donors that it hopes to roll out over the next few months. Reeves has been on a non-stop offensive to meet businesses and the party plans a major business conference in early December with a high-level CEO drinks party. Despite the manifesto work being done on tax policy, some Labour MPs feel they risk being left exposed after the autumn statement on the party’s plans for tax rises and spending cuts. There is a nervousness that the changes Labour has actually confirmed are limited to abolishing non-dom status, a new windfall tax and abolishing the charitable status of private schools. The most lucrative – a new windfall tax – is likely to be adopted again by the Conservatives in the autumn statement and Jeremy Hunt is also looking at changes to non-dom status, leaving Labour with little in the tank. “I’ll be slightly concerned if all we have to fund our pledges on free breakfast clubs or NHS workforce is taking a bit off private schools,” one senior MP said. Several of those on the left of the party have been loudly making their own cases for wealth taxes, many of whom are balking at the charm offensive by Reeves and Starmer towards the City of London. There is also no really developed answer for MPs to give on spending cuts – and whether Labour would also need to undertake them. For now, the briefings are to turn the question around and blame 12 years of Conservative policies for making challenging decisions necessary. Reeves is militant on borrowing, all spending pledges have to be hypothecated. One shadow cabinet minister said the party had to be disciplined about only borrowing for investment. “I think the shadow Treasury team are very much still in ‘No’ mode when it comes to big ideas, although I think election pressures will start to change that over the course of the next year,” another shadow cabinet minister said. “But of course it remains a big frustration among colleagues that we have big plans we want to announce but we aren’t given the go ahead.” The other thing worrying some shadow cabinet ministers is the perceived lack of long-term strategy around big fiscal events. When Liz Truss was in No 10, Labour had intended to match the government’s eight supply side reforms with offers of their own, starting with a new policy on low-cost broadband and David Blunkett’s major policy paper on skills, but then – amid the chaos of her government – no further public progress was made on Labour’s own offer. There are tentative plans to launch Gordon Brown’s commission on devolution this month. The proposals – which were leaked to the Guardian this summer – contains radical plans for devolution in Scotland, Wales and English regions as well as constitutional shake-ups such as abolishing the House of Lords. The commission has split the shadow cabinet, several of whom strongly object to some proposals but others would like to see the work given a major platform as part of Labour’s growth plan. “It’s the biggest piece of work Keir has commissioned, it needs a huge platform with Gordon, Keir, speaking alongside all the metro mayors and Scottish and Welsh leaders,” one said. “At the moment, we still seem unsure what exactly we do with it.” But despite some gripes, there is a feeling of growing confidence across most of the party, especially in Starmer. Shadow ministers, who have begun a programme of preparations for government, say they are starting to develop plans for the first 100 days of government, which would include legislation on workers’ rights and plans to press the button on a raft of investments. Reeves previewed what those might be in a speech this week at the Eden Project: carbon capture and storage, electric battery factories, tripling solar power in places such as Cornwall, and kickstarting floating offshore wind. That is part of the “mirror image” strategy, which will contrast with the Osborne blueprint, one senior adviser said. “Whenever we get the space like this, we really need to use it. We have to push really hard our positive plan for growth, to show there is an alternative.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2021/may/10/investing-in-coal-power-would-be-an-expensive-mistake","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2021-05-09T17:30:26Z","webTitle":"Investing in coal power would be an expensive mistake | Trent Zimmerman and Philip Dunne","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/10/investing-in-coal-power-would-be-an-expensive-mistake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2021/may/10/investing-in-coal-power-would-be-an-expensive-mistake","fields":{"headline":"Investing in coal power would be an expensive mistake","bodyText":"Wherever you are on the planet, the last 12 months have been very difficult. In seeking the strongest economic recovery from the pandemic, it is understandable that many on the centre-right in particular want to focus on boosting existing industries. But when it comes to the energy sources of the future, investing in coal power would be an expensive mistake, not just for the environment but for the economy too. The environmental case against coal has been well known for some time – its negative impact on the climate and the quality of the air we breathe is significant and unarguable. There is no doubt that countries continuing to use coal for power are making a material contribution to global warming. At a time when western allies are encouraging big polluters such as China and Russia to clean up their act, it is vital that we lead by example and end our own dependence on fossil fuels. This cannot, of course, happen overnight. The coal industry is an important part of many countries’ economies and a major supplier of power – to end that right away, as some argue, would be to damage livelihoods and access to electricity. But by taking prudent decisions now, we can transition our power supply away from coal without inflicting that harm on people’s lives. As well as being environmentally damaging, coal is no longer the energy panacea that it used to be. Indeed, rapid growth of renewable energy sources has rendered coal uncompetitive and expensive. Alternative, cleaner options for generating electricity such as solar and wind have plummeted in cost over the past decade, whereas the price of coal has stayed flat. If – as expected – these trends continue then it will not be long until coal is the most expensive mainstream power option. Relying on coal means not just higher electricity costs at home, but drastically reduced international trade potential with key export markets now committed to phasing it out altogether. The UK has enjoyed a remarkable and rapid transition away from coal power in recent years, with accelerating growth in renewables replacing the “dash for gas” of the 1990s and driving coal down from 40% of electricity generation as recently as 2012, to just 2% now. The national electricity grid regularly goes for whole weeks at a time without any recourse to coal at all, and by 2024-2025 coal generation will have disappeared completely from the country that pioneered coal power in the industrial revolution. While it is true to say that Australia’s reliance on coal for both power generation and energy exports is much greater than the UK’s, the risks of becoming even more reliant on it now are huge. At a time when so much of the world is seeking to abandon fossil fuels, we are on the cusp of a major global tipping point towards zero carbon alternatives. Those arguing for new investments in coal ignore this reality but, perhaps more significantly, risk delaying the transition for those currently employed by the thermal coal industry. Offering false hope will just make that transition harder and more costly for those whose livelihoods have depended on the sector. New investment in the coal industry will leave investors, including taxpayers, with vast stranded assets and a missed opportunity to invest in the high growth technologies of the future. Those nations which continue to evade the opportunity to clean up their power generation are risking not just reputational damage on the international stage, but the very real prospect of carbon taxes hitting their exports as other countries seek to drive down carbon emissions beyond their own borders. It does not have to be this way, and there is a more prosperous and cleaner alternative path available. The UK has enormous capacity, as the government recognises, to increase its energy supply from offshore wind. Australia too has vast potential for wind and solar power – and while federal and state governments, the private sector and households are deploying renewables at record rates, this potential is yet to be fully realised. Where clean power alternatives do not currently exist – for example in steel production – Australia is well placed to be a world leader on green hydrogen power and could show the UK, which is currently wrestling with how to produce steel in an environmentally friendly way, how this can be achieved. In reality, both countries need to focus on incentivising technological breakthroughs to give them the kickstart to commercial viability, rather than propping up industries that ultimately face terminal decline. A green recovery would be good for jobs too. The UK is adding jobs in the low-carbon sector at two to three times the rate of the economy as a whole, and these jobs are sustainable jobs in high-growth areas, and much more likely to be in post-industrial parts of the country that have high unemployment rates. By backing renewable energy and setting out a plan for using it to replace coal in the electrification of transport and industry, Australia too can create thousands of jobs – many of them highly skilled – across the whole country. Post the pandemic, we face some big choices on how to fire up our economies again. If we choose right, we will create a future that is both environmentally and economically sustainable. Let’s get on with it. • Rt Hon Philip Dunne is the UK Conservative MP for Ludlow and chair of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee • Trent Zimmerman MP is Australia’s Liberal federal member for North Sydney"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2021/nov/03/indias-huge-uptake-in-solar-is-driving-more-ambitious-climate-goals-says-minister","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-03T13:01:30Z","webTitle":"India’s huge solar uptake has boosted climate goals, says minister","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/03/indias-huge-uptake-in-solar-is-driving-more-ambitious-climate-goals-says-minister","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/nov/03/indias-huge-uptake-in-solar-is-driving-more-ambitious-climate-goals-says-minister","fields":{"headline":"India’s huge solar uptake has boosted climate goals, says minister","bodyText":"The staggering take-up of solar power in India has enabled the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to announce a more ambitious climate plan at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow, according to the country’s foreign secretary. India’s commitment to get half of its energy from renewables and to reach net zero by 2070 was arguably the most positive news from the opening phase of the UN gathering. Some tried to portray this as the successful result of international pressure, diplomatic arm-twisting by the UK host and still-unfulfilled promises of financial support, but senior Indian officials said the decision was based on practical domestic considerations, in particular the unexpectedly fast expansion of photovoltaic energy. “We voluntarily and unilaterally enhanced our commitments,” the foreign secretary, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, said. “It was very, very carefully thought through and considered.” He said the take-up of solar power had been so quick that India’s original target of adding 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022 was on course to be achieved. In response, the government had first upped the target to 450GW, and now, in Modi’s speech, to 500GW. This was encouraging news, because it suggested the price and popularity of the technology was driving the pace of change far faster than planned by the government, which continues to support coal power. Shringla said it had put the 2070 net zero target in sight. “We have consistently met our targets and surpassed them,” he said. “These are the stepping stones for us to reach that net zero figure.” He predicted the gap between India’s peak emissions and net zero would prove the smallest of any country. As an example of the spread of solar, he said he had recently seen many remote homes along the Brahmaputra river with photovoltaic panels, which residents had chosen because that was the cheapest and best way to power their homes, which were not otherwise connected to the grid. On a macro level, the government plans to upgrade its energy infrastructure further and joined the UK and other countries this week in unveiling plans for a global network of interconnected solar power plants that could ensure the world is powered by sunlight. The One Sun, One World, One Grid plan envisages more investment and regulations to encourage cross-border transmission lines and shared renewable energy. Until now, Shringla said India had funded its own expansion of clean energy. “We have to do what we do for our own country, our own people and future generations,” he said. But he emphasised that greater finance was needed to hasten the process in India and other developing nations. The question, he said, was the amount of support. “It is clear that it is not in the billions, but in the trillions of dollars.” This did not all have to be grants, he said; it could also be zero- or low-interest concessional loans that help developing countries invest in renewables. • This article was amended on 16 November 2021. In an earlier version, foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was indirectly quoted as saying India had a target of adding 175 gigawatts of capacity by 2030. This should have referred to a target of an extra 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by 2022."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/apr/27/berlin-cools-pools-in-political-statement-against-russian-gas","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-27T13:16:28Z","webTitle":"Berlin cools pools in ‘political statement’ against Russian gas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/berlin-cools-pools-in-political-statement-against-russian-gas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/apr/27/berlin-cools-pools-in-political-statement-against-russian-gas","fields":{"headline":"Berlin cools pools in ‘political statement’ against Russian gas","bodyText":"Berlin’s outdoor swimming pools will be two degrees chillier this summer than in previous years, in what the state operator says is its contribution towards reducing German reliance on Russian gas. Water at the German capital’s 16 gas-heated Sommerbäder, or lidos, which start to open this week, will be kept below the weather-dependent standard temperature throughout the summer season. Three pools heated by solar power, in the districts of Gropiusstadt, Mariendorf and Pankow, will remain as warm as usual. Last summer the average water temperature in Berlin’s outdoor swimming pools was between 22C and 24C. “We have made this decision because we wanted to make a contribution to the reduction of gas imports”, said a spokesperson for Berliner Bäder-Betriebe, Europe’s largest communal pool operator. The spokesperson said the lowered temperatures were not a cost-cutting measure driven by increased gas prices but a “political statement” coordinated with the Berlin senate. In a related political gesture, Berlin’s public baths have been free to use for holders of Ukrainian passports since March. Vladimir Putin’s war of aggression in Ukraine has exposed Germany’s reliance on the import of Russian natural gas, which has increased over the last decade in spite of warnings from east-central European and Baltic states that the Kremlin could use its energy resources as a geopolitical tool. The German minster for economic affairs and climate action, Robert Habeck, has vowed to wean the country off Russian coal by the autumn and cut reliance on Russian oil within the coming days, pending a supply deal with Poland. Foregoing deliveries of Russian natural gas, which covered 55% of Germany’s gas needs in 2021, will probably take until mid-2024, however. Outdoor swimming is a popular summertime leisure activity in Berlin, whose population is accustomed to a long and freezing winter but sweltering summer months. Some legendary lidos, such as Kreuzberg’s Prinzenbad, have featured in films such as the 2003 comedy Herr Lehmann (released in English as Berlin Blues) and the 2007 documentary Prinzessinenbad (Bath of Princesses). The public pool on the shores of Wannsee lake in Berlin’s west was the subject of the 1950s pop song Pack die Badehose ein (Pack Your Swimming Trunks). The city’s open-air swimming pools drew 2 million visitors in 2018, though the annual number of swimmers dropped to 1 million in the first year of the pandemic as pools and lidos restricted admissions in keeping with hygiene restrictions. As the water in the Berlin’s pools offers brisk refreshment this summer, it remains to be seen whether swimmers will instead opt for a front crawl in one of the hundreds of non-heated but freely accessible lakes that dot the surrounding countryside."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2022/apr/01/prince-andrew-facing-calls-to-explain-1m-payments-linked-to-high-court-case","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-01T22:21:57Z","webTitle":"Prince Andrew facing calls to explain £1m payments linked to high court fraud case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/01/prince-andrew-facing-calls-to-explain-1m-payments-linked-to-high-court-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2022/apr/01/prince-andrew-facing-calls-to-explain-1m-payments-linked-to-high-court-case","fields":{"headline":"Prince Andrew facing calls to explain £1m payments linked to high court fraud case","bodyText":"Prince Andrew is facing calls to explain why he received £1m in payments linked to a financier who is now facing allegations of fraud in the high court. The Duke of York, who is already embroiled in controversy after settling a US sexual assault case for up to £12m, is named alongside his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, in a ruling on a dispute between a Turkish woman and businessman. In 2019, Andrew received £750,000 from Nebahat Isbilen, a Turkish millionaire and wife of a former leading politician, who has claimed in the high court that she was told by her financial adviser Selman Turk to pay the sum to the prince in return for assistance with a passport application. Turk was the founder and chief executive of Heyman AI, a digital challenger bank which, nine days before the payment, received an award from Andrew at a Pitch@Palace event – a Dragons’ Den-style project for entrepreneurs created by the duke. Isbilen’s court case against Andrew has led to the uncovering of further payments of up to £350,000 to the duke from a company called Alphabet, described by solicitors as “a fraudulent and covert front” to make payments to those “associated” with Turk. Ferguson also received payments of at least £225,000 from Turk via Alphabet Capital, said to be in connection with payment she was owed for her work with a solar power company. There is no suggestion in the court documents of any wrongdoing by the prince or Ferguson. Andrew declined to comment while Ferguson’s spokesperson said she had been unaware of the allegations against Turk. Andrew repaid the £750,000 roughly 16 months after he received it and it remains unclear whether he was aware of the money entering his personal bank account, or what it was for. On Friday night the Daily Telegraph reported that the payment of £750,000 was described to bankers as a wedding gift for Princess Beatrice. Princess Eugenie was also allegedly paid £25,000 on the orders of Turk. Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment. Graham Smith, the chief executive of Republic, which calls for the dissolution of the monarchy, said Andrew should be clear about why he thought the money had been paid to him. “Quite clearly it raises a lot of questions about what was going on, what the relationship was between this person at Pitch@Palace and Andrew,” he said. “It’s not credible he had no knowledge of it and wasn’t aware it was paid in. So why didn’t he immediately raise questions and pay it back? He needs to be completely clear and honest about exactly what was going on.” Pitch@Palace involved entrepreneurs presenting pitches lasting no more than three minutes to a room at St James’s Palace filled with “CEOs, influencers, angels, mentors and business partners”. In 2019, Turk’s company, Heyman AI, won the people’s choice award, which is voted for by the audience. The company went bust about 18 months later. In her witness statement to the court, translated from Turkish and seen by the Guardian, Isbilen, 77, said Turk invited her to the event and she attended. “I can only wonder if there is any connection between this event and the Duke of York transfer,” she states. A “particulars of claim” document for the case against Turk, seen by the Guardian, says: “In or around November 2019, Mr Turk told Mrs Isbilen that she needed to make a purported ‘gift’ of £750,000 to HRH Duke of York by way of payment for assistance that he told her HRH Duke of York had provided in relation to Mrs Isbilen’s Turkish passport.” The document claims the passport suggestion was a ruse. It continues: “The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gift to HRH Duke of York in connection with her passport (or for any other purpose) was false, and Mr Turk made it dishonestly, knowing it to be false and intending Mrs Isbilen to rely on it.’ In the ruling, Judge Halpern QC said a lawyer representing Isbilen had said, in an affidavit, that information had emerged to show evidence given by Turk was “misleading”. He said the solicitor, Jonathan Tickner, had told him how evidence showed that “money was used for purposes unconnected with Mrs Isbilen, eg substantial sums were paid to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and to Sarah, Duchess of York”. The claim is part of a wider ongoing case against Turk, and various businesses associated with him, in the high court for the return of an estimated £40m. Isbilen said she had trusted Turk as her financial adviser. She claimed she was fleeing political persecution in Turkey. Her husband, the former deputy leader of the ruling AK party, was imprisoned in 2015 after an attempted coup in Turkey. Ferguson’s case is she received the funds from Turk’s business after he took on a debt owed to her by Pegasus, a solar power company, which owed her payment for her role as ambassador for the firm. Her spokesperson said: “The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him.” A spokesperson for Andrew said: “We are unable to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.” The Guardian has approached Turk for comment. Another court document, dated April 2021, says Turk disputes Isbilen’s allegations: “He disagrees with her portrayal of the facts, including as to her understanding of the various dealings with her assets. He states that much of what has happened is the result of Mrs Isbilen’s status as a politically exposed person and the consequential difficulty in dealing with her assets.” The revelations come after the prince settled a sex assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum, reported to be as much as £12m. The out-of-court settlement in the US civil case means the prince makes no admission of guilt over claims by Giuffre that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. On Tuesday, Andrew made his public appearance since the settlement, alongside his mother the Queen at a memorial service for his father, Prince Philip."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-21T09:00:25Z","webTitle":"‘We have not recovered’: Puerto Rico’s water supply remains vulnerable to hurricane fury","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/21/puerto-rico-hurricane-fiona-drinking-water","fields":{"headline":"‘We have not recovered’: Puerto Rico’s water supply remains vulnerable to hurricane fury","bodyText":"Hurricane Fiona was the second time José Oyola Ríos served as an emergency drinking water provider, after gusting winds and heavy rains battered Puerto Rico on Sunday, causing mass flooding and power outages. Oyola Ríos serves as a community leader in rural, inland Caguas, in the central mountain range, where he maintains water tanks that store thousands of gallons, known in the area as the “community oasis”. When Hurricane María battered the island in 2017, hundreds of residents from surrounding towns would drive up the mountainous road to Caguas to get a few gallons of water. Almost exactly five years later, Oyola Ríos activated his plan once again to distribute potable water to communities left without running water after deadly Hurricane Fiona passed through as a Category 1 storm in the Atlantic hurricane season and swept on with its destructive path towards other Caribbean communities. “These atmospheric events demonstrate that we haven’t been able to recover,” Oyola Ríos told the Guardian, adding that Fiona “aggravated that reality”. Slow progress in modernizing Puerto Rico’s water infrastructure has left many residents reliving the trauma experienced when the Category 5 María devastated the 3 million-strong US territory. Several water filtration systems across the island were inoperable post-Fiona due to turbidity or electrical failures, leaving thousands with an interrupted service because of flooding and outages. More than 760,000 customers were still without water service on Tuesday morning, according to the government’s portal. More than half of the water authority’s dams and filtration plants were affected by the hurricane, the president of the Puerto Rico aqueduct and sewer authority, Doriel Pagán, said at a press conference. Water pumps across the island also depend on electricity to distribute water in elevated areas. Pagán said the water authority continues to place power generators across their systems. In preparation for the latest hurricane, many residents stocked up on water, canned food, medication and other essentials. It’s unclear how long customers now without utilities will remain without power or water, and whether supplies at home will last. “This is where a family’s judgment comes in,” said Adamaris Quiñones Rodríguez, president of Puerto Rico water &amp; environment association, a non-profit that focuses on promoting infrastructure rehabilitation. “You might sacrifice a cleaning task in order to have enough water to drink or bathe with.” Yeseida Garay Cotto, 36, lives in Caguas and depends on a well to obtain potable water because the official water service doesn’t reach her house. When the storm hit on Sunday, all she could hear for hours were rocks tumbling that came from several hillside collapses caused by the torrential downpour. One of the collapses damaged the well’s pipeline that she, her family and several others in the community depend on. “We don’t have much clean water, so we’re using the rainwater to wash the dishes and stuff like that,” Garay Cotto told the Guardian. “We have some water we can drink, which should last until we can fix the well.” In contrast, the island is also prone to severe droughts, further necessitating water infrastructure fit for purpose. Puerto Rico’s latest drought was as recent as this summer, when water sources and reservoirs in the north-eastern part of the island were particularly low. Some of the reservoirs leak, which the water authority proposed to fix, and water rationing was mandated. But community leaders like Oyola Ríos lamented that the system is still operating with a vulnerable electricity grid and flawed water system. The US government’s federal emergency management agency (Fema) assigned about $13.2bn for the recovery of the electrical grid after Hurricane María. Only $40m of those funds have been disbursed so far, Anne Bink, associate administrator of the Office of Response and Recovery at Fema, told a congressional hearing last Thursday. “While the start could have been faster, we’re starting to see that pivot toward more work, more shovels in the ground,” she said. Obtaining safe drinking water can be arduous after an atmospheric event of the scope of hurricane. People must disinfect their water supply by boiling it or using liquid chlorine bleach. Hurricane María exposed the threat of drinking contaminated water after 26 people died of leptospirosis – a potentially deadly bacterial disease largely spread by rats. Ironically, people who lived closer to a large canal had a higher risk of being infected, a study led by researchers at the Yale school of public health found. José Ríos Meléndez oversees a group of community aqueducts that provide potable water to areas with unstable water systems. He said he saw a spike in the construction of such fixtures, especially after Luma Energy, a Canadian-American private company, took over Puerto Rico’s energy transmission and distribution system in 2021. But frequent power outages in the last year have left communities which rely on electricity to operate the pumps without an efficient water system, as well as basics like lighting and refrigeration, where many store medication as well as food. Disruptions have been accompanied by repeated increases in electricity bills. Hundreds of protesters gathered last month to demand the cancellation of the contract of Luma Energy, leading to violent clashes with police. More than 240 community aqueducts, equipped with tanks that hold thousands of gallons of water, are scattered around the island and supply water to thousands of people, and more than 100 of these systems run on solar power. Many Puerto Ricans are switching to solar for residences and businesses. Oyola Ríos believes solar energy is an efficient choice, especially as storms become more frequent and fierce. “If I didn’t had solar panels, I wouldn’t have been able to operate,” Oyola Ríos said. “Even with a power generator, there’s a low supply of diesel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/aug/16/labour-to-push-energy-price-cap-policy-in-campaign-blitz","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-16T05:00:49Z","webTitle":"Labour to push energy price cap policy in campaign blitz","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/aug/16/labour-to-push-energy-price-cap-policy-in-campaign-blitz","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/aug/16/labour-to-push-energy-price-cap-policy-in-campaign-blitz","fields":{"headline":"Labour to push energy price cap policy in campaign blitz","bodyText":"Labour is planning a campaigning blitz in order to take ownership of its new energy price cap policy in case the next Tory leader bows to pressure and cancels the 80% rise expected in October. Keir Starmer has vowed that his party “wouldn’t let people pay a penny more” on their gas and electricity bills this winter, proposing freezing the price cap at current levels and preventing the average household bill from reaching £3,600. Senior sources said the party had limited time to get out its message before the next Tory leader, presumed to be Liz Truss, enters No 10. The new prime minister will need to produce a comprehensive package on the cost of living, despite Truss’s reticence to spell out how she would help beyond tax cuts. Labour will increase efforts to promote its policy in the coming days, including with digital adverts, campaign tools for local parties and with direct mail for MPs to use. Plans for the summer offensive have been in the works since mid-July. Over the coming weeks, the party will set out more on its energy policy offer, including plans to upgrade 19m homes to make them more energy efficient, double onshore and offshore wind capacity and triple solar power. Starmer has said Labour’s plan, funded in part by an expanded windfall tax, is the radical approach needed to help households and reduce inflation, contrasting it with the inaction of a “lame duck” government. “We asked ourselves: do we want a plan that allows those prices to go up, causes that anxiety, and then rebates some people after the event, but doesn’t do anything about inflation, or do we want to be more radical, more bold, more ambitious?” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “One of the benefits of our proposal is that it brings inflation down, which benefits everybody, but particularly those who are most vulnerable, and those who are least well off.” Sources close to Starmer say plans for the party conference will need to be adapted on the basis of what the new prime minister announces in the first weeks in office, especially if there is an early emergency budget. Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economics thinktank, has queried whether Labour’s plan would help greatly with inflation, saying the rate would go up again once the energy subsidy ended. Starmer will visit marginal seats across the country almost every day of the coming fortnight, while the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will visit Scotland to outline how Labour’s plans compare with the SNP’s. “We are working with the assumption Liz Truss is going to do a big offer on energy – we are assuming that what she says now is fairly different to what she will do,” one senior Labour source said. “She will do what is politically salient. So we need to make sure we look like we are winning the argument now.” Senior Labour politicians will increase calls for the Tory candidates to outline their plans faster. Before the first Conservative hustings in Scotland, in Perth on Tuesday evening, Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary, issued a call for the candidates to set out their cost of living packages before the price cap announcement on 26 August. “If this was a banking crisis, the government would act. If this was a war, the government would act,” he said. “Tonight, in their hustings, the candidates must immediately clarify whether they agree with Labour’s proposals. And if not, what their alternative proposals are. The British people deserve answers, not more delay from a distracted and out-of-touch Conservative government.” Momentum, the leftwing grassroots group that has often been at loggerheads with Starmer, issued a statement backing Labour’s plan on Monday night, though it said it should extend to full-scale nationalisation. Hilary Schan, a Momentum co-chair, said: “Labour should be arguing for public ownership, at a fraction of the price. It’s the commonsense solution, backed by most voters, and the best way to keep soaring bills down.” Reeves told TalkTV on Monday night that she remained sceptical of full-scale nationalisation, although she did not think the energy sector was “working today”. She added: “The whole point of the package we’ve put together today is that every single penny of it will go directly to lowering people’s bills.” Starmer has faced criticism for the time it has taken for Labour to put out its plan. A week ago the Liberal Democrats said the energy price cap rise should be stopped, and the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown set out his own plan for the crisis. Starmer told BBC One’s Breakfast programme that his team had been working on the plan for more than six weeks. He added: “I’m not going to apologise for going on holiday with my kids. It’s the first time we’ve had a real holiday for about three years.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/jul/07/anti-green-mp-steve-baker-considering-running-for-pm-if-boris-johnson-goes","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-07T09:23:45Z","webTitle":"Anti-green MP Steve Baker considering running for PM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jul/07/anti-green-mp-steve-baker-considering-running-for-pm-if-boris-johnson-goes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/jul/07/anti-green-mp-steve-baker-considering-running-for-pm-if-boris-johnson-goes","fields":{"headline":"Anti-green MP Steve Baker considering running for PM","bodyText":"Steve Baker is considering running for prime minister, and if he won he would dismantle many of Boris Johnson’s green policies, the MP has said. The MP for High Wycombe, who runs the European Research Group which is credited for achieving a hard Brexit, has often hinted at his antipathy towards green measures, once retweeting a report that claimed the climate crisis is not happening. He said many green measures including paying farmers to help the environment were “anti-human life on Earth in the name of environmentalism”, and said he would expand the production of gas in this country because there is “no short-term threat” from the climate crisis. “I’ve got sufficient people imploring me to stand, so I’ve got to think about it seriously myself,” he said about entering the race in the likely event Johnson is ousted. Other politicians are aghast at the idea that a climate crisis culture war could become part of any leadership election. The Green MP, Caroline Lucas, said: “Our climate can’t be a pawn in the Tory leadership psychodrama.” She added that a prime minister with Baker’s views “would be a disaster of incalculable proportions”. Baker was speaking to the Guardian after an event in parliament hosted by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a thinktank that has been labelled one of the UK’s leading sources of climate scepticism, and of which Baker is a trustee. He said he would end the push for more wind and solar power, explaining: “They are fundamentally intermittent sources of energy. And therefore if we’re going to maintain our standard of living and in particularly industry, we’ve got to cover those intermittent sources with something else.” Instead, he would increase the country’s use and domestic production of gas, though conceded he would support carbon capture and storage. “I think if the public found that they got discount gas on their energy bills because they had accepted shale gas extraction near their homes, I think that would be extremely popular with them,” Baker said. He said a local Indian restaurant in his constituency was struggling with its energy bills, adding that it may have to close if prices do not go down. “If that’s the price of our literal survival in the short run, people would understand that but the truth is, we’re not in any danger in the short run,” he said. Measures to stop wildlife becoming extinct, and to store carbon in the land would also be under threat if Baker became prime minister. He would run on a platform to reverse plans to pay farmers to conserve the environment rather than produce food, he said. “What I want are policies that can feed us all,” he said, adding: “That does include actually growing food as a thing that we do in the UK. And I’m afraid some of the policies which are being adopted are just anti-life. They’re anti-human life on Earth in the name of environmentalism, and I want us to live flourishing and full lives with a healthy environment around us.” The MP said “we are at risk from extreme green policies” and accused climate campaigners of “terrifying children”. “I regard that as child abuse, it’s wrong.” He does not believe the high emissions scenarios presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are likely to happen. “High emissions scenarios are too often presented as a likely outcome,” he said, adding: “I used to manage risk as an aerospace engineer, and if a risk is catastrophic and frequent you’d better do something about it now. But if a risk is catastrophic and infinitesimally likely, then you just don’t do anything about it because it won’t happen.” His views do not match those of climate scientists. The third IPCC report, which was compiled by hundreds of scientists over several years and signed off by most of the world’s governments, calls for action now to avoid climate catastrophes. It warned that planetary warming of 1.5C was out of reach unless greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2025, and said temperatures would soar to more than 3C, with catastrophic consequences, unless policies and actions were urgently strengthened."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2022/oct/06/light-fantastic-bps-solar-venture-launches-biggest-uk-project-yet","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-06T09:37:30Z","webTitle":"Light fantastic: BP’s solar venture launches biggest UK project yet","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/oct/06/light-fantastic-bps-solar-venture-launches-biggest-uk-project-yet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2022/oct/06/light-fantastic-bps-solar-venture-launches-biggest-uk-project-yet","fields":{"headline":"Light fantastic: BP’s solar venture launches biggest UK project yet","bodyText":"“He’s scaring me now,” laughs Mark Davis, as a menacing-looking ram takes a step towards him from underneath an angled solar panel. The burly operations manager is touring Manor Farm near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire, where sheep are using the solar arrays for shade and a remote-controlled cleaning robot with the appearance of a mini tank steadily sloshes water down the panels. A persistent hairdryer-like hum comes from the huge boxy green inverter, which converts the direct current electricity that the panels generate to the alternating current used by the electrical grid. This is one of about 270 solar farms that have been developed by Lightsource BP in the UK. The company – a joint venture between its founder, Nick Boyle, and the oil supermajor BP – is, by some measures, the world’s largest solar developer. It is an industry in the spotlight amid a push for energy security, an increase in consumer demand and a row over the use of land. Against this backdrop, Lightsource BP is pursuing an aggressive global expansion plan – it will be present in 20 countries by the end of the year – and, the Guardian can reveal, has just pushed the button on its largest UK project to date. Construction will begin at the vast Tiln Farm development in Nottinghamshire next month. When complete, it will have a maximum output of 61 megawatts of power. The development is part of plans to increase Lightsource’s near-6GW output to 25GW by 2025 – or enough to power 19m homes – revised up from an original target of 10GW by 2024. Its many projects include the sprawling Woolooga scheme in north-east Australia and Europe’s largest floating solar farm on the Queen Elizabeth II reservoir south-west of London. In the long term, it has 55GW in its project pipeline. The firm also plans to expand its battery storage operations rapidly, typically sited alongside solar farms. It is an ambitious vision devised by Boyle, who cut his teeth in financial services before founding Lightsource in 2010. Since then, the venture has grown from a tiny operation with six staff to a 900-strong workforce. At Manor Farm, a large group in orange hi-vis jackets studiously examine the site. Every six weeks, a trip is bussed in as the hundreds of new employees hired during the pandemic get a first-hand look at its operations. “The big advantage with solar is its simplicity,” Boyle says, speaking on a videocall from the company’s London headquarters. “The sun comes up and then it’s simply a chemical reaction.” Boyle argues that soaring energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have underlined the case for the technology. “The price [to generate] solar is exactly the same today, and will be the same tomorrow because we have no feedstock; it’s free. It comes up every morning and goes down every night.” These low costs have prompted calls for a windfall tax on generators, as wholesale electricity prices are tied to the soaring sums paid for gas. Boyle insists Lightsource BP has not seen any windfall gains. “We still sell out the electricity at the same price because ours tend to be on long-term power purchase agreements,” he says. This locked-in income offers security for future investments, which are also funded by selling older solar projects. Lightsource’s last accounts, for 2020, show losses of £42m – flat on the previous year – on turnover up almost £8m at £62.6m. “We’re definitely in the growth stage, which is why the profit looks the way it does. We make no apology for that fact … you can’t reinvest and expect to make bumper profits, too.” Last year Lightsource secured £1.3bn of extra financing from 10 global institutions and Boyle said there are no plans to tap BP for funds. The oil producer, valued at £79bn, paid about £150m for a 43% stake in the business in 2017 – after six years away from solar power. It increased its holding to a 50/50 joint venture two years later. BP’s return to solar and its recent marketing drive for renewable energy investments have drawn accusations of greenwashing. Boyle spoke alongside the BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, when, in early 2020, he announced company targets to hit net zero by 2050 to great fanfare. Some believe the oil firm should be more ambitious, while others, notably certain City investors, were concerned for its profits before this year’s Ukraine-fuelled windfalls. Boyle argues that Looney has “grabbed the bull by the horns” on the energy switch. “There’s a marriage between different forms of technology – there’s a transition from where we’ve been to where we’re ultimately going, it’s not flicking a switch,” Boyle says. “We were sort of expecting an arrogance [from BP] of ‘we’re 100 years old, and you’re this little minnow’ and it just never materialised at all. We’ve found them nothing but supportive … they’ve let us run our business.” For households, demand for solar panels has boomed as the economics of the investment have made greater sense. Boyle says that, while he is not competing with smaller domestic suppliers, materials and shipping costs have risen. In the US, solar firms’ share prices have soared. On her campaign trail, Liz Truss reheated a long-running debate, suggesting: “What we shouldn’t be doing is putting solar panels on productive land.” Boyle rejects that argument. “Flicking a switch and a light coming on should be a priority,” he says. “I don’t believe that prime agricultural land needs to be used by any stretch of the imagination.” Since becoming prime minister, Truss appears to have softened her stance around some green technologies, notably relaxing the rules on onshore windfarms. There are plenty of signs agriculture and solar are not mutually exclusive. Last week, the Spanish power giant Iberdrola began a pilot in a vineyard in central Spain where trackers are employed to move the solar panels to provide the right levels of shade to improve the quality of the grapes. Looking down at the stony, inhospitable ground at Manor Farm, it is easy to see why this field suits its unlikely bedfellows: hi-tech solar and sheltering sheep."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/dec/23/2022-in-review-is-this-the-year-australia-faced-its-climate-reckoning","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-12-22T14:00:38Z","webTitle":"2022 in review: is this the year Australia faced its climate reckoning?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/23/2022-in-review-is-this-the-year-australia-faced-its-climate-reckoning","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/dec/23/2022-in-review-is-this-the-year-australia-faced-its-climate-reckoning","fields":{"headline":"2022 in review: is this the year Australia faced its climate reckoning?","bodyText":"The year 2022 is likely to be seen as one in which Australians started to act as though the climate and environmental crises are not just abstract ideas that mostly happen somewhere else or in the distant future. A political reckoning The country finally had its long-promised climate election, and it was emphatic. Social research indicates climate concern helped drive swings from the Coalition to Labor in some areas, and from the major parties to “teal” independents and the Greens in others. It followed long-term campaigns by the conservation movement and some political candidates to frame tackling the climate crisis as an opportunity, not just a cost. According to work by Rebecca Huntley, a social researcher, it was the first time extreme weather events – specifically, the black summer bushfires and catastrophic floods in northern New South Wales and Brisbane – clearly changed votes. The new Labor government immediately lifted the country’s minimum 2030 emissions reduction target from 26% to 43% (compared with 2005 levels ) and pushed through modest, but symbolically significant, climate change legislation. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, began work on policies to cut emissions from major industry, drive the uptake of electric vehicles, create an offshore wind energy industry and reach an 82% share of renewable electricity by the end of the decade. Some details, including a revamp of the Tony Abbott-era safeguard mechanism and a review of a controversial carbon credit scheme, are due early in the new year. Experts say the new policies will need to be ambitious. While a significant improvement, Labor’s climate goals do not yet live up to what scientists say is necessary, or the government’s rallying rhetoric on the global stage. The damage done, and to come The floods that wrecked Lismore and surrounding areas in northern New South Wales and engulfed central Brisbane in February caused multiple deaths and billions of dollars worth of damage to homes and infrastructure. They were also just the start. Australia’s eastern seaboard was thumped throughout the year as a third-consecutive La Nina over the Pacific Ocean helped drive unprecedented rain in many areas, including the country’s biggest city, Sydney. Scientists said while rising atmospheric emissions did not cause the wet conditions, they loaded the dice, making it more likely heavy rain would have a major impact. For every 1C of global heating, the atmosphere can hold 7% more moisture and Australia is nearly 1.5C hotter than in pre-industrial times. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Adaptation remains an under-discussed part of the climate equation in Australia, but the floods prompted fresh warnings that parts of the country may become uninsurable and raised questions about whether it is wise to rebuild on floodplains and in cyclone-prone areas in the north. The banking regulator cautiously weighed in, suggesting big banks could become unwilling to lend to households and businesses in the most at-risk areas as climate losses escalate. Nature in freefall. Can it be fixed? A five-year government report on the state of the environment, finished in 2021 but not released until after Labor was elected, set out evidence that the country’s natural heritage is in poor and deteriorating health due to the climate crisis, habitat loss, invasive species, pollution, mining – and generally being taken for granted by its custodians. Hundreds of species, including the koala and many less charismatic plants and animals, have been newly listed as threatened over the past decade. Hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest and other ecological sites continue to be cleared. Nineteen ecosystems were said to be showing signs of collapse or near collapse. The shocking report card followed years of deep cuts at the federal environment department, hundreds of recovery plans for threatened species not being completed and governments prioritising development over conservation. Environmental offsets used to justify project approvals have often been inadequately designed and sometimes just not delivered. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has acknowledged the scale of the challenge and promised to act. She set a zero extinction target and plans a major overhaul of environment laws, including the introduction of a national environment protection agency, next year. The design will be important. The science and politics of reef protection The world’s largest reef system suffered through a fourth mass bleaching event in seven years, with aerial surveys showing almost no reefs unaffected across a 1,200km stretch. It was the first time mass bleaching had occurred in a La Niña year, when temperatures are generally cooler. The response was familiar: denial from a vocal minority in the media; government funding to address local factors, including pollution from farms; acknowledgment that the 2,300 reef system is in strife unless global heating is more rapidly addressed. As always, the health of the 2,300 reef system is a complicated story. The Australia Institute of Marine Science later reported the reef’s north and central areas had the highest levels of coral in 36 years. But scientists urged caution in interpreting the results, warning they could be short lived, as the fast growing corals that have driven the increase were most at risk from heatwaves, storms and the crown-of-thorns starfish. In November, it was revealed a UN-backed mission had found the reef should be placed on a list of world heritage sites “in danger”. Plibersek said the government was doing more than its predecessor to protect the landmark, and would fight against the change in 2023. Reasons to be hopeful: renewable energy The bright news on climate action in Australia continues to be the rapid uptake of renewable energy, which is booming despite the previous federal government’s attempts to slow it down. Solar, wind and hydro energy provided little more than 20% of electricity on the east coast three years ago; over the past year it has been 35%, and over the past month 43%. Solar power, in particular, has grown at an extraordinary pace, both from regional solar farms and on rooftops. More than 3m Australian households have solar panels. Their cheap supply in the middle of the day is quickly cutting short the life of old, failing coal plants. State government renewable energy policies are expected to accelerate the transition. There are challenges in this – the grid needs a massive expansion of energy storage and interconnection to ensure a reliable and secure supply. Multi-billion dollar “rewiring the nation” deals between Canberra and some states – including a $7.8bn pledge this week with NSW – and a recent agreement to effectively underwrite new batteries and other forms of storage should help. Reasons to ask questions: fossil fuels The flipside to this optimism is that the coal and gas export industries continue to expand, with new projects likely to come before the government for approval. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fossil fuel prices skyward. The fallout is adding to a cost-of-living crisis for Australian consumers and led to a heated showdown between the government and the gas industry, which resisted steps to curtail its war profits until parliament stepped in. The boom times for fossil fuel companies won’t last for ever, but has created a burst of industry enthusiasm for projects previously considered unlikely to go ahead. Government data shows there are now 118 coal and gas developments in the “investment pipeline”, more than a year ago. Many won’t progress – 80 are at feasibility stage or earlier – but some are likely to be submitted for federal approval next year. Other decisions are already pending. Labor has tried to walk a line on fossil fuels, promising to drive emissions cuts at home but not prevent new gas and coal exports that have private financial backing and meet on-ground environmental standards. It is an illogical stance, in part because export developments also release pollution within Australia. Bowen ended the year rejecting industry claims that gas is a “transition fuel” or “low emissions” while saying its flexibility makes it a useful “background” supporting energy source. A big question for the government next year will be the extent to which its policies reflect this by deterring new fossil fuel developments, given they appear unlikely to explicitly rule them out."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/14/western-australia-to-become-coal-free-by-2030-with-muja-power-station-to-be-shut-down","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-14T22:01:14Z","webTitle":"Western Australia to shut state-owned coal plants by 2030","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/14/western-australia-to-become-coal-free-by-2030-with-muja-power-station-to-be-shut-down","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/14/western-australia-to-become-coal-free-by-2030-with-muja-power-station-to-be-shut-down","fields":{"headline":"Western Australia to shut state-owned coal plants by 2030","bodyText":"The Western Australian government will shut its last coal-fired power unit before the end of the decade and spend an extra half a billion dollars to foster new jobs for displaced workers, the state government said. Later this year, the first of the state-owned 854-megawatt Muja power station’s units near Collie, south of Perth, will close, with the entire plant to be shut by 2029. The nearby 340MW Collie plant will exit the market by the end of 2027, the premier, Mark McGowan, said in a statement on Tuesday. The state will join South Australia, the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania to be coal-free in its power generation once its remaining privately owned 416 Mw Bluewaters plant closes. A report by the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) last year said Australia could exit coal-fired power entirely by 2043. WA runs its power grid separately from the rest of the country. The rise of solar power – particularly on rooftops – had led to the two remaining coal plants becoming less viable, the government said. On Tuesday afternoon, coal, solar and gas were providing roughly equal shares of the market. “Our current electricity system is becoming increasingly unsustainable due to the uptake of rooftop solar and growing demand for renewable options for generation,” McGowan said. “Western Australia will implement a sensible, managed transition to a greater use of renewables for electricity generation, while ensuring we maintain electricity reliability as a priority.” The support package includes an extra $547.4m to be spent in the Collie region to back the exit of coal workers into new industries. That comes on top of the $115m already committed. “This investment makes economic sense, as it pays for itself by 2030-31, instead of continuing to pay increasing subsidies under the status quo,” McGowan said. State-owned Synergy now runs the two coal plants as part of the south-west power grid serving the WA’s main population centres. It will oversee the investment of an estimated $3.8bn in “new green power infrastructure around the state” including windfarms and new storage, the statement said. About 1,200 staff from Collie and the surrounding areas will be affected by the closure, ABC reported. Household power bill increases will be kept in line with inflation, McGowan said. Without taking the action to ditch coal, those bills would rise from their current average rate of about $1,800 to more than $3,000 a year, and subsidies to Synergy would swell to $3bn by 2029-30 to cover mounting losses. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning As part of the changes, the government committed to not commission any new natural gas-fired power stations on the south-west grid after 2030. The gas supplies are reserved as part of a 15% carve-out of gas production in the state, a system that some would like to see applied in eastern Australia to ensure supplies and cap price increases. By phasing out coal-fired power, Synergy’s carbon emissions will be reduced by 80% by 2030, including a 40% emissions reduction on the south-west grid, compared with 2020-21 levels, the government said. The WA energy minister, Bill Johnston, said the state was adding the equivalent of adding a new coal-fired generation unit every year in new rooftop solar. “We will be working closely with impacted businesses, workers and communities to ensure we create new jobs and training opportunities to future-proof Collie for the coming decades,” he said. • The headline of this article was amended on 14 June 2022 to clarify that it is state-owned coal plants that will be shut by 2030, not all coal plants."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2023/mar/09/a-long-overdue-moment-the-uk-greens-pushing-for-the-nuclear-option","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2023-03-09T15:00:25Z","webTitle":"A long overdue moment?

The UK greens pushing for the nuclear option","bodyText":"On 21 May 2022, after hours of impassioned debate, members of Finland’s Green party voted to make theirs the first in the world to back nuclear power. Greens in Finland would now campaign not only for the lifespan of current reactors to be extended but also for new plants, with the technology recognised by their manifesto as “sustainable energy”. It was a decision that upended decades of environmentalist orthodoxy – by campaigners who, in many cases, cut their teeth in opposition to nuclear. And, for Tea Törmänen, it was the culmination of years of campaigning. She and others in the Finnish Greens for Science and Technology group had argued that only through the adoption of nuclear power and other technologies could human societies decarbonise fast enough to avert climate breakdown. Writing later, the biologist, who is also a former chair of Finland’s Ecomodernist Society, said: “For me it was a moment that was long overdue.” As anxiety grows over the extent of climate and ecological crises, fear for the future is loading an ever more desperate calculus in favour of radical action. For some, this could include environmentalists embracing technologies previously regarded as unacceptable. But could Britain’s green movement go nuclear? Last month, Törmänen was in a London meeting with UK activists to see if it can. RePlanet are the pro-nuclear, pro-GMO vegans who have come to shake up the environmental movement. Newly formed of an international network of pro-technology environmental campaign groups, they believe doubling down on technology and progress is the key to solving the climate and ecological crises. Now, with funding from climate philanthropists, they are spreading out from a core in northern Europe with a plan to “pivot the mainstream” across the continent. But their proposals look set to put them on a collision course with traditional environmentalists. In a video fronted by the environmental campaigner and Guardian columnist George Monbiot they have entreated the public to go vegan, calling for animal products to be replaced by fats and proteins grown in genetically modified microbial soup. In Germany they are campaigning for the government to end its phase out of nuclear power and in Finland and the Netherlands they have helped guarantee the industry’s future. At the EU level they successfully argued that nuclear should be included in its taxonomy of green energy sources, while at the same time campaigning against the bloc’s organic farming targets and longstanding ban on genetically modified crops. They have hired two seasoned activists, Joel Scott-Halkes and Emma Smart, to manage their UK campaign. With backgrounds in Extinction Rebellion, both have proven themselves committed to radical climate action. Scott-Halkes went on to join radical vegan offshoot Animal Rebellion, while Smart’s activism with Insulate Britain earned her spells in jail. A third British campaigner, the environmental writer Mark Lynas, a former staunch opponent of GM who reversed his views, is a co-founder. RePlanet has its roots in a network of “ecomodernist” groups and societies established since 2015, after the publication of An Ecomodernist Manifesto. That document, signed by Lynas among others, upended traditional environmentalist philosophy. Instead of calling for humans to live in harmony with nature, for degrowth and moderation, the ecomodernists double down on technology as a means to minimise the human impact on Earth, while providing for a population of billions. Land sparing lay at the core of the manifesto, with the aim of rewilding as much of the world’s surface as possible by concentrating human activities. Ultimately, they wrote, technology could “decouple” economic growth from planetary systems, and the “wise” use of nuclear power, genetic modification and intensive agriculture would lead “to a good, or even great Anthropocene”. Activists in Finland, the Netherlands and elsewhere took up the charge. But in the UK, reception to the ecomodernists was frosty. Summing up criticisms at the time, Monbiot said ecomodernists “would wish away almost the entire rural population of the developing world”, and they had failed to interrogate the relationships between modernity and proletarianisation, uneven development and poverty. After a botched attempt to reach out across the political spectrum by teaming up with Owen Paterson, a Tory former environment secretary, Lynas admitted attempts to launch the movement in the UK had amounted to a “screw-up of impressive proportions”. Now he is playing a key role in trying to revive ecomodernism. RePlanet, Scott-Halkes explained, had been born out of a process of “rebranding ecomodernism”, jettisoning bits of the philosophy that had “become problematic”. Over the past two years, he said, they had worked together with Monbiot to embed into their approach a critique of power. Where previously ecomodernists had been seen as naively pro-capitalist and pro-technology, RePlanet believe they have faced up to the nuances and dangers of the technologies they are proposing – and the dangers of progress in general. Like classic ecomodernists, they see themselves as “pro-science and evidence-based” supporters of prosperity, who embrace progress, said Scott-Halkes. But there is a new emphasis on development and, befitting its sojourn in social democratic northern Europe, a new faith in “the power of the democratic state to take control of technologies, to develop technologies”. Precision fermentation and nuclear power are emblematic of the kinds of technical fixes they call for. Precision fermentation could, they claim, allow for the entire world’s protein to be produced from an area the size of London. It is not a pipe dream: the same technology is already used to produce most of the world’s insulin and citric acid; in the US, ice-creams containing precision fermented replicas of milk proteins are already on the market. But RePlanet says the technology must be “open sourced” to ensure its democratisation, with precision fermentation breweries in every town. “We’re saying with precision fermentation, in particular, we need to get in there now, because this is food, this is sustenance,” said Scott-Halkes. “If this does come to dominate the global food system we should be advocating for democratic control of it right now. Otherwise, we’re actually genuinely screwed.” Less easy to open source is atomic energy. But Replanet believe it is the only way for humanity to meet the energy needs of a rapidly developing world while decarbonising as fast as possible. “Nuclear is the most land-efficient energy source that has ever been invented,” Scott-Halkes said. “It is by various degrees 300 times more land efficient than wind power, 150 times more efficient than solar power, uncountably, 4,000 to 5,000 times more land efficient than biofuels. If you want space [for] rewilding, you need nuclear.” Finland is the “gold standard” of what RePlanet hopes to achieve. Not only have ecomodernists there managed to persuade the Green party to adopt nuclear power, but in December the party’s council agreed to a dismantling of restrictions on GM. With 20 seats in Finland’s parliament, such policy decisions have force. In the UK they have further to go. When pronuclear campaigners appeared on protests at Cop26 in Glasgow last year they were accused of being paid shills of the industry. Critics of precision fermentation argue it is a complicated technology prone to centralisation, when accessible, localised, resilient and above all natural food sources are needed. Rob Percival, head of food policy at the Soil Association, which certifies organic food in the UK, described RePlanet’s Reboot Food campaign on Twitter as “akin to the rewilding movement getting hooked on GMO-steroids”. Percival said it was important for campaign groups to push boundaries, and he agreed with the potential for precision fermentation to displace intensive animal farming. “But they are pushing this land-sparing concept to quite an extreme conclusion,” he said. “I think it’s unwise in that intensive systems have proven time and again to be liable to corporate capture, bad for the soil, heavily reliant on chemicals.” Opponents of nuclear say it is far from living up to RePlanet’s promise. Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace’s policy director, said the world needed alternative and clean sources of energy that are quick and cheap to deploy. “Nuclear is the opposite,” he said. “The new plant at Hinkley C is over a decade behind schedule and billions over budget. The next one in line, at Sizewell C, may not even start generating energy until today’s newborns turn teenagers. Crucially, we don’t need new nuclear. Solar and wind technologies are a much cheaper and quicker way to cut carbon emissions, and studies show we can keep the lights on with a wholly renewable energy system. All we need is the political will to make it happen.” Even Monbiot, who has helped to craft RePlanet’s updated ecomodernism, qualifies his support for the group’s ideas. He is known as an advocate for organic farming, which RePlanet has campaigned against. But he insists, nevertheless, that fresh thinking is needed to resolve the crises affecting the environment. “I broadly agree that we have to assess every issue from first principles, and we can’t afford to be blinded by prejudices against certain technologies,” Monbiot said. “We have to assess them all case by case, and we might come down in slightly different places on some of those technologies, but broadly I think we are on the same page.” RePlanet are not the only advocates of high-tech solutions to green problems. Taking his cue from Marx’s embracing of modernity as the grounds for revolutionary change, Matt Huber, author of Climate Change as Class War, dismisses degrowthers’ vision as “almost as austere as Pol Pot’s”. Adopting a more populist tone, the leftwingers clustered around the UK’s Novara Media news website have advocated for “fully automated luxury communism”, which went on to become the title of founder Aaron Bastani’s debut book. Most significantly, those with the money and power to actually bring ideas into implementation also seem to back technological solutions. Vast sums have already been invested into GM, plans are afoot for direct CO2 capture via huge industrial machinery and the cost-benefit analysis around geoengineering is increasingly regarded as worth the risk. Ecomodernism may not, yet, be the most popular idea among those who are campaigning for a solution to planetary crises created by humanity. But it increasingly looks as though it may be the one we will get."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/jun/07/biden-climate-change-defense-production-act","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-07T12:00:53Z","webTitle":"Activists hail Biden’s use of security powers to boost clean energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/07/biden-climate-change-defense-production-act","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/jun/07/biden-climate-change-defense-production-act","fields":{"headline":"Activists hail Biden’s use of security powers to boost clean energy","bodyText":"Environmental groups have welcomed Joe Biden’s invoking of national security powers to rapidly expand the production of clean energy technology as a significant advance in the effort to curb dangerous climate breakdown. Biden has triggered the Defense Production Act, a cold war-era law used to compel businesses to ramp up production of certain materials to aid national security, to boost the output of solar panels, building insulation, transformers for power grids and heat pumps, which are used to efficiently heat and cool homes. The US president has also provided a two-year exemption to solar panel companies from tariffs on imported parts, easing the flow of technology from China and other countries for use in the US, a country where only 2.8% of electricity comes from solar power. The moves have been applauded by climate activists who have pressed for Biden to use the breadth of his presidential powers to act on the climate crisis. Activists have sharply criticized the president in recent months over the continuing failure to pass major climate legislation through an evenly divided Senate, as well as Biden’s calls for bolstered oil production to offset gasoline prices that have risen amid the war in Ukraine. “We are in a climate emergency, an emergency we can only confront when our government steps up and launches a second-world-war scale mobilization to justly transition to renewable energy,” said Varshini Prakash, executive director at the youth-led Sunrise Movement. “This is a great step by the administration, and we urgently hope to see even more significant executive actions follow.” Biden has declined to declare a climate emergency, as has been done in countries such as the UK, or to set a phase-out of fossil fuels. But his administration said use of national security powers to create a “stronger clean energy arsenal” was evidence of “bold action to build an American-made clean energy future”. The use of the Defense Production Act will allow the US Department of Energy to invest in companies that can build renewable energy facilities and manufacture parts for technology such as solar panels. The administration expects domestic solar manufacturing will now triple by 2024, allowing more than 3.3m homes each year to switch to solar energy. A shift to cleaner sources of electricity would also help protect against energy bill volatility and provide efficiency to households, say proponents – heat pumps, for example, can save homes $1,000 each year from space heating alone. The administration has also sought to stress the benefits of weaning the US off the supply of fossil fuels from countries such as Russia. “Reducing America’s dependence on gas and oil is critical to US national security,” said Kathleen Hicks, deputy secretary of defense. Jean Su, director of energy justice at the Center for Biological Diversity, said Biden’s latest actions represented a “tremendous sea change” in his approach to tackling the climate crisis. “Biden’s executive moves give critical momentum to the needed transition to solar energy,” said Su. “We hope this use of the Defense Production Act is a turning point for the president, who must use all his executive powers to confront the climate emergency head on.” Scientists have said the world must cut planet-heating emissions in half this decade, and zero them out by 2050, to avoid even more disastrous heatwaves, floods, drought and other damaging climate impacts. Biden, who shares this target, won’t be able to achieve it, however, though executive action alone. The US has never passed major climate change legislation and the president’s attempts to do so have been stymied by Joe Manchin, the pro-coal Democrat who has been a crucial swing vote in the Senate. It’s unclear whether any climate bill will be able to succeed ahead of November’s midterm elections, which are expected to deprive Democrats of control in Congress."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/oct/13/first-edition-joe-biden-saudi-arabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-13T06:01:10Z","webTitle":"Thursday briefing: Has Saudi Arabia picked Putin over Biden?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/13/first-edition-joe-biden-saudi-arabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/oct/13/first-edition-joe-biden-saudi-arabia","fields":{"headline":"Thursday briefing: Has Saudi Arabia picked Putin over Biden?","bodyText":"Good morning. When Joe Biden gave Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, a fist bump in Jeddah in July, it was viewed as a moment of excruciating realpolitik: Biden, who had vowed to make Saudi Arabia a pariah state over the assassination of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, was instead palling around with the man believed to have ordered the hit. Today, that gambit appears to have failed – and the relationship is in tatters. Biden visited Saudi Arabia in the hope of persuading the world’s largest oil producer to increase production and offset petrol costs rising as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Instead, last week, Saudi Arabia and its allied oil producing nations in the Opec+ group – including Russia – agreed to a surprise reduction in supply that will push prices up. The undoubted beneficiary is Vladimir Putin. In an interview on Monday, Biden threatened unspecified “consequences” for the Opec+ decision – and last night, US Democrats told Saudi Arabia that if they did not change course, they would force a one-year freeze on all arms sales. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, and Dr Neil Quilliam of Chatham House, is about why Mohammed bin Salman would risk one of Riyadh’s most crucial alliances to help the beleaguered Russian regime – and what the news will mean for oil prices and Russia’s ability to prosecute the war. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Environment | Earth’s wildlife populations have plunged by an average of 69% in just under 50 years, according to a leading scientific assessment, as humans continue to clear forests, consume beyond the limits of the planet and pollute on an industrial scale. Four years ago, the figure stood at 60%. Politics | Liz Truss’ leadership was in fresh peril on Wednesday with calls growing among senior Conservatives to reverse more proposed tax cuts and MPs accusing her of “trashing” Conservative values. Meanwhile, the price of 20-year UK bonds hit new lows as the Bank of England insisted its £65bn support package would end on Friday. US news | The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay $965m (£870m) to people who suffered from his false claim that the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was a hoax, a jury in Connecticut decided on Wednesday. That takes the total in damages awarded against Jones past $1bn. Solar power | The prime minister is facing a rebellion from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s business department over plans to ban solar power from most of England’s farmland. Rees-Mogg is understood to believe it is “unconservative” to tell farmers what to do with their land. Covid | The World Health Organization’s head, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said that “immediate” action is needed to combat long Covid around the world. The WHO estimates between 10-20% of people who have had Covid-19 have mid- and long-term symptoms such as fatigue, breathlessness and cognitive dysfunction. In depth: ‘More than a bet on Russia, this is a bet on Trump’ *** How do Opec and Opec+ work? The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries was founded in 1960, as a way to force oil prices up in response to US import caps and the huge influence of multinational oil and gas companies. Today, there are 13 member states, with Saudi Arabia the most influential. Russia is part of an expanded group of oil exporters, Opec+, which was founded in 2016 as a way to counter big new challenges to Opec’s ability to control the market, from the emergence of the US as a major exporter to the growth of renewable energy. This Council on Foreign Relations backgrounder provides a more detailed history. Economists tend to view Opec and Opec+ as textbook examples of a cartel: member countries agree to coordinate their production of oil in order to influence prices. Opec+ states control about 50% of all crude oil, and 90% of proven reserves; when they slash output, as they did last week, that pushes the cost up. Kuwait’s acting oil minister, Mohammed al-Fares, described that as a measure to “maintain balance between supply and demand”; Carole Nakhle, head of consultancy firm Crystol Energy, told Al Jazeera that explanation was inadequate. “The market always balances itself,” she said. “The difference is that if you leave it to the market, it might give you a price that is much lower than what Opec wants to see.” *** Why has this decision caused such turmoil? Opec has been an accepted feature of the marketplace for oil for decades – but the context for this decision is very different. As well as pushing up petrol prices – and by extension inflation – at a time of economic turmoil, the move is of huge benefit to Russia. After European countries started to reduce their imports, Moscow’s income from oil fell significantly. Crucially, although Opec and Opec+ nominally cut production by 2m barrels a day, Russia was already producing well below its quota, meaning that this decision will allow it to produce more oil for a higher price. The news has been particularly poorly received in the US, where the likely consequence of rising petrol prices are painful for Joe Biden ahead of crucial midterm elections. It may also be viewed as a humiliation given Biden’s decision this summer to U-turn on his campaign promise to marginalise Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, over the death of Jamal Khashoggi – instead visiting Jeddah, giving MBS a fist bump, and urging him to increase oil production. “There was a lot of opposition to that among Democrats – and there was the whole moral dimension, of the war in Yemen and the death of Khashoggi,” Julian Borger said. “He expended a lot of political capital to make that trip. Democratic senators feel they have held back considerably to give Biden some latitude on this.” Even within Opec+, there will be some disquiet, Dr Neil Quilliam said by email. “There will undoubtedly be unease among member states about the strength of the US response, even if members agreed with the market forecasts that led the Saudi Arabia to champion this position. Kuwait, for example, which continues to place a very high value on its relationship with the US will no doubt be unnerved by the current situation.” *** What is Saudi Arabia’s relationship with Russia like? Those who viewed Biden’s trip to Jeddah as doomed from the start might have pointed to a $500m investment by a Saudi firm in Russian oil giants Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil at the beginning of the Ukraine conflict – or Riyadh’s decision in the summer to double purchases of Russian oil for its power plants to free up more of its own crude to export. Meanwhile, the president of close Opec ally the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, visited Moscow on Tuesday for face-to-face talks with Vladimir Putin. All of that indicates that Saudi Arabia and its partners have made a decisive shift towards Russia this year. Partly, that’s a cold economic calculation based on a shared interest in high oil prices. “But it’s also an illiberal alliance,” Julian said. “They see the US and its allies’ pressure for democratic reforms as an insult, and they have come together in the past on social conservatism. They see themselves as representing a hedge against US thinking around the world.” *** How will the US and its allies respond? In his interview on Monday, Joe Biden threatened “consequences” for the squeeze on oil production, without specifying what they might be. Senior Democrats in Congress are demanding radical action which would have a material impact on Saudi Arabia’s economy, and its military strength. Senator Bob Menendez, chair of the foreign relations committee, said he would vote to block future arms sales, while the New York Times reported that the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, was “seriously considering” legislation that would allow lawsuits for price fixing against the Saudis. And, in this piece, Senator Richard Blumenthal and Representative Ro Khanna call for legislation forcing an immediate halt to all US arms sales, arguing that it would take decades for Riyadh to transition to alternative suppliers and MBS would have no choice but to negotiate. Julian thinks that “this is a bipartisan issue, at least for the time being – Republicans would support this sort of action”. But he points to another possible factor in the Opec+ decision: MBS’s calculation that a Trump presidency, and Republican control of Congress, would be beneficial. Through the likely impact on US petrol prices, “they’re putting their thumb on the scale of the US election,” Julian said. “More than a bet on Russia, this is a bet on the Republicans, and especially Trump.” *** What happens next? This is not a “no turning back” moment, Quilliam said: “US Saudi relations will recover,” partly because the relationship between the two countries is much more deeply embedded in both their institutions. But it is a “hairline fracture”, he added. “The damage with the Biden administration cannot be repaired, and successive Democratic administrations will likely remember this moment.” On Tuesday, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, insisted that the relationship with the US “has been institutional since it was established” and claimed the Opec+ decision was “purely economic”. Last night, they joined an overwhelming UN vote to condemn Russia’s annexation of parts of Ukraine, which was “a way to show they’re still willing to do business”, Julian said. To assess Saudi Arabia’s likely path forwards, he added, it’s important to remember that “through every downward turn of the relationship since the death of Khashoggi, MBS has shown himself to be defiant. There seems to be this very personal sense that he was not respected.” In this excellent analysis, Martin Chulov argues that his ambition is for Saudi Arabia to “no longer be a Flintstones-like theocracy that eschewed progress and hid behind a US security umbrella … but a wealthy middle power in its own right that chose its friends, on its own terms.” In the short term, that appears to be good news for Russia, and bad news for the US and its allies. In the longer term, a fractured relationship could be disastrous for Saudi Arabia. “MBS is not a strategic thinker,” Julian said. “He is the one who got the Saudis into the incredibly costly Yemen war; the killing of Khashoggi shows him lashing out against perceived enemies. If he’s making an economic bet on Russia, it does look at the moment like he’s backing the wrong horse.” What else we’ve been reading Gloria Scott (pictured above) worked with the best: Tina Turner, Stevie Wonder, Barry White, the Supremes.

Now we’re all paying the price","bodyText":"As the full horror of the gathering energy crisis takes shape and the party of austerity prepares to borrow £150bn just to pay the bills, government ministers are desperate for you to remember one thing: it is all Vladimir Putin’s fault. Although the terrifying spike in gas prices is driven by the economic war Putin is waging on Europe, the emergency we face this winter is not simply a product of those high prices. It’s also a product of successive Conservative governments wilfully dismissing policies that would have reduced our reliance on gas in the first place. Take insulating homes and buildings. The past decade has been a period of dismal neglect for one of the most economically obvious policies. Report after report, campaign after campaign, year after year, governments have been reminded of the prudence of investing to make our buildings cheaper and cleaner to heat. Direct grants for those on low incomes, financial support for households and private firms, and properly funded schemes for the public sector could have ended the UK’s reign as the least insulated country in western Europe. Adopting these policies would have cost less than £5bn, and returned money to the Treasury over time through myriad economic benefits, even before gas prices skyrocketed. Yet it seemed there was no one ministers would listen to. They ignored recommendations from the Committee on Climate Change (the government’s official advisers), NGOs, the National Infrastructure Commission and the opposition. The result has been a staggering 85% decline in home insulation installations between 2012 and 2019. Under current plans, it will take 700 years to upgrade Britain’s homes for low-carbon heating. After a decade of inaction, we are now paying the price of remaining so dependent on gas. Successive governments have also ignored the benefits of cheap renewable energy. It is not news that wind and solar power are cheap. This was already the case in 2015, when David Cameron’s government banned new onshore wind farms and pulled the rug from underneath the solar industry. In absolute terms, the cost of solar has fallen by 88% since 2010 and onshore wind has fallen 57%, despite both being intentionally frozen out of new deployment. In relative terms, the numbers are now staggering: building a new solar or windfarm is now nine times cheaper than just running an existing gas power station. The government should be given credit for supporting the extraordinary success of offshore wind in recent years. But there was nothing to stop the rapid rollout of onshore wind and solar at the same time. Had this happened, we would have much more cheap, homegrown and clean energy available right now to ride out this storm. Had the Conservatives not “cut the green crap” over the past decade, households would now be saving an average £220 on their annual energy bills. This figure will probably rise further as gas prices do the same. Imagine what a genuine commitment to energy transition could have achieved. Instead, false solutions won the day. Chief among these was fracking. Despite plummeting levels of public support and repeated warnings from experts that a UK fracking industry would do nothing to lower bills, fracking retained mythical status among Conservative administrations. The dogged pursuit of an industry that went nowhere has wasted precious time and obscured the real solutions at hand. The obsession with getting every last drop out of the North Sea oil and gas industry has replicated a disastrous logic among Conservative ministers. The North Sea fields are in decline for a very simple reason – we’ve extracted, sold and burned most of what was there. Going after what is left will do nothing to lower gas bills because our reserves are a drop in the ocean of global gas prices. Carrying on with fracking regardless, as Liz Truss intends to do, will not lower energy bills – it will merely undermine the UK’s ability to lead on climate action. And then there is nuclear power. Nuclear power produces carbon-free electricity, but it is very slow and relatively expensive to deliver. Hinkley Point C, the first in a supposed new generation of UK nuclear power stations, won’t open for (at best) another four years. It will be a minimum of £5bn over budget. If gas prices never return to pre-2021 levels, Hinkley won’t look like a terrible deal for consumers. But we still have the present situation to deal with. If the political enthusiasm for Hinkley had instead been directed at cheap renewables and insulation, we would be feeling the benefits already. There is a depressingly tired story behind these failures: the power of vested interests. The access of frackers and drillers to the highest levels of the Conservative party since 2010 has left us with an irrational energy policy. Instead of reducing our energy consumption through insulation, and servicing our needs with cheap, domestic renewables running on the sun and the wind, British energy policies have sought to secure the profits of companies. These energy companies have no interest in realising a truly modern, clean and reliable energy system we could all depend on. Borrowing £150bn just to cap energy bills at already historic levels – with most of it going to oil and gas producers – is just the start of the pain. We are ruled by a party that thinks the answer to a fossil-fuelled crisis is more fossil fuels. It is incapable of governing the basis of any economy – the energy system.

It is as if all the problems of the past 50 years have descended on us in one fell swoop. The industrial relations problems and energy price hikes of the 1970s. The inflation of the 1980s and the onslaught of a biblical famine in east Africa. The devastation and war in Europe of the 1990s and the financial crisis and economic instability of the 2000s – as well as the difficult relationship with our neighbours in the EU. Add to these terrifying price hikes, rising interest rates on mortgages and rent rises. Is it any wonder our younger generation is the first since the first world war to believe that they will be less well off than their parents. But history shows us that it is not problems that bring down governments. It is the way politicians and leaders deal with them that determines political destiny. So here are four areas that should preoccupy Liz Truss and her new administration. First, our constituents need urgent reassurance that horrifying energy price rises which risk causing destitution and collapse are to be addressed effectively. Clearly, this must involve using the benefits system for our most vulnerable citizens. People are also furious that energy companies pass on petrol price rises at the pump within hours, while price reductions can take weeks to come through. And we need to give the process of retrofitting Britain’s housing stock a Nasa-style rocket boost. UK homes are some of the most expensive to heat in Europe because of poor maintenance and insulation. These price rises are unprecedented in recent times and, God willing, temporary. The government needs to organise a financial structure – a long-term debt instrument – that evens out these gyrations, possibly over many years. And although there is no reason why the state needs to own the electricity industry, we need total transparency of profits, earnings and efficiencies so that these companies operate openly and wholly in the public interest. Above all, for those who think the green levy an irrelevance and who dislike the “green crap”, don’t forget that while UK gas prices are likely to rise to more than 20p per kWh by January, the latest round of offshore wind development produced a contract for delivering electricity at 3.7p a kWh (yes, under 4p). Onshore wind capacity built now will probably be 3p or less. As with solar power, we should be in no doubt where our price and security of supply interests now lie. Second, the new leadership must properly grip the issue of immigration. We have to improve, radically, cooperation and our relationship with France. We have to agree safe and legal routes for those who are genuinely fleeing persecution. In practice, such routes only exist at the moment for Afghans and Ukrainians. And we have to streamline the absurdly lengthy appeals system and employ the necessary staff to process applications in a timely way. Above all, Britain needs to use its diplomatic clout to organise the renegotiation of the 1951 UN convention on refugees, which is hopelessly out of date. Third, the government (the executive), needs to improve its relationship with parliament and the legislature. The general denigration of MPs over recent years (and yes, not without cause) has fed into an unhealthy disrespect for parliament. While politicians have always been denigrated (just look at James Gillray’s cartoons of the 19th century), parliament has not. It is a serious error of judgment for members of the government to question publicly the workings of the privileges committee and, even worse, the integrity of its individual members who are carrying out the instructions of the House of Commons. Not the least of the reasons for Boris Johnson’s demise was his apparent view that he could act as a president, rather than the Queen’s first minister in parliament. Fourth, ministers and officials need to stop perceiving MPs from both sides of the house as an irritating nuisance. Where cross-party policy development takes place, the government should show more respect and genuine interest while accepting that parliament can be a useful ally and is not always a difficult and uncomprehending opponent. Finally, what is the lesson for the Conservative party as it seeks a historic fifth term in government? I served as a government whip and junior minister between 1992 and 1997. While Keir Starmer may not be Tony Blair, I see signs of great danger for my party. The Conservative party is a coalition – with the European Research Group representing one fine tradition and the one nation group representing another. Wise leaders recognise the importance of respecting these different strands. The circular firing squad that characterised the 1995-1997 period of Tory government should not – must not – be replicated. Our new leader must set about the urgent and serious task of sorting the nation’s myriad problems. They can only succeed with the backing of a united party and an empowered parliament.

The pop albums that have attempted to capture the spirit of youthful malaise over the past few years have been remarkably varied in tone: Lorde sought communion with nature on her pastel-toned 2000s throwback Solar Power, while Olivia Rodrigo bemoaned her “fucking teenage dream” to the sounds of glittery emo and pop rock on her debut album Sour. On their sophomore album Here Comes Everybody, Western Australian indie stars Spacey Jane take a different route, using bright, jangly indie rock to explore Gen Z’s fears around Covid and the climate crisis. Arriving two years after the release of their surprise blockbuster debut Sunlight – the Aria gold-certified album that spawned the Hottest 100 runner-up Booster Seat – this album is the result of the four-piece’s conscious attempt to grapple with meaty, hard-to-discuss generational anxieties: “I wanted to reflect on the last five [to] eight years … Covid gave me time to not just sit and think about myself, but be more outward-looking in some ways,” frontman Caleb Harper told Triple J. “I wanted to touch on that as much as possible.” “As much as possible”, in this context, though, still seems to mean “very little”. Although it may attempt to speak to a universal young Australian experience, Here Comes Everybody’s sights still seem fixed intently upon the navel; Harper’s comfort zone is expressing vague heartbreak or vague disaffection, and he almost never leaves it. Most of the songs here hit the same beats over and over: their protagonists constantly coming down and fighting with soon-to-be-exes; driving around blearily thinking of some amorphous “her” and hoping things will change tomorrow, but knowing they won’t. There’s nothing wrong with that, of course, but Harper’s songwriting is often painfully sophomoric, leaning heavily on trite truisms and uninspiring turns of phrase. Here Comes Everybody is named for the working title of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Wilco’s beloved early-2000s indie record, and you have to laugh at the sheer hubris of the choice: there’s a blithe simplicity to this record that’s miles removed from that album’s provocative darkness, its blackened wit. On Clean My Car, Harper is “still seeing your name in the sunset”, trying to “fill this you-shaped hole in my heart”; Lots of Nothing sketches a portrait of a couple who “fall in love to fall right out, and break apart without a sound.” Pulling Through, the record’s glib attempt at an uplifting finale, contains lyrics worthy of a high school graduation speech: “If it feels like failure, it’s probably good for you.” These are songs about growing pains that lack all the awkwardness and invigorating tension that comes with growing up – the kind of spice and urgency that made Hatchie’s Giving The World Away and Rodrigo’s Sour, recent albums that tackled similar topics without resorting to this level of cliche, so appealing. Occasionally, Harper will touch a raw nerve in a way that’s kind of remarkable, in comparison to the rest of the album. On the almost emo-leaning Haircut, he offers a true pearler: “I tattoo my arm just to prove that I’m changing, but I can’t even fool myself.” There’s a devastating sense of inertia captured in that one line, a world of ambient stress and alienation that’s more vivid than anything else here. The rest of the record could have used such specifics; instead, the line is a single lifeboat surrounded by vast ocean. Here Comes Everybody is hardly helped by the fact that, musically, it sounds like so many other records released by Australian indie bands in the past decade. In a playlist, its songs would slot neatly alongside hits by Little Red and San Cisco and the John Steel Singers and Hungry Kids of Hungary. But its overwhelming cleanness, its profound lack of any kind of chaos or discordance, matches the emotional content; this is a record that slips from memory freely and easily, so platitudinal are its lyrics – less the sound of Gen Z than a shrug, an attempt at empathy that inspires little more than apathy.

Klara is an Artificial Friend, or AF, who runs on solar power and has been created as a companion for lonely children – her role is part sibling, part childminder. Klara has a rare aptitude among AFs for observing human emotions, and learns to read sadness, anger and joy in the faces of the people she sees in the street. Watching what appears to be a reunion of two friends, she remarks to the shop manager: “They seem so happy … But it’s strange because they also seem upset.” Klara, who is the narrator of Ishiguro’s eighth novel, is spotted by a 14-year-old girl, Josie, who brings her mother to the shop and begs to buy her. Once installed in the family home, Klara learns that Josie is chronically ill with a sickness that killed her sister, and that her role will require considerably more than companionship. New York voice actor Sura Siu adopts a convincingly subdued tone to convey Klara’s android status. The language, and Siu’s reading of it, is spare and childlike, poignantly capturing Klara’s instinctive goodness and desire for connection. The book shares themes with the author’s 2005 novel Never Let Me Go: both have a vision of a future that feels uncomfortably close to the present, and both feature an artificially created protagonist who, in Klara’s case, is more human than the flesh-and-blood individuals she was created to serve. • Klara and the Sun is available on Faber, 10hr 16min Further listening The Push Ashley Audrain, Penguin, 8hr 38min Marin Ireland reads this tense psychological thriller about the dark side of motherhood.

Based in a region with virtually no access to fresh water, it is going to rely on desalination – the practice of debrining saltwater so it is drinkable. It seems like an elegant solution – but the problem is that desalination, which is projected to boom by 37% across the Gulf region in the next five years, has huge environmental costs, in terms of the fossils fuels used to carry out the process, and the marine environment. But without it, how can the arid region possibly quench its thirst? Forty-three per cent of the world’s desalination capacity comes from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Despite the scarcity of water, the GCC are among the highest consumers of it in the world, and heavily dependent on desalination plants. The United Arab Emirates has one of the highest per capita water consumption rates in the world, with people using roughly 500 litres a day – 50% above the global average. Yet many GCC countries such as the UAE are still keen to promote water-rich lifestyles through desalination efforts. Manicured lawns and waterparks are commonplace across cities, and at the Dubai fountain show, every half hour throughout the day more than 83,000 litres of water shoot up as high as a 50-storey building. But with populations rising, the region’s water industry is facing increasing pressure. “These plants essentially have rivers running through them. If you look at the desalination capacity across the GCC as a whole, the volume of water flowing through that is about four times the amount of water flowing down the Thames,” says Will Le Quesne, the Middle East programme director for the UK Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. Maryam Rashed Al Shehhi, an assistant professor of civil infrastructure and environmental engineering at Khalifa University in the UAE, says: “Desalination is our main source of fresh water. It’s a very arid region, and annual rainfall has decreased. So it’s very scary to think about any other sources of water.” Since the 1950s the GCC have been at the vanguard of desalination. The southern coasts of the Gulf are dotted with more than 300 desalination plants – mostly in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain. Powering the world’s greatest concentration of desalination requires a significant amount of energy. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, makes up a fifth of the world’s output, with roughly 30 desalination plants burning through 300,000 barrels of crude oil a day. In fact, most desalination plants are oil or gas powered, operating with either thermal processing technology, which collects steam from boiling water and condenses it, or the more modern reverse osmosis technology, which relies heavily on electricity produced using natural gas to power pumps that force water through very fine membranes, essentially straining out the salts in the water. “Either way, you need quite a lot of energy. That can be derived from a lot of sources including by burning fossil fuels,” says Le Quesne. So although Qatar maintains the World Cup will be carbon-neutral, climate organisations are already expressing doubts. The water demands alone are eye-watering. The tournament will need to manage pitches across eight stadiums, and more than 130 additional training grounds. The delicate and complicated process of creating the right turf for football in the Qatar climate just as the weather begins to cool means the groundsmen have to mimic winter, expert Haitham Al Shareef told Reuters, blowing chilled air over the grass and watering the pitch with at least 10,000 litres of desalinated water. And for emergencies, “a 425,000 sq metre reserve of grass – some 40 soccer pitches worth – is growing at a farm north of Doha”. The water consumption of that patch is not recorded. And despite national commitments to reducing carbon emissions and meeting net zero targets, the region is expecting to do more desalination, not less, with capacity planned to expand 37% by 2027. This could be devastating for the Gulf’s marine ecosystem, says Le Quesne. Desalination is one of the worst marine pollution drivers around the world, producing brine, a highly saline waste fluid usually released into the sea as saltier, toxic and warmer seawater. It can contain chemicals such as chlorine, heavy metals, and anti-foaming agents that are added during the desalination process, which can harm coral reefs and smaller marine organisms that live on the seabed. Along with water, smaller organisms also risk getting sucked into the system and can get impinged, crashing into the screens of the intake pipes, or entrained, travelling with water reaching the plant, resulting in severe injury and death. “The microscopic plants of the sea, things like fish eggs, will all get drawn into the system and experience very high levels of mortality. Most of them are typically destroyed on their way through the system,” says Le Quesne. With growing environmental concerns, GCC countries including the UAE and Oman are exploring methods involving solar energy. By far the most ambitious plan is Saudi Arabia’s solar dome, the world’s first zero-brine discharge desalination plant. Announced in 2020, the project is now being prototyped as part of Neom, the outlandish $500bn (£447bn) planned megacity. Partnering with a London-based company, Solar Water, the 20-metre high dome made from glass and steel is proposed to be surrounded by mirrors that will collect sunlight to heat up the seawater, condense it in a separate chamber, and distill it into fresh water. “The dome itself will be illuminated by this strong sunlight. It’ll look like a sparkling jewel in the desert,” says Christopher Sansom, a professor of concentrating solar power at the University of Derby and a director at Solar Water. But although the solar dome will, the designers say, be cheaper to build and operate than conventional plants, it will also produce significantly less water. Though Saudi Arabia has no shortage of sunlight, solar-powered desalination can have its limitations, says Sansom. Any interference with clouds or wind can stop the power from being generated. Dust is another factor that can hinder the technology. In a desert environment such as Saudi Arabia, solar panels need to be wiped clean. While promising, Al Shehhi says desalination plants running completely with solar energy is not yet practical and more research is needed into implementing more renewable energy into the desalination process. “It’s a challenge. The amount of water pumped every day from the Gulf to be desalinated is huge,” she says. And that is before a World Cup is added into the equation. • This article was amended on 10 October 2022.

Liz Truss – already a plausible contender for the “worst prime minister ever” gong before she even assumes office – apparently intends to issue up to 130 drilling licences for oil and gas firms. If the purpose of this is to confront the looming social catastrophe of energy bills, to describe it as an exercise in futility would be generous: it takes the best part of three decades to pump fossil fuels out of the ground and put them onstream. As Russia switches off Europe’s flow of gas via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – it implausibly cites maintenance work as the reason – the need for drastic, swift action could not be more obvious, yet our soon-to-be prime minister has nothing meaningful to offer. There are other paths. New renewable energy capacity secured by the government will cost only £48 per megawatt hour – compared with the current cost of running gas-fired power stations, which has surged to around £450 per MWh. (And, depending on the impact of action from the EU, it could rise further.) Renewables, therefore, are around nine times cheaper and far quicker to plug into our energy system. What possible reason is there not to make wind and solar the central pillars of an effective strategy to build energy independence and help stop millions being plunged into destitution? What explains this suicidal strategy? It is undoubtedly that the ideological predilections of the Tory right are prioritised above the Earth’s survival, energy independence and people’s livelihoods. Renewables are indelibly culturally associated with dangerous lefty nonsense, while gas and oil somehow represent macho British tradition. That the case for renewables is based both on pragmatic economics and incontrovertible scientific facts is irrelevant. It is hard not to conclude, too, that an addiction to waging eternal culture war is at play. Much of the behaviour of the modern right is driven by a desire to offend their opponents; like announcing they have passed wind, they want you to be aware of and disgusted by their actions. If you want to see such ideological spite in all its glory, consider the fact that onshore wind is a mere £50 per MWh, but has essentially been banned by the government. Why? Not because it’s unpopular – polling suggests that three-quarters back it, including a large majority of Tory voters. And not because another much less popular option they’ve also swung behind – expanding nuclear power stations – is cheaper. Nuclear plants are far more expensive and – toxic nuclear waste aside – still take so long to build that they would do little to address the current emergency. It gets worse: Truss has committed to change planning laws to hinder the development of solar power, trashing an energy source that costs just £55 per MWh. “Our fields shouldn’t be full of solar panels” she crows, while our streets will be filled with hungry kids and cold pensioners. This may explain, too, why David Cameron – who began his leadership by changing the Tory logo into a tree – demanded cutting the “green crap”. It was a commitment the Tories followed up on: while more than 2 million households were insulated in 2012, that plummeted to around quarter of a million a year later, and less than 100,000 in 2020. The consequence? An analysis by Carbon Brief showed that the insulation gap, along with cuts to wind and solar, will cost households an extra £150 a year – and that’s before we mention the loss of skilled jobs that mass insulation programmes support. Avoiding this looming, avoidable humanitarian catastrophe is crucial. So too is saving the planet. This week, scientists concluded that the Greenland ice cap melting will inevitably mean major rises in sea levels, threatening to overwhelm coastal areas and all those who live in them. A decisive shift to renewable energy offers hope of at least mitigating this calamity, while expanding UK drilling means pouring North Sea oil on to the inferno. The taxpayer is expected to carry a financial burden of subsidies to fossil fuel companies wthat will cost them twice over: it will cost them now in the pocket, and it will cost them a sustainable future. Britain’s direction is clear: Truss’s Britain will be governed by policies lifted from cliched Daily Mail headlines. All the bêtes noires of saloon-bar reactionaries from the past 20 years will be slaughtered, and the resulting anguish from those effete metropolitan lefties obsessed with mere trivialities such as avoiding mass impoverishment and the destruction of the planet will give the Tory faithful their kicks. While Labour’s refusal to confront the issue of utility ownership closes off the possibility of a long-term solution – and fuels the transfer of wealth from taxpayer to shareholder – at least their windfall tax to scoop away the ludicrous profits of energy giants to suppress bills offers some relief. As things stand, Truss only serves up a tray of niche hard-right poison pills that do nothing to address the three intersecting crises – living standards, energy independence and climate. And, yes, Truss may crave the disgust of those lefty do-gooders, but come winter, many of the Tories own true believers will be shivering in their homes, too.

Even those who get the largest payouts only get them once. This piece of window-dressing to obscure the squalid conduct and corruption of this government does nothing significant to alleviate the growing poverty in the UK. People need a much better level of guaranteed income and greater employment rights and security. But we also need a radical change in taxation from income to land, property and wealth taxes. All tax avoidance allowances should be closed. Utilities should be returned to public ownership or to far greater public control, and management should include employees and consumers. There are many things that can be done to restore a greater degree of equity among the population. The hegemonic economic paradigm of this government is not a law of nature as the chancellor and other ministers are presenting it. It is a human construct and can be changed by human actions so that its benefits are equitably distributed. Alasdair Macdonald Glasgow • The government has taken a great idea and executed it badly. The oil and gas industry is walking away with the vast majority of its excess profits from energy price rises, while taxpayers are covering two-thirds of Rishi Sunak’s energy support to help pay bills. Instead of lowering the cost of future bills by expanding cheap renewables faster and insulating homes, the government is giving a massive tax discount to oil and gas producers to invest in fossil fuels. In what world does it make sense to expand production of the high-cost fuel that threatens life on our planet, while doing nothing extra to get more of the cheap green stuff? Jenny Jones Green party, House of Lords • Multiple homeowners will avail themselves of the £400 on both primary and secondary homes. As there are around 500,000 second homes in the UK, that’s roughly an additional £200m that could be used more equitably. Yet again, we’re told that it’s too difficult to ascertain which are second homes. As with the massive fraud that occurred during the pandemic due to the inability of governments to regulate the formation of new companies, money is being leeched to those who don’t need it. Those who have more, get more. The meek among us can only look forward to inheriting the earth. Barbara Holroyd Erpingham, Norfolk • It is not entirely accurate that “every household” will receive £400 from the government. There are households (mine included – one of more than 350 in Northumberland alone) that have no mains electricity so will not receive this help. This is despite a reliance on diesel for electricity (unless lucky enough to have wind and solar power, out of reach of most), the cost of which has almost doubled in a year, and on oil or wood for heating, for which there is no price cap and where cost increases are eye-watering. We face the same cost of living challenges as everyone else. These households have been ignored. We are powerless in every sense. Sue Finch Elsdon, Northumberland • The government plans to give me £400 towards my energy costs. It seems that I might get another £150 because I am a pensioner. I don’t need the payments so will donate them to a charity supporting those who are really struggling because of this government.

Non-Māori must speak Māori for it to survive","bodyText":"My sisters and I are the first generation in almost 50 generations of our family who didn’t grow up speaking te reo Māori as a first language. At first, that fact seems startling – a dramatic rupture from our past and the language that gives form to it. We are only three generations removed from ancestors who were Māori-speaking monoglots, ordering their lives and their world in a language almost foreign to their 21st-century descendants. But this break between the language our ancestors spoke and the language we speak – English – is the typical Māori experience: only one in five Māori can hold a conversation in their ancestral language, and in the past three national surveys this number has fallen. That makes us anglophones a firm majority in our Indigenous populace. This isn’t surprising. From the moment Cook’s Endeavour made sight of land in 1769 the captain and the gentleman botanist Joseph Banks set about conferring English names on the landmarks and features they “found”. My own ancestral mountain, Pūtauaki, became “Mt. Edgecumbe”, possibly in honour of John Edgecombe, a sergeant of marines on the Endeavour. It would take another one hundred years for my ancestors to discover that their ancient mountain, as well as their sacred rivers, went by other names. Yet the histories of colonisation tend to centre around invasion and conquest – the British red coats move in and sooner or later the country falls – which neatly omits how nearly every conquest begins with a new English name. From these re-namings, the English language and the settlers who spoke it spread across New Zealand. Within a century of Cook’s 18th century landing Pākehā (white New Zealanders) were the new ethnic majority and their language quickly became the lingua franca of government, commerce, and media. Come the 20th century my grandparents and great-grandparents were torn about the value of Māori as their grandchildren’s first language. Particularly passionless scholars understand language as merely a means of encoding information, but I know my grandparents understood it as more than that: language is relationship between speakers, encoding their shared culture and, for Māori, embedding them in a common whakapapa (ancestry). This is something every grandparent would like to pass on. But, when the future speaks English, do you choose te reo? For a good number of Māori, sometimes through choice but mostly through circumstance, the answer was no. Even in my lifetime the proportion of fluent and conversational Māori speakers continues to decline. After moving home to Kawerau in 2019 I was struck at how the language was scarcely spoken outside the Marae and formal settings (council events, wānanga graduations, and so on). As a child in the 90s and 2000s the Māori language was all around me – at school, in shops, to some degree in the home, and certainly in the wider whānau (family). Where did it go? In the decade that I was gone English cut huge tracks into my little Māori community. It does so wherever it goes, a juggernaut absorbing other languages – “juggernaut” itself is a borrowing from the Indian subcontinent – into what we know today as modern standard English. As a language of expression, as a means of describing the universe and our knowledge of it, English is probably without peer. But it’s not my language – it was embedded in this land at the end of a musket. Like every other Māori person without their ancestral language, I yearn for te reo rangatira (the Māori language). I want the past it grants access to, and the shape it confers on my future and my partner’s future and our child’s future. Where I depart from many of those same Māori without the language is that I think it’s vital that Pākehā speak it alongside us. For that reason alone Lorde’s five track, Māori language accompaniment to her new album, Solar Power, is a pop culture landmark we should welcome. And yet on social media the reaction, at least from many Māori, is caustic. On Twitter and Instagram users wrote about the album triggering the language loss trauma they carry. The strangely psychoanalytic tone of that charge aside, it’s certainly happening. Hearing the language, especially in the mouth of a Pākāha person, is a reminder of its absence in your own. This kind of cognitive burden is punishing. The more persuasive critics take a slightly different view (one that doesn’t centre individual feelings) arguing, as one well-respected tōhunga (expert) on Māori dance did, that the album amounts to “tokenism”. One can appreciate that argument, and the discussions of trauma as well, but the implications are worrying for the future of the Māori language. If we must wait for perfect circumstances to speak or sing te reo rangatira – nobody’s trauma is triggered, no tokenism is detected – we may as well sign the language’s death certificate. In fighting for Māori radio, Māori television, Māori language schooling, and more the Māori language activists of the 70s and 80s knew that for the language to survive it must act as a functional language, deployed across institutions, mediums, and communities both Māori and non-Māori. The great rangatira (leaders) who brought Lorde’s Māori language album to life – Dame Hinewehi Mohi, Sir Tīmoti Kāretu, Hana Mereraiha, and Hēmi Kelly – likely take the same view. English is the first global language. For reasons of empire, obviously, but also for reasons of culture: English is the language of Hollywood, the chief language of pop music, increasingly the language of science, and the preferred language of commerce and diplomacy. If the Māori language is to survive against it – and the forecasts are grim – we must allow non-Māori to speak and sing it. Children need a pop culture and a social media that speaks Māori. Lorde contributed to that, and under the direction and supervision of some of our greatest language champions. As a second language speaker I recognise that as a public good.

The 60-year-old speechwriter says she was happy to foot the bill, and didn’t want anything fancy – like a Tesla Powerwall or three-phase charging – just a plug to charge overnight. “It would have been just your run-of-the-mill 240-volt powerpoint,” Stewart says. “I didn’t think the owner would mind because they’re going to end up with power in their garage they didn’t have before, so it’s a bit of a win for them.” But since making the request in December she has heard nothing, despite following up twice. Stewart rents her apartment – one of 25 in a block built in the 60s – so her property manager would have to check with the strata management committee whether she was allowed to install the plug, before asking the owner for permission. “I’m desperate to get into an EV. There’s all these disincentives at the moment for EVs and it’s not a sustainable position,” Stewart says. “It should be easy.” The hurdles facing apartment-dwellers who want to use electric vehicles, install solar panels or switch from gas to electric for cooking and heating are not just financial, says Associate Prof Cathy Sherry, of the University of New South Wales law and justice faculty. And for those who rent – about half the people who live in apartments across the country – the barriers can be insurmountable. A conservative count in the 2020 Australasian Strata Insights report by the UNSW City Futures Research Centre found there were 340,601 apartment blocks across Australia, home to 2.2 million people. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sherry says the strata system – collective management of common parts of the property – often works against optimal decision-making. Only owners can vote on strata committees, and in many cases the interests of those who live in their apartments and investors are at odds when it comes to improvements that will reduce emissions, but cost money in the short term. A little over one in 10 apartments across Australia are left vacant by investors. In Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia, the rate is closer to one in five. “Investors typically just want the money,” Sherry says. “What is the incentive for anyone who owns an investment property they don’t even rent out to make green upgrades in an apartment building?” ‘Financial benefit from doing the right thing’ The Zinc Building in Alexandria, Sydney illustrates what can be done. Nathan Hage, 45, is a supply chain logistics worker who serves on the building’s strata committee and says when it was built in 2005, the developers paid no attention to sustainability. Two decades on, the 45-apartment building has 10 EV chargers in the basement, with the capacity for more on demand, and 24kW of solar power on the roof, with another 70kW to be installed in the next few weeks. “There’s already people who come around, stand in the car park, look at the EV chargers and say: how do you do this?” Hage says. The process has been helped by gadgets such as the device about the size of a computer installed in the building’s electrical room that enables an equitable distribution of solar power between the apartments. Hage says he was lucky in that the hardest part was convincing other apartment owners to commit. “Each step you take it becomes more compelling because the benefits build off each other,” he says. “Once you make the leap to go solar, you’re spending less so you can afford to put more money into more solar and other improvements.” Now he says the building is considering battery options and replacing its gas hot water system. “The glorious piece is that for those who don’t care about the environment, or have the time to care about it, there’s a demonstrable financial benefit from doing the right thing, so there’s something for everyone,” he says. Each building will have different needs In many other cases, however, the process has been much more frustrating. Brent Clark is the chief executive of Wattblock, a consultancy that works with strata committees to improve the sustainability of apartment blocks. He says strata management contributes to the inertia on electrification. “Think of strata as the fourth tier of government,” Clark says. “You’ve got federal, state, local and then strata. “Those buildings aren’t going to decarbonise of their own volition, they need help from the first, second and third tiers of government to help them on the path, to decarbonise, to electrification.” Residents of older buildings face the biggest challenges, Clark says. “The most common is the red- or white-brick walk-up built in the 60s or 70s,” he says. “Sometimes you’ll only have as little as 100 amps from the nearest substation for the whole building.” As each building will have different needs, there is no one-size-fits-all solution but Clark says older buildings will likely be forced to at least double or triple their capacity to meet the future needs of their tenants. “We had one of our customers, they wanted to add another 100 amps into their building. They were looking at paying $100k.” Dale Cohen, the secretary of the Richmont strata committee in the inner Sydney suburb of Pyrmont, says the longer action on decarbonising apartment blocks is delayed, the more pressing – and the more expensive – it becomes. Cohen, now a Tesla owner, was driving a Mitsubishi plug-in hybrid in 2017 when he approached his building’s management committee about upgrades to support EV charging in the three-floor basement garage. He began to wonder what would happen if more people started driving electric vehicles. What if everyone charged at once? How much capacity did the building’s power supply have? Who would pay? And how would they do it? Answering those questions took five years. One of the most pressing challenges was getting the votes on the strata committee needed to approve any change – one that eased with reforms in NSW, the ACT and Western Australia that lowered the voting threshold needed for approval from 75% to 50% of owners. Then there were logistical and engineering issues associated with retrofitting a nine-storey building – and the cost. “To do a big bang and electrify everything in our building would cost over $500k,” Cohen says. “We’d need to have 100% of owners to have EVs to make that viable. “I’ve said before this is the time bomb in the basement for apartment buildings across the country. This is what I mean. That’s how big the problem is.” Cohen says his building has now settled on a staged rollout that will allow every car space to be electrified as demand grows, a project that will still cost “north of $100k”. Chris Duggan, the managing director at Strata Community Association Australasia, says electric vehicle charging has become a proxy for broader issues around sustainability and the risks posed by climate change. “Traditionally policy has been strata-blind and housing policy more generally has been squarely focused on single-dwelling policy,” Duggan says. “There will come a point where EV charging becomes an infrastructure requirement.” If nothing is done tenants will vote with their feet, he says, and buildings that can’t provide sustainable amenities will fall in value. Duggan says a government education campaign is needed to guide management committees looking to make the switch, and a strata-specific grant program to help pay for upgrades to older buildings. Sherry says governments have “very rarely” mandated the retrofitting of existing apartment buildings, and most successful measures, such as the installation of smoke alarms, and window-locks to stop children falling out, have been small and cheap. Addressing climate change, she says, will be much more complicated. “There are hundreds of thousands of strata schemes in Australia, there’s no point them all reinventing the wheel,” she says. “They need mandates and guidance. That’s the reality.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/oct/01/winds-of-radical-change-queensland-breaks-up-with-coal-in-stunning-week-in-energy","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-30T20:00:50Z","webTitle":"Winds of ‘radical change’: Queensland breaks up with coal in stunning week in energy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/01/winds-of-radical-change-queensland-breaks-up-with-coal-in-stunning-week-in-energy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/oct/01/winds-of-radical-change-queensland-breaks-up-with-coal-in-stunning-week-in-energy","fields":{"headline":"Winds of ‘radical change’: Queensland breaks up with coal in stunning week in energy","bodyText":"The announcement was always going to come one day – the climate crisis, the spiralling electricity costs and the gale-force winds of change in international markets had made it inevitable. But Annastacia Palaszczuk’s words were still met with amazement. By 2035, the Queensland premier said, the state would no longer rely on coal for electricity. A chart laid out how the coal-burning, coalmining state would end its long association. By 2037, the chart showed, coal will be gone entirely from the state’s electricity supply. Energy policy wonks were aghast. There is more detail to come, and many major hurdles to leap, but the feeling of change in the Sunshine State was palpable. “What was impressive was that they are the first state to really articulate a proper pathway out of coal,” says Alison Reeve, an energy and climate expert at the Grattan Institute. “I was a bit gobsmacked, particularly because they’ll be going from one of the most emissions intensive electricity supplies, to one of the least.” The 10-year, $69bn energy plan came in the middle of a huge week in Australian energy. On Monday, Queensland announced it was investing $774m to build the country’s biggest publicly owned windfarm. On Tuesday, Victoria revealed that by 2035, it wanted enough renewable energy storage to power half the state’s homes. On Thursday, AGL said it would close the country’s most polluting power station, Victoria’s Loy Yang A, in 2035, a decade earlier than planned. “There is a level of inevitability to all this,” says Reeve. “Because we have spent a decade and a half stuffing around, you do now have to go harder and faster.” Queensland’s coal announcement on Wednesday came with new targets for renewable electricity: 70% by 2032 and 80% by 2035. By 2040 more than a third of the state’s power will come from wind, with solar power the next biggest contributor. Batteries and two large hydroelectric plants – one in the north near Mackay and one west of the Sunshine Coast – will store the renewable power so it can balance the energy supply. The larger Mackay project, which Palaszczuk dubbed “the battery of the north”, only exists on paper and the government is still looking at other potential locations. But the coal exit still took many by surprise. Only a few months ago the state’s energy minister, Mick de Brenni, said none of the eight state-owned coal power stations would close. In hindsight, it was a carefully worded declaration. Under the plan, power stations become clean energy hubs for hydrogen, renewables and electricity infrastructure. Parts of the coal plants could be repurposed as huge spinning motors that help balance demand and supply in electricity grids. All this, Reeve said, meant Queensland could say “the power stations aren’t closed, but it just won’t need coal any more”. “Queensland is seeing an increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters,” de Brenni told the Guardian. “Boardrooms and consumers are asking governments to take real action.” What about emissions targets? There was no announcement on Queensland’s emissions reduction targets for 2030, which – at a 30% cut from 2005 levels – are the weakest of any state. And while much of the global climate impact from the state comes when its large volumes of coal and gas are exported and burned overseas, the energy plan does nothing on this front. But the latest figures for 2020 show the state’s emissions at 159m tonnes – the same level they were four years earlier, and a 19% drop on 2005 levels. Were it not for a sharp fall in emissions from land clearing, which went from 71Mt in 2005 to 12Mt in 2020, emissions would be rising. About a third of the state’s emissions, some 49Mt, relate to electricity production. That is a fraction higher than in 2005. Emissions have also climbed in the LNG sector after huge export facilities opened up in the state’s north, burning large amounts of gas in the process. The LNG export industry is the country’s biggest user of gas. De Brenni says achieving the state’s current 2030 target would mean cutting emissions in the electricity sector by 41%. He says the targets were “continuing work for our government”, and that the new energy plan is “the first and most significant step we have taken to drive real action”. “The nation can’t achieve 43% (the federal government’s 2030 emissions reduction target) without Queensland delivering this plan,” he says. For years, the coal industry has claimed the fuel will still be viable in a carbon-constrained world because the carbon emissions will be able to be captured and stored. But Queensland’s energy plan has no mention of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Earlier this year, the Australian Energy Market Operator released its plan for the most optimal and reliable electricity market in the future to meet climate targets. The investment outlined in Queensland, which will result in eight times the renewable energy capacity of today by 2035 if all goes to plan, is exactly in line with Aemo’s expectations. “What an amazing week,” said Simon Holmes a Court, an energy analyst and investor whose Climate 200 project helped fund the campaigns of six new climate-focused independent MPs elected to federal parliament in May. An orderly transition Dr Amanda Cahill is the chief executive and founder of The Next Economy, a not-for-profit specialising in economic development that has run scores of climate and energy workshops and summits around Australia and, in particular, in central Queensland “We’re at a turning point in the energy system,” she says. “We’ve talked about the need to move away from fossil fuels for a long time. This is the tipping point.” Despite perceptions from outside Queensland, big industry and public officials have been crying out for a decarbonisation plan but have, until recently, avoided going public because of the divisive nature of climate policy. “Behind closed doors for years government and industry and councils have been getting together to try and figure this out but … because it’s been politically sensitive, it hasn’t happened in the public sphere,” Cahill says. “In those circles, decision makers are on board and this plan will give them certainty.” Prof John Quiggin, an economist at the University of Queensland and a former member of the federal government’s Climate Change Authority, says because Queensland retained public ownership of its coal plants, it was able to plot an orderly transition in a way other states couldn’t. The plan includes a “jobs guarantee” signed with three unions to give coal plant workers security. “It becomes very straightforward to have a jobs guarantee if you own the business. It’s harder if you are dealing with private companies,” he says. “This is a big, big deal. It is radical change in all sorts of ways from where we were even just a few years ago. I didn’t expect it from this Labor government. They seem to have got brave.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/aug/28/the-observer-view-on-the-unforgivable-silence-of-the-tories-over-the-energy-price-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-28T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the unforgivable silence of the Tories in the energy price crisis | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/28/the-observer-view-on-the-unforgivable-silence-of-the-tories-over-the-energy-price-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/28/the-observer-view-on-the-unforgivable-silence-of-the-tories-over-the-energy-price-crisis","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the unforgivable silence of the Tories in the energy crisis","bodyText":"The rising cost of energy is a national emergency. Last year, British households collectively spent around £30bn on their energy bills. Next year, that bill is expected to be in the region of £170bn. Those sums do not account for the higher energy costs that will be faced elsewhere in the economy, by businesses, hospitals and schools. It would be a colossal economic shock that would cause untold economic hardship and homelessness and people dying of conditions related to being cold. Last week, Ofgem announced the energy price cap would rise to an average of £3,549 in five weeks’ time. This is almost triple what it was a year ago, leaving people facing average energy bills of £500 a month and more. Experts have predicted this will further increase to £700 a month in January. These kinds of sums will hurt the least affluent the most: low-income families with young children, pensioners living in poverty, people with disabilities. But only a slim minority of households are meaningfully insulated from a financial shock of this order. It is a crisis on the scale of the turmoil of 2008, which required a £137bn up front bailout to prevent banks collapsing and people’s savings evaporating, and of the economic impact of the pandemic, which required £70bn of furlough support to be paid to 11.7 million employees. Yet the only response of the Conservative government has been silence. Our lame-duck prime minister, Boris Johnson, would not stand down until the summer was over but has spent his last weeks in office holidaying abroad, while former prime ministers and experts pleaded for an emergency package to be swiftly developed and announced. Greg Hands, the energy minister, was abroad on the day that Ofgem, the energy regulator, made its announcement. The government offered no minister to tour the broadcast studios to reassure the public that the crisis is in hand. The party’s two candidates to be the next prime minister have been more focused on tearing chunks out of each other in an overly long and increasingly bitter contest than on cooperating to develop a plan that would be implemented by whoever wins. It is unforgivable to have a group of Conservative politicians in government who care so little for the country and who have so little respect for the people who live in it that they think it acceptable to neglect their responsibilities in this way. Neither Liz Truss nor Rishi Sunak has grappled with the crisis they would inherit as prime minister. Truss has promised tens of billions of tax cuts that will do precisely nothing to help the hardest-up cope and will deliver the most support to the wealthiest households who are the ones who can get by. She has preposterously said she was not in favour of “handouts”; the equivalent of saying she would have been happy to let the banks collapse in 2008 or for people to have become destitute as a result of being laid off during the lockdowns of 2020. That she is almost certainly likely to be the next prime minister is a disgraceful indicator of the state of the Conservative party. Sunak has at least indicated he would target support at the least well off, but has said nothing that shows he understands the scale of what is needed. The size of the energy price rises is such that measures targeted through the benefit system can no longer be sufficient, because they would miss too many households for whom extra support is vital. It requires an extraordinary response. Labour has put forward one such proposal: to cap energy bills at their current rates, at a cost of around £30bn over six months or £60bn over a year, partly funded through an increased windfall tax on oil and gas producers. There are other ways of delivering this support, such as bringing in a new social energy tariff that cuts bills for all but the wealthiest households or at least taxing back some of the costs of this from the richest 10% or 20% of households. But Keir Starmer has understood what is needed in a way that his Conservative counterparts in government have not. The immediate cause of this crisis is Vladimir Putin’s campaign of terror in Ukraine. He is trying to hold the world hostage by limiting access to Russian gas. There is no choice but to collectively pay the price. But Conservative prime ministers have taken bad decisions over the last decade that have left the UK more exposed to this crisis than it otherwise might have been. David Cameron scrapped subsidies for solar power, energy efficiency schemes and onshore wind, making the Britain more reliant on fossil fuels. The government has allowed the UK’s gas storage facilities to close, so that we now have capacity to store just 2% of annual demand. Every day that passes without ministers stepping up to announce an emergency rescue package is a day that more people have to live sick with worry, not knowing how they will make it through the winter. Businesses that have been left damaged by the pandemic have no certainty about whether they will be able to survive the next few months. It is a monumental and unconscionable failure by the governing class. Sunak and Truss cannot leave it any longer before announcing either joint or separate emergency packages that they would implement should they find themselves in Downing Street.

The energy security strategy to be unveiled on Thursday will acknowledge the need to move away from fossil fuels, the Guardian understands, but still allow for licences to explore new oil and gas fields to be expedited and more production from existing North Sea fields. Ministers are expected to say the UK needs more oil and gas in the short term, including new sources of fossil fuel imports, to replace the small proportion of UK oil and gas that comes from Russia, and ease pressure on prices. The government will present North Sea oil and gas as lower carbon than imported gas, according to a Whitehall source, to meet the UK’s needs while ramping up renewables and nuclear power. Yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change presented a “now or never” warning on Monday, showing that new fossil fuel exploration will put the Paris agreement target of limiting global heating to 1.5C beyond reach. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who will present the energy strategy, is strongly in favour of ramping up renewable energy over oil and gas, but under pressure from Tory rightwingers the government is set to offer a heavy emphasis on gas, with few measures on insulation or switching to heat pumps. The strategy will also set out: A review of the scientific advice on the safety of fracking. The Guardian understands that Kwarteng thinks fracking in the UK is unrealistic and uneconomic, but under pressure from the right will keep the option open. Doubling the target on the use of hydrogen, from 5GW to 10GW, of which half will come from “blue” hydrogen created from fossil fuels, despite evidence that it emits more carbon than coal. Ministers are expected to present blue hydrogen as a necessary bridge to future “green” hydrogen from renewable energy, but campaigners say it will lock in high emissions. A boost to offshore wind, with the expansion of existing coastal offshore windfarms and potential new floating platforms in deeper waters, but solar energy risks being missed. Investment in new nuclear reactors being made easier. Few new measures on ramping up heat pumps and no comprehensive national programme to insulate housing on the scale experts say is feasible and would make a real difference to the cost of living. Hopes for a major loosening of planning regulations in England that would allow more onshore wind will be dashed, owing to cabinet opposition. This is despite multiple opinion polls showing a large majority of people in favour of windfarms, including most Conservative voters and people in areas near actual and proposed turbines. Green campaigners said new North Sea fields licensed today would produce no gas for years or decades but result in continued higher emissions long into the future. Meanwhile, the bigger opportunity – of cutting energy waste – risks being missed. The government’s independent climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has expressed its strong disapproval of plans for more extraction in the North Sea, but said last month it was powerless to prevent it. Philip Evans, oil and gas campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Rushing to sign off new fossil fuel licences that’ll take decades to get going would be no help in standing up to Vladimir Putin, and would actively make the climate crisis worse. The quickest and smartest solution to the energy challenge and the cost of living crisis is a huge push to tackle energy waste. If your bathtub is leaking, you should fix the leak – not just turn up the taps.” Fixing the leaks seems to be low down on the government’s priority list, however. Successive attempts to insulate Britain have failed, for various reasons: poor administration, in last year’s disastrous green homes grant; complex rules and low incentives for its predecessor “green deal” scheme that was abandoned in 2015; and overall a half-hearted, short-term and piecemeal approach from the government. Experts say what is needed is a concerted nationwide push to roll out insulation, double glazing and heat pumps, concentrating first on households in or at risk of energy poverty. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the trade body Energy UK, said: “The benefits of making our homes energy efficient are so overwhelming that nobody seriously disagrees with its importance, but as a country our efforts so far have got nowhere near the scale required. Now is surely the time to press ahead with something that is proven to [reduce bills] by hundreds of pounds a year permanently.” There is little sense that the government is prepared to put in the large-scale effort required. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at E3G, warned: “There is technical potential to halve gas consumption in UK homes. But to realise that extraordinary potential means unleashing a new wave of public investment to help every household to make their home super energy efficient. This requires a wartime effort to build up an army of installers to insulate our homes and fit heat pumps and to ensure it is affordable for everyone.” If the UK wants to stop importing gas by next winter, that would be theoretically possible if every home were made energy efficient, according to calculations by Jan Rosenow, director of the Regulatory Assistance Project. He said: “We import about 150 terawatt-hours of gas for home heating every year. None of this would be needed if we insulated our homes and switched to heat pumps. “We could save more gas than we import for heating with existing technologies. What is needed is the government to step up its policies now to roll out insulation and deploy heat pumps as quickly as possible.” Behaviour change is also out of favour. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has urged people to turn down their thermostats by just 1C, from about 22C on average to 21C – which is still at the upper end of comfortable. But the government is reluctant to call on people to do anything that could be regarded as a sacrifice. Another area of concern is solar power. Offshore wind – Boris Johnson’s favourite form of renewable energy – will get a big boost in the strategy, but solar could lose out despite being the cheapest form of power in the UK and the fastest to get up and running, according to Chris Hewett, chief executive of the industry body Solar Energy UK. He said the UK could reach 54GW capacity for solar power by 2030 – about 17% of the UK’s electricity needs – with the right backing. Plans for some large solar farms have run into opposition, and solar panels are still expensive for most households, despite the removal of VAT on panels. Hewett said: “To unlock the full potential, we need to see the government setting an ambitious target and speeding up investment in the modernisation of our power networks. Supportive planning guidance and a formal recognition that land within a solar farm is frequently used for agriculture or to enhance biodiversity would also enable solar to play an important role in rural economies.” The Guardian understands there are no plans for the government to seek “wriggle room” on missing or delaying the UK’s carbon budgets or legally binding net zero target."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-plan-panel-tax-oil-gas-giants","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-08T14:18:33Z","webTitle":"Does Liz Truss’s plan offer solutions to the UK’s energy crisis? | The panel","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-plan-panel-tax-oil-gas-giants","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/08/liz-truss-energy-plan-panel-tax-oil-gas-giants","fields":{"headline":"Does Liz Truss’s plan offer solutions to the UK’s energy crisis? Our panel’s verdict","bodyText":"Caroline Lucas: This moment required visionary thinking – not outdated economic dogma The country is facing multiple crises of staggering proportions: an energy security crisis, a cost of living scandal, and an accelerating climate emergency. This moment required bold, visionary thinking grounded in compassion – not cold and outdated economic dogma. It did not call for fracking – a disaster for climate policy, and a measure which would fail to meet even 1% of our energy needs for more than three years. It did not call for a suspension of green levies, when we know that 90% of the rise in the price cap is caused by spiralling global gas prices. And while it did call for a price cap freeze, it should not be at the unaffordable rate of £2,500 when households are already struggling to make ends meet – it must be backdated to last October’s level, and accompanied by measures including reinstating and doubling the universal credit uplift. We urgently need a retrofit revolution, a massive investment in domestic insulation to deliver warmer homes and lower bills – yet Liz Truss failed to even mention the words “energy demand reduction” or “efficiency”. It called for policies that will help deliver energy security while simultaneously incentivising demand reduction for wealthier households. A rising block tariff, for example, would help end fuel poverty and ensure proper targeting of support for the poorest. And with new renewables now nine times cheaper than gas, the 650 wind and solar projects oven-ready and waiting can and should be delivered right now. The prime minister wanted to “deliver” – but she has delivered sticking plasters rather than a bold vision of clean, green and affordable energy for the long term. Caroline Lucas is the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion Miatta Fahnbulleh: Communities, not energy companies, are being asked to foot the bill Liz Truss’s intervention to freeze the energy price cap for 18 months is a big one that shows the government has finally grasped the scale of the challenge. It will stop the catastrophic rise in energy prices and provide immediate relief to millions. But there is a sting in the tail. By refusing to ask energy companies – making £170bn of excess profits over the next two years – to foot the bill, this may well come at the cost of investment in public services, communities and the transition to clean energy that we so desperately need. And for families on low-to-modest incomes, energy bills of £2,500 a year will be a sizeable hit when combined with the rising cost of food and everyday essentials. Yet the government has done very little to protect people from wider cost of living pressures by boosting their incomes. There is an alternative. After a six-month freeze, the government could introduce a system of free basic energy with a rising tariff for more energy use, alongside a major effort to insulate our homes. It could provide a £750 cost of living allowance for all households – paid for through a tougher windfall tax on energy companies – plus an energy top up to benefits worth £1,000. This would offset the full cost of living rises for 80% of families and gear support towards those who need it most. Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation Isabel Hardman: Truss wants to be seen as someone transforming Britain Today’s announcement was intensely political. The way it was made shows that Liz Truss doesn’t want to be seen just as the prime minister trying to fix problems (of which there are many), but as someone who is transforming Britain. She wants to campaign on her announcement, rather than just tick it off her lengthy to-do list. She used a Commons debate, rather than the normal ministerial statement, to outline her plans. This meant that she wasn’t taking questions from MPs across the house for an hour or so. Instead, she made her speech, Keir Starmer made his, and then everyone else made theirs. Both she and Starmer were happy to play up the divide between their parties over the funding of the policy, and both think their arguments suit them. For Truss, it is about making sure the businesses in this sector aren’t strangled. For Starmer, it is about showing that Labour is on the side of working people, not profit-making giants. Because of their contentment with their positions, we will see both sides making as much of today’s announcement as they can. The difference, though, is that Truss won’t be quite so keen on detailed scrutiny of what she’s announced – which is another reason she didn’t go for a format where she’d have to answer questions. Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator and a presenter of Radio 4’s The Week in Westminster Max Wakefield: She promises to fix a fossil fuelled crisis with more fossil fuels Liz Truss looks to have chosen to double down on the mistakes of her predecessors, with a promise to fix a fossil fuelled crisis with more fossil fuels, and a continued refusal to help us insulate our homes. While finding vast sums to prevent people freezing in their homes this winter is now unavoidable – and thus should be met as much as possible by a windfall tax on the very oil and gas firms this £130bn will flow to – the permanent solutions to energy crises have once again been left out in the cold by a government hellbent on ignoring them. Actual policies to promote cheap onshore wind, solar power and home insulation measures are nowhere to be found among the glut of doomed measures designed to dig up yet more carbon to burn. They will do nothing to bring down bills – or indeed floodwaters in Pakistan. Successive Conservative governments have wilfully dismissed solutions that would have reduced our reliance on gas – and our contribution to the climate crisis – over the last decade. For now it looks as if we must continue to pay the price of their incompetent leadership.

But a community group is hoping to transform the east London plot – currently used by Thames Water – into what is believed to be the capital’s first new wild swimming ponds since Hampstead Ponds were created in 1777. Under the proposed plans, residents want to buy the government-owned 5.68-hectare site on the polluted River Lea in Waltham Forest and turn it into a “brownfield rainforest”, featuring two free-to-use pools, community spaces, an anaerobic digester, a cafe and a make-and-repair hub. East London Waterworks Park’s two ponds, measuring around 1,600 sq metres and 1,400 sq metres, would be fed by rainwater cleaned by reed beds and aquatic plants, and the site would run on hydro and solar power, and have a capacity of 1,000 people a day. “There’s a real desire to swim in open water to reconnect with nature, and there just isn’t enough capacity at the moment to respond to that desire,” said the chair of the project, Abigail Woodman, who works in educational publishing. The idea came from members of the community after government plans to build two free schools on the site, which they purchased from Thames Water, fell through. Following a public meeting three years ago, swimming fast became a popular idea. “For the community, this is about embodying hope, because it can feel pretty bleak what’s going on at the moment,” said Woodman. “This is about saying we can make things better, we do have the capacity and the power to do that if we come together and work hard.” Amid record temperatures and drought, this summer has seen demand for wild swimming continue to soar following rising interest during the pandemic. But with pollution warnings and limited capacity in a small number of dedicated locations, particularly in cities, plus entry fees, the options are limited. William Upton, chair of the City of London Corporation’s Hampstead Heath management committee, said “a record number of swimmers” have been using the Mixed Bathing Pond, Highgate Men’s Bathing Pond and Kenwood Ladies’ Bathing Pond, which each regularly draw more than 1,500 swimmers a day. The ponds were originally created in the 17th and 18th centuries as reservoirs before some were later turned into bathing pools. Other wild swimming sites, West Reservoir in Hackney and Beckenham Place Park lake in Lewisham, have since opened, but the new project believes its ponds will be the first created in centuries. So far, residents have raised more than £210,000 in crowdfunding in just a few weeks. The target is £500,000 by 28 October if the project is to progress to the next stage. Providing the purchase goes through and relevant planning permission is given, it is hoped the ponds will open to volunteers in 2027 and to the public two years later. With a child poverty rate of more than 42% in Waltham Forest, making the facility free to use is a vital aspect of the project. “We will divorce our ability to bring income and make sure that we can sustain the site from its usage so that it is open and inclusive to all,” said Woodman. “So a world run for people and nature.” As well as bringing positive associations with physical and mental health, the ponds would also draw attention to water use at a time of dwindling supplies by displaying real-time data on how they use water. “It’s very easy when you live in a city to be divorced from what is going on with our water supply,” said Woodman. “The water companies are saying we’re low on water. but it’s still coming out of the tap.” Ed Accura, co-founder of the Black Swimming Association (BSA) and producer of the Blacks Can’t Swim documentaries, said the project would be a positive addition to the area, but that to many people, swimming does not feel “relatable”. Research by Sport England found that 95% of Black adults and 80% of Black children in England, and 93% of Asian adults and 78% of Asian children, do not swim. Calling for education on water safety to be a top priority, he said that more than 100 people have so far taken part in the BSA’s water orientation and familiarisation pilot programme in Hackney, and there are plans to extend it around the country. Accura, 56, who grew up in Tottenham, said that a few years ago he would have been “totally indifferent” to the creation of new wild swimming ponds. When he first got into a pool he felt fear. “Since then, I’ve been learning how to swim, getting more accustomed to getting into water. I feel relieved.” Woodman said the project plans to work with young people to create a water safety campaign targeted at their peers. The scheme has the support of Shirley Rodrigues, London’s deputy mayor for environment and energy, who said it was an “excellent example of community-led action”. She said the mayor, Sadiq Khan, is “committed to bringing nature closer to Londoners and rewilding the city by protecting, restoring and improving its green and blue spaces… It is essential that proposals like this enhance the local area and that, in creating new parks and open spaces, we are helping to build a better London for everyone.” The Department for Education, which is understood to be responsible for the site’s sale, and Waltham Forest council said they were unable to comment on the proposed plans at this stage. Thames Water, which met East London Waterworks Park in July, said it is “keen to support all stakeholder groups who want to develop wild swimming areas”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-12T08:58:28Z","webTitle":"Breaking from China’s clean energy dominance ‘imperative’, US and Australia say after new climate tech deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","fields":{"headline":"Breaking from China’s clean energy dominance ‘imperative’, US and Australia say after new climate tech deal","bodyText":"The US and Australia have stressed the importance of breaking the near-complete reliance on China for zero emissions technology supplies while signing a new agreement that promises to accelerate the development of climate solutions. In a joint press conference in Sydney, the US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, and the Australian climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announced a “net zero technology acceleration partnership”, including an initial focus on long-duration energy storage and digitising power grids. They said the agreement was motivated in part by the need for a clean energy and critical mineral supply chain that did not depend as much on China, which is responsible for about 80% of solar energy technology manufacturing. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), it is expected to reach 95% by 2025. Granholm compared the risk of relying on China for clean technology to the west’s over-dependence on Russian fossil fuels – a mistake that sparked a global energy crisis after it invaded Ukraine. “I worry that China has big-footed a lot of the technology and supply chains that could make us vulnerable if we don’t develop our own supply chains,” she said. “From an energy security point of view, it is imperative that nations that share the same values develop our own supply chains, not just for the climate, but for our energy security. “We’ve seen what happens when we rely too much on one entity for our source of fuel, and we don’t want that to happen – so to diversify those energy sources and to link up with partners is part of our energy security.” Bowen agreed. “It’s good for our own economies and it’s good for our national security to have supply chains among ourselves, but also amongst friends and allies,” he said. The Australian minister said the partnership would “work to ensure critical minerals supply chains are secure and resilient”. That meant ramping up production, processing and manufacturing capacity, he said. “The partnership is a commitment to make climate change a centrepiece of our alliance with the US,” he said. Granholm said the switch to renewables could be “the greatest peace plan of all” as no country could be “held hostage” over its access to solar and wind resources. “They have not ever been weaponised, nor will they be,” she said. The Australia-US partnership included few details, but said the countries would also focus on supporting the integration of variable renewable energy and the development of hydrogen and carbon dioxide removal, including direct air capture technology. It was revealed on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum, co-hosted by the Australian government and the IEA. A common theme among speakers at the forum was the importance of focusing on renewable energy to address the crisis caused by Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, said the world was in the middle of “the first global energy crisis” due to its over-reliance on Russian oil, gas and coal. He said it might get worse as the northern hemisphere entered winter, but expressed hope it could lead to governments accelerating the shift towards renewable energy. Birol said about 40% of energy policies across the globe were introduced as a response to the oil crisis of the 1970s. He was “very hopeful” that the move to clean energy would be accelerated in a similar way now. He said solar power had grown dramatically across the globe because it was cheap, and that people who argued that renewable energy policy was in part to blame for the crisis were “absolutely wrong”. “Factually and, in my view, ethically, this is very wrong and misleading,” he said. The forum was opened by Anthony Albanese arguing Australia had rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partner”. The prime minister later told reporters it was time for Australia to “stop the nonsense”, “wake up” and work across the political divide to end the climate wars. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese said the latest round of catastrophic flooding made the case to get on with legislating a more ambitious policy. He said Labor would attempt to legislate its medium-term emissions target when parliament resumed, and if MPs or senators chose to vote against the legislation they would be “held accountable for it”. The prime minister said he was open to “sensible amendments” but not “game playing about figures plucked from the air”, and reiterated that Labor intended to stick with its target of a 43% emissions cut by 2030 compared with 2005 that it had modelled last year. The Greens and some independents have called for a higher target – ranging from 50% to 75% – based on advice from climate scientists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2021/sep/09/lorde-releases-mini-album-maori-language-solar-power-new-zealand","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2021-09-09T06:06:33Z","webTitle":"‘Powerful experience’: Lorde releases mini-album in Māori language ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/sep/09/lorde-releases-mini-album-maori-language-solar-power-new-zealand","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2021/sep/09/lorde-releases-mini-album-maori-language-solar-power-new-zealand","fields":{"headline":"‘Powerful experience’: Lorde releases mini-album in Māori language ","bodyText":"Lorde has released a mini-album of tracks in Māori, describing the project as “powerful” and a “starting point” of a journey. The New Zealand singer re-recorded five tracks from her Solar Power album in te reo Māori, the indigenous language of Aotearoa New Zealand. It’s titled Te Ao Mārama, meaning “world of light”. Speaking to pop culture website the Spinoff, the 24-year-old artist said she consulted a wide a range of people – including Māori elders – on the project. That included consideration of the view held by some that te reo Māori should be spoken only by Māori. “It’s kind of scary to start any journey, but I guess that’s my thing; I am at the very beginning, and this project is a starting point,” the singer said. While some Māori artists and songwriters have large followings in New Zealand, hearing indigenous languages on commercial radio is rare. Lorde, who doesn’t speak the language, told the Spinoff that apart from learning a few simple songs at school, she wasn’t well prepared for recording in te reo. “It wasn’t something that was a big part of my life, and it was something that I had sort of sadness and a little bit of guilt around,” she said. She worked with translators to record the album, which has a focus on the wonders of the natural world. “It felt really big when we were doing it … It was really emotional. I’d never had any writing or recording experience like it. It was really powerful,” she said. Māori singer Hinewehi Mohi was among those involved in the project. “I think the most important thing is to do these kinds of projects with integrity. As we break down all those fears that people might have, then we’ll get an amazing perspective of ourselves and how we fit into the world, and you won’t see any more placards saying ‘stop ramming Māori down our throats’. Eventually,” she said. The proceeds of the sales of the album will go to two New Zealand charities, Forest &amp; Bird and Te Hua Kawariki Charitable Trust."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/nov/16/uae-cop28-host-lobby-climate-reputation-cop27","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-16T06:00:13Z","webTitle":"UAE using role as Cop28 host to lobby on its climate reputation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/16/uae-cop28-host-lobby-climate-reputation-cop27","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/nov/16/uae-cop28-host-lobby-climate-reputation-cop27","fields":{"headline":"UAE using role as Cop28 host to lobby on its climate reputation","bodyText":"The United Arab Emirates has been using its role as the host of next year’s UN climate conference to launder its international reputation, long before this year’s event – Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh – began. The Emirates, which will host Cop28 in November 2023, hired public relations and lobbying agencies specifically to promote its role as the future host before this year’s conference had began, an unusual move that exceeded the promotional efforts of past host nations and suggests an increased Emirati role in this year’s Cop27 conference. One US PR firm, FleishmanHillard, composed a series of letters to propose that Emirati ministers attend conferences or events last July, most containing the phrase “the UAE is hosting Cop28 next year and will be involved with Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh”. Another, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, contacted Republican and Democrat US politicians who were either pushing environmental policies or in favour of fossil fuels, alerting them that the UAE would host Cop28, just days after it was announced. The UAE’s keenness to display its involvement in Cop27 and its hosting of Cop28 before either conference had begun, speaks to its outsized political influence on Egypt and its desire to portray itself as a leading global partner on environmental issues, despite being a petrostate. The UAE sent 1,000 delegates to Cop27, the largest country delegation by far – twice as much as the next largest, Brazil. They included multiple representatives from public relations, artificial intelligence and real estate firms. 70 of the Emirati delegation are linked to oil and gas companies, according to data compiled by the organisations Corporate Accountability, Global Witness and Corporate Europe Observatory, notably Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, who is both the CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and the UAE’s climate envoy. The UAE president, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, addressed the world leaders’ plenary session in Sharm el-Sheikh, and began by discussing oil and gas supplies from the Emirates. “The UAE is a responsible energy supplier, and we will continue to play that role as we pursue a transition to alternate resources and technologies,” he said. “By virtue of our geology, the oil and gas we have in the UAE is among the least carbon-intensive in the world. Nevertheless, we will continue to work towards reducing carbon emissions in the sector.” The UAE has declared its intention to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, although the tiny Gulf nation continues to draw at least 30% of its GDP directly from oil and gas, with much of the remaining amount coming from industries heavily linked to fossil fuel consumption, such as airlines, tourism or construction. Longtime observers of Emirati policies say that the prospect of a smooth transition away from fossil fuels appears unlikely under current conditions. Matthew Hedges, an analyst of UAE affairs and the author of a book on Gulf governance who was imprisoned for six months in the Emirates during his doctoral research, said that the Emirates’ lobbying around climate technologies, Cop27 and Cop28 “diverts the discussion away from practical outputs to simply communication”. In his role as both the head of ADNOC and UAE climate envoy, Jaber recently said: “policies aimed at divesting from hydrocarbons too soon, without adequate viable alternatives, are self-defeating”. Jaber has also sometimes made other public statements about the climate crisis intended to present a more positive outlook. “We need more realism about the scale of the challenge and more optimism about our capacity to solve it,” he told a conference recently, adding that the UAE sees itself as a “consensus builder” for Cop28. The UAE’s record of mixed public statements on how to transition away from fossil fuels is reflected in lobbying efforts targeting politicians that began just three days after the announcement in November 2021 that they would host Cop28. Filings with the US Department of Justice show the UAE contacted media organisations in order to boost the perception of its action on climate issues, while also focusing on senators and congresspeople who had vastly different voting records on legislation on the climate crisis and fossil fuels. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld received $2.85m from the Emirates’ embassy in Washington DC for contacting politicians on both sides of the aisle to inform them about the UAE hosting Cop28 in the weeks after the announcement. This included senators with a legislative record of policies intended to curb wildfires and environmental damage caused by the climate crisis, such as Oregon senator Jeff Merkley and several other Democrats. The lobbying efforts also targeted others with a record of policies intended to buoy the fossil fuel industries, including the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who has said the climate crisis is “no reason to destroy the fossil fuel industry”, and senator James Inhofe who said human-made climate change was “the greatest hoax” ever perpetrated on Americans. Inhofe also labelled the US Environmental Protection Agency an “activist organisation” which he says has unnecessarily burdened farmers and fossil fuel producers. The UAE’s efforts to lobby around Cop28 are in addition to at least $10m in additional existing lobbying and public relations contracts with firms based in the US, intended to improve perceptions of the UAE, or of political or economic ties which were active at that time. Fossil fuel boss Vicki Hollub, CEO of Occidental Petroleum, is part of the UAE’s delegation at Cop27 in Egypt. At an event at the climate summit on Friday, she said people who call for the end of the oil and gas industry “have no clue what that would mean” and said rising climate disasters were the world’s fault, not just the oil and gas industry. Michael Hartt of FleishmanHillard rebuffed suggestions that the UAE’s lobbying efforts stating their involvement in Cop27 and Cop28 were unusual. “Nothing was meant by the word ‘involved’ beyond that the UAE will attend Cop27 as a participant, as it has at previous Cops, alongside other government delegations, international bodies and other organisations from around the world committed to progress on climate change,” he said. The UAE shares deep political and financial ties with Egypt, after almost a decade of support to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, who swept to power after a military coup in 2013. Abu Dhabi also stepped in to assist Sisi financially, both with an initial cash injection after the coup and more recently with a $2bn purchase of state-held stakes in Egyptian companies, intended to help the north African nation stave off a financial crisis. A UAE government official also shrugged off FleishmanHillard’s use of the word “involved”, in its communications on behalf of the Emirates, denying that this has resulted in any kind of financial or organisational support for Cop27. When asked about lobbying efforts, they said “the UAE held a series of meetings with counterparts in and around the United Nations general assembly to discuss climate action and the UAE’s participation at Cop27 … [this] is common practice and it is not considered as lobbying. We will participate in Cop27 in the same way that other countries do.” Yet US Department of Justice filings show that since September last year, shortly before the UAE was announced as the host of Cop28, the Emirates increased its lobbying and PR efforts around climate issues. This included at least $126,500 in agreements with FleishmanHillard intended to achieve a “general positive reputational impact for the UAE”, such as advertising claims about a Emirati government company producing some of its aluminium using solar power. In September this year, filings show that Masdar, a renewable energy company based in Abu Dhabi which is also headed by Jaber, hired three PR strategists for an undisclosed amount “to support the UAE in its role as host country in 2023 for Cop28”. Hedges believes the UAE is less interested in divesting from oil and finding alternative energy resources than its communications might suggest. “They can’t afford it, and the message is that: you’re expecting us to compete at the same level as developed economies, which is not possible without oil. There need to be active policies in place, but the transition away from oil is not apparent in any way, and there’s no serious intent to go further,” he said. “Egypt can’t do a huge amount without the help of the UAE,” he added. “It’s simply another way to try to help maintain international legitimacy for both countries. It’s another platform that can be used to say: ‘Look at all the good we’re doing, not just what we’re doing ourselves, but how we’re helping our allies within the region.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2021/dec/16/weatherwatch-scientists-send-saildrones-robot-boats-hurricanes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2021-12-16T06:00:37Z","webTitle":"Scientists send robot boats into the eye of hurricanes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/16/weatherwatch-scientists-send-saildrones-robot-boats-hurricanes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2021/dec/16/weatherwatch-scientists-send-saildrones-robot-boats-hurricanes","fields":{"headline":"Scientists send robot boats into the eye of hurricanes","bodyText":"Sending a small sailing boat to explore the interior of a hurricane may seem like a bad idea, but that is exactly what meteorologists from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration did in October. There was no danger though because the seven-metre vessel was crewless. Saildrones are robot vessels that can stay at sea indefinitely with a combination of wind and solar power. Some, like Saildrone Explorer SD 1045, have been modified to handle 140mph winds and giant waves. The Saildrone has a rigid sail called a wing. The hurricane wing is half the height of a standard wing, like reefing a traditional sail to reduce the risk of damage by decreasing its area. An earlier version tested in the Antarctic in 2019 could sail only downwind, whereas the new wing allows the drone to “run” and sail upwind like a traditional yacht. Greg Foltz, an NOAA researcher, says the Saildrone project should provide useful data on rapid intensification, when hurricane winds gain in strength over the course of a few hours. Intensification can be dangerous to coastal communities because it gives so little warning.

After days of record-breaking heat that tested California’s energy capacity, baked moisture out of the drought-stricken landscapes and spurred the spread of deadly fires , the arrival of Tropical Storm Kay produced heavy rains that caused flash floods and threatened more trouble for the state’s electric grid. Showers hit the San Diego area early on Friday afternoon, and more rain is expected as the storm moves north throughout the day and into the weekend. Kay made landfall as a category 1 hurricane along the coast of Baja California, Mexico, before it was downgraded to a tropical storm. The storm whipped up gusts of 109mph in the San Diego mountains, according to the National Weather Service, as high winds sent trees and power lines tumbling, the Los Angeles Times reported. The storm came during a week of extreme weather in California and across the American west, as several dangerous events overlapped. “This is the time of year where we get a lot of these features – just not necessarily all at once,” said Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Los Angeles. Along with rising temperatures that can occur at this time of year, “the fire threat is always there”, he added, noting that the duration of this heatwave – 10 days – was particularly intense. “Individually those are things we deal with this time of year. It just so happened that in this case we had the hot temperatures very quickly followed by this tropical system,” he said. “That’s the way it worked out and it makes for a really crazy time.” Fire risks are mounting as tens of thousands have already been forced to flee from fast-moving flames. Both the Mosquito fire burning in the northern part of California and the Fairview fire to the south exhibited erratic and dangerous fire behavior including large plumes, swirls and rapid spread, as they left destruction in their wake. The blazes show no signs of slowing until critical conditions change. Strong winds with gusts above 40mph complicated containment efforts on the Fairview fire which had surged across more than 27,463 acres by Friday morning. With just 5% containment, officials warned that the conditions were creating risks of long range spotting, where flames can jump more than a mile ahead. Two people died while fleeing flames on Monday and at least 12 structures have been destroyed. More than 18,000 homes still lay in its path, officials said in an update Thursday evening. To the north in the Sierra Nevada, the Mosquito fire also continued to burn out of control, scorching at least 29,585 acres nd threatening 3,600 homes in Placer and El Dorado counties, while blanketing the region in smoke. By Friday morning the blaze was still 0% contained. Flames jumped the American River, burning structures in the mountain hamlet of Volcanoville and moving closer to the towns of Foresthill, home to about 1,500 people, and Georgetown, population 3,000. Fire spokesperson Chris Vestal called the fast-moving blaze an “extreme and critical fire threat”. Stefani Lake evacuated her hilltop home near Georgetown on Thursday after sheriff’s deputies knocked on doors telling people to get out. “The dogs are in the back of the car, I’ve got a room for the night, so I’m ready to leave,” Lake told the Sacramento Bee. “Wow, &amp; yikes, are all I’ve got to say,” climate scientist Daniel Swain said on Twitter of the fire, sharing photos of the intense smoke formations emanating out of the blaze. “Explosive wildfire plumes like this – which resemble, from meteorological perspective, volcanic eruptions or nuclear explosions – are all too common these days. I hope everyone in Volcanoville makes it out.” The Mosquito fire’s cause remained under investigation. The utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) notified California’s Public Utilities Commission that the US Forest Service placed caution tape around the base of a PG&amp;E transmission pole but that no damage could be seen. PG&amp;E said unspecified “electrical activity” occurred close in time to the report of the fire on 6 September. After a milder-than-expected summer, California officials are now bracing for an intense autumn, when fire risks typically mount. Parched and overgrown landscapes are now primed to burn after extreme heat left already-dried plants with devastatingly low moisture levels. Although big blazes are a natural and important part of the California climate, rising temperatures and a history of land management policies that left high-risk areas overgrown, have shifted conditions, intensifying blazes and the harm they cause. Fire threats are lingering across the American west this week, prompting the National Interagency Fire at Center to boost the country’s preparedness level to 4, indicating that more than half of all available resources had already been deployed as need grows. With months of the highest risks still ahead, nearly 6.5m acres have already burned across the US this year. Dozens of fires are burning in several states, including Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. In Oregon, utility companies shut down power to tens of thousands of customers on Friday as dry easterly winds swept into the region in the hopes that it would lessen the risk of wildfires in extremely dry and hot conditions. Several areas were also blanketed in a thick haze as smoke spread across the region, creating unhealthy air quality and straining energy supplies. Wildfire smoke and the cloud cover created uncertainty about solar power production in afternoon hours when temperatures rise toward their peaks, said Elliot Mainzer, president and CEO of the California Independent System Operator. Operators of California’s power grid issued another “flex alert” call for voluntary cuts in use of electricity and expanded the period by two hours, 3pm to 10pm. Storm and wind conditions associated with the approaching hurricane were likely to create a new set of risks for power shortages in southern California, Mainzer noted. Though California’s energy supply was strained for days amid the searing heat, the state has avoided ordering rolling power outages. Residents jumped into action, conserving their use when emergency alerts were issued. But there’s more heat ahead. “The seemingly endless heatwave that has been plaguing California will finally becoming to an end across at least southern California, but not before two more very hot days and very warm nights,” the Los Angeles-area weather office wrote. Meteorologist Mike Wofford noted that even as temperatures drop off, aided by the incoming storm, humidity may be an issue. “It is still going to be very warm,” he said. “It is going to be tropical so to a lot of people it won’t offer a lot of relief.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2021-11-10T05:38:10Z","webTitle":"Central Melbourne could generate three-quarters of its power from solar panels, study suggests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2021/nov/10/central-melbourne-could-generate-three-quarters-of-its-power-from-solar-panels-study-suggests","fields":{"headline":"Central Melbourne could generate three-quarters of its power from solar panels, study suggests","bodyText":"Central Melbourne has the potential to generate three-quarters of its electricity needs from solar power, according to new modelling. By integrating more solar panels into roofs, walls and windows, the City of Melbourne could generate 2,354 gigawatt hours of energy a year – equivalent to 74% of its current electricity consumption, the Monash University research suggests. Prof Jacek Jasieniak, a co-author of the study, said the capacity of solar panels currently installed in central Melbourne was only a fraction of what was possible. “There’s a massive opportunity to build photovoltaics into a city, and Melbourne CBD … could be, as a collective, a distributed energy powerhouse,” he said. The modelling focused on the City of Melbourne, a 37.4 sq km municipal area that includes the central business district, mid-rise developments in the inner-city suburbs of Carlton and South Yarra, and the industrial area of Port Melbourne. Rooftop panels accounted for the vast majority – 88% – of the potential solar energy the area could generate. Generating 2,354 gigawatt hours annually was “an ambitious target,” Jasieniak said. “That’s assuming that you’re getting pretty high-efficiency devices and you’re covering about 80% of the rooftops that are available.” To produce that amount of energy, Jasieniak estimated several million solar panels would need to be installed in central Melbourne. The researchers used 3D models that simulated how much sunlight would illuminate buildings during the day. The modelling took into account seasonal variations in the direction of the sun, the shadows cast by buildings, and building properties such as rooftop space and window-to-wall ratios. Jasieniak said the challenge was that many buildings have multiple tenants “and it’s not clear whose responsibility is it to ensure that there are maximised photovoltaics on those buildings”. The study made calculations based on the efficiency of PERC photovoltaic cells, an existing rooftop solar technology developed by University of New South Wales researcher Martin Green. It also assumed that solar panels would be integrated into building facades and windows, generating 8% and 4% of the calculated energy respectively. “True building-integrated photovoltaics replaces the wall,” Jasieniak said. While the technology to do that exists, he said, “it hasn’t been done at scale” on buildings in Australia yet. Solar windows – photovoltaic cells that generate energy but are transparent like glass – have been less commercially viable to date, because of their low efficiency of only 2% to 3%, Jasieniak said. “We’re working on technologies that increase efficiency by a factor of four or five.” His research group Exciton Science is collaborating with the CSIRO to develop solar windows made of a crystal material known as perovskite. Producing solar electricity close to where it is used minimises energy losses during transmission. “It needs to be a distributed network,” Jasieniak said, meaning it is spread across the city. He said there needs to be photovoltaics in fields to support areas where high density or solar integration was not possible. “You also want it to be in cities and in buildings.” Future building design could take sunlight and shadowing into account to maximise the potential of solar power, Jasieniak said. “In Melbourne, you could imagine that you could have slightly higher buildings towards the southern part of the city, so they can capture as much of that northerly sun as possible.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/apr/06/pm-to-put-nuclear-power-at-heart-of-uks-energy-strategy","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-04-06T21:30:35Z","webTitle":"PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK ’s energy strategy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/pm-to-put-nuclear-power-at-heart-of-uks-energy-strategy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/apr/06/pm-to-put-nuclear-power-at-heart-of-uks-energy-strategy","fields":{"headline":"PM to put nuclear power at heart of UK ’s energy strategy","bodyText":"Boris Johnson is to put nuclear energy at the heart of the UK’s new energy strategy, but ministers have refused to set targets for onshore wind and vowed to continue the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. Amid deep divisions among senior Conservatives, the strategy will enrage environmentalists, who say the government’s plans are in defiance of its own net-zero targets and neglect alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills. The prime minister will launch the plan on Thursday, after a period of intense political wrangling set against the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has convulsed energy markets and sent home energy bills rocketing. Whitehall sources said rows over the strategy between No 10, the Treasury and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) continued right up until the eve of publication, with an insider describing the process as “chaos”. The cabinet eventually agreed that atomic energy would form the backbone of the strategy, and up to eight new reactors are planned. Targets for offshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic low-carbon energy sources by 2030. But the plans risk infuriating environmental campaigners, after the opportunity to remove barriers to more onshore wind farms appeared to fall victim to Tory in-fighting, new North Sea drilling won the government’s blessing, and ministers appeared to open the door to fracking. Opposition parties were scathing about the strategy. Two former energy secretaries from Labour and the Liberal Democrats branded it “ludicrous” and “hopeless” for failing to expand onshore wind power or tackle energy efficiency. Ed Miliband, the Labour climate change secretary, said the energy relaunch was “in disarray” and would do nothing to help the millions of families facing an energy crisis now. “Boris Johnson has completely caved to his own backbenchers and now, ludicrously, his own energy strategy has failed on the sprint we needed on onshore wind and solar – the cheapest, cleanest forms of homegrown power,” he said. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader and another former energy secretary, added: “The Conservatives’ failure to help people cut their bills with an urgent energy insulation programme, the failure to back super-cheap onshore wind and the failure to back properly new technologies like tidal power and hydrogen is a total betrayal of families and pensioners across the UK.” The energy strategy outlines a wide-ranging plan to boost domestic energy production through a range of power sources. They include: Increasing nuclear capacity from 7 gigawatts to 24GW Offshore wind target raised from 40GW to 50GW (from 11GW today) Solar could grow five times from 14GW to 70GW by 2035 An “impartial” review into whether fracking is safe Up to 10GW of hydrogen power by 2030 Johnson said the plan will “reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices we cannot control, so we can enjoy greater energy self-sufficiency with cheaper bills”. “This plan comes in light of rising global energy prices, provoked by surging demand after the pandemic as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “This will be central to weaning Britain off expensive fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile gas prices set by international markets we are unable to control, and boosting our diverse sources of homegrown energy for greater energy security in the long term.” While some renewable domestic energy sources won backing, the wind industry’s hopes of getting the green light to double onshore capacity to 30GW appeared to have fallen victim to opposition from within the Conservative party to new projects, particularly in England. Communities who live near planned new projects could be offered incentives, such as guaranteed lower energy bills, but the plan does not include targets for increased generation. Cabinet colleagues have been at odds over whether to reform planning laws to spur faster development of onshore windfarms, which can take as little as a year to build and start contributing to the grid, but were described by transport secretary Grant Shapps as an “eyesore” at the weekend. Shapps and chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris, a longstanding opponent of onshore wind, are among a group of MPs who have sought to thwart a major rollout in England, with Michael Gove and business minister Kwasi Kwarteng – whose brief includes energy – among those to have pushed back. The business department is also understood to have been thwarted by the Treasury in a plan to channel £300m of budget underspend into a rapid rollout of energy efficiency upgrades that could aid homeowners in bringing down their bills. Solar won significant backing from the government, which said planning rules could be relaxed to favour development on non-protected land, enabling capacity to increase up to fivefold, from 14GW to 70GW. The target for hydrogen power will be doubled to 10GW by 2030 “subject to affordability and value for money”. Overall, “clean” energy sources could provide up to 40,000 new jobs, reaching a total of 480,000 by 2030, the government will say. But alongside the push for renewables sit plans that will alarm opponents of further oil and gas exploitation. The British Geological Survey will conduct an “impartial” review of whether fracking for shale gas can proceed safely, a move likely to spark fury among environmental campaigners about the controversial technology, particularly after a moratorium was imposed on the process in 2019. New North Sea oil and gas projects are also likely to be accelerated, although the strategy sets out proposals to limit emissions as much as possible. Nuclear power forms the centrepiece of the energy strategy. Ministers expect to begin a competitive selection process as early as next year for a new round of nuclear projects, although tensions between Downing Street and the Treasury over the cost of new projects, which are expected to require government investment, have yet to be resolved. The target of producing 25% of Britain’s electricity from atomic energy is likely to require tens of billions of pounds of new investment from private companies, with the state providing guarantees under a new “regulated asset base” funding model. A £120m “Future Nuclear Enabling Fund” will be launched this month in the hope of kickstarting projects, while a new body called Great British Nuclear will oversee the plans. National Grid has predicted that peak electricity demand will hit 85GW by 2050, up from 60GW today, because of factors such as the electrification of vehicles and home heating. The government said it could approve up to eight new reactors to help reach a target of generating 24GW of the total from nuclear power plants, which typically have more than one reactor. Some of the increase can be achieved by extending the life of the Sizewell B reactor, while the Hinkley Point C project is due for completion in 2027 and Rolls-Royce has the government’s blessing for small reactors nicknamed “mini-nukes”. Major projects that have already been through some form of planning, such as Sizewell C and Wylfa, on Anglesey, have been singled out by the government as among the first to win support. The target also implies new plants at sites whose locations have already been approved but where no plans are under way, such as Oldbury in Gloucestershire or Moorside (Sellafield) in Cumbria. While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted global discussion on how to reduce reliance on Kremlin-controlled oil and gas, it appears to have cooled the government’s resolve to limit the UK’s own fossil fuel production. Drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea is at odds with the government’s own net-zero targets. The government will justify the plans by saying that local exploitation of hydrocarbons emits less carbon than importing supplies from elsewhere. Ministers have also commissioned a new study to examine safety concerns about fracking, which polls have shown is deeply unpopular with the public. • This article was amended on 7 April 2022. An earlier version said “targets for onshore wind and solar power generation will also be raised, in a push for 95% of Great Britain’s electricity to come from domestic renewable energy sources by 2030”.

In 2019, Andrew received £750,000 from Nebahat Isbilen, a Turkish millionaire and wife of a former leading politician, who has claimed in the high court that she was told by her financial adviser Selman Turk to pay the sum to the prince in return for assistance with a passport application. It was later claimed in court documents that this was a false representation. Isbilen is now suing Turk in the high court, alleging that he defrauded her. Andrew offered no explanation on Friday as to why the money originally entered his bank account and why he paid it back in full after being approached by Isbilen’s lawyers 16 months after it was received. The Daily Mail has obtained a transcript of a phone call on 14 November 2019 between Andrew’s former aide Amanda Thirsk and bankers acting for Isbilen. In the call, the bankers queried the purpose of the £750,000 transfer from Isbilen’s account to the duke’s personal account at Coutts, and Thirsk, who was a senior member of the royal household at the time but no longer works there, said: “It’s a gift for the wedding, a wedding gift.” Responding to the latest reports, a spokesperson for Andrew said they could not comment while legal proceedings were ongoing. Isbilen had claimed that she had been told by Turk that the payment was for the prince’s assistance with a passport application, although it was later claimed this was a false representation. An affidavit by Isbilen that has been seen by the Guardian states that she later saw an email from Turk to her bank claiming the transfer was a “wedding gift to Princess Beatrice owing to the close connection between our families”. She adds: “This email is entirely false.” Beatrice married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a private ceremony in Windsor in July 2020. Turk was the founder and chief executive of Heyman AI, a digital challenger bank which, nine days before the £750,000 payment was made, received an award in person from Andrew at a Pitch@Palace event – a Dragons’ Den-style project for entrepreneurs created by the prince. On Friday it emerged that Beatrice’s mother and Andrew’s ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, also received payments of at least £225,000 from Turk via Alphabet Capital, said to be in connection with payment she was owed for her work with a solar power company. Ferguson’s spokesperson said: “The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him.” A spokesperson for Andrew said: “We are unable to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.” The Guardian has approached Turk for comment. The reports come after the prince settled a sexual assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum, reported to be as much as £12m. The out-of-court settlement in the US civil case meant the prince made no admission of guilt over claims by Giuffre that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. On Tuesday, Andrew made his first public appearance since the settlement, alongside his mother, the Queen, at a memorial service for his father, Prince Philip."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/aug/27/she-has-no-choice-liz-truss-faces-u-turn-on-energy-if-she-enters-no-10-mps-say","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-27T17:03:46Z","webTitle":"‘She has no choice’: Liz Truss faces U-turn on energy if she enters No 10, MPs say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/27/she-has-no-choice-liz-truss-faces-u-turn-on-energy-if-she-enters-no-10-mps-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/aug/27/she-has-no-choice-liz-truss-faces-u-turn-on-energy-if-she-enters-no-10-mps-say","fields":{"headline":"‘She has no choice’: Liz Truss faces U-turn on energy if she enters No 10, MPs say","bodyText":"For months, everyone in government had known that Friday was energy cap day, and at 7am the bad news duly dropped. Phones pinged as the nation woke to Ofgem’s confirmation that typical gas and electricity bills were to rise by a frightening 80%. Millions of people would be unable to cope, said charities. Even those on low or middle earnings who had some savings could see them entirely wiped out. It was a full-on national crisis, albeit long predicted. Consumer champion Martin Lewis tore around central London giving breathless interview after breathless interview, starting on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme at 7.30am. Lewis appeared on 11 separate outlets before 2pm, raging at government failure to act on his warnings, first issued back in March. But while Lewis was everywhere, and Labour’s shadow ministers piled in unopposed, the government was nowhere. Where, news producers asked, was the energy minister Greg Hands? Or indeed any other minister of the crown? Prime minister Boris Johnson, back from his second summer holiday, or the chancellor for another week at least, Nadhim Zahawi? Hours earlier Hands, whose responsibilities include energy retail markets, had tweeted that it was “great to visit Los Alamos National Laboratory, here in New Mexico,” where he had been holding “useful discussions” on nuclear fusion. When asked, mid-morning, if Hands was back at his desk, officials at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy seemed at first not to know. Then they said he was travelling to Indonesia for a G20 meeting. This despite the fact that he had been spotted late morning in his department office between flights, clearly with no time at all to entertain any media bids. With the government absent, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) released its own analysis showing that energy bills would outstrip many people’s incomes to the point where paying them would become “fantasy”. It was, the JRF made clear, terrifying. “In all my years, I haven’t double-checked a piece of analysis as much as this one because it is so staggering, it feels incorrect,” said Peter Matejic, the foundation’s chief analyst. “It is impossible to think a care worker or a shop assistant will have to scramble to find hundreds more pounds to pay for their heating or that the entirety of someone’s income for a whole year will be less than their energy bill. But that’s what these figures suggest will be the case unless significant further steps are taken quickly.” The growing sense of national anxiety that Matejic shared with millions will not, however, be addressed or eased for some time yet by anyone running the country. There are still eight days to go before the name of the next prime minister is announced. Then, once Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak is in No 10, the date for an emergency budget has to be set, options discussed, and eventually, choices made. Friday morning’s events added to a growing sense that the six-week Tory leadership contest has not only left a vacuum at the heart of power, but that it has taken place in a world some distance from reality. Not only has the search for a new Conservative leader and PM left government effectively suspended (at the start the cabinet agreed not to make any big financial decisions until it was over, despite the cost of living crisis) but the desire of the candidates to play to what they believe are the views of the tiny Tory “selectorate”, has made pragmatic policy formation impossible. Truss, the hot favourite, has spent weeks locking herself into potentially inflationary commitments to tax cuts, at the same time pledging to avoid “handouts” which everyone now knows are inevitable if those most in need are to get the help they need with their energy bills. Both candidates have also leaned away from green solutions to the energy crisis. At several hustings Truss has won applause from Tory members by dismissing solar power. But reality is closing in. Economists and MPs see danger and say something will have to give. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said Truss would have to swerve away from some of what of what she had being saying. He said: “She is bound to have to do substantial handouts and she is committed to substantial tax cuts. That is clearly going to be many tens of billions of additional borrowing, which will pose risks for the long-term stability of the public finances and potentially for the short-term outlook for inflation or interest rates.” All governments are struggling to find solutions. But there is a sense of urgent engagement in the EU that has been lacking in the UK. European governments are scrambling to find ways to protect households and businesses and the Czech Republic, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, is weighing calling an emergency energy summit to discuss bloc-wide price caps. Many countries have already taken action. Spain has capped gas prices for a year, halved VAT on energy bills and slashed another tax on electricity to 0.5%, and is taxing energy companies more, transferring the money to needy customers. Italy this month approved a new energy aid package worth €17bn, on top of €35bn earmarked since January for cost of living subsidies, and also aims to tax companies profiting from higher energy prices. Low-income earners are getting a €200 extra payout. France has forced the state-owned electricity utility EDF to limit wholesale price rises to 4% for a year and cut its tax on electricity consumption from €22.50 per megawatt hour to €1 for households and €0.50 for businesses. Further individual help is being decided. Germany enacted several energy-saving measures last week: temperatures in public buildings will be limited to 19C from September and heating turned off in common areas such as corridors. The private sector is being encouraged to follow suit. In the last two days Truss has indicated she will provide help as and when it is needed, but it will require a U-turn before she even becomes PM. David Gauke, the former Tory Treasury minister, said he believed she would have to announce some tax cuts to save face, but that these would provide nowhere near enough help. In effect he thinks that after six weeks of saying one thing she will have to do another, raising more questions about Tory leadership contests at times of crisis. “She is trying at the moment to present what she is going to do as very Conservative, whereas I suspect what she will end up doing is something that has a very substantial interventionist, handout measure at its heart, which is not the kind of politics she wants to do but I cannot see she has any choice.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/jul/21/big-oil-v-the-world-review-climate-crisis-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-21T21:00:42Z","webTitle":"Big Oil V the World review – how can these climate crisis deniers sleep at night?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/21/big-oil-v-the-world-review-climate-crisis-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/21/big-oil-v-the-world-review-climate-crisis-bbc","fields":{"headline":"Big Oil V the World review – how can these climate crisis deniers sleep at night?","bodyText":"Al Gore described it as “in many ways the most serious crime of the post-world war two era, whose consequences are almost unimaginable”. Can you guess which one the former vice-president meant? Genocide in the former Yugoslavia? Genocide in Rwanda? The attack on the twin towers? The oxymoronic “war on terror” that produced – rather than eliminated – terrorism? The nuclear arms race? The invasion of Ukraine? The crimes of Stalin, Mao, or Pol Pot? Or other ones I haven’t the space to cite? Gore is in fact referring to a very specific moment that occurred on 25 July 1997. That day, the US Senate voted by 95-0 for the Byrd-Hagel Resolution, ruling that the US should not sign a climate treaty that would become known as the Kyoto protocol – despite the Clinton administration’s desire for the US to be a world leader in the fight to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It meant that Clinton would only be allowed to take action when developing countries – particularly India and China – were bound by the same strictures. The worry, touted by purported experts (many of whom were briefed and funded by US oil companies), was that Kyoto would be a disaster for the US. Imposing strict emission controls on the US – while industrialising nations such as India and China were not similarly constrained – would cost the US upwards of 5,000 jobs, put more than 50 cents on a tank of gas, whack up electricity bills 25% to 50% and put the struggling US economy at a competitive disadvantage in international markets. Or so it was claimed. Jane McMullen’s excellent and shocking first instalment of a three-part series, Big Oil V The World (BBC Two) reveals another reason for senators Robert Byrd and Chuck Hagel’s resolution. For many years, the big oil lobby had poured scorn on the growing scientific orthodoxy that humanity is hurtling towards a climate catastrophe and that the leading reason is the rise in emissions of greenhouse gases. What I didn’t know, and this documentary helpfully explains, is that the US’s largest oil company, Exxon, had labs filled with researchers who had produced detailed reports showing the reality of the climate crisis. That research, though, was suppressed. The bitter irony, clinched by one of the company’s former climate scientists, Ed Garvey, was that Exxon could have been part of the solution rather than the problem. Garvey worked on Exxon’s carbon dioxide research programme from 1978 to 1983, when it was closed because falling gas prices made it seem an expendable luxury. Garvey also recalls that there were scientists at Exxon developing alternatives to fossil fuels such as solar power and lithium batteries. But their work was shelved. The future of the planet, Garvey suggests, was deemed less important than Exxon’s short-term profit. Although the Clinton administration in which Gore served had from the outset committed itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by 2000, and leaders of industrial nations such as the British prime minister, John Major, called for even deeper cuts, the Senate resolution effectively destroyed the president and his vice-president’s hopes of the US leading the world. Instead, the US, through its inaction, helped hasten the climate catastrophe we now live in. To clinch this rhetorical point, the programme repeatedly cuts from talking heads to scenes more hellish than those imagined by Dante or Milton. Floods in China, a fiery hellscape in California, storms lashing Louisiana and, in one shot, battering an Exxon gas station. After seeing such images, I wonder how Hagel, who sponsored that 1997 Senate resolution and went on to become defence secretary, sleeps at night. He was among the climate crisis deniers this documentary catches up with to hear them repent. Off-screen, the excellent interviewer asks Hagel if he feels he was misled, given that Exxon, whose execs lobbied him before the Senate vote, was making a concerted effort throughout the 1990s to cast doubt on the reality of the climate emergency and the role of human activity in increasing global temperatures – even though their own scientists were telling them that the science was sound. “We now know about some of these large oil companies … they lied,” says Hagel. “Yes I was misled. Others were misled. When they had evidence in their own institutions that countered what they were saying publicly – they lied.” If the truth had been told to Hagel and other climate crisis-denying senators, would the situation be different? “Oh absolutely,” says Hagel. “I think it would have changed the average citizen’s appreciation of climate change and mine. It would have put the United States and the world on a different track. It has cost this country and it’s cost the world.” Last August, the UN secretary general António Guterres said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) working group’s report confirming the link between human activity and rising greenhouse emissions is “a code red for humanity”. That Senate resolution, McMullen’s film argues, contributed to our climate emergency. No one in this programme explores the hideous political ramifications of this terrible state of affairs, namely that the virus of capitalism (in the form of big oil) undercut democracy through a sustained campaign of disinformation. How easy it proved for corporations to sucker politicians such as Hagel to subvert not just the will of the people but the wellbeing of the planet. If McMullen’s film has a moral, it’s that democracy must be healthy enough to resist commercial lobbying, so that we don’t get fooled again.

By then, the bouillabaisse of bodies – lumpy, fleshy, knobbly – comes as no surprise after all we have witnessed: an orgy of new-age mysticism and unbridled pleasure. And a literal orgy. This rip-snorting comedy from the New Zealand director Armagan Ballantyne situates itself on Zǿbftąņ, a fictional island hovering somewhere in the wild blue yonder of the Pacific. Ballantyne wastes no time hurtling us into the stultifying marriage of Bruno (Damon Herriman) and Laura (The Breaker Upperers’ Jackie van Beek, doubling as screenwriter), whose subtle barbs and constant bickering are conducted entirely in … gibberish. In the pantheon of invented languages, there have been many of studied, intricate beauty: Elvish, Klingon, Na’vi. Nude Tuesday’s language is not one of them. It is lewd and crude, landing somewhere between a bad ABBA impression and backpackers at Oktoberfest. It’s as though an alien learnt Swedish entirely through Ikea’s most misjudged product names – and it is utterly delightful. In tongue-twisting fricatives and nasal grunts, Herriman and Van Beek communicate perfectly the existential dread of middle-class life. Laura is a cog in the corporate machine who, in a mad dash to retrieve her forgotten notes for a pitch, smashes the window of her car, then delivers her presentation with a gruesome, bloodied arm. Bruno is a bumbling dad who can’t get the simplest of tasks right, all his sublimated stress suddenly coming to the fore in a screaming match with a poor bloke at the grocery store. It is Laura and Bruno’s anniversary, and they strap in for a joyless dinner with the in-laws, made all the more awkward by a surprise present to the unhappy couple: an all-inclusive retreat for two, deep in the wilderness, that promises long-lasting self-fulfilment – both metaphysical and just plain physical. The dispirited duo are bundled off faster than they can say marriage counselling to their sanctum in the woods: Wonderla (or ẄØnÐĘULÄ, as it’s stylised). Nude Tuesday was shot in New Zealand, and it shows: Wonderla is a pastoral fantasy of log cabins and verdant fields, snow-capped mountaintops and rushing rivers. Except this isn’t so much a ski resort as a culty commune where debauchery reigns. Wonderla’s residents are mostly yogi types, dreadlocked, ponchoed and polyamorous in the same way student colleges are, which is to say: mostly just horny. So Bruno and Laura – stuffy and stiff – come to experience the ways of their free-wheeling, free-balling peers – stiffied and stuffed. By the time they settle into the tantric rhythms of their orgiastic oasis, we can already see how this film might end: with the once-sheltered couple stripping away traumas and undergarments to reveal something feral and innate within themselves, to excavate the identities they’ve lost to the churn of domesticity. It’s a feat, then, that Herriman and Van Beek – alongside a sideshow of oddballs, including the Australian TikTok star Ian Zaro as a blustering but big-hearted foil to Bruno, and Flight of the Conchords’ Jemaine Clement as their fraudulent cult leader-cum-love guru called (of course) Bjorg – keep the foregone conclusion at bay, just long enough to indulge in a raft of slapstick antics. They cup each other’s crotches as grounding exercise. There is breathwork that sounds like climaxing and climaxing that sounds like breathwork. They flail about like apes, held by the gentle embrace of nature, returning to their primal forms – swinging appendages and all. Call it the power of the hog. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning There are certainly notes of The Breaker Upperers – the 2018 comedy Van Beek wrote, directed and starred in – in Nude Tuesday; both have a certain emotional agility, with the latter ping-ponging between slapstick farce and devastating catharsis without letting any moment percolate too long, lest it descend into schmaltz. And there are whiffs of Lorde’s Solar Power, The White Lotus and the folk horror Midsommar here too, infused into the film’s broad satire of the wellness industry. But Nude Tuesday also wields a silent weapon: its subtitles, written completely independently in post-production by the British comedian Julia Davis. The cast’s performances may transcend language but the subtitles inject an omniscient – and hilarious – presence in the work, full of gleeful schadenfreude at its characters’ shortcomings (and short comings). Davis’s writing lets the film get away with its feast of anatomical jokes, which would quickly wear out were they delivered in English. And when, at last, the din quiets and we see the anatomy in all its bare-faced glory, we might just feel tempted to join this clan of naturists and throw all caution and clothing to the wind. Might. Nude Tuesday is now screening as part of Sydney film festival. It will be released in cinemas in New Zealand on 16 June and Australia on 23 June, then will be streamable on Stan from 7 July. UK and US releases have yet to be announced"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/27/australias-emissions-climbed-in-coalitions-final-year-as-transport-and-fossil-fuels-wiped-out-gains-during-covid","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-27T04:05:04Z","webTitle":"Australia’s emissions climbed in Coalition’s final year as transport and fossil fuels wiped out gains during Covid","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/27/australias-emissions-climbed-in-coalitions-final-year-as-transport-and-fossil-fuels-wiped-out-gains-during-covid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/27/australias-emissions-climbed-in-coalitions-final-year-as-transport-and-fossil-fuels-wiped-out-gains-during-covid","fields":{"headline":"Australia’s emissions climbed in Coalition’s final year as transport and fossil fuels wiped out gains during Covid","bodyText":"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2021 as the country wound back Covid-19 lockdowns without taking significant steps to maintain a fall in carbon pollution recorded during the pandemic. National emissions rose 0.8% – representing 4.1m tonnes of carbon dioxide – in the final full year of the federal Coalition government, according to government data released on Monday. While pollution from electricity generation continued to drop due to an increase in renewable energy and reduction in coal power, this decrease was effectively cancelled out as emissions from transport, manufacturing and fossil fuel developments – notably the gas industry – bounced back. Emissions were also up from agriculture as the recovery from drought continued. Officials said compared with 2005 levels – the benchmark the Australian government uses in its international climate commitments under the Paris agreement – emissions were down 21.4%. But nearly all of this cut was due to a dramatic drop in the emissions from what is known as “land use, land use change and forestry” between 2006 and 2016. Land use emissions were estimated to have fallen dramatically in that period due to changes in state land-clearing laws, a decline in native forestry and forest regeneration in some semi-arid areas. If land use and forestry are excluded, pollution from the rest of the Australian economy – including the country’s substantial fossil fuel industries – was down only 1.6% since 2005. The Albanese government’s target of a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels by 2030 includes all parts of the economy, including land use and forestry. The new climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said the latest quarterly data showed the Coalition had relied on Covid and drought to misleadingly claim emissions had reduced in recent years. He said the previous government had “caps off its record of denial and delay by increasing emissions on the way out”. “Their failure to deliver proper climate policy over a decade undermines the great strides in emissions reduction made through household solar, the renewable energy target and state-based renewable schemes in the electricity sector over recent years,” he said. “Good climate and energy policy is good economic policy – it doesn’t rely on recession and drought for short-term and temporary emissions reduction.” The Coalition’s climate change spokesman, Ted O’Brien, accused Bowen of a “pretending you’re still in opposition” and said Labor would be measured against its commitments, particularly to keep electricity prices down. He acknowledged the 0.8% emissions increase last year, but said it was “worth noting a rise of 3.4% in Australia’s gross domestic product over that period”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The greenhouse gas inventory update for the December quarter shows: Total national emissions for the year were estimated to be 488m tonnes. The rise of solar power and a cut in coal generation helped push emissions from electricity down 4.2% (7m tonnes) compared with the previous year. Pollution from transport was up by 4% (3.5m tonnes) as people spent less time in lockdowns and more time in their cars. Other sectors to see emissions bounce back were heavy industry including manufacturing (3.3%, 3.3m tonnes), agriculture (4.2%, 3.1m tonnes) and fugitive emissions resulting from venting and flaring at oil and gas sites (1.8%, 0.9 m tonnes). Looking at the change since 2005, easily the biggest shift in emissions was from land use and forestry, which is estimated to be down more than 140%. Where the sector used to release 90m tonnes, it is now estimated to be a carbon sink, drawing down nearly 40m tonnes from the atmosphere. This estimate is not universally accepted: an analysis of Queensland data suggested forests in that state were being cleared at almost twice the rate reflected in national greenhouse accounts.Remove changes in land use and forestry from the national greenhouse accounts and the overall change across the fossil fuel economy is small. Electricity emissions dropped nearly 19%, but pollution from other “stationary energy” facilities – essentially heavy industry – were up nearly 26%. Transport emissions were up 10% compared in 2005 last year, but were still below their peak due to Covid lockdowns and are likely to increase further in 2022. The same applies to fugitive emissions from fossil fuel mines, which were 18% higher than in 2005 but still not back at 2019 levels. Bowen said Labor’s 2030 target and commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050 would be underpinned by its “powering Australia” plan. It includes a $20bn fund to accelerate the rollout of renewable energy, a gradual reduction in industrial emissions using the Coalition’s “safeguard mechanism” and reducing taxes on electric vehicles. Scientific estimates have suggested Australia should be cutting emissions by more than 50% by 2030 to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement. Tim Baxter, from the Climate Council, said the country needed ambitious policy and concrete measures to reduce the burning of coal, oil and gas. “Through late 2021 the best the former federal government could manage was bluff and bluster, so it’s hardly surprising emissions sprung back up as Covid lockdowns eased,” he said. “We need to urgently, permanently and drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions to protect Australian lives, livelihoods and the places we cherish.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/15/india-committed-to-clean-energy-but-continues-to-boost-coal-production","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-15T10:57:51Z","webTitle":"India’s energy conundrum: committed to renewables but still expanding coal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/15/india-committed-to-clean-energy-but-continues-to-boost-coal-production","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/15/india-committed-to-clean-energy-but-continues-to-boost-coal-production","fields":{"headline":"India’s energy conundrum: committed to renewables but still expanding coal","bodyText":"Three days before India’s environment minister boarded a flight to Egypt for this year’s UN climate summit, Cop27, the country’s finance minister was busy with a new announcement. “India needs greater investment in coal production,” said Nirmala Sitharaman at the Delhi launch of India’s biggest ever coalmine auction, where 141 new sites for coalmines will be sold off to the highest bidder. At a time when the world’s future hinges on a dramatic global reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and global leaders are gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh to try to limit the impact of the climate crisis – with decarbonisation on the agenda – the Indian government is continuing on its biggest ever push for domestic coal production, even toying with the idea of producing so much it could become a future coal exporter. This was the sixth, and largest, such auction the Indian government has held since 2020, when it privatised the coal industry. Two-thirds of the 968 sites that are allocated for mines, known as coal blocks, are on untouched land and many sit under India’s most ecologically rich and fragile forests, and rural areas populated by tribal communities that will be destroyed if the new projects go ahead. “The worst part is that in order to open up more coal, the government is allowing mining in dense forested areas. Forests are sinks of carbon dioxide so if you are getting new coal to burn by chopping down forests, it’s a double whammy of environmental disaster,” said Sudiep Shrivastava, a lawyer who has fought back against new coal blocks. In Hasdeo Arand, a dense forested area in the state of Chhattisgarh, where 23 coal blocks have been proposed and seven approved – which would wreak havoc on some of India’s oldest and most biodiverse environments and displace thousands of tribal people – communities have been fighting back against the mines. According to anti-mining activists, opening up coalmines in the area will not only lead to the loss of thousands of hectares of forest land, but also affect the flow of the river, cause pollution and displace many villagers and tribal communities who live off the forests. In October last year, hundreds of villagers from the region marched almost 200 miles on foot from their villages to the state capital, Raipur, to register a protest against the proposed coalmines. On the global stage, India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has presented himself as a staunch environmentalist, and speaking at the G20 meeting on Tuesday, Modi said: “India is committed to clean energy and environment.” Yet India has also made no secret of the fact that it will need coal for decades to come, even as it increases its reliance on renewables and moves towards net zero in 2070. It was one of the most dramatic moments at the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow last year when India, backed by China, made a last-minute intervention to water down the language of the final agreement, changing the commitment to “phase down” rather than “phase out” coal power. Coal currently accounts for 70% of electricity generation in India, while renewables count for only about 12%. At Cop27 this year, the Indian position has been to try to counter the pressure to reduce its continued reliance on coal by pushing for an agreement to phase down all fossil fuels, including gas, which Europe and the US are still heavily dependent on. India’s argument is that it is unfair to single out coal – which is primarily used by developing countries – while other fossil fuels widely used in western countries remain unsanctioned. Speaking on Monday, the environment minister, Bhupender Yadav, who is representing India at Cop27, accused developed nations of “turning back to fossil fuels” as the energy crisis hit. Ashish Fernandes, the chief executive officer of Climate Risk Horizons, which analyses the impact of the climate crisis in India, said: “It’s quite clear because of the west’s failure to live up to its commitments on emissions reductions and climate finance, India is using coal as a bargaining chip. It’s hard to criticise India’s plans for new coal when Europe is looking to build up so much more new gas.” India is already at the forefront of the climate crisis. This year two-thirds of the country suffered months of an unprecedented heatwave that decimated crops and livelihoods. There were extreme weather events on 80% of days this year. Yet the Indian government’s position is that as a fast-developing country, which is the world’s second-largest importer of coal, it is necessary in the name of self-reliance and energy security for the country to take advantage of its own vast domestic coal reserves, said to be the fourth largest in the world. As a historically low emitter of carbon emissions compared with the west, ministers claim it is unfair to penalise such actions. Under plans promoted by Modi, India plans to increase its domestic coal production to a 1bn tonnes a year. In the year since Cop26, the government says the situation has become even more pressing. India’s electricity demand soared post-Covid and foreign coal prices hit record highs because of inflation and the war in Ukraine, costing the government billions of rupees to import what was needed. In April, after the hottest March in 122 years, the country suffered a grave coal shortage and some coal-fired power stations had less than three days supply left, resulting in rolling power cuts. Nivit Yadav, programme director at the environment thinktank Centre for Science and Environment said: “You can’t avoid the fact that India still needs coal and we need to reduce our dependency on imported coal, which is becoming costlier by the day. Long term, we definitely want our reliance on coal to be reduced as much as possible but there is so much conflict around the world, India has to secure its energy.” Yet environmentalists and thinktanks have argued that opening up hundreds of new coalmines across India is both environmentally devastating and unnecessary. Multiple studies have shown that India’s current capacity of coalmines and coal-fired power stations are more than enough to meet India’s growing electricity demand if they operate efficiently. The coal shortages that hit in April and May are said not to have been due to a lack of domestic coal, but instead poor planning by power companies, and analysis showed that they could have been avoided if there had been greater investment in renewables. India now produces the world’s cheapest solar power, and prices will continue to fall. “India does not need more coal,” said Fernandes. “There is no financial or energy requirement for new coal construction in India, this is all political.” He emphasised that India’s current coal power generation was “suboptimal”, only currently running at about 60% capacity, and if run properly would be more than enough to meet the electricity demands of a fast-developing nation. On average, India’s coalmines use only two-thirds of the capacity, with some large ones using only 1%, according to analysis by Global Energy Monitor (GEM), calling into question the need to open up more. Fernandes said such huge new investment in coal now meant there was “a real chance that it will undermine the renewable energy industry” by tying India’s electricity sector into a contractual commitment to coal for decades to come, even as renewables are cheaper. Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency said Modi’s coal expansion plans were “difficult to reconcile with India’s evolving energy needs and environmental priorities”. There is also the issue that India’s coal, with its high ash content, is notoriously polluting and inefficient to burn, requiring twice as much to produce the same amount of power as imported coal. It is also difficult to transport. Many coal-powered fire stations are on the coast, specifically built to receive sea shipments of imported coal, and are hundreds of miles away from the central Indian states where many of the coal blocks are located, putting huge pressure on passenger railway lines. For environmentalists, one of the greatest concerns is that the push for new coalmines is coming as India’s environmental regulations are being watered down, particularly for power infrastructure projects, while laws around coal “act like an implicit subsidy to coal development”, according to a recent report by Oxford University. Currently coal blocks are auctioned off before any environmental clearances are done on the area. For the new coalmine in Hasdeo Arand, local people allege the projects have been given all the environmental clearances by the state government without their constitutionally-bound consent and by using fabricated documents. “Once the forest is gone, the people will not only lose their livelihoods but also their heritage, their culture, their religion, because they worship the forests – but their voices have been silenced” said Alok Shukla, an environmental activist who has been at the forefront of the community opposition to the new coal mines in Hasdeo Arand. “Tearing it down will also affect the monsoons as well because it disrupts the whole ecosystem. Tell me, what coal is worth that?”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2022/oct/15/australians-whove-sworn-off-flying-if-you-get-on-a-plane-youve-undone-a-years-worth-of-good","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2022-10-14T19:00:46Z","webTitle":"Australians who’ve sworn off flying: ‘If you get on a plane, you’ve undone a year’s worth of good’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/oct/15/australians-whove-sworn-off-flying-if-you-get-on-a-plane-youve-undone-a-years-worth-of-good","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2022/oct/15/australians-whove-sworn-off-flying-if-you-get-on-a-plane-youve-undone-a-years-worth-of-good","fields":{"headline":"Australians who’ve sworn off flying: ‘If you get on a plane, you’ve undone a year’s worth of good’","bodyText":"After the bushfires of 2019, 38-year-old Clara* made a drastic decision: she swore off all air travel. “I had a two-year-old who was coughing up blood from all the smoke in the air in Canberra,” she recalls. “My morning routine was opening up the air quality app to see whether we could go outside that day.” Clara, who does not want to use her real name because she feels it may threaten her employment, already did everything she could think of to reduce her climate impact: she composted, cut back on driving and tried to reduce, reuse and recycle as much as possible. But the bushfires clarified the need for “firmer” action. “I’ve got no choice left,” she remembers thinking. “I can’t do this any more for my kids. I can’t let them live in a world where they have to check an air-rating app before they go outside.” Googling led her to an organisation called Flight Free, which encourages Australians to stop flying. Without consulting her husband – “which, in hindsight, probably would have been a good thing to do” – Clara signed up. She vowed not to step foot on an aeroplane for the next 10 years. “I just wanted to channel the rage, the anger and despair into something constructive.” Clara is one of around 100 Australians who have taken Flight Free’s pledge to ditch air travel. Members can vow to quit flying for a year to test it out, or go all-in, boycotting air travel for the rest of their lives. Some, such as Clara, choose their own timeframe or tweak the pledge according to their circumstances. There is no one publicly holding pledgers to account; it’s a simple promise, made in an effort to tackle the escalating climate crisis. While Flight Free is a small organisation in Australia, the movement is far bigger abroad. The first Flight Free was founded in Sweden – also the country of origin for flygskam, or “flight-shaming” – in 2018. Globally, there are 10,000 pledgers across 62 countries, and Flight Free is one of many organisations calling on the public to fly less or not at all. Celebrities including Taylor Swift and Kylie Jenner have lately been taken to task for their egregious private jet usage, and in the UK there are growing calls to impose a frequent flyer levy. Although Flight Free has been operating in Australia since 2019, it’s no coincidence it has been slower to get off the ground domestically. “Because of our physical location on the planet and our lack of fast rail infrastructure, it is a big challenge,” admits Mark Carter, co-founder of Flight Free Australia. “Unlike in Europe, there’s not really the convenient alternatives to flying here.” Carter hopes Flight Free Australia will encourage more people to cut down on their air travel and potentially help to push future regulatory change. As well as collecting pledgers like Clara, Flight Free Australia does a “mixed bag” of anti-aviation lobbying work and seeks to raise public awareness of the industry’s emissions contributions. So, how to quit flying in an island nation where major hubs are separated by thousands of kilometres and many remote areas are not accessible by land for parts of the year? “There’s not any quick or easy answer,” Carter says. But he believes extreme circumstances require extreme responses. “The climate emergency puts us in a non-normal kind of world,” Carter says. “Being in an abnormal situation means we need to do things differently.” He likens inaction to watching TV while one’s house is burning down. “It’s that way of looking at it.” Melbourne-based Flight Free pledger Peter Miller sees things similarly. He knows Carter “quite well” and their conversations convinced him to join the movement. “I think that going on holiday is not justifiable if it’s going to cause that much damage,” Miller says. “To go for holiday to Fiji and emit all that carbon, to sit alone on a beach and have a drink just seems a little bit preposterous to me.” Miller and his wife have both pledged off flying for the rest of their lives, though they may choose to travel if a loved one dies abroad, or similar “serious” circumstances. It’s been both an easy and difficult decision for the couple, both 64, to make. On the one hand, Miller has had the privilege of travelling earlier in his life. But now that he is approaching retirement, the pledge means his golden years will look quite different from what he once imagined. “It’s a fairly large impact on how we had thought we would be living at this point in time. But nevertheless, we feel very strongly about it.” Instead of visiting Europe (“which would be nice,” Miller says), he and his wife are holidaying domestically, exploring the vast swathes of Australia they’ve not yet seen. The pair have already taken a couple of trips to Tasmania on the overnight ferry – a “little bit of an inconvenience” compared with the 75-minute flight, but not too onerous. “If you spend a lot of your time trying to minimise your carbon by adding solar power or having electric cars or any of those things, that’s all well and good,” Miller says. “But if you then get on a plane and travel to London, you’ve just undone a year’s worth of good.” Tim Ryley, a professor of aviation at Griffith University, agrees that at an individual level, quitting flying is the most impactful thing we can do to reduce our carbon footprint. While aviation is a small percentage of Australia’s total carbon emissions (energy production is far and away the highest), “it’s harder to reduce than just about any other emission,” Ryley says. Power can go solar, fuel-guzzling cars can be traded for EVs and beef patties can be swapped for lentil burgers, but there is currently no way to fly without causing an environmental impact. (Even airline CEOs concede offsets are “a fig leaf”.) However, Ryley believes an Australia without planes as an unrealistic prospect. “Aviation is clearly not environmentally sustainable, but it is economically and socially sustainable,” he says. “It does help economically – cargo, that side of aviation, tends be ignored. Even if everyone stopped flying individually, you’d still get businesses delivering stuff from abroad.” Life without flying also poses “the social challenges of people having family internationally, as well as across Australia”, Ryley says. While the environmental case has merit, “the demand and interest in flying, particularly in a post-Covid world, probably trumps that at the moment”. The pandemic made the first couple of years of Clara’s pledge relatively easy, but she is aware the choices will get harder from now on. Already the decision to swear off air travel has come with some sacrifice. To avoid the need for interstate business trips, Clara has actively looked for roles that don’t require travel. Both her and her husband’s parents live interstate, so a visit to the grandparents means a long drive, not a short flight. Clara’s husband would like to take the kids on a skiing holiday to Japan at some point, but that’s out of the question unless they can take months off work and go by boat, a prospect they have not ruled out. All this makes Clara question whether she is doing right by her children. “I do wonder, ‘Oh goodness, are my children going to be deprived because I’m making this decision for them?’ But then I counter that by thinking ‘Well, what are they going to be more angry about – the fact that they missed out going to Japan for a skiing holiday, or the fact that they have to live on a planet where they can’t actually breathe any more?’” Ultimately she wants to know “I did everything in my power to make things as least bad for them as I possibly could.” Besides, Clara says, “My parents lived the bulk of their lives without ever stepping foot on a plane and had perfectly happy childhoods.” *Name has been changed"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"}]}}
