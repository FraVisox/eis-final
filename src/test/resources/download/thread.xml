Here in north-east Wales, for example, the cultural and economic links with north-west England are much stronger than the ones we have with south Wales. From Wrexham, we can be in Manchester and Liverpool within an hour (which is why so many north Walians work there). By contrast, a journey from Wrexham to Cardiff takes at least three hours, while the road journey to Pembrokeshire is comparable, in travel time, to a flight across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the liberal-left is serious about a more federal UK, it should examine the case for devolution within, as well as for, Wales – and ask whether parts of eastern Wales would fit more naturally into regional assemblies based in western England. Or does Welsh devolution rest ultimately on emotion rather than any rational, secular case for regional governance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Kelly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buckley, Flintshire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• I would argue that much of the upturn of speaking Welsh in Cardiff and other “anglicised” areas of south Wales is not because of any “discrimination in favour of Welsh-speakers in government jobs”, but rather, because of, in particular, the excellent education available through Welsh-medium schools in the capital and beyond. Having worked considerably with Welsh government civil servants across a number of departments, I’ve yet to come across anyone who has seemingly attained their position through an ability to speak Welsh. Indeed, in my experience, many senior civil servants have actually hailed from outside Wales.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Equally importantly, over the last 25 years since I returned to live here, I have noticed a greater acceptance of Welsh among the majority Anglophone population and, moreover, an enhanced desire among many of them to understand and learn more of the language and its related rich culture, which has again contributed to the upturn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yn eiddoch yn gywir.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Llewellyn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cardiff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• The Scottish referendum has given Welsh leaders their chance for parity of representation for both England and Wales if they press for an English assembly, elected on proportional representation, with the same powers as the Welsh assembly in health, education and planning, to replace the House of Lords, leaving the House of Commons, with control over taxation, as the real upper house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Simon Jenkins points out, the long border with England is permeable, and parts of mid and north Wales are &amp;nbsp;more closely linked to large English conurbations than they are to Cardiff. The total population of this “nearly nation” is similar to larger Birmingham, Liverpool or Manchester, which each have one chief executive and one director of education, compared with 22 of each in Wales. This Tory legacy of a disastrously top-heavy system of local government means that, after the austerity cuts devolved from Westminster, there is no money left for vital services, despite council taxes being rebanded to make the top rate higher than Westminster. Wales remains dependent on an annual subvention of £15bn from the UK Treasury that makes independence a financial non-starter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Failure to reband council taxes in England has reduced local government to implementing Tory cuts, euphemistically called “localism”, but Wales could lead the way for England through a reform of local government that elected two AMs per constituency, one to be in charge of directly elected mayors for each borough, serving a maximum of two terms so that it does not become a job for life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The union with Wales is almost two centuries older than the union with Scotland, but an English assembly would provide the federal structure required for all the constituent parts of the UK to go forward together in harmony of equal representation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margaret Phelps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Simon Jenkins touches on the bleak attitudes of many Welsh people towards their culture, language, English incomers and domination from England, stating that “Where the nationalist will is strong, nothing is impossible” regarding the possibility of Wales becoming an “autonomous unit”. This lack of self-belief is the crux of the current situation, where the Welsh language is so often mocked and its speakers derided and scorned, the rich cultural heritage is scoffed at or ignored and its illustrious forefathers and current ambassadors in all fields are played down as an embarrassment. English incomers are indeed often more worthy of being called Welsh than those who perceive their roots to be Welsh as they embrace the language, explore the beautiful landscapes and acknowledge and engage in the&amp;nbsp;wealth of literary and cultural opportunities. The apathy and indifference of so many to the richness of this wonderful country could well be the greatest potential downfall of Wales. If we are to survive and prosper as a nation we urgently need to cast aside the self-inflicted shame and start to value ourselves as richly diverse Welshmen and women who can offer so much to ourselves and the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cathey Owen Cousins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aberhonddu, Powys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• So, according to Simon Jenkins we need to get rid of those lower-class caravans spoiling the view and get more Michelin stars in order to keep Wales safe for middle-class tourists and wealthy metropolitans wanting to buy bijou cottages in pretty little villages (if we are lucky perhaps some of them will marry our daughters!). Meanwhile we should shut up about the low-skilled, low-paid, part-time jobs in the tourist industry and stop complaining about the distribution of government cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even for a professional controversialist this is low stuff. Pointing out that whole industries were deliberately destroyed (coal) and run down (steel) by fiat in Westminster, without being replaced, is not “whingeing”; it is setting out some hard economic realities. Never mind the Depression, Wales has never recovered from the depredations of the 80s and never will until it rebuilds a higher-skilled and higher-paid economy. We have no oil but UK and other governments were happy to fuel their navies with Welsh steam coal at the height of the imperial project; Welsh steel was used to make rails for the trains that carried British goods from Russia to South America; migrants from around the world flocked to work in Wales, which had the densest railway network in the world, per head of population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as these things could be got cheaper elsewhere, there was no further use for them – or for the people who worked there, leaving Wales (still) with higher rates of unemployment, industrial disease and disability than anywhere in the UK, with the possible exception of north-east England. That is why we need a proportionately higher level of expenditure on health and benefits than England; that is why the Barnett formula is unfair. This is not the “politics of grievance” – it is the politics of survival, literally for some, and this is before the cost of rebuilding a social and economic infrastructure, ravaged by Thatcherism, is taken into account.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martin Barclay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cardiff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• I am surprised Jenkins made no mention, of the “black hole” of economic imbalance created by the resident Tafia of Cardiff, and relocation of services and culture (eg BBC and S4C studios from Swansea and Llanelli) to the administrative centre. Perhaps Scotland is fortunate in that Edinburgh and Glasgow are connected by an excellent road and rail link of a mere 40 miles, and political diversity is healthily dispersed between these two vibrant centres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edinburgh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;• &lt;/em&gt;After many years of professional life in England a return to my native south Wales coincided with the birth of Welsh devolution and while there is little with Simon Jenkins’ piece with which I would take issue, it is important to see the “slumbering dragon” in an historical context. To do so is to perhaps appreciate both the psychological and economic mountain which the dragon has been obliged to climb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The so-called Act of Union of 1536 between Wales and England openly spoke of the annexation of the former by the latter and for 500 years the clear intention of government in England has been to treat Wales in every respect as a part of England, completely ignoring crucial differences in culture and in the Welsh pattern of historical development. This is reflected in the dramatically different devolution settlements afforded to Wales and Scotland respectively. For the Scots it was a question of “if it’s not out, it’s in” with Scottish government and parliament operating from the outset in all areas except those specifically reserved to the UK government and Westminster. In Wales, we were obliged to operate on a basis of “if it’s not in, it’s out” and have been playing catch-up ever since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not sure that the reasons for such devolutionary disparity between the two mainland Celtic nations have ever been given: was it the very slender initial Welsh majority vote or an innate reluctance on the part of the colonial power to release one of its “colonies”?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the Welsh assembly was only four years old, it received what amounted to a vote of confidence by the Richard commission, compounded in 2011 by a substantial majority who voted in favour of primary law-making powers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do not belong to a political party but feel that the corollary of Simon Jenkins’s essay may be conjoined with the explicit message afforded us by an outstanding Scottish referendum campaign, namely, if you want successfully devolved government – don’t elect a unionist party to govern you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Howard Jeans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thomastown, Rhondda Cynon Taf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• So the Welsh language is a key factor in keeping the Welsh people trapped in poverty and backwardness? It is only through fully embracing the English language with its attendant entrepreneurial spirit that they can be saved from their self-imposed chains argues the writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I seem to have heard this “line” somewhere before. It was in fact the analysis adopted by Victorian governments of Wales and its language in the aftermath of the Merthyr rising, Chartist insurrection, Rebecca riots etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This government-imposed attitude would in time lead to the brittle pride and fierce self- loathing exhibited in Simon Jenkins’s father’s views on his home country, its culture and language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who exactly is forcing what down someone’s throat here? It looks like more of the same old cultural imperialism on offer. Let us rather look at the massive exploitation that capitalism inflicted on Wales – and other industrial parts of these islands – for explanations as to our current crises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the City of London – and subsequently a myriad of tax havens – that reaped and still reap the benefits wrested from these lands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meic Birtwistle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trefenter, Ceredigion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• “Wake up, Wales” read your front page banner for Simon Jenkins’s excellent essay. As an Englishman who is more than happy to live in Wales, I would say in return, “Wake up, Guardian”, for it is English institutions such as yourselves that treat Wales as a “nearly nation”. You never report on Welsh politics, rarely report on Welsh news and events, and you downgrade your coverage of Welsh sport. Look at how much space you give when England plays – pages of it; and compare it with your coverage when Wales play – it is so small, you’ve got to look hard for it. You cover English rugby union in full; you give no space at all to the Guinness Pro12. It is no wonder that there is a narrative of grievance and resentment. For yourselves, you need to become a truly British and not just an English newspaper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is true that the railway to Cardiff is not electrified, but it is still only two hours away from London.

Like Warwick Thornton’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/11/samson-and-delilah-rewatching-classic-australian-films&quot;&gt;Samson and Delilah&lt;/a&gt; (2009) and Adam Elliot’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/may/30/mary-and-max-rewatching-classic-australian-films&quot;&gt;Mary and Max&lt;/a&gt; (2009) Animal Kingdom is among the most assured feature film debuts of any Australian director since the turn of the century.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;figure class=&quot;element element-video&quot; data-canonical-url=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNszOl14AWg&quot;                                                                        &gt; &lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;259&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YNszOl14AWg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first scene establishes Michôd’s ability to complicate seemingly prosaic moments with creepy dramatic escalation: it opens with 17-year-old Joshua (James Frecheville) sitting unemotionally on a couch next to his slumped over mother watching Deal or No Deal. When paramedics arrive we learn she’s overdosed on heroin. Joshua’s grandmother Smurf (Weaver) picks him up and moves him into the Cody residence, inhabited by a close knit bunch of heavies who divide their time into dealing drugs, committing armed robberies and taunting police.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Family friend Baz (Joel Edgerton) is the closest they have to a voice of reason. He wants them to settle down and invest in the stock market, but any trek towards the straight and narrow is quashed when Baz is murdered by police. Oldest son Pope (Ben Mendelsohn) organises a bloody revenge that escalates a war between both sides of the law. With crooked cops and shady deals aplenty, those sides, as the recent real-life example of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/roger-rogerson-a-long-and-crooked-tale-20140531-39atz.html&quot;&gt;disgraced detective Roger Rogerson&lt;/a&gt; reminds us, can be blurry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senior Sergeant Nathan Leckie (Guy Pearce) is the good cop to the rest of the universe’s bad ones.

Rough and unhinged, but quietly spoken and personable in the way of a prototypical barbie-operating beer drinking Aussie bloke, Mendelsohn is all sorts of creepy in playing Pope.

There is good reason why Michôd’s new film The Rover (in official competition at the Sydney film festival) is such an anticipated title.

Do rare species make any difference in the larger scheme? These questions have puzzled biologists for centuries. Truth be told, even today, scientists have uncovered just a few pieces within this complex puzzle as we discover in Eric Dinerstein's The Kingdom of Rarities [Island Press, 2014; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781610911962&quot;&gt;Guardian Bookshop&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1610911962/livithescieli-21/&quot;&gt;Amazon UK&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1610911962/livingthescie-20/&quot;&gt;Amazon US&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00B2IRHKA/livingthescie-20/&quot;&gt;kindle US&lt;/a&gt;]. In this engaging and informative narrative, the reader accompanies the World Wildlife Fund's chief scientist on his lifelong journey to visit some of the world's rarest species and remotest places. Along the way, Dinerstein discusses contributions from a variety of disparate scientific fields that shed light onto why some species are rare whilst others are not. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dinerstein begins by retelling the story that captured my attention like no other at the time, that amazing story of &lt;a href=&quot;http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/02/07/lost-bird-of-paradise-found-in/&quot;&gt;Bruce Beehler's expedition to the Foja Mountains of western New Guinea&lt;/a&gt;. This remote region was noteworthy because no one -- not even the local tribespeople -- had ever set foot there. The purpose of this expedition was to survey all species that could be found in this pristine place but Beehler also had a personal objective: to rediscover several &quot;lost&quot; species of rare birds. Specifically, Beehler hoped to discover the home of the golden-fronted bowerbird, a bird so rare that it was known only from four dusty old museum skins purchased from locals in the mid-1800s. These tribesmen reportedly obtained the skins somewhere in western New Guinea. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after Beehler and his colleagues arrived, it became obvious that nestled within the Foja Mountains' rugged and forbidding terrain was the topographical isolation necessary for new species to evolve and adapt to restricted niches. Although the spectacular golden-fronted bowerbird was incredibly rare overall, they were quite common here. But other rare birds were also locally common, including the mysterious six-wired bird of paradise and a new-to-science honeyeater that was voiceless, a most peculiar trait for a songbird. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This points to the fundamental question: what is rarity? We can all agree that those species comprised of just a few individuals inhabiting small ranges are rare, as for the golden-fronted bowerbird and other residents of the Foja Mountains, but what about species that are locally uncommon but widespread? Are they rare, too? This is precisely the situation for thinly-distributed &quot;apex predators&quot;, such as the New World's puma and jaguar. In the case of these big cats, each species occurs within a vast range and occupies a wide variety of habitats, ranging from montane forest to desert and even tundra (in the case of the puma). Both puma and jaguar are sparsely distributed throughout the rain forests of Central and South America, where their natural histories and their interactions are poorly known.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many scientists maintain that the food pyramid adequately explains the scarcity of large predators since it takes a lot of herbivores to support just a few predators -- particularly the largest &quot;apex&quot; predators perched at the top of the food pyramid. This hypothesis is consistent with the argument presented in Paul Colinvaux's book, Why Big Fierce Animals Are Rare. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But how do pumas and jaguars live side by side in the Amazon rain forest? Despite these two big cats' overlapping ranges, their similar habits and shared prey preferences are some of the reasons they carefully avoid each other -- effectively making each species even more scarce. But the explanations are more complicated and subtle than this since, for example, jaguars show clear sex-based habitat preferences: adult female jaguars reside along rivers and on flood plains whereas males, which are nearly twice their size, live higher up and farther from rivers. Why would they do this? The evolutionary and ecological rationales for these distinctive behaviours are not known at this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, wide-ranging but thin distribution patterns make intuitive sense for large predators, but what might you conclude if you learned that scarlet macaws, which range widely, are also locally scarce? Additionally, what might you think if you learned that bald-faced saki monkeys are so rare that most primatologists have never seen them in the wild? Further, even particular tree species, such as mahogany, are so scarce that only one individual can be found in every few hectares or less. Why would certain &lt;em&gt;tree species&lt;/em&gt; have a population distribution pattern that resembles that of an apex predator? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to biologist Deborah Rabinowitz, there are three reasons why species are rare. In addition to the two already mentioned, there's a third, more complicated, reason; extreme loyalty to a particular habitat. Basically, this is the situation faced by America's most imperiled bird, the Kirtland's warbler. These colourful songbirds breed only in fire-prone small-stature jack pine groves in northeastern North America. Yet when these trees are made available through land management practices, this still isn't enough; even the soil and undergrowth must be just right for this ground-nesting species to prosper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Kirtland's warblers, after the appropriate habitat had been restored, these diminutive birds were confronted by a second threat: invasion of brown-headed cowbirds. Originally known as &quot;buffalo birds&quot;, cowbirds are nomadic nest parasites whose entire life history evolved around following enormous herds of bison that roamed the American West, scaring up clouds of delicious edible insects. After human settlers substituted herds of domestic cattle for the newly-exterminated bison, cowbirds survived because they managed to transfer their allegiance to a new partner. Where ever cattle went, cowbirds followed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is how Kirtland's warblers met cowbirds. Having never experienced nest parasites before, the evolutionarily naive warbler ended up fostering hoards of cowbird chicks. Soon, almost no Kirtland's warbler parents were raising their own young. Only after the US Fish and Wildlife Service launched a program to daily capture and euthanise the thousands of cowbirds that popped up inside Kirtland's warbler breeding habitat did this species began to recover. &lt;em&gt;But how long must Kirtland's warbler be managed so intensively?&lt;/em&gt; some people ask. &lt;em&gt;Forever, perhaps?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But this simple question has universal ramifications: there are other, more famous, examples of extreme habitat specialists, including some of the world's most iconic and beloved animals; giant pandas and polar bears, northern spotted owls and penguins. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dinerstein then moves on to consider other critically important questions: are all rare species on the verge of extinction? Have all species that are currently rare always been historically rare? Which common species are likely to become rare in the future? What sort of impact do rare species have upon their habitats and indeed, upon the overall function of larger ecosystems?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I actually read this book as a hardcover almost one year ago, but other projects prevented me from writing my review then. (And for this, I apologise.) But this personable travelogue was such an intellectual delight that I just &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to tell you about it so when I learned this title had recently been republished as a paperback, I seized the opportunity to remedy my oversight. Rereading this book was a pleasure -- if anything, it was even &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; the second time through. The writing is compelling and at times, poetic, the stories, captivating, and the scientific data, illuminating and well-chosen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this engaging and thought-provoking chronicle, we tag along with the author as he shares the story of his lifelong quest to appreciate rarity in all its facets. His search takes us on a personal guided tour through the world's four major tropical rain forests -- the Amazon and Congo basins, Southeast Asia and (my favourite place) New Guinea. We sit next to him before crackling campfires when he joins fellow scientists and listen as they explain their life's work to understand the many nuanced reasons that make some species rare. Dinerstein examines decades of research in both mammals and birds and, in contrast to so many books I've read, he frequently discusses findings for plants, too. Passionate but never polemic, Dinerstein deftly weaves together findings from many disparate fields of research, along with the urgent necessity to conserve these rare species. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eric Dinerstein earned his PhD from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washington.edu/&quot;&gt;University of Washington&lt;/a&gt; and did postdoctoral work in Nepal with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.si.edu/&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Institution&lt;/a&gt;. He has published over one hundred scientific papers and nine books, including The Return of the Unicorns: The Natural History and Conservation of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros and Tigerland and Other Unintended Destinations. In 2007, Tigerland won the American Association for the Advancement of Science's award for science writing, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbfonline.com/Subaru/Pages/PrizesHome.aspx&quot;&gt;AAAS/Subaru SB&amp;amp;F Prize for Excellence in Science Books&lt;/a&gt;.

Dinerstein examines decades of research in both mammals and birds and, in contrast to so many books I've read, he frequently discusses findings for plants, too. Passionate but never polemic, Dinerstein deftly weaves together findings from many disparate fields of research, along with the urgent necessity to conserve these rare species. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. Eric Dinerstein earned his PhD from the University of Washington and did postdoctoral work in Nepal with the Smithsonian Institution. He has published over one hundred scientific papers and nine books, including The Return of the Unicorns: The Natural History and Conservation of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros and Tigerland and Other Unintended Destinations. In 2007, Tigerland won the American Association for the Advancement of Science's award for science writing, the AAAS/Subaru SB&amp;amp;F Prize for Excellence in Science Books.
