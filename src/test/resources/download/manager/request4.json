The news British farmers have been waiting for will end a trade blockade imposed more than three years ago in response to consumer fears about the spread of mad cow disease. It will trigger a major marketing campaign designed to regain lost export sales estimated to have cost the beef industry £1.5 billion. The European Commission will vote today to clear British beef for export following final approval from EU veterinary experts of Government measures designed to protect against BSE. Mr Fischler said: \"What has changed is very clear. First of all, we have got positive advice from our scientists. \"Secondly, we did a lot of inspections in the United Kingdom and the results are now all positive, so it is justified now to lift the ban. \"If I wouldn't be convinced about that, then I would not vote in favour to lift the ban.\" Even when the ban is lifted, precautionary restrictions will still apply. All meat for export must be de-boned and come from cattle born after August 1 1996 - the date on which a ban came into force on the feeding to animals of meat and bone-meal. In addition, meat from cattle more than 30 months old will not be sold overseas. This so-called \"date-based\" scheme was offered to Brussels as the answer to the crisis after months of negotiations and bartering in a bid to win clearance to restore the beef markets. Exports from Northern Ireland were allowed to resume a year ago because the province has a sophisticated computerised cattle monitoring and checking system unmatched in England, Wales and Scotland. But difficulties experienced in Ulster rebuilding worldwide markets indicate the uphill struggle the rest of the UK will face. Efforts will initially be concentrated on Belgium, Holland and France. Mr Fischler said British beef exporters will face an uphill struggle winning over European consumers in a free market. He told BBC1's Breakfast News: \"This is a question which has to be raised with the exporters - how they can convince the consumers so they will again buy British beef? \"It will be necessary in my view in the main importing countries for British beef to do some advertising and also to give all the information necessary so that it can be showed that British beef is safe.\" Britain still has more reported cases of BSE than any other EU country, although this year's figure of 1,000 so far contrasts sharply with a peak in 1992 of more than 36,000. A feared link between BSE in cattle and a similar disease, new variant CJD, in humans, prompted the unprecedented decision by Brussels to ban British beef across the globe. Claims by the then Government that eurocrats were far exceeding their powers were rebuffed by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that Britain could be ordered to wipe out an export industry beyond EU borders. The move could be justified, said the judges, because of the danger that blocking only exports to other EU member states could lead to a \"back-door\" market in Europe for British beef re-imported from third countries. The Government says that its response to the beef crisis means British beef is now safer than that from anywhere else in the EU. UK farmers hope this will lift the shadow still hanging over British beef on the Continent. National Farmers' Union president Ben Gill said: \"This is very welcome news and it has been long overdue. \"It is not the end but it is the beginning of the end. It allows us to start rebuilding the markets that we have lost.\" Mr Gill said the export market for British beef in 1995 had been worth up to £750 million and now farmers would have to start from scratch. He believed the farming industry had lost billions of pounds and, asked how many farmers have quit, said \"contractions in the industry have been severe in some cases\". One company alone used to export 1,000 carcasses a week to Italy before he ban, he said. Mr Gill added: \"I hope that we will be making a sizeable contribution in terms of exports during 2000 but we are not going to be back to where we were ever in some respects because the price of beef is a lot lower than it used to be.\" Countdown to crisis • A worldwide ban on British beef exports was imposed by the EU within days of the Conservative Government announcing a possible link between mad cow disease and a new strain of the human brain condition Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease in March 1996. • It meant an overnight end to a trade worth £500 million-a-year. • Frantic negotiations to lift the ban resulted in the Florence Agreement, a framework document signed in the summer of 1996 setting out conditions Britain had to meet before the ban would be lifted. • These included a mass slaughter of all cattle over the age of 30 months, BSE control measures including the removal of spinal cord from carcasses and the setting up of a computerised cattle database so every animal can be tracked throughout its life and its full history recorded. • But hopes of a swift resumption of trade were dashed when negotiations stalled. • As frustration intensified, the Government accused its European partners - led by Germany - of deliberately scuppering progress to protect their own markets and curry political favour at home bringing relations with Europe to a new low. • Scientists and even the European Commission have acknowledged for months that there are no scientific reasons for the ban to remain in place, adding to farmers' mounting anger and despair. • The first breakthrough came early last year when the EU finally agreed to allow exports of certain accredited meat from herds in Northern Ireland, where a computerised system is already in operation. • European ministers agreed last year to the resumption of beef exports from mainland Britain. But final approval was needed from EU inspectors who wanted to make sure the \"date-based\" scheme could be soundly managed. • Under the \"date-based\" export scheme, meat must be off the bone, from cattle which can be traced to BSE-free parents, and which are over six months and under 30 months of age. • Britain still has more reported cases of BSE than any other EU country, although this year's figure of 1,000 so far contrasts sharply with a peak in 1992 of more than 36,000. • A total of 174,857 cases of BSE have been reported in Great Britain since 1988. • The disease is predicted to die out in the first few years of the next Millennium."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/1999/jul/15/11","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-15T01:29:06Z","webTitle":"How fallen giants cheated death","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jul/15/11","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jul/15/11","fields":{"headline":"How fallen giants cheated death","bodyText":"The immediate future of Govan, Britain's biggest commercial shipyard, appeared to have been safeguarded last night as Kvaerner completed its last-ditch negotiations to sell it to GEC's Marconi Marine division. Many believe, however, that British merchant shipbuilders can no longer compete with low-cost operators in the far east or even eastern europe, leaving Govan dependent on an ever dwindling number of military contracts. So prospects for the historic Clydeside facility will remain tough, even if GEC does pull off a rescue. Nonetheless, some of the great names of British shipbuilding have shown an amazing capacity to recreate themselves as profitable entities. Cammell Laird, Swan Hunter and Harland &amp; Wolff are all now thriving after near-death experiences. Fallen giants can be resurrected but so far it has been done by new, and in some cases foreign, owners who have turned towards ship conversion, repair and offshore work. Britain still has a substantial bank of maritime expertise which, combined with a local market for repair and conversion, can give home firms an edge over far east competition. If, by this morning, GEC is successful in saving the jobs of 1,200 Scottish workers it will certainly want to switch them from building large merchant ships to either small ferries, offshore oil craft or naval craft. GEC has already earmarked work on two Royal Naval supply vessels at its Barrow-in-Furness yard which is to be switched to Govan. Martin Stopford, a former director at state-owned British Shipbuilders and now managing director at leading shipbroker H. Clarkson, says British yards can succeed - but not by doing what they were in the past. \"There is a market for smart engineering but not steel bashing. Korea can do ordinary shipbuilding at half the price. But there is a future for UK companies doing value-added work such as offshore and specialist engineering,\" he argues. No one has been more successful at turning itself around in financial terms than Cammell Laird. Certainly few would have predicted that its major facility on Merseyside, closed in 1993, could possibly become the base for a stock market darling of 1999. Cammell Laird Holdings has seen its profitability pretty much double every year since 1995 and seen its share price rise from £1 when it rejoined the stock exchange in July 1997 to well over £9 today. But the Birkenhead-based company, like others, only succeeded after they were revived with most of their debts written off - and in some cases all staff removed. Some employees saved themselves, however, and the shipbuilding trades unionists who fought closure of their facilities have breathed new life into at least one yard, Sunderland Shipbuilders, which now trades as Pallion Engineering. The private company led by former shop steward, Peter Callaghan, is fabricating steel pieces for land-based indus tries but there is speculation that it could move back into the shipping field before long. Harland &amp; Wolff was one of the great problem companies of the 1970s. It was considered to have been kept in business by the government only because its Belfast location would make its demise as a key employer politically disastrous. But a hard-headed new owner in the shape of Norway's Fred Olsen has turned the company around. First he gave the yard orders from his own shipping empire but then he moved into offshore and more specialised craft. It was not easy, but Harland &amp; Wolff is now a success story. Similarly, Swan Hunter was rescued from receivership and imminent break-up by Dutch businessman Jaap Kroese in 1995. Since he bought the company for £4m, it has converted the bulk carrier Solitaire into the world's largest cable-laying ship and has now set his sights on two new landing ships and an aircraft carrier for the ministry of defence. Kroese, who was also talking to Kvaerner about Govan, is now looking at investing £30m in building the biggest dry dock in mainland Britain. He believes there is a good future for Swan Hunter and Govan in the construction of smaller ships - up to 100m in size - and offshore craft. But before Govan is brought back to profitability, Swan Hunter believes there is a need for a big investment programme in men and equipment. Like Harland &amp; Wolff, which brought in Japanese robotics and labour systems, Swan Hunter has been harnessing more dynamic work methods from Holland. Norman Brownell, Swan Hunter's commercial director, acknowledges that the bulk carriers that were the mainstay of Govan's work in the past are no longer appropriate because of far east competition. But he is convinced there is still a swath of smaller ships on which Europe can still be more competitive. The long rundown of shipbuilding interests in Britain has taken its toll on the workforce, however. Swan Hunter has committed itself to training 100 apprentices a year over the next decade to build up a pool of talent for the future. Brownell says: \"When I started in this industry the average age of a shipyard welder was 20-something, now it must be 50-something.\" So, Govan might still be saved if Kvaerner can agree terms with GEC but a new world-beating merchant shipbuilding sector is unlikely. No one will bring back the glory days of the 1920s when 330,000 were employed and almost 70% of the world's merchant fleet was constructed in British yards. Now less than 1% of the world's larger ships are constructed in the United Kingdom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jul/16/3","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-16T00:22:37Z","webTitle":"Bridging the north-south divide","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/16/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jul/16/3","fields":{"headline":"Bridging the north-south divide","bodyText":"Final designs for the Hungerford bridge millennium project, which will link the West End of London with the South Bank, were unveiled yesterday, writes Libby Brooks. The project will create two symmetrical footbridges suspended on either side of the existing rail bridge, which itself originates from a suspension footbridge built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 1845. The bridge will allow pedestrians to walk from Waterloo Station to Trafalgar Square in minutes. In addition, the Surrey Pier - one of Brunel's original bridge piers - will be opened for the first time in 100 years and connected to the South Bank by two lower level walkways. The constructions will become the only bridges to offer shelter across the Thames, and are expected to carry about 7m pedestrians a year. The whole structure will be illuminated at night, and accessible to people with disabilities. Work will begin in October, and the first bridge is expected to be completed by the end of 2000, the second by the following spring. About £8m of the funding for the £26 million project comes from the Millennium Commission, in addition to support from Westminster city council, which is managing the scheme on behalf of the Cross River Partnership. The winning design, selected in an international competition, is from design consortium engineers WSP Group, the architects Lifschutz Davidson and quantity surveyors Davis Langdon &amp; Everest."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/jul/16/devolution.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-16T00:27:34Z","webTitle":"Hague accused of feeding English flames","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jul/16/devolution.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jul/16/devolution.uk","fields":{"headline":"Hague accused of feeding English flames","bodyText":"The government accused William Hague of fanning the flames of English nationalism yesterday after he proposed a ban on Scottish and Welsh MPs voting on purely English matters at Westminster. But Mr Hague denied the incendiary charge, claiming that what he was trying to do was defuse the nationalist \"timebomb\" rather than set it ticking. \"Talking about these problems is not anti-Scottish,\" he said in a speech last night. In a lecture to the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies, Mr Hague warned: \"We can already hear the drums of English nationalism starting to beat.\" He pointed out the \"sea of red and white flags and the painted faces at last year's World Cup ... the signs of an emerging English consciousness are all around us. We must provide this English consciousness with a legitimate political outlet. The Scottish secretary, John Reid, said the Conservative leader was \"feeding the very resentment he claims he wants to avoid and is becoming the mirror image of the Scottish separatists.\" The Leader of the House, Margaret Beckett, accused Mr Hague of \"playing a dangerous and exceptionally stupid game. Rather than listen to Britain, William Hague has just listened to his extremists on this issue. The Tories, for short-term political expediency, are seeking to pit the people of Britain against each other.\" Labour opinion on the devolution voting issue is not united: Tam Dalyell, who represents Linlithgow, has already unilaterally announced he will not vote on English matters. Mr Hague's proposal also threw into confusion the Liberal Democrats, who support a federal solution: Nick Harvey, Lib Dem spokesman on the regions, said Mr Hague was \"broadly on the right lines\" while Malcolm Bruce, who represents a Scottish seat, accused Mr Hague of trying \"to provoke an English backlash\". Mr Hague has a point: that Scottish and Welsh MPs can vote on English matters is a constitutional anomaly. But phrases like \"the drums of English nationalism\" risk giving a veneer of credibility to an English thug element who might take his campaign as a call to arms. In his speech Mr Hague said the creation of a Scottish Parliament earlier this month had upset the political balance and action was needed to redress it. He was \"unpersuaded\" about the need for an English parliament or English regional government and proposed that English MPs alone should vote on English matters: \"English votes on English laws.\" Labour would still have an overall majority in the present parliament even if Scottish and Welsh MPs were excluded from English votes. Of the 659 MPs at Westminster, 529 of them represent English seats. At present the Conservatives have 163 seats, all of them in England. But in general the Conservatives tend to do better in England and Labour in Scotland and Wales, and Mr Hague's proposal could see Labour in future have an overall majority at Westminster but not on English matters, creating a potentially unworkable situation. A Conservative spokesman denied that Mr Hague was in danger of encouraging the thug element, saying it had been Labour that had gone down the devolution road. In an interview before delivering the speech, Mr Hague said: \"We've got a very strange situation in the House of Commons where the Scottish MPs can vote on schools, hospitals, roads, whatever, in England, even though they can't vote on it in Scotland.\" He added: \"I think the risk is English nationalism will build up, that people will become increasingly resentful about the fact decisions were being made on England by people from other parts of the United Kingdom, on matters that the English did not have a say on elsewhere.\" The Conservatives are planning to campaign on the issue at the next election. Ieuan Wyn Jones, the Plaid Cymru MP and member of the Welsh Assembly, said: \"The Tories are willing to use the weapons of prejudice and fear as they seek to restore their political fortunes.\" Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond who holds seats in the Scottish Parliament and Westminster, said: \"We have always had a self-denying ordinance - we do not vote on purely English matters.\" But he added: \"The trouble with William Hague is that he seems to be couching this in a very anti-Scottish and hostile way\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/1999/jul/16/newsstory.sport","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-16T21:50:12Z","webTitle":"Sponsor cashes in on bared bra moment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/jul/16/newsstory.sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/1999/jul/16/newsstory.sport","fields":{"headline":"Sponsor cashes in on bared bra moment","bodyText":"It was a moment of sporting history, but critics have seized on it as a moment of marketing genius. When Brandi Chastain whipped off her shirt after scoring the winning penalty for the United States in the women's soccer World Cup final this week she was celebrating the end of a tournament which has broken all attendance records for female sporting events. But the gesture, which revealed her specially designed Nike bra, has prompted a rash of criticism which suggests that the battle for sexual equality in sport may not yet have been won. Whereas the likes of basket ball's Michael Jordan and others are admired for their ability to make money outside stadiums, one female US columnist lambasted Chastain for her \"distasteful display\". Andrea Peyser, writing in the New York Post, added that the players in the team, who earn up to £22,500 a year, should not have pretended to be \"saints and virgins\" if they were going to use the soccer pitch as a billboard. The criticism comes after the team endorsed a wide range of other products aimed at the fans attracted by this year's success. Lookalike soccer-playing Barbie dolls are set to become one of this summer's best-selling toys, and Mia Hamm, the top-scoring captain, already has her own range of Nike sports shoe, named after her brother Garrett who died in 1996 of aplastic anaemia. In a tearful press conference in New York on Wednesday, Chastain denied that Nike had asked her to take her top off in the event of her scoring the winning goal. \"I didn't even know which bra I was wearing,\" she said. Commentators raised their eyebrows at that, as Chastain had helped design the bra and was standing close to Niketown, the company's giant Manhattan sports shop, when she said it. But Kathryn Reith, senior communications manager at Nike, which sponsors the US Soccer Federation, insisted that the free advertising was completely unplanned. She was overjoyed when she saw which bra Chastain was wearing at Pasadena's Rose Bowl stadium on Sunday, \"but if we'd planned for her to do it we would have the bras in the shops right now,\" she said. Instead the new version of the sports bra is due out on Sunday week. Reith had an interesting idea why the incident, at the end of the winning game against China, caused such a fuss. \"Part of the attention is to do with men seeing women in their bras. But the other part is that it was a great picture for women. She looked fabulous, successful and toned - and she was wearing a sports bra. Everyone loved it.\" The company is going to use the picture when it launches its new underwear range. Marketing agency executives say that the image, seen by more than 40m people on televisions throughout the US, could add £30m to the company's sales figures. Chastain, who appeared semi-naked on a magazine cover before the tournament, has ensured a continuing relationship with Nike which could pay her another £600,000 over the next year. It is not much compared with the tens of millions earned by sports stars such as Jordan or even football players in the United Kingdom. But then few of them wear bras."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/1999/jul/17/thatcher.uk","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-17T00:08:44Z","webTitle":"A round peg in the Square Mile","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jul/17/thatcher.uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jul/17/thatcher.uk","fields":{"headline":"A round peg in the Square Mile","bodyText":"Michael Ashcroft was telling friends this week that he was really not that ruffled by the extraordinary burst of interest in his past business dealings and accompanying suggestions that he is not suitable to be treasury of the Conservative party. \"I've been through it all before,\" he said. The businessman, who over the past 30 years has turned an initial £15,000 investment in a cleaning company into a personal fortune of £1bn, is certainly no stranger to official scrutiny. His word has often been questioned, not least by Hilary Heilbron QC and accountant Michael Boohan, appointed as inspectors by the secretary of state for trade &amp; industry nine years ago to investigate events at what had been the world's largest employment agency, Blue Arrow. They set about, in their own words, \"to unravel this extraordinary corporate story\", and discovered a series of unusual transactions linking Ashcroft to the affair. He was not overtly criticised, but the inspectors were not satisfied by the \"explanations\" received on certain matters. At the time, none of this surprised anyone in the City or any other observer of Ashcroft's business career. This seems to be at the root of why he has been engulfed recently in, as yet, unsubstantiated innuendo and it probably explains too why the political honours scrutiny committee rejected William Hague's bid to make his party treasurer and benefactor-in-chief a peer. The latest accusations suggest that in his determination to protect his carefully woven web of tax-efficient companies in Belize, bringing local British diplomatic pressure to bear as he pursued his case, risked turning this tiny central American country into a haven for drug runners. But then this fits well with the basic charge which Ashcroft has faced throughout his career: he has always been travelling too fast not to cut corners. It is illustrative to take a random look at the public information on one Ashcroft transaction to see why those outside his very tight, secretive circle of business associates have long harboured suspicions. This is one of his business statements: \"In July 1994, the company acquired the entire investment in the £22,500,000 nominal convertible debenture stock 2005 in Limelight Group Limited, a United Kingdom private company, from Farnham Limited, a fellow subsidiary undertaking, for an aggregate consideration of £15,000,000. In November 1994, following a number of transactions, the company disposed of its entire investment in Limelight for a net cash consideration of £8,875,000 together with the receipt of a total of £32,885,000 nominal convertible debenture stocks 2002 in a United Kingdom private company, Lacmaw 57 Limited. \"The realisation of the debenture stocks is conditional on a number of uncertain future events. Accordingly, under the circumstances, the directors consider it prudent at this time to ascribe a fair value of nil to the debenture stocks. The net loss arising on these transactions amounted to £6,125,000.\" The statement is tucked away in the accounts to one of the many thousands of companies Ashcroft has been involved with during the 30 years since he stubbed out his management traineeship at tobacco firm Rothmans and set about joining the top 20 of Britain's wealthiest. Aside from the fact that this statement is referring to a company called Limelight Group and involves an uncertain number of millions, the words tell the casual reader nothing at all. Professional readers are offered precious few clues either. But statements such as this one, precise but opaque and utterly unilluminating, litter the accounts of every business venture Ashcroft has touched. Outsiders, whether they be experienced corporate financiers, accountants, institutional investors or journalists, have never been able to get an insight into what exactly Ashcroft has been up to in his business career. When commentators have asked innocent questions, such as about corporate strategy, or requested that a particular deal be explained in more detail, answers have not been forthcoming. Every transaction, every deal, every time the man has bought a company or sold an asset, the attendant complexity has proved baffling. For many of those whose business paths crossed Ashcroft's, unravelling the financial complexity was only part of the problem. They have had to deal with the man, his \"intense brightness\" downright \"arrogance\" and self-confessed sneering toward those who can't keep pace. By many accounts, the businessman has often resorted to \"throwing his weight around\". And this is why, a decade ago, Ashcroft was effectively frozen out of the City. The Square Mile did not want one in their midst they could not understand. \"He is very, very bright and that may sometimes be his undoing,\" says one City financier who has worked on several deals with Ashcroft. \"Many people in the City took against him because his byzantine deals were difficult to follow. He can also be bloody rude to bankers who think they are very clever and try and tell him what to do despite never having made a penny of their own in their lives.\" After a short spell hitch-hiking around Europe and managing a rock band, he famously began his pursuit of wealth in 1973 when, with a £15,000 loan, he bought a cleaning business which was sold five years later for £1.3m. In the years since, that original jackpot has been multiplied a thousand times and he is a billionaire ranked Britain's 14th richest man. In 1977, he bought a stake in Hawley Group, a camping equipment company close to receivership before setting off on a blistering path of acquisitions that grew into ADT, one of the world's largest security groups with 230 offices around the world. He finally sold ADT to the American company Tyco in 1996 for £4bn. His empires built in contract cleaning, burglar alarms and the provision of temporary staff hardly measure on the glamour Richter scale and his candid pursuit of profit has stuck in the craws of some. He once confided that he was irritated by the constant references to the amount of money he personally made from the sale of ADT because it substantially underestimated the actual sum. His labyrinthine web of investments has stretched from a stake in auctioneers Christie's to Eric Morley's Miss World competition and Pineapple, the dance studio group which captured the zeitgeist of the 1980s. Debbie Moore founder of Pineapple remains a friend. \"A lot of people have become very rich because of him but he has got richer and there is a lot of jealousy out there. But he is charming, he works hard and has a lot of energy.\" Ashcroft, 53, was born in Chichester, the son of a civil servant, and spent much of his formative years in the former British Honduras. He was educated at King Edward VI grammar school in Norwich and what one tabloid once described as his \"gauche social climbing\" has been at the heart of his love/hate relationship with the establishment and the City. He numbers Lord Parkinson, and Denis Thatcher among his friends and was criticised for having the temerity to wear a silver bow tie when he accompanied Princess Diana to a function. He finds the repeated comment particularly irksome and tells friends that it was a white tie at a white tie evening. Journalists attest that he once went to some length to court the business press but has lately become more taciturn - no doubt a wariness that has come through experience. This has only served to create stories of mythical proportions. Former associates talk of his once owning a holding in every one of the companies quoted on the stock exchange as a way of getting hold of their annual reports. He also blew £300,000 on a lavish 50th birthday party at the Grosvenor hotel in London. Another report details how he would get his favourite restaurant to call him only when the guest that was waiting for him had begun to look ruffled. The City's mistrust of Ashcroft is reciprocated and he surrounds himself with a small cabal of fiercely loyal people. Ashcroft has always eschewed the huge investment houses of the City and Wall Street, sticking instead with two tiny London merchant banks. He married his former secretary. Ashcroft moved his business interests offshore to Bermuda in 1984 and decided to focus on building business interests in the US away from the snobbery which rankled him in Britain. He became a self-imposed exile in Boca Rotan, Florida, and shifted the ADT listing to the US. But in the early 1990s things started to turn sour. Investments in Christie's and then British Airports Authority went wrong and then in 1991 a Canadian waste management group called Laidlaw which owned 29% of ADT launched a legal suit alleging fraud and insider dealing of shares. Ashcroft countersued and won. His name also cropped up in the department of trade and industry's report into the Blue Arrow affair in the early 1990s. BHI Holdings, his Belize-based interest, was set up in 1984 and includes a sprawling base of investments from local telephone companies to property, banking and until recently, the Belize shipping register. He supports the People's United Party which is now in government and was made the Belizean ambassador to the United Nations. The interests were injected into Carlisle Holdings, the stock market quoted company he acquired last year which marked his return to Britain but are slowly being sold off. The most recent disposal was his 50% share in the shipping register which had attracted strong criticism for being a \"flag of convenience\". Friends say his more regular visits to Britain - he owns a house in Westminster 100 yards from the Conservative central office - was partly prompted by his wife Susie who had tired of life in Florida. Others say it was in part due to his desire to take his place in the establishment. He made no secret of his ambition to replace Lord McAlpine as Tory treasurer although the former said it would be over his \"dead body\". If William Hague had harboured any doubts about Ashcroft he could not afford to be fussy. After the election, funds quickly dried up and Ashcroft was one of only three wealthy businessmen, along with Sir Stanley Kalms and Sir Graham Kirkham, who stayed loyal. Ashcroft's donations are reportedly running at £360,000 a month. For those who like to paint Ashcroft as a man with his face pressed up against the window of the establishment, his involvement in politics was in the hope of his own enoblement. But this hope was dashed recently when his peerage was turned down and now seems unlikely to happen. Nigel Wray, now a fellow Carlisle director and boss of Saracens rugby club, says: \"He's a very considerable entrepreneur with the guts to speak his mind. He's not 100% diplomatic which isn't to everyone's liking but you will never win a financial argument with him. But he's a good bloke, you can have a beer with him and have a good time. He doesn't need the money, but I think he feels he has something to prove.\" His most recent business gamble was an attempt to acquire Corporate Services Group, a troubled recruitment business which owns remnants of the old Blue Arrow. As proof that his combative nature has not mellowed with the years he took on some of the biggest City institutions which were resisting the bid and calling for the ousting of one Jeffrey Fowler who was chairman at the time.

The heads of state are angry that the nuclear shipment will be travelling through their waters and that they are not being consulted about the route. Armed nuclear police were drafted in yesterday along the shoreline at Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria to protect the two nuclear transports as British Nuclear Fuels successfully applied to the high court in London for injunctions to prevent Greenpeace interfering with the shipments. Greenpeace has ships off Barrow and Cherbourg, France, ready to intercept the two transports but refused to comment on its intentions or if it was going to shadow the nuclear convoy all the way to Japan. If protesters board the heavily armed nuclear vessels or use inflatables to obstruct them they face jail for contempt. The Caribbean countries have long been opposed to the shipment of spent nuclear fuel from Japan to Sellafield via the Panama Canal but the prospect of dozens of shipments of potentially far more dangerous refined plutonium fuel going in the opposite direction has infuriated them. The US insistence that the ships must be heavily armed to resist potential terrorist attacks only added to Caribbean alarm - especially since formal protests made to the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, had apparently been ignored. In a statement, the heads of governments of Caricom, which includes Commonwealth countries such as The Bahamas, Jamaica, Barbados and Guyana, said they were \"particularly outraged at the callous and contemptuous disregard of their appeals by the governments of France, the United Kingdom and Japan to desist from this dangerous misuse of the Caribbean Sea\". They also bitterly regretted that their appeal to the US to prohibit such shipments, using its authority as the nation in control of vessels through the Panama Canal, had failed. \"In light of these situations heads of government have vowed to take all necessary steps to protect their people and the fragile ecology of the Caribbean Sea from this highly dangerous threat to which they are now habitually exposed, as well as to safeguard the livelihood of the millions of people who depend on that unique resource for their well being.\" Last night the foreign office said there had been delays but a meeting between Caribbean high commissioners in London and Baroness Symons, a government minister, would be held on Wednesday. The diplomatic headache comes days after the government decided to privatise 49% of BNFL provided it could show, among other things, increased profits from this controversial plutonium trade with Japan. The government has yet to approve fuel-scale production of plutonium fuel and the company has to prove that armed shipments of this type are financially viable. Yesterday BNFL would not comment on when the two ships, the Pacific Pintail and the Pacific Teal, would sail for Japan. They are due to carry 450kg of plutonium in new fuel for reactors mixed with depleted uranium, enough to make 40 high-grade nuclear weapons. The company has repeatedly said that there is no risk from the fuel."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/jul/20/correctionsandclarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-20T00:15:30Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jul/20/correctionsandclarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/jul/20/correctionsandclarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"On pages 4 and 5 of the Friday Review, July 16, we used a version of an article about working with Stanley Kubrick which its author, Brian Aldiss, had specifically asked us to scrap in favour of a later version. There were two items, in particular, which Aldiss wanted to change. Firstly, he wished to make clearer his admiration for Kubrick's film, Barry Lyndon. Secondly, and more importantly, he wished to state that the arrangement he had with Kubrick's company whereby he would have received either $2m or nothing was only a suggestion. It never formed the basis of any contract. Aldiss wanted to make it clear that he signed a perfectly fair contract and was generously rewarded for his work. After a friendly conversation with one of Kubrick's colleagues at Warner Brothers, Aldiss was anxious that an erroneous statement about payment, which he had made elsewhere, should not be repeated in his Guardian article. The error this time was ours and we apologise for the unnecessary embarrassment caused by it.

Over two months after the first elections to an Edinburgh parliament, Scottish secretary John Reid also hinted that the number of Scottish constituencies may have to be cut because MPs have effectively lost duties to Scottish parliamentarians, known as MSPs. His frank admission of the need for constitutional changes in a British parliament to reflect the transfer of powers to Scotland will alarm party traditionalists, and the small band of anti-devolution Labour MPs. They will argue that a reduction of Scotland's 72 Westminster constituencies - perhaps to fewer than 60 seats - could make it more difficult for Labour to form a government if the Tories gain ground. Both the Wilson and Callaghan governments depended on Scottish MPs to stay in power, because Labour had no majority in England. Speaking to Scottish businessmen in Edinburgh, Dr Reid, who is close to Tony Blair, sought to clarify his own position in the much reduced role of Scottish secretary, after persistent reports of a feud between himself and Scotland's first minister, Donald Dewar, the former Scottish secretary. After sustained attacks by William Hague over the constitutonal anomalies created by devolution, it seems clear that the prime minister has sanctioned Dr Reid to clarify the confused position of Scottish MPs at Westminster. The Tory leader has spoken of an English backlash over the so-called \"West Lothian question\" - so named because it was first raised over 20 years ago by the former West Lothian MP Tam Dalyell, a long-standing devolution critic. This points to the anomaly of Scottish MPs still being allowed to vote on English issues - such as health, housing and home affairs - when they can no longer vote on similar Scottish issues because they have been devolved to Edinburgh. Dr Reid said yesterday: \"Of course there will need to be change at Westminster. If we are rearranging the base of politics and decentralising, then other changes can be examined. We can look at the number of Scottish MPs or the way we do business in the UK parliament. But these changes should be brought forward in a considered manner.\" The white paper on devolution, Scotland's Parliament, which was published in July 1997, proposed setting up a boundary review in time for the next general election. This would remove Scotland's guarantee of 72 MPs, and reduce them to around 58. The Scottish secretary also maintained that a series of changes in England - beginning with next year's election of a Greater London Authority and mayor, followed possibly with English regional assemblies - would begin to answer the West Lothian question. Reports of Dr Reid's strained relationship with Donald Dewar surfaced a month ago over claims that Scotland's first minister had let matters drift since elections in May, with policy dithering and negative publicity focusing on MSPs expenses. Dr Reid's publicists last week appeared to be making clear that the Scottish secretary - rather than the first minister - was primarily responsible last week for saving the Kvaerner shipyard in Glasgow from collapse. But Donald Dewar's team are adamant that the first minister was instrumental because he found the cash for the rescue. Critics of Dr Reid believe the role of Scottish secretary should be scrapped and replaced by a minister for constitutional affairs, who would also look after Wales and, perhaps, Northern Ireland eventually. But yesterday Dr Reid insisted he had to represent Scottish interests within the UK while defending the integrity of the United Kingdom. He criticised opponents of devolution who could not accept the settled will of the Scottish people. \"They have had to accept that the Scottish parliament is here to stay so they now attack the other end of the devolution settlement - Scotland's role and partnership in the UK parliament.\" He stressed that Westminster remained responsible for key areas such as economic and monetary policy, employment issues, taxation and social security. It was his role as secretary of state to be \"a channel of communication\" for Scotland's interests in the UK. Powers devolved to Edinburgh • Home affairs and the judiciary • Health • Housing, local government • Farming and fishing • Education • Social services • Implementing European directives. Powers retained by London • Employment law • Economic and monetary policy, taxation • Social security benefits and pensions • Passports, immigration • Negotiating with European Union • Foreign affairs"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/jul/22/thatcher.uk4","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-22T02:14:08Z","webTitle":"Mr Ashcroft's patronage","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jul/22/thatcher.uk4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jul/22/thatcher.uk4","fields":{"headline":"Mr Ashcroft's patronage","bodyText":"Almost exactly 30 years ago, a group of young radicals in what was then British Honduras gathered to form what became known as the People's Action Committee. The country was at the height of its movement towards complete independence and highly conscious of the black power movement exploding in the United States. So in May 1969, the new committee issued a statement condemning capitalism and racism and calling for a massive land reform programme because \"a vast amount of our fertile land is in the hands of foreigners who gained these lands by expropriating them\". One of the key authors of that manifesto was Said Musa, an English-trained barrister who is now the prime minister of Belize, the person who appointed Michael Ashcroft as that country's United Nations ambassador and the man who has given him vigorous support, praising him for the contribution he has made to the Belizean economy. Another of the authors was Assad Shoman whose Thirteen Chapters of a History of Belize is the country's most admired history and who is now the Belizean high commissioner to the United Kingdom, a job that currently involves monitoring the effect of the Ashcroft affair in the UK. The following year, in 1970, Musa and Shoman, also an English-trained barrister, offered their services free to Evan X Hyde, a young radical inspired by the black consciousness movement in America where he had just finished his studies. Hyde had just been charged with seditious conspiracy because of a gently satirical article in his newspaper Amandala. The trial became a national drama with crowds packing the court - incidentally a few yards from where Michael Ashcroft's Belize Bank now stands - and gathering outside daily. When the jury acquitted Hyde and his co-defendant, pandemonium broke out. In the wake of the legal triumph, Hyde's United Black Association for Development announced the formation of a new political party aiming to lead Belize to independence as Afro Honduras. But the party had petered out by 1974 and Hyde concentrated his energies on making a great success of Amandala, currently Belize's best-selling paper, and launching the country's first private radio station. His son Cordel, however, has entered politics and is now a cabinet minister in the ruling party and Said Musa's lieutenant. This week Amandala headlined its story on the Ashcroft affair: Brit press hassles Ashcroft. It is no secret to anyone in the United Kingdom in 1999 that young radicals may later shift their position when faced with running a delicate and embattled economy. But there is more than a touch of irony that Ashcroft, a Thatcherite, a billionaire, a foreign investor, an off-shore banker, an absentee landlord, in fact a capitalist par excellence, should find his integrity and his financial arrangements being defended by the very people whom previous Conservative administrations would have happily seen clapped into Hattieville jail. While the Ashcroft affair is largely being seen as a personal drama for the man himself and an ethical test for the Conservative party, its much longer-lasting effects may be on the 250,000 inhabitants of Belize. If honest investors are scared off by the whiff of money-laundering and scandal, who will most likely replace them? Already drug traffickers and money-launderers have seen the advantages that Belize's flags of convenience can offer. Last week, an American tourist-resort owner was arrested and dispatched back to the US on conspiracy to money-launder charges. Tourism offers the perfect cover for dry-cleaning grubby money. The fact that, as has now emerged, Belize passports can now be bought by virtually anyone with the money to do so is another earner for the government but equally an incentive to anyone who may have their own shady reasons for wanting to fly under two different flags. Already a casino and golf course complex is being built on Caye Chapel, part of the glorious reef off Belize's northern coast. \"It's for rich men like you,\" said a boatman with a smile as he pointed out the construction work. It will have a runway so that gamblers can fly straight in from Miami and New York. One does not have to have read Graham Greene or been to Las Vegas to get the picture. This is the great dilemma faced by the 60s radicals of Belize, the people who risked jail and contumely because they organised against colonialism and the American war in Vietnam. Faced with running a country where one-third of the citizens are below the poverty level, what compromises with capitalism become necessary? Now that they are sitting down to dinner with the likes of Michael Ashcroft, how long a spoon should they use? Shoman, updating his history in 1995, before he became high commissioner to the UK, recognised the problem only too well: \"Everywhere we feel the power of market values: everything, everybody, can be bought and sold - including politicians and others who control scarce resources. Hence the phenomenon of corruption which everyone cries about.\" Evan Hyde said this week that it had to be understood that Belize was a \"complex little country\" and that Said Musa, a friend for 30 years, was a pragmatist. There was, he said, an irony in it all but that had to be balanced against what was now considered gospel for small countries - to attract foreign investment. Perhaps the real issue of the whole Ashcroft affair is not whether someone who has exploited every loophole to make his millions is a suitable office holder in a party that supports free-range capitalism, but how small and impoverished countries can escape the warm embrace of off-shore banking, flags of convenience, drugs and casinos to survive. Many Belizeans feel that the Ashcroft affair indicates that Britain takes them for granted, assuming that because English is the official language and cricket is still played that Belize's loyalty is assured. In fact, most Belizeans speak Spanish or Creole as a first language and it is basketball not cricket that features in the press most prominently this week. The United States has insisted that Belize attack drugs or lose US aid. This has led to the largely pointless and token destruction of marijuana fields while Colombian cocaine traffickers fly their bulk orders into the same coastal bays which once proved so helpful to British pirates. So Belize finds itself today in an odd position. Encouraged to explore every possible means to become self-supportive, it took the obvious off-shore banking route. Now it finds itself ticked off by the politicians of the very countries - the UK and the US - whose citizens most avail themselves of those facilities. The Belize government is advertising for tenders for hurricane shelters as the stormy season gets under way. The country has seen more than its fair share of storms and knows that the current one about their UN ambassador will eventually blow over. What they do not yet know is what damage will be left in the wake of Hurricane Michael."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jul/22/maevkennedy","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-22T02:17:00Z","webTitle":"A chance to live in Edwardian style if you can cope with visiting hordes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/22/maevkennedy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jul/22/maevkennedy","fields":{"headline":"A chance to live in Edwardian style if you can cope with visiting hordes","bodyText":"The National Trust is seeking a tenant to rear chickens and live an irreproachably dull Edwardian life - and pay about £5,000 a year for the privilege. In return the latterday Mr or Miss Pooter will come into a little kingdom, a bubble of turn-of-the-century suburban affluence, miraculously preserved on the outskirts of Telford in Shropshire. There is certainly honey still for tea at Sunnycroft, from the bees in the garden, as well as a paddock for the pony and a garage for the horseless carriage, a pigsty and a henhouse, and a tennis court to keep the bright young things out of mischief. The tenancy is being marketed by Strutt &amp; Parker, and the tenant, the prospectus says menacingly, \"will need to have a keen interest in Edwardian life, productive gardening, chicken husbandry, and will be happy to share their home with visitors.\" When Sunnycroft was built, on the edge of the small market town of Wellington, now almost swallowed up by booming Telford, there was nothing unusual about it. The detached redbrick villa was one of thousands of near-identical houses, on the fringes of every little town. But by the time the National Trust inherited Sunnycroft - from the family which built it in 1899 - the house had become a great rarity. Almost all its peers have been demolished or turned into flats or nursing homes, and their gardens lost to wider roads and housing estates. The tenant will have to grapple with the issue which killed off the way of life of such houses: the servant problem. The prospectus warns: \"To keep the house and gardens maintained to National Trust standards, the tenant would probably wish to employ domestic help and a gardener, depending on the amount of input by themselves.\" The tenant will also have a problem undreamed of by the builiders: the paying public. The house opens to the public for the first time next Monday, and will then be open each year from April to October on Sunday and Monday afternoons. It was left to the trust with all its contents, down to the last patent medicine bottle, by Joan Lander, a name revered in needlework circles. Miss Lander was the grand-daughter of a prosperous Wellington lawyer, who bought the house from his sister-in-law in 1912 - the town could have set its clocks by his dapper daily walk to work, with bowler hat, walking stick, and buttonhole carnation from the conservatory. Three generations of her family added a few more comforts, but threw away nothing: the house kept all its Victorian radiators and fireplaces and Edwardian electric fires and light fittings, and gained a few post-war electric kettles and blankets, and a Rolls-Royce in the stables. Miss Lander died in 1997. By the end of her life she recognised that she was living in a museum piece, and discussed the future of the house with the National Trust. Her pantry came with an ancient bucket of preserved eggs, and enough bottled fruit and jam from the garden to last another lifetime. Her sister, Rachel Morris, recalled the daily life of the house. \"Sunnycroft was a house run by punctuality and discipline. Even the hens were fed to time.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jul/22/audreygillan1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-22T15:27:42Z","webTitle":"Paedophiles infiltrate aid charities","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/22/audreygillan1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jul/22/audreygillan1","fields":{"headline":"Paedophiles infiltrate aid charities","bodyText":"British paedophiles are targeting charities and aid agencies in developing countries in an attempt to gain access to vulnerable children. The National Criminal Intelligence Service, which registers and monitors the activities of paedophiles, has warned that the scale of the problem is on a level with sex tourism. Faced with legal safeguards in the United Kingdom, the men have found that it is easy to gain access to children in developing countries. The Guardian has discovered that a number of British and Canadian paedophiles have targeted an aid agency working with orphans of the famine in Ethiopia. They infiltrated Switzerland's biggest children's charity Terre des Hommes Lausanne (Tdh), and went to live and work in a children's village at Jari in Ethiopia's south Wollo region. One of the men, David Christie, 57, who is British, was sacked from the charity after admitting an \"improper sexual relationship\" with one of the 300 or so children in his care. He has not been prosecuted and is now living in north London. Yesterday he refused to discuss the allegations. Another five men are alleged to have been involved in abuse. A psychologist who has worked with the traumatised children, Tizita Gebreu, said she knew of at least six abusers who operated a \"tight, closed system\". One of the men linked to the ring is Marc Lachance, the founder of Circus Ethiopia, the world-travelling band of acrobats and jugglers recruited from the homeless of Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. Lachance, 40, born in Oxford but raised in Montreal, killed himself last May after boys in the circus sought political asylum while on tour in Australia last year, citing abuse. Last month, Benjamin Foot, the Ethiopia programme director of Save the Children, wrote to all his staff after he discovered what had happened at Tdh. \"We are now faced with the possibility that there remain a number of individuals at liberty who are either known paedophiles or have been accused of child abuse ... The lesson that must be learnt from this is that paedophilia is a major but frequently hidden problem. We also know that agencies that work with children are vulnerable to being targeted by paedophiles.\" A spokesperson for NCIS said that increasing numbers of paedophiles were focusing on charities or teaching work. \"NCIS also knows of paedophiles who have pretended to work for charities or who have invented charities in foreign countries. These pretend charities are in effect nothing more than paedophile rings,\" he said. \"These people take advantage of children when they are at their most vulnerable and in need of care. It allows them access to children on a level rivalling the traditional paedophile sex tourism.\" Ray Wyre, a psychologist who has worked with both police and a number of high profile offenders, has discovered former clients with paedophile convictions to be working abroad with children. \"As we get better and better at control and databases, the offender goes for the weakest link which is the voluntary sector and charities, especially abroad. You have people going from charity to charity. It gives them access to children who are much more vulnerable. In these countries you could buy a child for a packet of crisps,\" he said. A spokesman for the foreign office said it was aware of the reports of abuse from Ethiopia and the details had been passed to Scotland Yard but the matter pre-dated the 1997 sex offenders act which allows British courts to try UK nationals for crimes of this nature. \"This government is very concerned about this issue. We will be looking to work with foreign governments in combating this problem and offering our help to [non-governmental organisations] with concerns over their selection procedure,\" he said. Last night other charities, including Voluntary Services Overseas and Christian Aid, said they too were concerned. Christoph Schmocker, spokesman for Tdh, said: \"It's a fact that paedophiles are attracted to organisations such as ours and now we can try and find mechanisms to fight against them. But we are afraid that this could happen to us again.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jul/24/saudiarabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-24T21:34:43Z","webTitle":"Saudis tangle with the web","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jul/24/saudiarabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jul/24/saudiarabia","fields":{"headline":"Saudis tangle with the web","bodyText":"Western peril: From the outset, the internet was seen in clerical circles as a new western peril, but the secular powers knew it had to come so that Saudi Arabia could further integrate itself into the world economy. Sheikh Muhammad bin Jubair, a senior cleric and speaker of the consultative council, the appointed body which is Saudi Arabia's pale imitation of a legislature, acknowledges that earlier this century some of his predecessors saw inventions such as the radio as works of the devil. They relented only when they realised how such inventions could be used to spread the word of Allah. The Saudi approach to this latest invention has been to control rather than circumscribe it. It took two years to devise the method. All internet connections are routed through the state proxy server, sited at the King Abdul Aziz Centre for Science and Technology. This means that the man in charge, Fahd Hoymany, and his technicians can block access to \"bad sites\" which contain pornography or which could be of use to would-be terrorists. US companies furnish the centre with lists of pornography sites, updated weekly. The authorities have also blocked access to the website of the London-based Islamist opposition - although the group recently announced it was to switch from faxes to email to communicate with its followers in the kingdom, as these cannot be blocked. However, it is almost impossible to control sites which offer the chance to contact the opposite sex. Under pressure from clerics, new technology has always been used to reinforce the strict taboo against the mixing of the sexes - video links have been used to allow male teachers to instruct female students, for example. But new technology also furnishes opportunities for circumventing the prohibited. The advent of the mobile phone, which few Saudis would be seen without, immediately offered the same obvious, if even more risky, advantages for clandestine romance as it did in the west. One of the more expensive techniques has been for young men to toss a spare phone to a promising female spotted in the street and then wait for her call. Now the internet provides easier, cheaper and more discreet opportunities for such encounters; one which the older, less computer-literate generation lack the knowhow to supervise. At high schools and colleges, said one student, there was now \"more interest in the internet than football\". Local newspapers report that girls devote much of their surf time to chatting. The question which troubles Saudi society is: \"With whom?\" Online censorship: According to Mr Hoymany, there are now about 30,000 internet users in Saudi Arabia; by the year's end, 115,000 are expected to have joined the more than 400m who are online around the globe. China and Singapore apply similar controls to Saudi Arabia, but in the Middle East restraints on internet use vary. Egypt and Lebanon are open and the Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait apply slightly laxer conditions. Mr Hoymany insists that the main constraint is not censorship but pressure on phone lines. Arch-conservative it may be, but Saudi Arabia is well ahead of some supposedly progressive regimes, such as Syria. There a committee headed by President Hafez al-Assad's son Bashar is still agonising over the introduction of what is seen as yet another new instrument of subversion - just as the typewriter, photocopier, fax and mobile phone were before it. \"I'm told,\" said Sheikh Jubair disdainfully, \"that ordinary people still can't even own a fax machine there.\" •Two foreigners were beheaded yesterday after being convicted of smuggling heroin into Saudi Arabia. Idrees Issa Mohammed, a Nigerian, was executed in the city of Jeddah, and Taj Khan Gul Akbar Khan, a Pakistani, was beheaded in the capital, Riyadh. Fifty-five people have been executed so far this year, compared with 29 in the whole of last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/jul/26/davidsharrock","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-26T02:40:51Z","webTitle":"King bequeaths hunger for reform","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jul/26/davidsharrock","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/jul/26/davidsharrock","fields":{"headline":"King bequeaths hunger for reform","bodyText":"Within the space of six months President Bill Clinton and other world leaders have attended the funerals of two buttresses of the west's relations with the Middle East and the Islamic world. Yesterday it was King Hassan, sometimes known as \"our friend, the king\", who ruled Morocco with an iron fist. His death followed that of King Hussein of Jordan, whose demise in February after 46 years on the Hashemite throne left Hassan the region's longest surviving ruler. Significantly, Hassan did not make the pilgrimage to Amman for the burial of Hussein: he sent his son Sidi Mohamed, 35, to offer condolences to the new King Abdullah, himself a soldier in his 30s with no experience of governance. The United States and European powers have now seen countries upon whom they depended as sturdy allies against Islamic fundamentalism fall into an abyss of uncertainty. More could follow. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, 78, arrived last week at his summer palace in Marbella, Spain, ostensibly for a holiday. But he did so with his private hospital in tow. The haste with which President Hafez al-Assad of Syria is seeking peace with Israel suggests this septuagenarian too is conscious of time running out. The Middle East has not seen such flux in decades. Years of despotism Although Hassan and Hussein both claimed descent from the Prophet Mohammed, the parallels between them should not be overstated. Hussein survived for so long through a benign form of dictatorship. Hassan earned a reputation for cruelty and despotism in the 70s, with assassinations, disappearances and the jailing of thousands of opponents. Only in recent years had he begun to experiment with political reforms. But their timidity has illustrated the long journey Morocco must still make if it is to become the constitutional monarchy Hassan wanted, modelled on post-Franco Spain. His prime minister, Abdel Rahman Youssouffi, a socialist who spent 15 years in exile, is seen by some as the best guarantee of progress towards democracy. But he is 73 and in poor health. Hassan acceded to the throne in 1961 after the death of his father, Mohammed V. His first 20 years were harshly repressive. A military coup led by the chief of his royal household forces in 1971 was brutally suppressed. A year later Hassan's plane was attacked by its escort squadron. In 1975 he found a popular cause to unite his people when he launched the Green March into Franco's Spanish colony of Western Sahara. But the protracted war with the Polisario front has cost the country dear. A much delayed United Nations referendum in Western Sahara is now scheduled for next year and possibly its greatest obstacle has been removed. King Mohamed VI, who does share his father's playboy image, is unlikely to share his obsession with the territory and is already spoken of as a man who wishes to modernise and liberalise his kingdom. Yet some political observers doubt that the introverted and inexperienced king will take risky initiatives, despite his enormous powers under the 1996 constitution. The challenges he faces are great, even though the country has an unsatisfied appetite for change provoked by the constitutional reforms of the past five years. Heir faces enemies Yet if Mohamed VI intends to move Morocco into a new era he faces enemies, especially in the Makhzen, the semifeudal network emanating from the palace. The news blackout on Friday when, with Hassan on his deathbed, the official news agency MAP suspended its service for four hours, mobile telephones ceased to function and internet server links were cut, suggested to some local journalists the depth of the sudden power vacuum. Intellectuals have ruminated for years about the battle between the conservatives - beneficiaries of the Makhzen - and the modernisers. But the debate has touched only the few. The majority live in profound poverty, witnessed in the bodies washed up on Spain's southern coast every month as desperate would-be migrants take to the straits in flimsy boats. Unemployment among the 29m population officially stands at 20% but is probably nearer twice that. In 1997 half the population was subsisting on about £1 a day. The literacy rate is only 45%, and 40% of children have never attended school. The abyss separating rich from poor has widened in the years of political reform, posing a potentially explosive challenge to the new regime. Yet the dead king, through his role as \"commander of the faithful\", succeeded in suppressing any latent Islamist opposition, avoiding the bloodbath of neighbouring Algeria. Yesterday Mr Clinton paid homage to Hassan. It was a debt not only for his brokerage of peace between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (he facilitated the first secret meetings with the PLO) but also for his role in the cold war: he supported Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebels in Angola and granted asylum to the ousted Zairean president Mobutu. Crown prince Sidi Mohamed opened an exhibition in Paris in April, The Hour of Morocco, which cast the country in a secular and progressive light. Hassan visited it only 10 days before his death. Now is the time to see if his son will realise this better future for a country with a dark past."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jul/26/2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-26T02:41:04Z","webTitle":"In brief","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/26/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jul/26/2","fields":{"headline":"In brief","bodyText":"Scientists get £16m payout A £16m compensation award by the European commission was being celebrated yesterday by 217 workers at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at Culham, near Abingdon, Oxfordshire.

David Davis and David Heathcoat-Amory, both ministers at the foreign office during the last government, are to refuse on constitutional grounds to agree to their publication - despite a request for their release from Sir Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary. The documents, which are understood to include a number of frank telegrams and re ports passed between Latin America and the United Kingdom, could be pivotal in the forthcoming court case in which Mr Ashcroft is suing the Times. The fate of the Conservative party treasurer is tied up with William Hague, the Tory leader, who is staking his reputation on Mr Ashcroft's innocence. It is possible that the documents will become public in any court case under the rules of discovery which can compel the release of internal government papers and force civil servants and former ministers to give evidence. But the Tory ex-ministers are on strong constitutional ground since, under Whitehall rules, all internal documents belonging to a previous administration are not released to an incoming government - unless the minister involved personally sanctions their publication. Neither would want to cause trouble for Mr Hague after he made such a strong defence of Mr Ashcroft. Sir Richard is, however, keen to clear the air over the whole case rather than having the partial leaking of selective documents. He also has the problem of conducting a \" leak inquiry\" into what has already got into the public domain. Both Mr Davis and Mr Heathcoat-Amory were responsible for Latin American affairs at the foreign office during the period when Mr Ashcroft built up his business empire, including setting up his Belize bank. They would have seen most of the crucial documents at the time. Mr Ashcroft issued a writ against the Times last week after a sustained campaign linking him to alleged US inquiries into drug smuggling and money laundering. The paper also published two foreign office telegrams alleging that there was a shadow over his business activities. The Guardian has since learned that there is a much bigger file in the FO containing more frank telegrams and reports from Belize on the whole business. The file would reveal the full details of correspondence between David Mackilligin, former higher commissioner for Belize, and London demanding relaxations in the former colony's financial regime that would have benefited the Tory benefactor's banking business. Mr Mackilligin makes it clear again in the Times today that he was not satisfied with Mr Ashcroft's activities at the time. There is no suggestion that Mr Davis was involved in any pressure. Indeed, Whitehall sources suggest Mr Ashcroft was a model of propriety in following FO rules. One problem with the release of the documents is that they contain a wide range of classified information on dealings with Belize and central America that could be embarrassing to British and American diplomats. Sir Richard's request to the former ministers was conveyed to Peter Bradley, Labour MP for the Wrekin, whose controversial Commons speech drawing attention to Michael Ashcroft's business interests, led to violent attacks from loyalist backbench Tory MPs, including a smear campaign against him. Mr Bradley has tried to add spice to the affair by putting a request under John Major's \"open government\" code demanding that Sir John Kerr, the permanent secretary at the foreign office, use his discretion to release the documents. Last night Michael Ancram, chairman of the Conservative party, wrote to Mr Bradley in an attempt to close down the affair altogether. \"Given your cowardly retreat behind parliamentary privilege in this matter, and serious questions about the motivation behind your questions, you will not be surprised to learn I have no intention of corresponding with you on this matter which is now, in any event, the subject of legal proceedings,\" Mr Ancram wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"culture/1999/jul/28/artsfeatures1","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-28T00:18:03Z","webTitle":"Prince of the barrio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/jul/28/artsfeatures1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1999/jul/28/artsfeatures1","fields":{"headline":"Prince of the barrio","bodyText":"The Bard boom knows no bounds. Far away from the millennial fanfares of the BBC, across the tempest-tossed seas in Buenos Aires, Shakespeare is all the rage. Free adaptations are popular, ranging from rock opera style glossy musicals to offbeat versions on the fringe, with black blocks for sets and puppets for protagonists. The Winter's Tale is being performed in the capital for the first time, one of some 25 Shakespeare theatre productions scheduled for the city. And among the films coming from the US are Titus, with Anthony Hopkins, O, the high-school version of Othello, and a couple of Midsummer Night's Dreams. It may be the centenary of Borges's birth, but even Argentina's most esteemed man of letters cannot compete with Big Will. Andrés di Stefano, director of traditional period productions, shrugs off the freestyle frenzy: \"It's a millennial thing, choosing a hero for the end of the century. Suddenly people pay attention to quirky adaptations and no one notices that some of us have been producing quality, traditional Shakespeare plays for years.\" Susana Groisman, professor of literature and organiser of a major international Shakespeare conference here in September is more philosophical. \"I honestly believe Shakespeare to be our contemporary; his work, despite the industry built around it, shall prevail and his power to reach us through emotion and deep thought will always defy so-called cultural materialism.\" There are four Hamlet productions under way in Buenos Aires, testimony to the play's status as an \"everyman\" drama with universal appeal: Di Stefano's, which has been bringing in secondary school students for three years; a long-running version of Heiner Müller's Hamlet Machine; a manic, heavily psychoanalytical adaptation called Hamlet: the One and the Other; but most fascinating of them is A Hamlet of the Suburbs, which transfers the action of Elsinore to the southern outskirts of 20s Buenos Aires. The district, known as El Sur, is a haunt of small-time hoodlums and prostitutes and is the birthplace of tango. Controversial director Alberto Félix Alberto's play alters the characters, the language and plot details to create a version which taps into local myths and enriches the familiar story of regicide and revenge. Claudius becomes small-time mafia boss Don Claudio Reyes, Polonius is a prostitute called Polonia, a profession Ophelia seems to be considering too, and even Horatio loses his whiter-than-white character, luring sailors into his corrugated-iron shack. In this way the play deals in two kinds of corruption: the acceptable corruption of sexual preferences, drinking and selling sex, and the raw corruption of murder and incest. Hamlet, who, when not in Montevideo (ie Wittenberg), helps out in the family saloon, is visited not by a ghost but by a man called The Shadow, who makes his presence known through drunken visions or via the wireless. Thrown into mental chaos, Hamlet collapses on to a table clutching a bottle as his glass falls, moaning, \"Oh that this too, too solid flesh would spill over like this wine.\" Laertes and Claudio dance a tango together, practising for \"the real thing\" with women; meanwhile the Players' Scene is a camp sketch starring a transvestite, its purpose to threaten Don Claudio's fragile machismo as well as to reveal his guilt. The play is not merely a translation of the original to another space and time. Tulio Stella, who adapted the text for Félix Alberto, sees parallels between Shakespeare's England on the edge of Eurasia and the violent outskirts of 20s Buenos Aires: \"Wasn't 16th-century England a suburb of the world? An impatient suburb with designs on copying, occupying and competing with the centre of the world: that great empire where the sun never set. Hamlet is the prince of a sub-suburban kingdom, created by a writer on the fringe.\" Far from the modern British construct of the sedate, even soporific middle-class suburb, Stella's seedy burb is \"beyond the limits, a zone with no limits, bordering on the desert, or the jungle, or nothing.\" The adaptation seeks to set up a dialogue between two great myths, one a Renaissance tragedy set in the even more remote \"suburb\" of Elsinore, Denmark, the other a more recent tale of exiled Latins high on bravado, tortuous tango and power games. Revenge in the old barrios had none of the poetic sense Shakespeare gives it and Stella speaks of vengeance as \"an incomprehensible initiation rite, the sole purpose of which is to perpetuate violence.\" This southern, suburban Hamlet is a dark, not very princely or heroic figure, merely another dead son of a murdered father, himself an ambiguous figure, in a world which turns around men killing and calling the shots. Hinting ominously at the essential evil of his father in the darker days of Argentina's post-war history, Hamlet the barman dies with the words, \"The rest is in the shadows.\" As the lights go up, it suddenly registers that Fortinbras, who had written earlier requesting permission to pass through the neighbourhood during Carnival, has never arrived."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"politics/1999/jul/28/jackstraw.labour","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-28T15:42:31Z","webTitle":"I'm cleaning up British politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/jul/28/jackstraw.labour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/jul/28/jackstraw.labour","fields":{"headline":"I'm cleaning up British politics","bodyText":"For too long public confidence in our democratic system has been undermined by a lack of openness and accountability in the way political parties are funded. Our manifesto promised to change this. By the next general election, the political landscape in the United Kingdom should have changed for good. We will have a more open, honest and transparent political system. Yesterday I published a white paper on party funding responding to the Neill committee's recommendations. Their thorough, comprehensive and authoritative report was in response to the government's invitation to look at the whole question of funding of political parties in the United Kingdom. No one should be able to buy political influence. There should be no secrecy about our political system. Voters have a right to know exactly who they are voting for and the political parties need a system in which they too can have confidence, knowing that all parties are on a level playing field, abiding by the same rules. We have seized the opportunity given to us by the Neill committee to put forward a comprehensive package of proposals. The bill will establish a new independent electoral commission which will have an important role in encouraging people to vote in elections and referendums and helping to explain the democratic system. Their principal role will be independently to oversee the implementation of all the proposals we have put forward. To make funding more transparent, the proposed legislation will require donations to political parties of £5,000 or more at the national level, and of £1,000 or more at local level, to be reported by the parties with a view to being publicly disclosed. I want to ensure that those who have a genuine stake in the political life of this country will be the ones contributing to it. The draft bill makes it unlawful for a political party to receive donations from an individual who is not registered to vote in the United Kingdom or from companies that are not incorporated in the European Union and carrying on business in the UK. Referenda are likely to become an increasing part of the political scene and we have responded positively to Lord Neill's proposals in respect of this. The Neill committee's suggestions were designed to ensure that the two sides in a referendum campaign have a fair opportunity to put forward their case. I agree with the proposals that \"umbrella\" organisations get extra support for the campaign. Governments will, inevitably, be closely involved in whatever the subject of the referendum campaign is. It is right, therefore, that they should step back and leave it to the campaign groups and other political parties to put forward their points of view to the electorate. From 28 days before a referendum, the government will be unable to issue material to the public on the subject matter of the referendum. In one respect we intend to go further than Neill proposed. No contest should be skewed by the injection of disproportionately large funds which happen to be at the disposal of a particular group - broadly similar rules should apply whether they are for referenda or general elections. In recent years the public has become increasingly concerned about the conduct of political parties. The draft bill is a major step on the road to cleaning up British politics and restoring the public's faith in the political system. • Jack Straw is the home secretary."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jul/29/emu.theeuro","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-29T02:31:50Z","webTitle":"Tories cry foul over £5m referendum spending cap","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jul/29/emu.theeuro","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jul/29/emu.theeuro","fields":{"headline":"Tories cry foul over £5m referendum spending cap","bodyText":"Jack Straw's plans to allow every political party to spend up to £5m in the Euro referendum campaign led to charges of bias by the Conservatives yesterday . The proposals, announced in the draft bill to clean up political funding, were seen by the Conservatives as giving a big advantage to pro-Europe campaigners since the major parties - except the Tories and the Greens - are in favour of joining the euro. Between them they could spend up to £20m on the campaign compared to only £5m by the Tories. At the same time anti-Europe campaigners were furious that the same measures would limit spending by individuals and campaign groups to £500,000 each. This measure was introduced to stop multi-millionaires like Paul Sykes and the late Sir James Goldsmith spending their personal fortune on campaigns. Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, said yesterday that rules which \"will obviously give the campaign to scrap the pound an unfair advantage\" were \"unfair and undemocratic\". Miss Widdecombe's views amount to a U-turn on the party's stance when Lord Neill's committee on standards in public life proposed the changes last year. At that time a leaked Central Office document shows that Conservatives objected precisely because there was no cap on party spending. A spokesman said yesterday that the situation had changed. \"We are going to have the possiblity of four major parties with two MPs or more spending £20m while the Tories can only hope to spend £5m with £500,000 each from the Greens and the United Kingdom Independence Party.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/jul/30/1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-30T00:58:34Z","webTitle":"Statue honours Britain's first Sikh settler","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/30/1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/jul/30/1","fields":{"headline":"Statue honours Britain's first Sikh settler","bodyText":"The Prince of Wales yesterday formally unveiled a statue to Britain's first Sikh settler, Maharajah Duleep Singh, the last ruler of the Sikh kingdom of Punjab. The bronze statue was unveiled on Butten Island in Thetford, Norfolk, near the Elveden Estate where the maharajah lived the remainder of his life after being exiled to Britain in 1849 at the age of 14. Earlier in the day Prince Charles had met local people in Thetford town centre. After the unveiling of the statue the prince was presented with a sword by the Maharajah Duleep Singh Centenary Memorial Trust, which had raised an estimated £100,000 to pay for the sculpture by Denise Dutton, from Leek in Staffordshire. \"This historic day restores Duleep Singh to his rightful place in history, not just for the Sikh community but for the British people as well,\" said Harbinder Singh of the trust. \"We have been working for six years to remove the veil of anonymity that surrounds him. \"The fact that Prince Charles has come here today is a fitting tribute to the relationship between the Sikh community and the royal family, which is based on mutual admiration,\" said Mr Singh. The maharajah was dethroned in 1849, after ruling the Punjab for six years, when the British annexed the country following the Anglo-Sikh wars. In Britain he became a friend of Queen Victoria, who was godmother to several of his children, and gave her the Koh-i-noor diamond, which is the centrepiece of the Queen Mother's state crown. The maharajah spent most of his time at the Elveden Estate in Suffolk, where he died and was buried in 1893.

The home secretary faces an uncomfortable summer recess deciding whether he should rewrite large tranches of his bill or go down in history as the member of the cabinet who kept \"the culture of secrecy\" alive and well in Britain into the 21st century. Richard Shepherd, the Conservative MP who has campaigned for two decades for a proper freedom of information bill and sits on the public administration committee, summed up the mood of MPs and peers yesterday: \"Why should the citizens of the United Kingdom be treated as lesser citizens than those in Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada or Ireland? There is no reason why we should not have the same rights as those people\". His comments came as MPs and peers who have spent weeks scrutinising Mr Straw's draft bill issued critical reports calling for a philosophical seachange in the home secretary's attitude towards release of information. Tony Wright, Labour chairman of the public administration committee,said: \"What we need is a freedom of information bill. What we have got instead is an open government bill.\" He warned: \"It is overcautious and overprotective for ministers. But it is a first draft and we would expect the next draft to be better.\" Lord Archer of Sandwell, chairman of the Lords committee, said unless there were substantial changes, it would not usher in the revolution which was promised in the white paper published two years ago. The fundamental divide between the home secretary and MPs and peers lies in Mr Straw's insistence that ministers should decide how much information should be released to the public. His present bill leaves the release of information in wide areas of government - from the economy,international relations, defence to any commercially sensitive services - entirely to the discretion of ministers. In some areas from the security services to policy making, the home secretary wants a total ban on its release. MPs and peers yesterday threw out the whole structure of his proposals by insisting that the new information commissioner, and not ministers or officials, should have the power to decide whether documents could be released in the public interest. They also want tougher tests to force the disclosure of commercially sensitive information and guarantees that investigations into accident inquiries would be made public. They rejected a raft of clauses in the bill which allowed public authorities to demand to know why people wanted information and gave them powers to gag people given documents from telling the press or even their family details of the disclosures. The MPs and peers attack came on the same day as Mr Straw blocked the Guardian from getting information under John Major's \"open government\" code on the Passport Agency debacle - by saying it was either commercially confidential or would involve releasing policy advice. Both the Campaign for Freedom of Information and the Consumers' Association yesterday warmly welcomed the criticism by MPs and peers of the proposed legislation. Maurice Frankel, director of the campaign, said: \"These reports call for the removal of some of the most objectionable elements of the draft bill. If acted upon, they would transform the bill from a weak measure likely to frustrate many of those seeking information into a robust right of access.\" Mr Straw promised to study both reports and give his views later. Bob Satchwell, director of the Society of Editors, welcomed the committee's verdicts: \"Members of parliament clearly share the grave misgivings about the draft bill shared by a host of disparate organisations.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/jul/31/3","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-07-31T00:35:51Z","webTitle":"Russian ruse causes red faces at the IMF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/jul/31/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/jul/31/3","fields":{"headline":"Russian ruse causes red faces at the IMF","bodyText":"The United Kingdom cannot but be deeply embarrassed by the discovery that the dependent territories of the Channel Islands were used by the Russian authorities to hide a portion of Moscow's foreign exchange reserves. An inquiry commissioned by the International Monetary Fund and carried out by the global accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has established that when Russia negotiated its $10.1bn (£6.5bn) loan from the IMF in 1996 (the loan has since been cancelled) it falsely claimed that some $1.2 bn of cash, deposited with Financial Management Company in the Channel Islands, was part of its liquid reserves. In fact, it was not accessible at all. Had the Russians presented the IMF negotiating team with proper data then, the fund credit might never have been disbursed. The issue has come to a head as a result of the decision by the IMF board this week to approve a new $4.5bn loan to Russia, the first since last summer's collapse of the rouble and debt moratorium. The United States and other western governments refused to support any new lending, even if it was only to keep Moscow on existing loans until such time as a thorough auditing of its reserves had been done. In the wake of the PwC report, the IMF has acknowledged that the previous loan agreements were made on the basis of false information. This, according to the fund's first deputy managing director Stanley Fischer is \"a very, very serious issue\". While it is certainly critical for the IMF, because its credibility as a custodian of official global funds had been challenged, it is also tricky for Britain. The UK is a founder member of the IMF, its fourth largest shareholder and a considerable influence on the way it is run. It cannot be very proud, therefore, that a secretive investment company in the Channel Islands -- where the Home Office has legislative powers - was used by Moscow to pull the wool over the eyes of the IMF and indirectly Westminster, which authorises Britain's contributions to the IMF's quotas. The European Union already has the Channel Islands in its sights because of its tax-haven status and its £230bn offshore finance industry. It is time, however, that Westminster moved to ensure that the highest standards of financial regulation, as recommended by the Edwards committee, are implemented. Figure it out The headline increase of 43% in Lloyds TSB profits will look, to critics of the bank, a trifle excessive. The reality behind the figures is less spectacular, but nonetheless impressive. The main reason for the exaggerated increase is that in the first-half of 1998 Lloyds TSB took a £400m hit on pensions mis-selling , if this and other exceptional items are removed from the figures then first-half growth was 16% at £1.85bn, with cost savings and rising interest rate margins contributing. By its own high standards, Lloyds TSB's performance in the areas in which it has focused its expansion in recent times - insurance and mortgages - was sub-octane in the first half. With competition in the mortgage market strong, Lloyds TSB/Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester stood back, with the result that it suffered a sharp drop in market share of new mortgage business to 7% from 14.7% in the first half of 1998 and to 9.5% in the six months to December 1998. Lloyds TSB says it took a deliberate decision not to pursue market share on the basis of \"uneconomic pricing\". This suggests that some of the business which has been written by others may be a cause for future concern. But it will also mean, as the Halifax learnt last year, that building back market share can be difficult. The second area where Lloyds TSB has been pioneering expansion has been in bancassurance, where it hopes to take a giant step forward in 2000 with the £7bn acquisition of Scottish Widows and its independent financial adviser distribution network. However, the first half of this year was a bit off the pace with profits slipping to £184m from £195m. This is largely explained by technical factors including the switch of some long-term savings to units trusts and Isas. Even so, British financial services, which chairman Sir Brian Pitman has turned into the core of the business, yielded some 71% of group profits. A fascinating branch line in the Lloyds TSB figures is the discussion of \"economic profit,\" the measure of performance which Lloyds TSB has adopted as a means of measuring how well the bank is doing without the interference of accounting conventions. The bank believes this standard, which seeks to capture growth in investment and return, provides a real guide to its progress. In the first half this increased by 22%, which just outstrips the dividend rise of 21%. Much more is likely to be heard of \"economic profit' in the coming months as the inquiry, looking at competition in the banking sector makes its mark. The inquiry's leader Don Cruickshank believes that the Lloyds TSB measure may be the best way of assessing the real performance and profitability of the sector. Top-pay dodge The trade secretary Stephen Byers is right to keep up the drumbeat on boardroom pay excesses with his proposal that contract periods for executive directors should be held to one year or less, limiting the prospects of golden handshakes for failure. But he should not underestimate the resourcefulness of greedy directors. One possibility is that they will seek to increase base pay, at the expense of performance-related earnings. Another is that companies will opt for two-tier boards. The upper-level would be made up of non-executives and the lower level would be a management board. But its members would not be \"directors\". Hey presto, these senior executives could be rewarded as they wanted, without fear of pay codes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/aug/02/juliahartleybrewer1","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-01T23:28:02Z","webTitle":"Iris Murdoch's brain for research","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/aug/02/juliahartleybrewer1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/aug/02/juliahartleybrewer1","fields":{"headline":"Iris Murdoch's brain for research","bodyText":"The brain of Dame Iris Murdoch, the Booker prize-winning novelist and philosopher, is to be donated to medical science to help in the search for a cure for Alzheimer's disease. Her husband, John Bayley, is to give Murdoch's brain to research teams in Oxford and Cambridge after revealing that the author, who died this year, had expressed a wish to have her body donated for medical research before she was diagnosed with the brain-wasting disease four years ago. Murdoch's brain has been preserved at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge since her death in February at the age of 79. It will be studied by researchers at Addenbrooke's and the Radcliffe infirmary in Oxford, where Robin Jacoby, who treated Murdoch, heads a team researching Alzheimer's. The disease is responsible for 75% of all dementia in people aged over 65, affecting 400,000 people in the United Kingdom. Professor Bayley, a retired professor of English literature at Oxford, who was married to the author for 43 years, said: \"One just hopes they will find a way of coping with Alzheimer's.\" The Alzheimer's Disease Society praised Dame Iris and Prof Bayley, 74, for their decision. A spokeswoman Rebecca Gray said: \"It is important that people who wish to further research make it possible by donating their brains.\" Professor Jacoby, the clinical director of the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (Optima), said the team would study cells and brain lesions caused by the disease in the hope that the information would help in the development of drugs that would prevent the lesions developing. The Optima team has made considerable advances in the understanding of Alzheimer's in recent years, developing a method of diagnosing the disease before death and identifying a gene partly responsible for the condition.

They'd opened for 7,988 other convicted criminals, said officials, but not for her husband. There were tears as well as cheers at Morocco's largest amnesty in living memory. \"It's so arbitrary,\" she said, wiping her soaked cheeks with the tuffs of her headscarf. \"Why did the king pardon all the rest, and leave me to fend for my four kids alone?\" In a scene reminiscent of Les Misérables, the first to emerge were the elderly, the sick, and the handicapped. There were also some pregnant women. In one sweep, Mohammed's first act on the throne had solved the problem of prison overcrowding, and had freed prison warders of their most labour-intensive cases. And al most all prisoners had something to smile about: the king commuted the sentences by up to three years of a further 38,224. Moroccans heralded King Mohammed's first decree as the siren to a new era of post-Hassan liberty; the press wrote ecstatically of winds of freedom blowing through the kingdom. King Hassan's last trip overseas was to join President Chirac for the Bastille celebrations in France. Now after one week on the throne, the last king of Africa was declaring a Bastille of his own. In a throne day speech, Mohammed VI promised to honour the international declarations of human rights, which Morocco had signed under his father. For the first time in years, European drug-smugglers were included in the reprieve. \"We danced with joy when we heard the evening news,\" said Ricardo Rodriguez, 49, one of hundreds of Europeans, some of them British nationals, detained in Sale prison for trying to snatch a share of the largest hashish market in the world. But after a breakfast of harira, the mood turned sour when the Europeans were told that Rodriguez would be one of only six set free. Even less fortunate were the 20-odd political prisoners, who human rights groups say are still behind bars. Activists from the disputed Western Sahara say a Saharawi dissident jailed in Kneitra, north of Rabat, is staying put. And 350 who have disappeared since King Hassan annexed the Western Sahara in 1975 are believed to be dead. Morocco still bars the ailing and exiled Communist leader, Abraham Sefarty, from returning. But Moroccans are taking to their new king like a breath of fresh air. In his first address to the nation, he promised to tackle the country's social ills, eradicate the 60 per cent illiteracy and tend to the kingdom's crippling two million unemployed. Unlike his decree on prisoners, though, that won't be quite so easy to solve.

Does it rival Tony and Bill? And is it as friendly as Hilary and Cherie? These are questions raised by the normally secret correspondence between George Robertson, the defence secretary, and his US opposite number, William Cohen, secretary for defence. The \"Dear Bill\" and \"Dear George\" exchanges are said to echo an era more romanticised than real - the famed \"special relationship\" between Britain and the US. They show some of the reasons why the Americans are so keen on the appointment of Mr Robertson as Nato secretary-general - he is expected to get the job tomorrow. The letters were released to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act. They would be kept secret in Britain until 2029 under Jack Straw's freedom of information bill - to protect relations with other countries. Tories who were close to two of the last defence secretaries - Tom King and Michael Portillo - say phrases used in the letters are nothing like the language between Britain and the US under the Tory government. Those old enough to remember say it reminds them of the mutal admiration society between Lady Thatcher and President Reagan. Those with even longer memories recall Harold Macmillan and Jack Kennedy. Labour sources say Mr Robertson and Mr Cohen hit it off almost immediately and that their relationship has gone from strength to strength. Not so well known is that Sandra Robertson and Janet Cohen also get on famously. The letters - all written in February - centre round the invitation to Mr Robertson to attend the launch of the guided missile destroyer USS Winston S Churchill - celebrating another famous Anglo-American partnership, between Churchill and President Roosevelt. The occasion marked the first time an American warship has been named after a foreigner. In his invitation letter Mr Cohen tells Mr Robertson: \"We expect a momentous celebration indeed, with Janet in the role of the ship's sponsor and Lady Mary Soames, daughter of Sir Winston Churchill, as the Honorary Sponsor for the United Kingdom. Your presence would highlight the historic ties between our two nations and pay homage to one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century.\" He also offers Mr Robertson and his wife a ride on his jet from Washington to Bath in Maine and back. Mr Robertson's same day reply says: \"Sandra and I will be delighted to attend. It is perhaps especially significant that the launch takes place immediately prior to the Nato summit, at which we will reaffirm our commitment to many of the values which Sir Winston Churchill remains rightly famous\". He adds in a personal hand: \"It will be great to be with you and Janet on her big day\", signing off as \"Ever, George\". By February 22 Mr Robertson is even more effusive: \"For our part we are deeply appreciative of the cooperation we received at every level; military, official and political. As we face another difficult situation in the Balkans and continue to engage in military action in Iraq we are all profoundly grateful for the leadership provided, and the example set, by the US. \"On a personal level, I would like you to know that your constant readiness to give us everything we need and your wise advice makes a tremendous difference. It is extremely reassuring to know that we stand alongside a faithful friend and ally as we face the challenges of these difficult times.\" Mr Cohen replies in the same vein: \"I am grateful that you prove to be an equally constant source of valued insight and judicious counsel.\" Alice Mahon, Labour MP for Halifax and a critic of the defence secretary, said yesterday: \"The release of these letters shows how ridiculous the British secrecy laws are - if a newspaper can get information abroad just by writing to the US government\". The ministry of defence was perplexed why the Guardian should even ask them to release the information: \"Correspondence between secretaries of state and other countries is not released for diplomatic reasons.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/aug/03/internetipos.internet","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-03T14:22:27Z","webTitle":"Focus: Internet listings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/aug/03/internetipos.internet","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/aug/03/internetipos.internet","fields":{"headline":"Focus: Internet listings","bodyText":"Where the United States goes the United Kingdom tends to follow, and the London market appears to be embarking on its very own internet boom.

A volume of 659,000 shares were traded, although totals for Aim shares are not usually available for several days. Brokers indicated that total volume amounted to a much greater percentage of the 23m shares in free float.

With the share certificates now issued, many observers reckoned - incorrectly as it turned out - that Freeserve would suffer, but they finished 6p better at 243p. Fellow internet service provider Easynet also shone, and proved that internet service providers can turn a profit - just. Turnover rose 80% in the six months to June to just under £13m, taking net earnings to £150,000. This time last year, Easynet recorded a near-£500,000 loss. The Aim-listed shares rose 30p to 695p. Over on Ofex the internet service provider, Totalise, continued its ascent, gaining another 4p to 30p on relatively healthy volume of 715,000. The issue hit the market last week at a price of 20p.

Nato ambassadors in Brussels, who had been expected to rubber stamp the appointment today or tomorrow, are instead holding lengthy consultations with their governments. Some of the smaller European member states are said to be unhappy about the way the British defence secretary is being pushed into the top job. Robertson is still the favourite - indeed he is the only serious candidate - but if he gets the four-year contract he could be handicapped by unease among the European members of the Alliance. Nato's top soldier is always an American; if the secretary general is to be a Brit, the organisation will look a bit like an anglophone benefit. Much more seriously, Robertson has pitched his claim on the back of his richly undeserved reputation as a hawk over Kosovo. He was nothing of the kind. He was among the foremost of the wimps who, day after day, pipsqueaked dire warnings to Slobodan Milosevic, while assuring the world that no ground forces would be committed to Kosovo until the Serbs left. The result of that pusillanimous policy was that the Serb fascists were given free rein for 78 days to kill up to ten thousand Albanians with absolute impunity. Our soldiers are now expected to maintain a non-existent peace in the hate-filled wreckage of Kosovo. Every day brings more awful accounts of revenge killings and newly discovered atrocities. Today we hear of a 90-year-old Serb woman strangled in her bath, and of three other Serbs casually slaughtered. There is mounting evidence that the thuggish rabble of the Kosovo Liberation Army is directly involved in a systematic campaign of terror. It's little wonder that many Kosovar Albanians are crazed with vengeance, or that most of the 200,000-strong Serb population have fled the province. Having provoked the worst slaughter in Europe since World War Two, Nato is unwillingly, helplessly, presiding over the final ethnic cleansing of Kosovo. George Robertson had a good war, in the eyes of the Nato establishment. He came over well on the media, with his sub-Churchillian claptrap about solemn duty and stern resolve. The Americans were particularly delighted with him, and they of course provide most of Nato's cash and death-tubes. Today's Guardian carries a fascinatingly slobbering pre-Kosovo correspondence between Robertson and his US opposite number, William Cohen, in which both men heap praise on each other and swear undying mutual support. Robertson writes to Cohen: \"I would like you to know that your constant readiness to give us everything we need and your wise advice makes a tremendous difference. It is extremely reassuring to know that we stand alongside a faithful friend and ally as we face the challenges of these difficult times.\" Cohen replies: I am grateful that you prove to be an equally constant source of valued insight and judicious counsel.\" And so on and so forth, until the sick-bag brims over.

The disclosure came as Germany announced that it would continue to ban the import of British beef because of fears of BSE, even though this would be illegal under the deal lifting the restrictions. The new setback for farmers comes after meat exporters examined the small print of the deal negotiated by Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, and the EU to lift the ban. The rules require cattle to be slaughtered in abattoirs dedicated solely to export. They will have to be policed and supervised by teams of inspectors. Lorries used to export the beef will be banned from handling any other business. The restrictions make it prohibitively expensive for meat exporters to open abattoirs. They fear the huge extra costs of running them plus the relatively few cattle eligible for export will drive them into the bankruptcy courts. In Northern Ireland export of Ulster beef has ceased 12 months after the ban was lifted there precisely because of the same problem. The rules also require strict traceability of the new animals - including guaranteed proof that the mother of the calf is alive six months after its birth. This rules out two out of every three steers coming to abattoirs for slaughter - and will not change significantly until next spring when the ministry of agriculture's computer records will only just begin to cope with supplying such information. Meat exporters say only one new slaughterhouse - in St Merryn, Cornwall - is planning to handle beef exports in the whole of the United Kingdom. One abattoir in Scotland - already approved by the EU - has decided not to open because it would bankrupt its business. No other abattoir is planned to open in Scotland because of the huge running costs of the EU proposals and because 68% of Scottish cattle do not meet the traceability rules. The restrictions are particularly disastrous for Scotland, which was least affected by BSE and also still able to command an export market for prime Aberdeen Angus beef. They could not use the Cornish abattoir because the long lorry journeys would cause stress for the animals and might break regulations for transporting cattle. Brian Pack, chief executive of the ANM group, which owns Scottish Premier Meat, the biggest beef exporter, said: \"If we went ahead under the present regulations it would be economic suicide - not only for exports but for the domestic market. The losses would be so great on exports that it would undermine the viability of slaughtering animals for the domestic market.\" He disclosed that one company, Buchan Meats, had received approval from the EU and the Scottish Office for the opening of a dedicated slaughterhouse to handle beef exports, but had abandoned the plan because it was not commercially viable. Gerry Maguire, joint managing director of Linden Foods in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, said yesterday: \"We have now abandoned slaughtering beef from Northern Ireland despite the lifting of the ban last year. A computer glitch meant last year that 19 animals were wrongly exported without the proper authority. Our previous company, Granville Meats, was anyway only handling 80 carcasses a week and we made heavy losses. We are now handling beef from the Republic of Ireland which does not require such heavy regulation.\" The firm originally had a deal with a Dutch supermarket group to sell Ulster beef. Last night the German health minister, Andrea Fischer, a member of the Green Party, said the domestic ban on British beef would be left in place until her government reconvened after the summer recess, and further discussions with the European Commission had taken place. The British government said it believed the current regulations ensured British beef was the safest in the world. Last night Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond MSP, expressed anger at the situation. \"Within 48 hours of the lifting of the beef export ban, Scottish farmers have taken another blow, since they could be facing a further six-month delay before they can get their beef back on to world markets. \"Farmers should have been celebrating the lifting of this disastrous ban. Instead, further bureaucratic nonsense has delivered yet another setback for an already crippled industry.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/1999/aug/06/suzannegoldenberg","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-06T00:51:17Z","webTitle":"Search for sins of saint of the gutters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/06/suzannegoldenberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/aug/06/suzannegoldenberg","fields":{"headline":"Search for sins of saint of the gutters","bodyText":"As the Catholic church begins the process for Mother Teresa's fast-track induction into sainthood, it should be prepared for a rather unorthodox intervention. Christopher Hitchens, the writer who scandalised the faithful by portraying Calcutta's \"saint of the gutters\" as a stony-hearted fundamentalist who consorted with the very dictators who robbed from the poor, is ready to go to Rome to play the devil's advocate. Devotees of Mother Teresa hope she will become Saint Teresa in time for the church's millennium celebrations. After Mother Teresa died on September 5 1997, aged 87, she was entombed in the Mother House, an unfriendly grey block sandwiched between spare autoparts shops and the Communist party head office on Calcutta's Lower Circular Road. It is the world headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity order, which she founded, and became the focal point of the successful campaign calling on the church to dispense with the usual five-year waiting period for beatification. On July 28, a three-member tribunal heard the first of almost 100 witnesses assembled by Father Brian Kolodiejchuk, a Canadian-born priest from the Missionaries of Charity, to make the case for beatification and then canonisation. Most of the witnesses will propound the hagiography popularised by Malcolm Muggeridge nearly 30 years ago and reinforced when Mother Teresa won the Nobel peace prize in 1979. Henry D'Souza, the archbishop of Calcutta who will act as overseer as the tribunal gathers witnesses and documents over the coming months, maintains that its task is to assemble a complete record of her life - from her birth in 1910 in Skopje, Macedonia, as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, to her death in 1997. That means calling on hostile witnesses, or giving a hearing to a contrary view. \"They [the tribunal] would surely look at the Christopher Hitchens book because he would have made some allegations the facts of which need to be examined,\" he said. \"I think he would be allowed that possibility in case he would want to testify.\" Mr Hitchens is perhaps the best-known critic of Mother Teresa. His 1995 book The Missionary Position was scathing of Mother Teresa for accepting donations from Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, the former dictator of Haiti, and from fraudsters like Robert Maxwell and Charles Keating, a California banker jailed in a savings and loans scandal. \"Her kingdom was of this world and of the nastiest bits of it, and the net effect of her career was to enormously impoverish the poor,\" he argued. In Calcutta, his forceful polemic came as a slap in the face to the Missionaries of Charity, who reinforced their customary secrecy and further restricted public access to their homes for lepers, children and the destitute. But yesterday, Mr Hitchens was ready to testify. \"I have not actually been solicited for my opinion by the holy mother church,\" he said. \"But I remember thinking when the process was announced that when the moment comes I will take my stuff to Rome and maybe some other people with me. And we will say 'can you possibly be serious?' \"I would be astonished if they actually call on me but if they declare the process open I would be interested to see how they can keep anyone out.\" In the event, he may not have to travel far from his Washington home. Last week, the archbishop of Calcutta wrote to the dioceses of Rome, London, New York and San Diego asking that they begin simultaneous investigations. Father Brian has also visited Mother Teresa's sole surviving relative, a niece living in Palermo, Sicily. That just leaves the two posthumous miracles required for sainthood, for which there are a multitude of contenders. At the moment, the tribunal is considering the case of a woman from Raigunj, a town in West Bengal, who was cured overnight of a large tumour on the first anniversary of Mother Teresa's death. \"They prayed in the evening, and by the next morning the tumour was gone and it was a tumour the size of a six-month pregnancy,\" said Father Brian. However, he could not furnish medical details. The second miracle being considered is also from West Bengal, where Sister Rita Mascaren has attributed her recovery from paralysis to Mother Teresa's posthumous intercession. The former nurse, who had been confined to her bed following a botched hernia operation, said that 12 days after Mother Teresa's death, she heard a voice ordering her to move in her bed and then asking her to walk. The Calcutta tribunal will forward its findings to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, a group of Vatican officials. They will consult doctors, theologians and cardinals to decide whether to recommend beatification, after which Mother Teresa would be known as \"blessed\". Father Brian has reservations about calling Mr Hitchens to testify but says these stem only from the lack of direct experience of his work. He is more anxious to hear from a disillusioned American nun, who left the order in 1989. He claimed that she was untraceable. However, Susan Shields is still living in the New York area. She declined to speak to the Guardian but in an article about the Missionaries of Charity last year in Free Inquiry, published by the Council for Secular Humanism, she described an order in which unyielding obedience was paramount and in which a cult of poverty saw the sisters in Haiti reusing needles until they were so blunt that they caused pain. \"It is in the hope that others may see the fallacy of this purported way to holiness that I tell a little of what I know,\" Ms Shields wrote. \"There are many who generously have supported her work because they do not realise how her twisted premises strangle efforts to alleviate misery. \"Unaware that most of the donations sit unused in her bank accounts, they too are deceived into thinking they are helping the poor.\" During her nine years in the Missionaries of Charity, Ms Shields was assigned to write thank-you letters to donors. \"The money arrived at a frantic rate. The mail carrier often delivered the letters in sacks. \"We wrote receipts for cheques of $50,000 [£30,815] and more on a regular basis. Sometimes a donor would call up and ask if we had received his cheque, expecting us to remember it readily because it was so large. \"How could we say that we could not recall it because we had received so many that were even larger?\" Such doubts may now be aired more widely as the tribunal scours the globe for evidence of Mother Teresa's piety. The proceedings of the tribunal, now under way at Calcutta's St Mary's Church, will be conducted in secret. The first witnesses were two octogenarian European priests, who are living at the infirmary of St Xavier's, a Calcutta boys' school. Another of Mr Hitchens's objections is to the speed with which the church is acting to canonise Mother Teresa. \"The reasons for haste are so palpably secular as to be obvious for anyone,\" he said. \"The Pope wants this to be done by him. I don't allege that he wants it done by the time Y2K adjustments are necessary, he just wants it done while he is at the helm.\" Father Brian says fast-tracking has been done before - albeit several hundred years ago, for Francis of Assisi and Anthony of Padua. Mother Teresa's cause was sped by her very 20th century celebrity. \"Before you begin this official investigation, you do not start unless there is a very wide and extensive reputation of holiness,\" said Father Brian. \"So the opening is there. Yes, she had a worldwide reputation of holiness already in her own lifetime. Now the question is was that reputation of holiness authentic or not?\" For • Lived life of poverty and chastity • Founded Missionaries of Charity in India to help poor and homeless regardless of race or caste • Used award money to help lepers, alcoholics, orphans, drug addicts and homeless • Responsible for 'miracle cures' • Inspired materialist role models to try to do good,eg Princess Diana Against • Accepted money from Haiti dictator Baby Doc Duvalier • Believed it was \"beautiful for the poor to accept their lot\" • Hostile to birth control (for orthodox Catholics, this is a 'pro') • Believed Aids sufferers were being punished for sexual misbehaviour • Endorsed primitive medical regime at her order's clinics"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/1999/aug/06/edinburghfilmfestival.festivals","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-06T17:43:16Z","webTitle":"The spartan stylist of cinema","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/aug/06/edinburghfilmfestival.festivals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/aug/06/edinburghfilmfestival.festivals","fields":{"headline":"The spartan stylist of cinema","bodyText":"He almost never used close-ups. In his last nine films, he worked with only one lens. For decades he has not employed a professional actor. He is the most spartan stylist in film history. And yet Robert Bresson is regarded by many of the more expansive of great world directors as their master. The ferocious Martin Scorsese, the flamboyant Bernardo Bertolucci and the operatic poet of Soviet cinema, Andrei Tarkovsky, have all rated him as the greatest film director, as have Paul Schrader, the Spanish director Victor Erice, and the German Wim Wenders. What could these directors find in such an oasis of austerity? Scorsese believes that Bresson's stony exterior is misleading. \"He is actually an incredibly dynamic film-maker. I learn a lot each time I watch one of his pictures,\" he said. \"There's a cheap dynamism that's easily attainable through the many technological advances in movies, but in Bresson you get a true dynamism generated by the most elemental relationship between image and sound.\" Bresson's surprising status worldwide - supplanting more obvious candidates such as Renoir, Bergman or Fellini - was revealed last year when the Cinematheque Ontario launched a project to make Bresson's work available to a wider audience. The Edinburgh Film Festival will be showing all 13 of his films later this month and the National Film Theatre in London will run a season of his work during September. Victor Erice, Spanish director of The Spirit of the Beehive, revealed that when he was a young film student in Franco's Spain, he started a secret society devoted to Bresson. Although A Man Escaped was banned in Spain, a Jesuit teacher introduced the film to Erice. \"My friends and I formed a secret society. . . full of the fervour of youth and sacredly devoted to the author of A Man Escaped. We were only 17 or 18 years of age. The Secret Bressonian Society grew in the 60s and 70s. . . the passage of time only confirmed what we knew to be true all along: the decisive influence that his ideas had on the birth of what was to be called Modern Cinema.\" Tarkovsky in the Soviet Union was following much the same course. You would not expect the author of a thunderously coloured account of an icon painter (Andrei Rublev) and one who dealt in film on the planet in danger would have much to learn from a minimalist. But Tarkovsky told how when he was a film student he found that of the films of Mizoguchi, Bergman and Bresson, \"Bresson was the only director who knew how to captivate and surprise me. I consider him a unique phenomenon in the world of film.\" Bresson was born in 1907 in the Auvergne and went to Paris to study painting at the Beaux Arts. But he soon abandoned the idea of becoming a painter. \"I was too nervous,\" he explained. At the outbreak of the second world war, he joined up, and was a prisoner of war from March 1940 to June 1941 when he was repatriated. His first film, completed in 1943, was Angels of Sin; dialogue by Jean Giraudoux and was set in a Dominican convent. This was followed by The Ladies of the Bois du Boulogne (starring Marie Casarès). The dialogue was ostensibly written by the surrealist poet, Jean Cocteau, but in reality it was almost entirely written by Bresson, Cocteau's contribution being a few tips written on a cigarette package and lending his name and fame to the project. Shooting was delayed for a very Bressonian reason: the weather was too good for the sombre mood he needed. It was finished after the Liberation. At the time it was regarded a failure, but is now hailed as as a masterpiece. His next film, however, The Diary of a Country Priest (1950) won eight awards. Bresson was launched as a European director of consequence. By the early 60s, having completed A Man Escaped, Pickpocket and the Trial of Joan of Arc, Bresson was a world figure, and by now had totally dispensed with professional actors. The American director, Paul Schrader (The Comfort of Strangers) paid a rather flowery tribute to Bresson: \"I can pinpoint the moment my film sensibility was galvanised: April 1969 when I, as a film critic, saw Robert Bresson's Pickpocket. . . Pickpocket moved through my mind into my heart. It was as if my soul was deflowered. Strange to say, Bresson 'loosened me up'... I discovered films could be spiritual and profane!\" Scorsese wondered if young film-makers today could accept Bresson's challenge. \"A great deal of today's popular cinema,\" he said, \"is so big, loud, kinetic and, in many cases, grotesque. A Man Escaped functions like a beautifully calibrated, handmade machine. I wonder if young people brought up on digitally engineered effects can actually find the patience to watch a film by Bresson.\" Well, Lynne Ramsay, the film-maker who will open the Edinburgh Film Festival with her first feature, Ratcatcher, has taken up that challenge. Bresson is one of her chief influences. \"As a student I studied his Notes on Cinematography,\" she said. \"I don't know how much I am directly influenced by him but I like this sparse style. His use of sound was terrific in A Man Escaped. \"I relate to him in that I hate filmed theatre, as he does, and the purity of his images is important to me. One of his great scenes is in Mouchette where the girl commits suicide. It's actually funny at first, she keeps rolling down the hill and getting up - until she finally goes into the water.\" Mouchette was banned in France for decades, for fear of imitation suicides among the country's teenagers. In his last major interview, given to the French critic, Michel Ciment, Bresson spoke of how important sound was to him. \"I'd say I compose a film rather than construct it. In making a film I listen to it as a pianist listens to a sonata he is playing. I flatten the image as with an iron.\" But Bresson was not always that austere. His first film, of which the Cinématheque Paris is reputed to have the only (partial) copy, was a surrealistic burlesque, Affaires Publiques. Made in 1934 with a painter friend, Pierre Charbonnier, and set in the kingdom of Crogandie, it is a wild tale of a princess who flies a plane to reach her lover chased by her father on horseback. (He never catches up). It ends at a public ceremony where a statue does its own unveiling by swallowing the veil which mysteriously sends everyone into a yawning sleep - including the princess whose plane crashes. She, however, escapes unblemished. Then, for a year, Bresson was, rather unbelievably, a script consultant on a comedy called Brighton Twins of which no trace remains. But in 1964, with such austere masterpieces as the Trial of Joan of Arc and Pickpocket behind him, Bresson had an amazing change of attitude. He wrote to George Cukor (director of The Philadelphia Story and Born Yesterday) who had praised his films and asked him to intercede with two Hollywood stars to get them for his projected filming of Lancelot of the Lake. He wanted Burt Lancaster and Natalie Wood. \"I have been told Lancaster is very athletic,\" he wrote. As for Natalie Wood, he stated: \" I believe her to be intelligent.\" Cukor promised to try to enlist the support of Wood and Lancaster. There is no known response from Wood, but Lancaster eventually wrote to say that at the time Bresson needed him, he would be making The Train. In fact, Bresson did not make Lancelot until 13 years later. Bresson, now aged 92, has moved permanently out of Paris to his country home in Seine et Marne. He has been ailing recently, taken care of by his wife, Mylène Bresson. At one time, Madame Bresson worked with him in the cinema and is now a diligent gatekeeper of his affairs, keeping a keen watch on everything to do with his films, from festival screenings to the accuracy of subtitles and the state of the prints. Since Bresson himself was too ill to give an interview for this article, she agreed to reply to some questions about his work and attitudes. One of his favourite quotes is Cézanne's: \"I paint, I work and I think of nothing\". How, I asked, could this dreamy approach possibly be associated with such a rigorous director? \"He is very thoughtful,\" Mme Bresson said. \"But he is also very intuitive - in perpetual equilibrium. He makes his films like an architect builds a bridge - it has to stay up - at the same time it reserves for chance, for the unknown, for mystery a good and great place.\" What is not generally recognised is that for all the apparent rigidity of his approach - actors must be virtually expressionless - Bresson does accept improvisation. His wife confirms this. She said: \"With the exception of his first two films, he works with 'models' who are not of the acting profession and in natural settings. Inevitably then he improvises. But he loves freshness in all its forms and at every stage of his work, including script, dialogue, shooting, montage, and mixing.\" Was it true that he only uses one lens making a film? \"Yes, since A Man Escaped\". Does he miss painting? Did he ever think of becoming a painter again? To these questions, Bresson gave a curious answer. \"He was born a painter and remains one. His films are more paintings than writings, but they are, in reality, quite different from painting and writing.\" When asked what he thought of so many modern films which were often no more than a cacophony of sound and movement, in which violence is shown in every detail, there was a cooling answer. \"He sees few modern films.\" Then there is the question of his fervent Catholicism, which some could find disturbing. Could you say of him, as you could of some classical painters, that they were Catholic painters? \"You could perhaps label The Angels of Sin and Diary of a Country Priest [from the novel of the Catholic writer Bernanos] as Catholic films. His other films are those of an artist who is a profound believer.\" I have the impression that he was not very much influenced by the new wave? (He was filming Pickpocket on the streets of Paris at the same time as Godard was shooting Breathless). \"The influence was rather in the other direction.\" Why did he never again attempt to make a comedy? \"War changed him,\" Mme Bresson said. \"His humour remained, but in the background.\" Your husband once said said that he was \" un pessimiste gai \"? Where do we find the gaiety? \"At the end of almost all his films, doors open.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/1999/aug/06/2","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-06T20:56:39Z","webTitle":"The spartan stylist of cinema","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/aug/06/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/aug/06/2","fields":{"headline":"The spartan stylist of cinema","bodyText":"He almost never used close-ups. In his last nine films, he worked with only one lens. For decades he has not employed a professional actor. He is the most spartan stylist in film history. And yet Robert Bresson is regarded by many of the more expansive of great world directors as their master. The ferocious Martin Scorsese, the flamboyant Bernardo Bertolucci and the operatic poet of Soviet cinema, Andrei Tarkovsky, have all rated him as the greatest film director, as have Paul Schrader, the Spanish director Victor Erice, and the German Wim Wenders. What could these directors find in such an oasis of austerity? Scorsese believes that Bresson's stony exterior is misleading. \"He is actually an incredibly dynamic film-maker. I learn a lot each time I watch one of his pictures,\" he said. \"There's a cheap dynamism that's easily attainable through the many technological advances in movies, but in Bresson you get a true dynamism generated by the most elemental relationship between image and sound.\" Bresson's surprising status worldwide - supplanting more obvious candidates such as Renoir, Bergman or Fellini - was revealed last year when the Cinematheque Ontario launched a project to make Bresson's work available to a wider audience. The Edinburgh Film Festival will be showing all 13 of his films later this month and the National Film Theatre in London will run a season of his work during September. Victor Erice, Spanish director of The Spirit of the Beehive, revealed that when he was a young film student in Franco's Spain, he started a secret society devoted to Bresson. Although A Man Escaped was banned in Spain, a Jesuit teacher introduced the film to Erice. \"My friends and I formed a secret society. . . full of the fervour of youth and sacredly devoted to the author of A Man Escaped. We were only 17 or 18 years of age. The Secret Bressonian Society grew in the 60s and 70s. . . the passage of time only confirmed what we knew to be true all along: the decisive influence that his ideas had on the birth of what was to be called Modern Cinema.\" Tarkovsky in the Soviet Union was following much the same course. You would not expect the author of a thunderously coloured account of an icon painter (Andrei Rublev) and one who dealt in film on the planet in danger would have much to learn from a minimalist. But Tarkovsky told how when he was a film student he found that of the films of Mizoguchi, Bergman and Bresson, \"Bresson was the only director who knew how to captivate and surprise me. I consider him a unique phenomenon in the world of film.\" Bresson was born in 1907 in the Auvergne and went to Paris to study painting at the Beaux Arts. But he soon abandoned the idea of becoming a painter. \"I was too nervous,\" he explained. At the outbreak of the second world war, he joined up, and was a prisoner of war from March 1940 to June 1941 when he was repatriated. His first film, completed in 1943, was Angels of Sin; dialogue by Jean Giraudoux and was set in a Dominican convent. This was followed by The Ladies of the Bois du Boulogne (starring Marie Casarès). The dialogue was ostensibly written by the surrealist poet, Jean Cocteau, but in reality it was almost entirely written by Bresson, Cocteau's contribution being a few tips written on a cigarette package and lending his name and fame to the project. Shooting was delayed for a very Bressonian reason: the weather was too good for the sombre mood he needed. It was finished after the Liberation.

The Ulster Unionists immediately condemned the IRA statement, which they said should be \"treated with the contempt it deserves\". But the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, welcomed the move, saying it \"should end recent speculation about the status of the IRA's cessation\". Published in the republican newspaper An Phoblacht, the statement, in which the IRA says that no sanction was given for a gun smuggling operation, came the day after two men from Northern Ireland pleaded not guilty to illegally posting guns and bullets from Florida to the Republic of Ireland. The statement says: \"The army council has not sanctioned any arms importation operation\". Anthony Smyth, 42, and Conor Claxton, 26, appeared in court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Prosecutors said that Claxton had admitted involvement with the IRA after his arrest last week, but his lawyer has since denied it. Smyth, and Siobhan Browne, 34, of the Irish Republic, who delayed entering a plea until next Tuesday, are accused of buying 44 handguns and posting 15 of the weapons to Ireland and the United Kingdom. A fourth accused, Belfast-born Martin Mullan, faced a bail hearing in Philadelphia. There has been no official confirmation that the ring is affiliated with any terrorist organisation. Referring to the shooting dead of Charles \"Chucky\" Bennett, whose body was dumped on waste ground off the nationalist Falls Road in Belfast eight days ago, the IRA said: \"There has also been speculation about the recent killing of Charles Bennett. Let us emphasise that there have been no breaches of the IRA cessation, which remains intact.\" Security sources in Belfast said the attack, in which the body of the 22-year-old had been bound and blindfolded, \"bore all the hallmarks of a paramilitary style execution\". The family of Mr Bennett, from north Belfast, denied claims that he had been an informer.

Fluently written for large orchestra with two soloists, Inside Story should not be thought of as a concerto, he insists, with its connotations of confrontation and showing off. Inevitably, however, our programmed ears make us hear it that way, especially when the soloists are virtuosic, the writing technically demanding and the whole concerto world is effervescently present. The first of the work's two movements echoes traditional sonata form, with a distinctive, jazzy-folk figure which spins off in two directions and returns. The second is episodic, characterised by a cadenza rhapsody whose delicate explosion into a dense, bustling clatter leads to a cleverly teasing conclusion. Clio Gould, violin, and Philip Dukes, viola, for whom the piece was written, gave well-matched, richly expressive performances, with sympathetic support from the BBC Scottish Orchestra conducted by Martyn Brabbins. Hellawell (b 1956) makes deft use of his resources, as the high, klezmer-like clarinet writing, bright flugelhorn and array of percussion demonstrate. Yet what lies beneath this abundance of ornament? A first listening was too early to say, but the mix of modal and dissonant harmonies will surely not have scared those members of a packed Albert Hall audience who had come for the Rachmaninov (his third symphony, in a robust performance) and a stately (going on funereal) account of the Enigma Variations. The past fortnight's rush of premieres have included the lyrical Autumn Gardens by the 70-year-old Finn, Einojuhani Rautavaara. In this Scottish Chamber Orchestra commission, the organic unfolding of the piece had a pleasing mulchy softness, but its damp charm was limited. Another Proms commission, Aerial by the Austrian iconoclast, H.K. Gruber, was a tougher proposition. Essentially a trumpet concerto for the ever versatile Håkan Hardenberger (the job description here includes piccolo trumpet and cowhorn), this beguiling piece had wit, nerve and resonance. Despite its grandeur, the Second Symphony of the Latvian Peteris Vasks, failed to put its case with comparable individuality, despite a masterly account by the Bournemouth SO, which co-commissioned it, conducted by Yakov Kreizberg. This single-movement work unfurls in a broad sweep, from crashing, Brahms-like menace (in the repeated timpani pedal-point) to haunting, quiet lament. This was another strong week for the Proms, with majestic account of Elgar's oratorio The Kingdom by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, conducted by Andrew Davis, and an intense reading of Poulenc's Dialogues of the Carmelites, sung in French and semi-staged by the Opera National du Rhin. One reason opera is so expensive, according to Jonathan Miller, is because too much money is wasted on scenery. Holed up in the ski-school in the smart Swiss resort of Verbier, home to a lively summer festival, he proved his point. Aided only by a few chairs and a piano, he persuaded a handful of excellent young singers to enact scenes from Don Giovanni and Rigoletto, translating us in a trice from bright, scrubbed Alpine order to the enthralling, velvet darkness of the theatre, simply by a raised eyebrow or a shift of the body. Miller was a benignly maverick presence at Verbier, a festival started in 1994 by a former agent, Martin Engstroem, and now a magnet for big international artists so tempted by the mountain air that they break their holidays, accept modest fees (three figures rather than five) and agree to give masterclasses. The Emerson Quartet, James Levine, Yuri Bashmet, Yevgeny Kissin (and his parents), Ida Haendel (and her dog) all flew in for mainstream concerts in the big tent. So far, however, Engstroem has ducked the awkward matter of contemporary music. A couple of Lennon/McCartney songs in a guitar recital and a John Cage improvisation by the children's orchestra hardly got us on to the beginners' slopes. But the festival's record for supporting young musicians is strong. Plans have just been announced for a Verbier Festival Youth Orchestra, drawing players from conservatoires all over the world, with Levine conducting. This should help raise the festival's international profile; despite the musicians attending, audiences tend to be local. Morning recitals, held in the ascetic 1960s church whose white spire dominates the valley, offer a platform to the prodigious young. Helen Huang, piano, and the violinist Hilary Hahn, barely out of their teens, played solo Bach, both confirming a brilliance and brashness which too often characterises the American school. Hahn's stage manner was alarming, not least because of her mesmerising dress which flashed and twinkled like a million competitive glow-worms. Bach doesn't require such advocacy, particularly not at 11am. Dress and performance matched each other rather than the music. Hahn, who already has a following thanks to her Sony CDs, has talent, but it needs careful handling. In contrast, Ilia Gringolts, a young Russian violinist born in 1982, wore an ill-fitting suit over his fragile frame and looked at the floor for most of his recital of Brahms, Ravel and Mozart. He neglected to engage with the audience in any conventional sense. Yet his playing had a rare, quiet eloquence. Anyone who can solve Mozart's near-impossible equation of air and fire, grace and grit, finally dazzles the ear."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/aug/08/deniscampbell.theobserver","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-07T23:30:11Z","webTitle":"Athletes face drugs crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/aug/08/deniscampbell.theobserver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/aug/08/deniscampbell.theobserver","fields":{"headline":"Athletes face drugs crackdown","bodyText":"Athletes at next year's Olympic Games face blood tests for the first time in a concerted crackdown against drugs in sport. The move will be the most determined assault on cheating since urine analysis was introduced to detect illegal hormones in the 1970s. The International Olympic Committee is planning to introduce blood tests at the 2000 Sydney Games in a bid to stop competitors taking EPO and human growth hormone, both of which cannot be found in urine. Athletes in Sydney will be tested by both means as the IOC tries to turn back the tide of drugs cases which are damaging sport's reputation. Linford Christie, Britain's 100 metre Olympic gold medallist, was revealed last week to have failed two tests for the banned steroid nandrolone. At the same time, the United Kingdom Sports Council is urging the Government to approve drastic new doping measures to check the rise of drugs in sport. They have asked Ministers to set up a powerful new doping policing agency and consider making drug taking in sport a criminal offence. 'Drug cheats defraud fellow competitors and spectators, and can obtain prize money when they shouldn't, so this is worth considering,' said a source. Sports Minister Kate Hoey has agreed that UK Sport should undertake an urgent review of current doping arrangements to keep pace with the sophisticated lengths to which some athletes go to disguise their consumption of drugs. It is not yet clear whether athletes will be blood tested on a mandatory or voluntary, trial basis in Sydney. Although the IOC has been reluctant in the past to give blood tests the go-ahead, the scandal-hit body is keen to restore its reputation. It has finally decided that objections to blood testing, on practical and civil liberties grounds and from Muslim countries, can be overcome. Next month UK Sport will approve plans to ban Lottery-funded athletes for life from receiving support grants if they commit a serious drugs offence. Sir Rodney Walker, UK Sport's chairman, believes a new organisation is now required to test athletes, investigate cases and prosecute those found to have taken a banned substance. The sports council's ethics and anti-doping directorate could become the nucleus of the new 'justice body'. The governing bodies of many major spectator sports back the plan. David Moorcroft, the head of UK Athletics, wants a new body independent of UK Sport to tackle athletes who resort to protracted legal action to clear their names. Sir Rodney has also told the Government that the rise in the number of drug offenders in sport going to court may require a 'legal fighting fund' to deal with compensation actions like the £1.5 million case which cleared runner Diane Modahl, but bankrupted the British Athletics Federation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/aug/08/foodanddrink","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-08T10:49:08Z","webTitle":"The best of British","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/aug/08/foodanddrink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/aug/08/foodanddrink","fields":{"headline":"The best of British","bodyText":"Imagine you're in charge of the United Kingdom Vineyards Association for a day. You're keen to publicise the results of the 1999 English and Welsh Wine of the Year Competition, and you're looking for a suitable venue. Would you choose the House of Lords, a place where the only way to create a splash is to throw a case of wine in the Thames? No, thought not. But that was where we gathered recently to taste (and applaud) Britain's latest vinous efforts. On second thoughts, the House of Lords is arguably the ideal place to hold such a tasting - eccentric, irrelevant, and not long for this life. Or so I told myself as I walked towards the Palace of Westminster. I've always admired British wine producers, in much the same way that I'm impressed by people who scale Everest or run back-to-back marathons with a sack of coal on their back, but I've never understood them. England and Wales are miserable places to grow grapes: too cold, too wet and too humid to produce a reliable crop every year. Only someone who enjoys a very considerable challenge would set up an English winery. After all, why make wine here when there are hundreds of semi-abandoned vineyards in the south of France, a place with far more propitious growing conditions? Such a challenge is easy to flunk. Stephen Skelton, the perceptive chairman of the United Kingdom Vineyards Association, pointed out in his awards speech that of the eight vineyards which won the Gore-Brown Trophy (the UKVA's top gong) between 1974 and 1986, five have since gone under. 'Had this business been more profitable, there is a good chance that all eight would still be with us,' he said. And how will it become more profitable? 'We must raise quality so that our wines both command and are worth £5 a bottle or more. We need to continue to produce wines that have added value: red wines, sweet wines and sparkling wines.' I certainly agree with him about the sparkling wines. Britain's only world-class producer, Nyetimber (which didn't enter the UKVA's competition) has shown that, in the right site, it is possible to make stunning fizz in Britain. But what about the non-sparkling wines? Is it realistic to expect wine drinkers to pay £5 or more for something made from hybrid grapes when they can buy, say, very good Chilean Chardonnay for less? In the past, there's been a tendency to overlook the shortcomings of British wines and to patronise the efforts of the people who make them. (An Aussie friend of mine once said that being the best winemaker in England was like being 'the downhill skiing champion of Saudi Arabia'.) I was delighted to see that the judges of this year's awards were much tougher than previous panels. Three-quarters of the wines entered won nothing; last year, nearly everyone got a piece of paper. Given the conditions in 1998 (remember the summer and early autumn?), the quality of the best wines was remarkable. Chapel Down and its winemaker David Cowderoy deservedly won five out of the nine awards for producing modern but recognisably British wines of great character.

The Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) is fishy, because it is not the one recommended after the horrific 1988 Clapham crash which killed 35 people. It is drearily predictable, because it has been chosen over the more advanced Automatic Train Protection (ATP) alternative, on cost grounds. Installing TPWS will cost around £150 millions over the next five years. The ATP option would have cost £1000 millions. So, after 11 years of dither, Britain's burgeoning rail industry is going for safety on the cheap. That will please the directors and shareholders of Railtrack, which has the contradictory task of ensuring safety on the network while extracting maximum profit from it. It will also produce a sigh of relief among the gaggle of train operators, who have been freed from the awful prospect of having to lash out hundreds of millions to pay for something as irrelevant to their interests as passenger safety. For John Prescott, the decision is a time bomb. If, or rather when, there is a fatal accident which raises questions about the effectiveness of the new system, his words will come back to haunt him. \"This is a very safe railway system,\" he said this morning. \"I can make it safer.\" Indeed he can. What the travelling public wants to know, however, is whether he could have made it safer still, by opting for ATP. This is not to argue that what is expensive is necessarily best. In every form of transport, accidents can and will happen. Risk cannot be completely eliminated. But where there is a choice, money should be a secondary consideration. If TPWS provides the same safety margins as ATP, then well and good. If the choice has been made on cost grounds alone, it is contemptible. Another issue has been raised by Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail union. \"The introduction of this additional protection must not be at the expense of other much-needed rail investment,\" he said this morning. As yet, we have no assurance that the £150 million bill for TPWS will not be siphoned out of Railtrack's other investment commitments. The company is run as a money machine, turning out a torrent of profit for its shareholders, while grudging every penny spent on the reliability, comfort, and safety of Britain's decrepit and outrageously expensive rail network. There is an eerie and not too far-fetched comparison to be made here between Britain's privatised railways and India's huge state-run train system. For generations, Indian politicians have been under remorseless public pressure to expand public transport. They have responded by cramming more and more trains on to the vast but decaying network. The result is an average of four multiple-fatality accidents every year, the most recent being the nightmarish collision in West Bengal (above) which took around 300 lives. In India, the motive is votes. In Britain, the motive is cash. Neither has anything to do with public service; a concept which has long since treated with contempt by both political systems.

Death of a hunk Legendary Hollywood actor of the 40s and 50s Victor Mature has died at the age of 86. A cousin, Julia Mature of Louisville, Kentucky, said the actor died last Wednesday at his home in Rancho Santa Fe, near San Diego, California, after a three-year battle with cancer. Tall, dark and with a physique of a body builder, Mature was adored by legions of female fans and was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the postwar era. Studio publicity machines labelled him a \"beautiful hunk of a man,\" or simply, the \"hunk.\" Although best known for roles in biblical melodramas such as Samson Delilah and The Robe, Mature played a wide variety of roles from Doc Holliday in John Ford's My Darling Clementine to the famed Indian warrior in Chief Crazy Horse. Critics dismissed his acting as wooden, and it was true his acting range was limited. Mature, himself, often said he was a better golfer than actor and was not playing parodies of himself. Nevertheless, he gave some memorable performances, and won praise for his work in the Betty Grable 1941 thriller I Wake Up Screaming, and for Nick Bianco in the 1947 film noir Kiss of Death with Richard Widmark as a giggling psychopath on his trail. Willis's sensitive turn wins top box-office spot The Sixth Sense, an afterlife drama, took the US box office honours over the weekend. Its gross of $25.8 million makes it the highest August opening ever. Forsaking his usual tough guy roles, Willis plays a child psychologist who helps a troubled young boy deal with his ability to see dead people. The movie's unexpected ending apparently more than makes up for its slow passages. Blair Witch Project, the shoestring fake documentary, remains in second place, having made $80.2 million. It looks set to make at least $125 million, which would seal its status as an Indie phenomenon. Last weekend's champion, Runaway Bride the romantic comedy which reunites Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, slipped to No 3. The remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, opened at No 4 with $14.6 million, and Renny Harlin's shark thriller, Deep Blue Sea, fell two places to fifth place.

With him went more than 400 retainers, ministers, 200 tonnes of luggage, 25 Rolls-Royces and limousines. There is nothing remarkable about such excess. A quarter of a century ago the north coast of Jeddah was a sandy waste; now it takes half an hour's drive to reach the end of the royal retreats. The king has a peninsula to himself. The £1.17bn latest seaside home of his favourite son, Abdul Aziz, is said to outdo in splendour even the latest abode of another son, Mohammed. What they all have in common is their scale and opulence, extraordinary array of functions and high-tech facilities, high retaining walls that sometimes stretch for miles, and portals which, though grandiose, are invariably opaque, denying any glimpse of what lies behind them. \"This one\", said a knowledgeable Syrian engineer, pointing to the home of the defence minister, Prince Sultan, \"has eight tennis courts.\" The home of one of the prince's brothers has 350 telephone lines, he said, while that of another brother's youngest wife, \"has a football field\". Crown Prince Abdullah was delegated by the king to \"manage the country's affairs\" in his absence on holiday. Many Saudis hope it will be for good. The king is quite unfit to rule, but the fiction is preserved that he is. Fahd heads the \"Sudairi Seven\", the sons of King Abdul Aziz's favourite wife, who have long dominated the regime. The brothers know that they cannot stop Abdullah coming into his own. But meanwhile they do all they can to preserve their threatened ascendancy. \"It's as if the US president were in intensive care and the vice-president could never step into his shoes,\" said a columnist. The Sudairis do not relish Abdullah's accession, in part because he is acquiring a popularity that Fahd never had, and showing a disposition which bodes ill for their whole style of rule. He conveys warmth and simplicity, talks to ordinary people, tells home truths. Above all, no odour of scandal attaches to him. The kingdom badly needs the kind of leadership that Abdullah - Saudis hope - has in him. It is in crisis. This is not the Saudi variant of region-wide transitions from one generation of rulers to another, that is unlikely to take a dramatic turn for a while yet. Nor is it a challenge to the regime as such - the Islamist threat has declined. Nor is the crisis immediately menacing. But, slow-moving and insidious, it is all the more serious for that. If every system contains the seeds of its own destruction, these are to be found in Saudi Arabia's two most defining features: oil and Islam. Profligacy At the outset of the great oil boom, the House of Saud called it a \"a grace and a blessing from God\". It had always laid claim to a legitimacy rooted in the harsh Wahhabite version of Islam, but oil provided the ideological foundation of a whole new relationship between state and society. With undreamed of wealth at their disposal, the rulers in effect offered the ruled a new compact - modern forms of material well-being, development, education, lavish welfare services - in return for a complete surrender of modern forms of political participation. But the compact is coming seriously unstuck. The main reason is the profligacy of the royal family. What was already excessive in the fat years has become outrageous in the leaner ones of today. There could be as many as 20,000 princes and princesses. The lowliest of them, said a leading technocrat, gets a monthly stipend of £2,500, senior ones up to £80,000. A diplomat estimated that the monthly \"expenses\" of the notoriously prodigal Prince Sultan could not be less than £12.5m. But where does family end and state begin? When King Fahd flew to Malaga, he commandeered his eight planes from the national airline. Some see that as a metaphor for the whole Fahd era. \"He and his have quite simply looted this country,\" said a leading commentator. There are good princes, good Sudairis, as well as bad, but it is the bad who tarnish the reputation of the rest. A London-based opposition publicist, Saad Faqih, calculates that, in all manner of guises, 40% of national revenues find their way into family pockets. Saudi Arabia going bust? It would once have seemed a contradiction in terms. No more. In 1982 it had £106bn in reserves; now it has debts of not much less. Last year they reached 104% of GDP. Most of its debts are domestic, bonds issued to local banks, but it also borrows heavily from parastatal organisations, pension funds and the national oil company, Aramco. Some 12% of its budget goes on debt-servicing. It owes huge arrears to suppliers and contractors, who get deferred payment in special bonds. The giant Bin Laden corporation, said to be owed £3bn, has axed half of its 20,000 employees. The per capita income has plunged from £9,800 in 1980, then higher than the US's, to £3,560 today, a fifth of America's. With its public finances reeling, the all-providing state can provide no more - not at least in one key area. The Basic Law of Government decrees that the state \"shall provide job opportunities to all able-bodied people\". But, while some 6m expatriates toil on behalf of 16m Saudis, 27% of native males are now out of work. Female unemployment stands at 95%. Jobs for Saudis mean essentially government jobs. There are no official figures for the bloated civil service, but about 60% of the annual budget now goes on the wages of people whom, under the law, it is virtually impossible to dismiss. The state cannot reasonably recruit any more, but it was recently obliged to do so. \"I see hundreds of them queuing outside the ministry of defence,\" said an expatriate. One estimate has it that expatriates comprise 95% of the private sector. Unemployment will grow rapidly because the population, half of whom are under 18, is increasing so fast, at 3.4% a year, that those of working age have risen from 7.3m to 9.8m in just five years. Last year the economic growth rate was only 2.1%. Hardship There was never any formal unemployment benefit in the all-providing state. Until very recently it hardly mattered. The jobless must depend largely on their families, the largesse of princes or businessmen, on the mosque or on charity, which, being a religious duty, is still widely and sincerely practised. But such support will diminish with time. Already real hardship is not hard to find. Just go down to south Jeddah, at the opposite end from the princes' palaces, and you will find something akin to the slums and squalor of Middle Eastern countries less blessed with oil. Most of the inhabitants are foreigners. But some are Saudis. And there is even an occasional Saudi among the African beggars who loiter outside restaurants, mosques or automatic cash machines. Saudi Arabia was once virtually crime-free. But with the demoralisation of unemployment, delinquency is creeping in. Drug addiction is more widespread than acknowledged. With a widening gulf between princes and commoners, waste, corruption, inefficiency, the atrophy of initiative, the habit of dependence on foreign labour, the time has already come when the ravages of great wealth threaten to outweigh the blessings of the greatest, most archetypal of the \"petro-Islamic states\". The same can be said of Islam, which, captive to a reactionary clergy, thwarts and imperils the very system it upholds."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/aug/12/islam.saudiarabia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-11T23:41:20Z","webTitle":"Saudis strain inside Islamic straitjacket","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/12/islam.saudiarabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/aug/12/islam.saudiarabia","fields":{"headline":"Saudis strain inside Islamic straitjacket","bodyText":"Early this year, one Dr Khodr Uraif accused the soft drink company 7 Up of blasphemy, in a local Saudi newspaper. The US-educated professor said that seen from the rear its logo closely resembled the word \"Allah\" in Arabic. It might not have been deliberate, but the company should have taken more care. Unless it withdrew the label, the Almighty's name would \"continue to be trampled on\" wherever the bottles were discarded. More remarkable than this sanctimonious demagogy was that no one took issue with it, or pointed out that Allah's name was likely to be trampled on far more often in discarded newspapers, including the professor's own. On the contrary, the Saudi ministry of commerce asked the company to change the label. It is a typical example of tensions in a society suspended like no other between ancient and modern, native and universal, the narrowest of local mores and exposure, through technically unlawful satellite dishes on every other roof-top, to a carnival of world cultures. It is a collision in which the state-appointed clergy embody all that is most backward. \"In other countries\", said Sheikh Mohammed bin Jubair, the top theologian and Speaker of the Consultative Council, \"people chose the democratic path. Their representatives make the law and constitution. But in Islam we get those from God and his Prophet.\" Divinely inspired or not, the Saudi theocracy, which is derived from the highly authoritarian Wahhabite school of Islam, grants near-absolute power to the monarch. He appoints the exclusively spiritual authority, the Council of Senior Ulema (theologians). Only if the king does something openly hostile to Islam, and the council declares it so, are people entitled to resist him. Otherwise they are guilty of fitna, or sedition. The king naturally chooses the kind of clerics likely to fulfil his purpose, which is to endorse his and his government's Islamic legitimacy. There is an implicit quid pro quo. The ulema can expound and impose Islam in the doctrinal, social and cultural spheres; the king gets what he wants in the political one. \"It's splendid for the king,\" said a liberal intellectual. \"The ulema issue fatwas to their hearts' content, or appear on television answering weighty questions like whether or not a wife can wear jeans in front of her husband. Our sheikhs' religion has little to do with ethics, only lifestyle. They never do what they should - denounce tyranny, injustice, corruption. We need a Martin Luther to bring us into the fifteenth century.\" Under King Fahd the ulema's influence has grown disproportionately. Partly it was his frightened response to Iran's Islamic revolution. Partly it was because, with the oil boom, he, his family and cronies grew so greedy that they had to compensate with a greater show of defer ence to Islam. Now, with the oil bonanza over and cash for appeasement and control growing scarce, Islam is becoming a luxury the state can no longer afford. \"I am sure no one has made a thorough study of the economic cost of Islam as practised here\", said a diplomat, \"but it's enormous.\" The technocrats, westernised liberals, even the moderate Islamists, know this, but do little about it. \"We liberals\", said an economist, \"are cowards, we enjoy our whisky too much. In any case, under this sytem you can't pressure the powers that be - that's sedition - so we have to wait for them to act.\" Slow-moving Enlightened princes want to act, but though the monarch has the power he is generally reluctant to use it, either because he eschews dissension of any kind, fears an undermining of his own ulema-endorsed righteousness, or because the royal family's whole style is so slow-moving and dependent on consensus. But until he does Islam will collide with social and economic reform and rationality in ever costlier fashion. Examples abound. Women drivers: There are some 500,000 foreign chauffeurs in the kingdom, but when I pointed out to Sheikh Jubair that if women drove it would slash the £10bn that expatriates send home every year, he said \"Islam isn't concerned with economic advantage or disadvantage, only with the good of Muslims.\" The public mixing of the sexes: Women can only work, if at all, in strict segregation from men. After women drivers, desegregation would be the next logical step, saving the costs incurred by such artificial barriers and unleashing productive female energies now barely tapped. The uproar over Crown Prince Abdullah's call to \"facilitate women's participation\" in national life showed how unthinkable that is in Saudi Arabia today. The population explosion - and consequent growing army of youthful unemployed: When a columnist tried to initiate a debate on birth control, the clerics assailed him with their arsenal of koranic verses or prophetic sayings. With 600,000 to choose from, they had no trouble finding incontestable dictums like \"Multiply, O Muslims\". Education: Students devote a vast amount of time to Islamic disciplines, often esoteric. \"My boy\", said a Lebanese, \"comes home with his head filled with strange knowledge about the number of camels you should distribute as zakat (Islamic charity), or signs of the end of the world.\" Graduates of the three Islamic universities are largely unemployable; they just do not have the mental equipment. The problem is not just Islam as such, it is the whole style of rote-learning carried over into secular disciplines. Young Saudis generally want to be doctors before engineers, engineers before going into arts; the very idea of going to a technical college is a stigma in itself. But with the pressure for jobs dramatically increasing, higher grades are needed to get into university. Fewer and fewer make it. Ironically, in a system that rewards memorisation, not creative thought, the ones that do often should not have. The courts: The exclusive preserve of the ulema, the courts are perhaps the most backward institution in the land. Reliant on ancient texts, the ulema resist even the codification of laws and precedents. Since they regard interest as a form of \"war on God\", judges refuse to deal with interest-charging banks. Many cases concern land and property ownership, an area congenial to their notorious venality, especially in favour of princes. Even if a prince does lose his case, all he has to say is \"sue me\"; no court will enforce payment. \"As a result, this is a land of worthless cheques,\" said a moderate Islamist. Spending cut Untainted by personal corruption, and said to be a very religious man in the deeper ethical sense, Crown Prince Abdullah should be well equipped to address the manifold abuses, religious and secular. He has pronounced \"the boom period over, never to return\"; curbed the excesses of at least minor princes; placed Jeddah's southern coast off-limits to princely development and cut defence spending by 20%, curbing opportunities for princely arms commissions. The ordinary man is learning pain too. He now pays the same 56p that Americans do for a gallon of petrol. The government wants to privatise as a means of reducing the burdens of the all-providing state. It needs to raise immense sums - about £81bn for electricity alone - to keep infrastructure up to the mark, and encourage the return of the £375bn-plus that Saudis hold abroad. To absorb unemployment, the private sector is being urged to replace expatriates with Saudis. Some young men are indeed taking jobs that their elders would not have dreamed of. The private sector does not like it, so accustomed has it been to cheap labour. The upturn in oil prices offers a breathing space. That is good, people say, if it is not used as a pretext to delay reform. What is really needed, they add, is for Prince Abdullah to come fully into the kingship that should have been his when King Fahd suffered his first stroke four years ago. The king-in-waiting is 75 years old. Unless Fahd's holiday really does turn into permanent exile, or he dies, Abdullah will have little time to rescue the state. This was the last in a two-part series on the pressures for reform in Saudi Arabia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/aug/14/jamiewilson","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-13T23:53:49Z","webTitle":"Students 'used email to cheat'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/aug/14/jamiewilson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/aug/14/jamiewilson","fields":{"headline":"Students 'used email to cheat'","bodyText":"A group of students accused of mass cheating using email face the prospect of expulsion or fines from Edinburgh university, it emerged yesterday. As a result of a disciplinary inquiry, started when tutors discovered startling similarities in the students' course work, half of the 117 first-year computer science class must re-sit an exam. The university said the students could also face suspensions. It withheld the annual grades of 97 students last month and launched what is believed to be the biggest official inquiry by an academic institution in the United Kingdom into computer cheating. Initially the university believed the students may have been using an internet site to share ideas. But by using software which detects plagiarism by analysing sentence structure, vocabulary, phrases and syntax, combined with an examination of internal emails, university chiefs found students had been transmitting copies to each other. Problems were also uncovered with the results of 26 other students. A small group of the total 117 students implicated are to be reported to the university's code of discipline. A spokeswoman said that could result, in \"extreme cases\", in expulsion, suspension or fines. \"We are not in a position to say at the moment how many students will be reported. Also we cannot pre-judge what may or may not happen in those instances as the examination process is not yet complete.\" About half of the students involved would have to re-sit the work under supervision if they wanted to continue to second year. The rest had passed. Due to the summer vacation, some of the affected students were still to be interviewed and may appeal against any decision taken by the inquiry board which could change the pass and fail ratio. The university principal, Sir Stewart Sutherland, said a review was now under way of the practical part of the computing science course to try and prevent a repeat. \"At the first indication of copying, detection software was used to uncover the extent of the problem. This was followed by an examination of student departmental email records, as an obvious means by which copies may have been transmitted, to provide further evidence,\" he said. \"Internet sources played no role in the incidents of copying.\" Discussion was acceptable among students, but the transfer of programme solutions was not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/aug/14/weekend.julieburchill","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-13T23:53:50Z","webTitle":"Same old story","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/aug/14/weekend.julieburchill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/aug/14/weekend.julieburchill","fields":{"headline":"Same old story","bodyText":"Every time I see a picture of Catherine Zeta Jones these days, all I can think is, \"What kept her?\" Of all the women who were born or built to be film stars - more even than, say, Uma Thurman, Jennifer Lopez or Cameron Diaz - it seems ludicrous that anyone ever assumed that Zeta Jones could be anything else. Her eyes always seem to be looking at you from a pillow, and she appears to carry her own Klieg lights secreted on her person, for wherever she appears there seems to be a sudden burst of radiance, almost a Pentecostal flame. For once, that erratic actor Michael Douglas has got his expression just right: sheer numb, dumb gratitude. What seems most perplexing is not that Miss Jones is now the only female star apart from Julia Roberts who can open a film, but that she ever wasted so much time cooling her heels over here on Airstrip One, making films playing the love interest of Wurzel Gummidge's son and doing dull things with sticky-backed plastic and a Blue Peter presenter. But just when you thought we'd be making merry with the Tizer and bunting at her success, it's all gone quiet. When you think about the pathetic way in which we tried to talk up such obvious non-starters as Julia Ormond and Helena Bonham-Carter, it's rather sad that the only recognition we can now give Zeta Jones is that she's really hooked herself a live one. Way to go, gold-digger! Naturally, I feel a little perturbed that she has put the kibosh on my theory about actresses with three names never really making it - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Mary Louise Parker, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mary Beth Hurt - but, that apart, I am really pleased for her because she has bust out; she has found her old life not worth living and gone and got herself another one. If men do this, we're meant to regard them as sexy old dynamos, but if a woman does it there is still a great deal of no-better-than-she-should-be-ing. Women are supposed to stay where they're put. Indeed, Zeta Jones was so far down the showbusiness food chain that even Michael Winner felt free to be bitchy about her. Seeing how he sucks up to anyone famous, even OJ Simpson, this is really quite a first; \"She's just a former dancer,\" he is quoted as saying in my precious copy of Who's Really Who. \"They're almost always rather nice, jolly people who go through life having a ball. But you never seem to hear much about them when they get older.\" Either Zeta Jones never read this, or she's much more forgiving than I am, because last week she was all over OK! magazine being all over, among others, Michael Winner. Most likely she just thinks he's a stupid old man. Although, in civilian life, old geezers are finding themselves redundant and disrespected, I'm afraid that showbiz seems to be the last refuge of the wrinkly. There used to be that special Oscar they'd give John Wayne or Hank Fonda just for Not Being Dead yet, but these days such greybeard worship seems to be endemic, I'm afraid. Just look at all the fuss about Des Lynam! What's all that about, then? And Jack Nicholson! If I hear one more woman say how sexy he is, I'll puke - when did it start being sexy to hire prostitutes and beat them up when they ask for money? Nicholson is a walking, breathing affront to women, and if he was young and fit, somebody would have blackballed him years ago. There seems to be some unwritten rule that old blokes can get away with things that would have young men pilloried as psychopaths fit only for locking up. \"Poor old General Pinochet - he's on his last legs, bless him!\" Good: the quicker he pops his clogs in clink, the less money the wretched British taxpayer will have to waste on him. I bet all those people he had tortured to death would have loved the chance to die of old age in jail - compared with what they went through, Pinochet's having an all-expenses-paid Saga holiday. People of a certain sensibility would be the first to ridicule and reject the sickening displays or brown-nosing recently laid at the bunion-blighted feet of the Queen Mother, yet these same people, the Hip Squares, practically wet themselves and genuflect every time they mention John Peel or, God help us, Jeffrey Bernard. Longevity, pure and simple, has a great deal to do with it - such people hit critical mass only when they hit 60. Before that, only a handful of dismal misfits had ever heard of them. Add on William Burroughs, Ken Kesey and Steven Berkoff while you're at it, and what a sad-sack selection of septuagenarians we've put up there in the counter-culture canon! Makes you kind of envious of squares proper, what with Compo and Rompo and the rest of them. And what does this rogues' gallery have in common, apart from providing a good argument for forcible euthanasia? Yes, fight fans, you've guessed it: an attitude to women that is in equal parts Howard Hughes's attitude towards money and Hitler's attitude towards the Jews - as a wise (Jewish) man once said of the old pop group The Knack. You will look for old women in the Hip Square canon in vain; they were long ago killed by their spaced-out husbands or dumped for younger models. For my sins, I met Jeffrey Bernard a few times, and I do not for the life of me understand his continuing canonisation. I can only suppose he appeals to people who are foul-tempered, burnt-out and who will never produce anything of worth themselves, because at last they have someone they can feel superior to. Intellectual women, like what I am, always have to exercise caution when praising glamour icons; you can make yourself look terribly over-heated and lecherous and lonely, like when poor Professor Paglia starts banging on about Catherine Deneuve and Cindy Crawford, and comes out of it looking like little more than the thinking dyke's Benny Hill. But, as tales from Theatreland go, I find the Catherine Zeta Jones Story - girl from nowhere dancing in West End show at 15, on the scrapheap at 25, then conquers world - far more poignant and affecting than the old, old story, now playing at the Old Vic until Kingdom Come, of how a man was born with every advantage life had to offer and frittered it all away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"education/1999/aug/14/highereducation.news","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-14T14:50:52Z","webTitle":"Students 'used email to cheat'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/1999/aug/14/highereducation.news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/1999/aug/14/highereducation.news","fields":{"headline":"Students 'used email to cheat'","bodyText":"A group of students accused of mass cheating using email face the prospect of expulsion or fines from Edinburgh university, it emerged yesterday. As a result of a disciplinary inquiry, started when tutors discovered startling similarities in the students' course work, half of the 117 first-year computer science class must re-sit an exam. The university said the students could also face suspensions. It withheld the annual grades of 97 students last month and launched what is believed to be the biggest official inquiry by an academic institution in the United Kingdom into computer cheating. Initially the university believed the students may have been using an internet site to share ideas. But by using software which detects plagiarism by analysing sentence structure, vocabulary, phrases and syntax, combined with an examination of internal emails, university chiefs found students had been transmitting copies to each other. Problems were also uncovered with the results of 26 other students. A small group of the total 117 students implicated are to be reported to the university's code of discipline. A spokeswoman said that could result, in \"extreme cases\", in expulsion, suspension or fines. \"We are not in a position to say at the moment how many students will be reported. Also we cannot pre-judge what may or may not happen in those instances as the examination process is not yet complete.\" About half of the students involved would have to re-sit the work under supervision if they wanted to continue to second year. The rest had passed. Due to the summer vacation, some of the affected students were still to be interviewed and may appeal against any decision taken by the inquiry board which could change the pass and fail ratio. The university principal, Sir Stewart Sutherland, said a review was now under way of the practical part of the computing science course to try and prevent a repeat. \"At the first indication of copying, detection software was used to uncover the extent of the problem. This was followed by an examination of student departmental email records, as an obvious means by which copies may have been transmitted, to provide further evidence,\" he said. \"Internet sources played no role in the incidents of copying.\" Discussion was acceptable among students, but the transfer of programme solutions was not."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/aug/15/drugspolicy","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-14T23:30:27Z","webTitle":"We're all going to pot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/aug/15/drugspolicy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/aug/15/drugspolicy","fields":{"headline":"We're all going to pot","bodyText":"Last night 1 million of us settled back, rolled a joint - and inhaled. The sweet aroma of cannabis wafted across the land, from the dinner parties of barristers to groups of clubbers in Soho to housewives in suburban semis. Cannabis is all around us, and no one seems concerned. More British teenagers enjoy the occasional spliff than their counterparts in the United States or in Holland, where it is virtually legal. The drug is most popular among the young - but as the hippy generation ignores middle age, cannabis is crossing the generation gap. The drug is scarcely coming out of the counter-culture, either: according to statistics it is the more affluent people who are least likely to give up as they move into their thirties. All the worry has gone out of the weed, with even police officers shrugging their shoulders at open consumption. It is difficult to walk along Shaftesbury Avenue in London's West End without picking up the scent on the street. The police superintendent in operational control of Luton, speaking personally, expresses his disappointment that the New Labour government has no plans for liberalisation: 'I know that tonight alcohol will be the cause of a fair bit of crime and a fair bit of violence and a fair bit of suffering. I don't think cannabis does that.' Beat officers stopped a young guy with a joint, according to one story, telling him 'You don't want to be smoking that', adding, after helping themselves to a puff, 'That stuff's rubbish!' Apocryphal or not, this anecdote encapsulates the new and tolerant consensus. But there is one part of the United Kingdom where cannabis remains strictly taboo: the Palace of Westminster. Only two MPs, Paul Flynn and Brian Iddon (both Labour), have publicly come out for its full legalisation under a system of state licensing and regulation. 'But there are so many who've come up privately to say we're right,' says Flynn. This bigger group made a fleeting appearance in support of Flynn's Early Day Motion backing a House of Lords committee recommendation last year that cannabis be available on prescription for medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis. In breaking with parliamentary convention and calling for a rethink of Britain's anti-drugs strategy, Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy is following in the path of his colleague Chris Davies, now an MEP but between 1995 and 1997 Liberal Democrat MP for Littleborough and Saddleworth. Like Kennedy, Davies had spoken in favour of a Royal Commission (at the 1993 party conference); as a result he drew the fire of a Labour by-election machine directed by Peter Mandelson. 'It came up every day on every piece of piece of Labour literature,' Davies recalls. The campaign was dominated by Mandelson's accusation that Davies was: 'Soft on drugs, high on taxes.' Yet Davies was elected at the by-election, and Kennedy's hunch must be that the main parties' jitters are as electorally unjustified as the former taboo on openly gay MPs. So there's now the prospect of a public debate on our new-found fondness for soft drugs. Should we see cannabis, in the words of the late 19th century Cambridge researcher Walter Ernest Dixon, as 'a useful and refreshing stimulant in the same category of tea, coffee and cola', or as a menace with the same disruptive potential as its predecessors, Dutch gin and Indian opium? It's a plant that comes with a venerable pedigree. Cannabis sativa has been in cultivation since time immemorial, chiefly for its fibrous stem, which was twisted or woven to make clothes and ropes. The Greek historian Herodotus describes how Scythians from central Asia strewed the 'seeds' (probably the fruiting tops) on hot stones in enclosed tents, and how the resulting fumes provoked these nomadic tribespeople to 'shouts of joy'. Archaeological remains from Roman Palestine reveal that it was used to relieve the pains of a young woman who died in childbirth. In India, it is especially associated with the worship of the god Shiva and it was Indian indentured labourers who took the habit to 19th century Jamaica and from there to North America. Cannabis reached Britain in the 1840s as a medicine on the recommendation of Dr William Brooke O'Shaughnessy, who also devised India's telegraph system. The Oxford Street pharmacist Peter Squire devised an alcohol-based tincture that remained available on prescription until 1971. Some members of the artistic avant garde tried the drug. When it was controlled under the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1925, public opinion was unmoved either way. It took immigration to make the issue come alive. In the US, through the 1920s and 1930s, states with Mexican populations imposed local bans. Britain joined in the 1950s, with inadvertently hilarious press exposés of the hot jazz clubs where 'coloured men' pressed reefers on white girls. But in fashionably multi-cultural Britain what once caused visceral anxieties is now a positive selling point. Meanwhile the medical and scientific debate has moved on 'from being polarised between paranoid fanatics and fervent believers', in the words of Dr Geoffrey Guy, who was licensed last year by the Home Office to grow cannabis for clinical trials. Under the Nixon administration there was an explosion of research spending looking for evidence of cellular damage caused by cannabis. The 1990s has also seen a wave of interest, but this time set off by the discovery of a class of chemical messengers in the body that act on specific receivers triggered by the active substances in cannabis. Chemical companies are using these discoveries to develop new classes of medicines. To get such a product to patients will mean a change in the law making cannabis a prescription drug. Full legalisation is probably ruled out because of international treaties on drug trafficking. But there is the option of decriminalisation, like Holland, which retains legal penalties but does not enforce them. During his trip to Europe last year the White House 'drug tsar' Barry McCaffrey denounced this as leading to a high murder rate in Holland - a claim the Dutch were easily able to refute. They also recently published statistics showing that adolescents in the Netherlands used significantly less cannabis and were only about a third as likely to become heroin addicts as their American counterparts. Voters in six American states have now backed legalisation of medical marijuana, in the teeth of White House opposition. This encourages campaigners who see little prospect of Britain going it alone in reforming drug laws. However, it is not certain that decriminalisation would reduce pot's British popularity. The reaction of one bearded young man was typical when I told him I was writing a book on hashish. 'Magic,' he said, and smiled. I was on my way back from Morocco - and he was the British customs officer. • Patrick Matthews is the author of 'Cannabis Culture' (Bloomsbury, £12.99)."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/aug/15/markhonigsbaum.tonythompson","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-14T23:30:37Z","webTitle":"Bomb plot tip-offs fuel airline safety fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/aug/15/markhonigsbaum.tonythompson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/aug/15/markhonigsbaum.tonythompson","fields":{"headline":"Bomb plot tip-offs fuel airline safety fears","bodyText":"A leading campaigner on air security has criticised the safety measures of major airlines following warnings that Islamic terrorists are planning a Lockerbie-style attack on a passenger plane. Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was among the 270 people who died in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, said the United Kingdom had acted to improve security but others had lagged behind. 'If you are flying out of the UK you are better protected than if you are flying in from anywhere else,' he said. 'There will be a lot of people in those countries sweating because they have done so little to improve security recently. We have had 11 years to put our house in order and, though it's by no means perfect yet, Britain has made significant advances. I do not have the same assurance about air security in either the US or Europe where there's been a lamentable slowness, especially in the US, in following this lead.' The warning came as the Department of Transport refused to confirm reports that, following a tip-off from US intelligence sources, it had issued secret warnings to all UK airlines that an attempt may be made to smuggle a bomb onto a plane during the next three months. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of the reports but we do not discuss security matters.' British Airways stepped up security on all flights leaving Heathrow yesterday. Checks were particularly tight on scheduled services to the United States and Middle East from Terminal Four. Although the airline refused to comment on the reports of a bomb threat, it stressed that it was now spending £100 million a year on security. 'Safety and security is our number one priority and is never compromised,' said a BA spokeswoman. The airline also dismissed newspaper reports that the US Federal Aviation Authority had expressed concern about its alleged failure to use sophisticated scanning equipment to check passenger luggage at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. BA said it was 'staggered' by the allegations, insisted that it operated its CTX5000 scanners in accordance with regulations and had received no complaint from the FAA. It is understood that the airline has stepped up the screening of luggage from Middle Eastern destinations to Britain and has brought in extra guards to protect planes before they return home. Supporters of one of the world's most wanted terrorists, Saudi Arabian exile Osama bin Laden, are thought to be behind the threats. Bin Laden, the 42-year-old son of one of Saudi Arabia's wealthiest families, has been linked to a number of Islamic extremist groups and individuals with vehement anti-American and anti-Israeli ideologies. Most recently he formed an organisation called the International Islamic Front for Jihad Against America and Israel. Bin Laden, currently in hiding in Afghanistan, was the mastermind behind the bombings at embassies in East Africa last August which left more than 250 dead and a further 5,000 wounded. Five members of his guerrilla ring, Al-Qaeda, are in custody in the US. Bin Laden is also wanted for a 1995 bomb attack that killed five American serviceman in Riyadh and for bomb plots in Asia and Europe."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/1999/aug/17/food.gm","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-17T01:18:00Z","webTitle":"Seeds of dissent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/1999/aug/17/food.gm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/1999/aug/17/food.gm","fields":{"headline":"Seeds of dissent","bodyText":"Captain Chromosome is a picaresque guy who guards his anonymity. A man of high principle and outrageous acts, he is remembered in some circles as the man who led the \"Super Heroes Against Genetix\" in the first British uprising against GM crops. The first crop pullers were Californians who destroyed a strawberry patch in 1987, but this was April 1997, Oxford. The captain and others had identified a GM potato field being tested by a research institute that had forgotten to tell people what they were growing. They walked in to the field at two in the morning and started digging. Soon, reflecting the Luddic element that accompanies most environmental protest, they were playing a bizarre game of spud cricket. Cut to Watlington, near Oxford, a few weeks ago. A rally of about 400 people from all over the country, semi-organised at short notice by a non-membership group is taking place close to a government GM trial site. The relaxed crowd is addressed by Alan Simpson MP, Guardian columnist George Monbiot, and a noted food writer. Not a word is mentioned about destroying the crop. Few people have any notion of what might happen. After speeches and a picnic, with people about to leave, the rally breaks into two groups walking round the field along footpaths and minor roads. An eye witness takes up the story: \"They had only got a short distance when individually and spontaneously they all headed straight to the test site and started trampling down the crop. It was extraordinary. There was no signal or word given.\" They were followed into the field by the police, whose big feet are believed to have damaged as much of the crop as the protesters as they ran around after the ducking and diving bodies. As ever, there were elements of farce and protests about police over-reaction. Both incidents confused the authorities. Who were these people? Why were they not on Thames Valley's bulging files of environmental activists, files that include almost 1,000 arrested at road, animal and other protests in the region in the past few years. Was Watlington really spontaneous or carefully planned by a Mr (or Mrs) Big? Was there, as the Sunday Times routinely suggests after any British protest, an \"evil genius\" behind it? Questions like these were being asked once more yesterday as the government announced the locations of four new genetically modified crop trials, effectively laying down a fresh challenge to the crop pullers. Until late last year fewer than 80 people in the United Kingdom had anything to do with crop pulling. Leaving aside the thousands involved in burning crops in Brazil, India, Australia, Germany, France and the US in the past 18 months, at least 700 people in Britain are thought to have participated. Many more are reportedly keen to get involved, even though it is now a criminal act with the penalty of prison. They are now causing problems for the government, companies and scientists. The likelihood is that many more tests will be destroyed, though maybe not in the immediate future because most of the remaining 1999 trials have been harvested. At the latest count more than 70 fields or GM trial sites (out of about 150-200, but no one knows exactly how many) have been wholly or partly destroyed - with almost 50 in the past 12 weeks. The government is now considering zoning off a great area of Britain to test them, or to test in secret. The companies and research institutes have employed guards, applied to the courts for injunctions and are in frequent talks with the cabinet office. The authorities are likely to be wrong-footed again. To understand why, you need to look at how environmental protest is changing in Britain and elsewhere. Established organisations such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and a host of smaller groups are still digging away, campaigning, doing detective work, and organising legal demonstrations and rallies, but the direct action activists today are working much more as individuals - if only because draconian rules governing assembly and trespass have been introduced. Protest has become increasingly decentralised, ad hoc, quick-witted, global and unpredictable. And it is undergoing yet another transition both in targets and tactics. Instead of the 80s-style concerns with old liberal issues such as the arms race, nuclear power, pollution, animal welfare or countryside access, or those of the early 90s such as roads, supermarkets, toxic waste - all of which are very much on the agenda - the new activists are moving towards global concerns such as world trade, developing world debt, global bodies, corporate affairs, even \"progress\" - science and capitalism itself. Were this the Philippines or Romania, commentators might argue that we were witnessing the development of a radical new social democracy movement, not so much interested in votes and party politics as broad influence, participation in decision-making and global direction. The targets are now huge and myriad - some would argue impossible - but the politics and influences are now global and are as much informed by the developing world as Europe or America. The ecological-inspired critique of democracy is now exploding and the crop pullers should be seen as part of an international movement that, thanks to email and the web, watchdog groups and increasing networking, is throwing up new issues, philosophies, ethics, and legal arguments. The new breed of activists include jurists, anoraks, policy geeks, technologists, scientists, futurists, and political analysts. It may not be a movement in the traditional political or social sense, but this opposition to the status quo is significantly widening its appeal on both intuitive and intellectual levels. Protest, whether over dams in India, GM in Europe, roads or corporations, is now an essential part of the new arguments and many people see direct action as the only option. This leaves governments and police spinning, not knowing where or when the next protest will take place, what it will be about, who organise it, what its tactics will be or who will be involved. The authorities have long wanted to categorise direct action. They want leaders, members, and the people they believe are financing it. Embarrassed by not being able to stop it, Special Branch and others are now leaking names to the media on the basis of little intelligence. Most recently, they have tried to link GM with road protests and with the Stop the City J18 \"riots\" in London. But GM, with its big issues about political influence, food safety, corporate power, speed of change, accountability, effects on the poor, ethics, future direction and scientific responsibility is the one issue of the past decade able to engage so many people on so many levels. The crop pullers in the end, reflect only the diversity of opposition the technology has met."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/1999/aug/17/tvandradio.television2","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-17T01:18:13Z","webTitle":"The African king","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/aug/17/tvandradio.television2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/1999/aug/17/tvandradio.television2","fields":{"headline":"The African king","bodyText":"Looking at King Mswati of Swaziland you see subliminal images of ducks in water and pigs in clover. I never saw a man enjoy being a king more. At his 30th birthday party, when all the guests wore decent black and morning suits, he wore a wide smile, a leopard skin and an exploding feathery hat which would have caused comment on an upended ostrich. Bare-breasted maidens danced for his delight. He usually picks one as a birthday present. He has six wives and absolute power. As Field Marshal Smuts said admiringly to Queen Mary 'You are the big potato.' How different from the home life of our own dear King Letsie of Lesotho. Now he really does look like a big potato. A sweet, overweight chap with a rich bubbling chuckle. He is the only man I've seen wax enthusiastic about Brussels sprouts. I put it all down to a public school education. Since he became king - literally catapulted onto the throne, as Prince Edward put it in a film about George VI - he has had a miserable year. Nagged about his weight. Bullied about his failure to marry. His secretary gave him meal replacements called Herbalite and his mother gave him catalogues of engagement rings. Mandela, of all people, invaded. Becoming the King (Under the Sun, BBC2) was made by a childhood friend, Dominic Ozanne. There is a plus to being a childhood chum. You are close. And there is a minus. You are too close. Dominic could be spotted helping the king to button up his jacket on Coronation day. It was a rather natty jacket with a large gold crocodile down the front. Are crocodiles common in Lesotho? It seems unlikely. It is a little mountain kingdom, once Basutoland, entirely surrounded by South Africa. The king, still in his Carlsberg T-shirt, was running late having struggled with his speech on 'Peace, reconciliation, development and democracy that sort of thing'. Prince Charles, looped with gold braid, and President Mandela, in a swirly shirt, were already waiting in the sports stadium. You do hope he didn't ask either of them for advice on choosing a wife. As for peace, reconciliation, development, democracy and that sort of thing, they would all go up in smoke together with the centre of his capital. There were accusations of vote rigging, riots, and then the government called in South Africa, with bloody results. What Ozanne clearly had in mind was a jolly little film about finding a wife, or as the king put it in his rather stately diction, the search for a spouse. There was an illuminating, if excruciating, party at his concrete palace. After a desultory hunt for peanut butter and crisps, he sank into an armchair and never stirred again. The girls clung to the wall as if by centrifugal force. He attempted some sort of bluff badinage 'Why are you lining up like a beauty parade?' and elderly chit-chat. 'Are there jazz clubs here in town?' He may be shy and is said to favour a university student who is even shyer. You rather lost heart. Constitutionally, he has no power, so throughout the war he did nothing in particular but, in fact, did it rather well. 'I'm not leaving the country. If they chuck me out, I'll pack my bags and go home to my village. After all they will have to give me legal reasons for sending me into exile. It happened twice to my father and I won't let it happen to me.' I wouldn't describe him as an irresistible force but he looks an immovable object. The population of Lesotho is two million. If it were a TV programme, it would be dropped. Tested to Destruction (ITV) presented by Carol Vorderman got about five million and has slid down the snake of the schedule from 9pm to 7pm. It is well intentioned but earsplitting. Even the infinitives are split. Cars crash, cylinders explode, nuclear flasks are given a terrible drubbing. It should be comforting to hear a F4 Phantom jet crash into a nuclear power station and atomise. Not as comforting as the softly blowing brass that introduces Coronation Street at 7.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/aug/17/healthandwellbeing.health5","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-17T15:23:46Z","webTitle":"The other troubles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/aug/17/healthandwellbeing.health5","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/aug/17/healthandwellbeing.health5","fields":{"headline":"The other troubles","bodyText":"It started with picketing. A group of women would gather outside the home of a counsellor from the local pregnancy advisory service. There they would hand out leaflets and shout out that the woman inside the house was a murderer. Many of the women picketed in this way were in their sixties and seventies; all were petrified. The demonstrators waved placards bearing images of aborted foetuses and the addresses of the women they accused of being killers. On July 13, the advisory service's tiny office was attacked by arsonists who caused thousands of pounds worth of damage. Two weeks ago, the office closed down - staff were too scared to continue with their work. Such scenes of harassment are commonplace in America's Bible Belt. But this was Northern Ireland. Despite living in the United Kingdom, women in Northern Ireland in 1999 are only allowed a termination under extremely limited circumstances. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK not covered by the 1967 Abortion Act. The province was excluded from the act because resistance would have hindered or even prevented the passing of the act. Today, abortion is such an emotive issue that it unites fundamentalists on both sides of the religious divide. The picketers were members of an organisation called Precious Life and they succeeded in closing down the 20-year-old Ulster Pregnancy Advisory Association (UPAA), one of the only two abortion referral agencies in the country, although there is no evi dence that the group was linked to the arson attack. As part of their campaign, Precious Life still carry out weekly pickets of Family Planning Association clinics and the Belfast offices of the Brook Advisory Service. The UPAA was staffed mostly by volunteers, the majority of them older women. A head office operated from Belfast and seven counsellors worked across the country from their own homes, providing advice and referrals to pregnant women. These counsellors were some of the very few prepared to offer information on the possibilities open to someone with an unwanted pregnancy. Now, UPAA's director Joan Wilson is said to be so traumatised that she cannot speak about the affair. The closure has shaken many in the country and has been condemned as a violation of both human rights and freedom of information. At a time of heightened political unrest in the province, Mo Mowlam, secretary of state for Northern Ireland, still took time yesterday to visit the Brook Advisory Centre in Belfast along with members of the voluntary sector in what was described as a \"show of solidarity against the intimidatory tactics of Precious Life\". Whatever the criticism and condemnation, Precious Life shrugs it off as pro-abortionist propaganda. Bernadette Smyth, chair of the organisation, has heralded the closure of the UPAA as a victory for Precious Life and has vowed that the offensive will escalate. In September, guest speakers from America will be invited to a conference hosted by Precious Life, and it is to these more experienced anti-abortionists that the group looks for inspiration. \"We will be recruiting more people and we predict a massive expansion of our group,\" says Smyth. Precious Life began its present campaign a year ago by gathering information on the UPAA's counsellors, building up a profile of each of the women and making it very difficult for them to continue their work. \"We started off in Portstewart, where 10 of our members were arrested. All the charges have been dropped now,\" says Smyth, who explains that her group leaflet the neighbourhood of people they believe are involved in the \"abortion industry\", telling people that the home is being used an abortion referral service. \"These women are making £55 per referral,\" says Smyth. \"So we stand outside their house with picket boards.\" Precious Life was founded in 1996 in response to the \"threat of legalised abortion in Northern Ireland\". Smyth claims that she has between 4,000 and 5,000 people on her mailing list, but there are usually only about 30 active members on the pickets. The group's main target is now the Brook clinic, which refutes Smyth's claims that it is an abortion referral service. Dismissing allegations of harassment and intimidation, Smyth says she is only exercising her legal right to protest. She adds: \"We see for ourselves the damage that is being done by these organisations. We are not there to intimidate, we are there to give the full facts on abortion. I can't understand why these people feel intimidated. Our protests are against the services they are offering.\" While recent surveys have shown that 79% of the public in Northern Ireland believe the entitlement to abortion should be the same as on the mainland, the majority of Northern Ireland's MPs there are anti-choice. While abortion is technically legal, there is widespread confusion about who has the right to one. The Northern Ireland department of health statistics for 1996-97 show that there were 85 \"medical\" abortions, eight \"other\" and 77 \"unspecified\" abortions recorded, while around 1,800 women travelled to mainland Britain for a termination. This means that about 40 women a week whose mainland counterparts receive terminations on the NHS are forced to travel to England for abortions in private clinics in London, Manchester and Liverpool. Usually, they travel alone. The cost - anything up to £450 - can be so prohibitive that it often delays the decision-making process and means that the proportion of women seeking termination after 12 weeks is almost double that on the mainland. All of this increases the incidence of backstreet and self-induced abortion. In 1981, one woman, Charlotte Hutton died after trying to give herself an abortion. In 1993, a British government committee, investigating the abortion issue in Northern Ireland, concluded that: \"The law is so unclear it violates the common standards of international human rights.\" The committee made three recommendations: that statistics should be kept on spontaneous and induced abortions; that options should be brought forward for a clearer law; and that the issue of a woman's ability to pay for an abortion should be removed from the debate. But there has been no change. Doctors in the province remain unsure about the circumstances under which abortion is legal and very few will perform the procedure. Many would prefer to be able to. In June, a survey by Marie Stopes International found that 80% of GPs believed there should be clarification of the abortion issue. It also found that 22% of all doctors in Northern Ireland believed that abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, while 45.5% considered themselves pro-choice. And yesterday, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said it would lend its support in an attempt to halt the campaigns of intimidation and harassment. At the Brook Advisory Centre, manager Mary Crawford is furious: \"For the past 18 months, staff, volunteers and users of Brook have been the victims of a sustained campaign of threats and intimidation. Letters have been sent to my neighbours trying to discredit me personally. \"We have been portrayed as an abortion referral service, which we are not and never have been - we provide advice and counselling on positive sexual health for young people, just like any family planning clinic or GP.

Charles Kennedy, the Lib Dem leader, made clear he intends to maintain distance between his party and the government over genetic modification by demanding a more cautious approach to testing. Publishing a paper to be debated at his party's annual conference in Harrogate next month, Mr Kennedy reaffirmed its commitment to a five-year moratorium on grow ing GM crops for commercial use. He warned of growing public fears over the trials, and called for more information to allow consumers to make informed judgments about GM foods. \"The government must realise that public concern on this issue is enormous. By ignoring these concerns they risk alienating a large section of society and causing long-term environmental damage.\" However, he stopped short of condoning the recent Greenpeace action in destroying GM trial crops, instead arguing that ministers had failed to ensure controls on crop trials were adequate to prevent damage to the environment or neighbouring farms. The paper recommends extending the segregation zones around GM crops to lessen the risk of cross-pollination. It also urges labelling requirements on GM products be strengthened, and a legal liability without time limit be imposed on producers in respect of any adverse health or environmental effects. Cabinet \"enforcer\" Jack Cunningham responded to Mr Kennedy by saying that Britain's regulations and tests were the most rigorous in the world, while Friends of the Earth described the Liberal Democrat stand as encouraging. • Jersey, home of Britain's most popular new potato, has abandoned a £600,000 GM programme because its farmers fear it will undermine sales of the island's most important agricultural export, writes John Vidal. The decision to suspend GM research being done in England to engineer Jersey Royals to resist the eelworm has been made by the island's agricultural committee after discussions with some of the biggest potato farmers. Jersey grows nearly 45,000 tons of Royals a year, most of which are sold to mainland Britain. In a separate development, Marks and Spencer yesterday announced that it had begun to remove GM ingredients from animal feeds to ensure that its chicken, meat and eggs were fed on a GM-free diet. Other supermarket chains are expected to follow. The Jersey decision is significant because it is the first by a semi-autonomous region of the United Kingdom effectively to outlaw GM not for scientific reasons, but to maintain an image of high quality produce. The Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament are also under pressure to declare GM-free zones."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/aug/22/observerbusiness.theobserver2","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-21T23:34:04Z","webTitle":"Disney seeks happy ending","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/aug/22/observerbusiness.theobserver2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/aug/22/observerbusiness.theobserver2","fields":{"headline":"Disney seeks happy ending","bodyText":"These are dark days for Michael Eisner, the autocratic chief executive of Disney, as he tries to rescue the sagging fortunes of the house of mouse and deal with the fall-out from his feud with his former lieutenant, Jeffrey Katzenberg. Over the past few weeks, a newly accessible Eisner has emerged. He's been wooing Wall Street with unusual eagerness, and conceding that his squabble with Katzenberg, whom he once called 'that little midget', should never have reached the courts. He has even floated the idea of hiring a tough deputy, a post unoccupied since Mike Ovitz's disastrous tenure in 1996. In an interview last week, Eisner appeared to be wishing for a classic happy ending. 'Maybe this is like a Disney fairy tale,' he told the New York Times. 'All's well that ends well. The truth will win out.' But a happy ending will take more than clever screenwriting and glossy public relations. Eisner, once unassailable as the prince of Hollywood who built up Disney into a powerhouse with annual revenues of $23 billion, is fighting to save his 15-year Disney career. To some analysts it seems he may have little time before shareholders such as billionaire Texas industrialist Sid Bass and Warren Buffett, whose philosophy of decentralised management Eisner is being encouraged to put in place, call for his head. Others suggest his job is safe for now. 'He's not weaker, but he's under tremendous pressure from Wall Street and from Disney's board of directors to get the company back on the growth track,' says Barry Hyman at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum in New York. 'Disney's stock may be lagging now but when you look at performance over the years, shareholders have done extremely well.' But the Magic Kingdom is showing signs of decay. After 13 years of growth, earnings fell last year and are expected to slip more this year. Disney's share price has slumped by about a third from its 1998 high to just $28.50. The giant entertainment company's ABC television network is floundering, a huge investment programme, in everything from two $400 million cruise ships to new theme park rides, has yet to pay off. To make matters worse, Eisner has lost two tiers of top management and continues to reign without an heir apparent. The problems are systemic. It is now too large a company to be run from the top down, and its centralised, closed corporate culture seems at odds with the agility a modern media conglomerate demands. 'The company is very Michael-centric,' says one former executive. 'Everybody worries about what Michael will think. They are always looking over their shoulders.' And there are mounting problems in almost every part of Disney. In the film division, competition from DreamWorks and Universal has pushed up the price of producing cartoon films so that even hits such as Tarzan, which pulled in $160m at the US box office, are insufficient to make an impact on the bottom line. Observers say declining sales of videos and merchandise show it has lost its brand cachet, falling victim to 'age compression' - children switching earlier to adult entertainment. Eisner, 57, denies that he has lost touch, saying criticisms of him and the company today 'are as short-sighted as was the praise of me and Disney in the high economic times'. He has a point. Disney's net profits of $1.55bn in 1998 still exceeded those of Time-Warner, News Corp and Viacom combined. But that still won't cheer investors who have watched as operating profits and net income declined by 17 per cent and 27 per cent respectively in the first nine months of this year. 'We are the most profitable media company in the world,' Eisner complained last week. 'We're being buried a bit prematurely.' Over the last two months, a strategy has been adopted for putting Disney back into shape by streamlining operations, selling off non-strategic assets to reduce an estimated $11 billion in debt, cut spending on new projects and concentrate on overseas growth. 'What we are doing is increasing our focus on cash flow, return on investment and value creation,' says Thomas Staggs, Disney's new chief financial officer, who has been told to conduct a major review of capital spending. Last week, it emerged that Disney has sold the magazine publisher Fairchild to Condé Nast for $650m. Rumours abound that it has also put its Anaheim Mighty Ducks hockey team and the Anaheim Angels baseball team up for sale. Other assets that can't demonstrate a healthy return may follow. At ABC, now third ranked among the big US broadcasters, costs have been slashed and production placed under the same management as the Disney film division. Last month, Disney agreed to combine its Internet assets like the Go portal and ABCnews.com with the search engine Infoseek which it is in the process of buying outright. Recognising that its best opportunity for growth lies overseas, Disney International president Robert Iger has been put in charge of reorganising the haphazard overseas operations to better integrate Disney's businesses. It is, for example, considering using the company's tie-ups to US retail outlets to promote films, videos, along with its merchandise. The plan is 'to pick low-hanging fruit,' says Eisner. If he can keep his current team in place, rein in extravagance and resist the temptation to tinker, he will survive. But if he cannot adapt to a changing world where speed counts and partnerships are vital, many fear the big mouse will fall. One leading ex-Disney executive says: 'The company has changed and the world has changed, but Michael hasn't. Now he must.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/1999/aug/22/life1.lifemagazine2","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-21T23:34:11Z","webTitle":"China crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/aug/22/life1.lifemagazine2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/1999/aug/22/life1.lifemagazine2","fields":{"headline":"China crisis","bodyText":"'Holy shit!' was the initial - but unofficial - reaction of US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson when he saw the contents of Wen Ho Lee's computer drive last March. But by then, it was five years too late. Wen Ho Lee used to stay late in the laboratory, except on evenings he taught calligraphy to children at the Chinese Cultural Association. The wise, ancient scripts of his people that Chinese-American parents working at the nuclear 'forbidden city' of Los Alamos wanted their children to learn. But most nights, Wen worked late, dragging-and-clicking data to which only he and an elite few had access. The material was classified with good reason. It contained the innermost secrets of how the most advanced missile systems in the West's nuclear defences work. It was a road map through the nuclear arsenal, carefully laid out for anyone who wanted to replicate it. Wen Ho Lee worked in secret, downloading this Pandora's box of atomic secrets on to his own personal file. 'Holy shit' indeed - for by the time Secretary Richardson was also allowed access to Wen's disk, the distillation of half a century of research on how to perfect nuclear weapons - the keys to the defence of the free world, and to its unlocking - was in the hands of Chinese intelligence, though the FBI admits it doesn't have enough evidence to charge Lee with leaking the information. There were some in America who refused to believe that this had happened. Who insisted that the unveiling of a spy network haemorrhaging US nuclear secrets was a harking back to the Cold War, that - even if it were true - China would be decades away from being able to make good its stolen knowledge. Until last month, when the Beijing regime itself told the world that it now had the capability to carbon-copy and deploy the West's most advanced nuclear secrets. The Los Alamos laboratories, sprawled across a 7,400ft-high plateau in the high desert of New Mexico, are the cradle of the atomic age. The first nuclear bomb was built here by some of the greatest minds of our century: Julius Robert Oppenheimer, who later recanted, and drew on the words of the Bhagavad-Gita to say: 'I am Oppenheimer, shatterer of worlds.' And the brilliant Klaus Fuchs, who drove a car to a bridge near Santa Fe one hot afternoon in the summer of 1947, and handed the secrets of the bomb's design to Harry Gold, his 'runner' from the KGB, thereby launching the arms race. Fuchs, a genius, communist and Quaker from Kiel, in what became East Germany, confessed many years later in London, unable to live this double life among his friends and colleagues any longer. The arms race was the nuclear essence of the Cold War. And at the Cold War's end, that race was declared over, and effectively won by democracy, the free market and the sole surviving superpower, the United States. But at Los Alamos, not everything had changed. Los Alamos had remained a forbidden city until 1957, closed to the public and guarded by sentry boxes on the only road in - a mirror of the USSR's secret atomic cities. But as the Cold War thawed, visiting scientists from Russia and China began to arrive, alongside those from allied countries. As nuclear engineer Bill Partain says: 'The security is always tight as regards someone trying to sneak in, but once you get in, they'll give you classes on nuclear weapons design.' However, there remained, and remains, an inner sanctum at Los Alamos, a core of research that is as sensitive and as secret as any in the 1940s. In 1984, a scientist called Peter Lee (no relation) arrived at Los Alamos. He had been born in China in 1939, but his father, an ardent anti-communist, moved to Taiwan and then the US; Lee became an American citizen. From 1976 to 1984, he worked at Los Alamos's partner laboratory, Lawrence Livermore, in California. Lee's work concerned the creation of miniature nuclear fission explosions. These secret scale-models of nuclear explosions are ideal for a country which had signed the nuclear test ban treaty, but also wished to modernise its nuclear arsenal undetected by prying international eyes - like those of Lee's native land, China. One year after joining the lab, Lee went to China as 'translator' for a scientific delegation. But on the evening of 9 January, he had an appointment in a hotel room with a nuclear physicist who asked him to help 'a poor country'. There was an exchange of diagrams. Next morning, Lee was picked up and taken to another meeting, where he answered questions for two hours, drew diagrams and provided 'specific mathematical and experimental results' on laser fusion. An agent called Jon Shapiro with the Los Angeles FBI suspected Lee of being a spy. He initiated a surveillance and was anxious to make an arrest, but hit two obstacles. First, the US Navy said that some of the other projects Lee was working on were so sensitive they could not become the basis of a courtroom prosecution. Moreover, for reasons that baffled the FBI, the Justice Department in Washington would not approve a prosecution, either. But finally, in 1997, Lee was called in by the FBI and charged with one count of 'gathering, transmitting or losing defence information' on the micro-explosion research. Lee pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 12 months in a halfway house and ordered to pay $20,000. But the trial hid the chilling truth about the extent of his treachery and the damage it had done. During six 'adversarial' interviews, Lee confessed he had stolen another project, with more serious consequences. This information, if successfully developed by China, would expose the stealth of the entire submarine fleet - previously invulnerable - of the Western alliance, and especially the United Kingdom. After leaving Los Alamos in 1991, Lee had gone to the TRW Corporation of Los Angeles, working on a contract at Livermore. By now, his area of expertise was anti-submarine warfare, on a joint British-American project which enabled space radars to expose submerged submarines from commercial satellites and airplanes. On 11 May 1997, Lee was in Beijing again. He told TRW that the visit was 'for sightseeing and pleasure', but during the three-week trip, paid for by the Chinese government, he was billed to address an invited audience at the Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics. Lee's lecture was to cover laser fusion and micro-explosions - but he told his hosts in advance that he had found a more interesting subject, which he would only discuss when he arrived in China. The Institute was an umbrella under which nuclear-weapons scientists worked, but only recently did the Americans learn that it and another host, the Academy of Engineering Physics, answered directly to the Chinese government's Defense Commission, which manages nuclear test sites. During his lecture, Lee described for the People's Liberation Army the latest physics anti-submarine warfare, of microwave scattering from ocean waves, as developed at Los Alamos by his British and American colleagues. At one point during his presentation, Lee produced an image of the wake of a surface ship which he had brought with him from Livermore. The US authorities decided not to prosecute Lee on this charge, on instructions from the Pentagon. The material was so sensitive, said the Defense Department, that it did still not want to risk it becoming the subject of a courtroom prosecution. Colonel Liu Chaoying epitomises the new, trade-driven family business with which America is now so eager to engage. As a high-flying woman in the People's Liberation Army, Liu is the daughter of the Politburo member responsible for technological research, General Liu Huaqing. She is herself vice-president of the Hong Kong subsidiary of the China Aerospace Corporation, which manages the country's missile and space industries. In a dingy restaurant in Hong Kong in early 1996, three people sat down to dinner with an ambitious agenda. The first was Colonel Liu. The second was her boss, General Ji Shengde: head of Chinese military intelligence. Their guest was a Chinese-American businessman, Johnny Chung. The business of the night was to do whatever was necessary to win the Presidency for Bill Clinton, towards which end General Ji and Colonel Liu promised Chung $300,000 to spend in donations. This money was small change, however. While looking into the Chung affair, federal investigators stumbled on tens of millions of dollar, which Colonel Liu was funnelling into an otherwise obscure Californian bank. The case was quickly handed over to counter-intelligence and the FBI. The bureau found that over six years, $92 million appeared in the accounts of a shell company owned by a Nan Nan Xu, daughter of a hardline Communist Party leader and former minister. Ms Xu was a senior partner with the Chinese Central Bank, although she had no financial experience. She was then dispatched to the US as managing director of the Far East National Bank in Los Angeles, with which her shell companies banked. Traced by the New York Times last month, Ms Xu refused to say where the $92 million came from, and what its purpose was. But Ms Xu has a family connection to Chinese military intelligence: Colonel Liu is her sister-in-law. The two have travelled together from California to China, and Colonel Liu once used Ms Xu's identity as an alias. Between 1992 and 1995, the US intelligence had been poring over data from a series of test explosions in China, most of which post-dated the test-ban treaty of 1993. The apparent purpose of these tests was to modernise the Chinese arsenal beyond a dependency on 'multi-megaton' missiles, each carrying a single warhead. Now something different was happening. The Chinese were developing a new bomb with multiple, lighter warheads to be fitted to a single missile which could then be programmed to hit various targets - an increased 'yield- to-weight ratio', as they say. There could be little doubt about where they were getting the idea. The US security services were looking into a mirror and seeing a reflection of their most deeply held nuclear secrets. In 1995, at a CIA station somewhere outside China, a 'walk-in' arrived to dispel any last - hopeful - doubts. The 'walk-in' provided a Chinese classified document that looked horribly familiar. There, surrounded by Chinese characters and diagrams of other thermonuclear warheads, was the design for the new Chinese DF-31 and DF-41 generations of missiles. It was identical to the US W-88 missile system, better known as the Trident D-5 - the most sophisticated strategic weapon in the Western defensive arsenal, with its multiple, individually targettable warheads. A year later, the CIA determined that the 'walk-in' was working for Chinese intelligence, and that for some reason the US was intended to know how far China had come along the road towards a new Cold War. Officials are baffled as to why: A mistake? A Chinese puzzle? A 'cat and mouse' game? Houston Hawkins, a former nuclear weapons expert at the Defense Intelligence Agency, quoted from the fifth-century Chinese text The Art Of War, by military philosopher Sun Tzu - the philosophical text on which the practice of modern Chinese intelligence is still based. Tzu's complex, Zen-like doctrine of 'mosaic' intelligence and disinformation posits the possibility that the Chinese wanted the US to know what it had. The document was passed to the most experienced intelligence officer at the Department of Energy, Notra Trulock. Trulock concluded the worst, narrowed his list of interviewees at Los Alamos down to five suspects, and took his findings to the FBI. One man, he said, 'stuck out like a sore thumb'. Wen Ho Lee was born in 1939 in Taiwan, and after securing an engineering degree, joined the flow of emigrants to the US, graduating from A&amp;M University in Texas - 'A good, hard worker,' recalls his professor. In 1978, he arrived at Los Alamos from the US government's main civil nuclear laboratory to work in the Applied Theoretical Physics Division. His expertise dovetailed into the design of trigger mechanisms for neutron bombs. He moved with his family to the quiet dormitory suburb of White Rock, where neighbour Jean Marshall remembers him being 'the sort of person who, when he's painting the house, says: \"Would you like me to paint yours?\"' Wen Ho first attracted the interest of the authorities in 1982; the FBI intercepted a telephone call to another scientist suspected of passing secret designs for the neutron bomb to China. Wen Ho visited China to give lectures about his work between 1984 and 1988, on how high explosives can be used to compress a sphere of plutonium and produce the 'primary', or first stage of hydrogen bomb explosion, which then creates atomic fusion and unleashes the main explosion. His first contact was in a letter to the Institute of Applied Physics and Computational Mathematics in Beijing - answerable to the Military Commission - in 1984. In 1986, Wen Ho went to China to deliver a paper to the Institute on Detonation Velocity. His wife Sylvia, who worked at Los Alamos in an administrative position, was also invited to address the conference, even though she was not a scientist. Two years later, Wen Ho returned for a second series of lectures. Ironically, he was so eager to meet the Institute's leaders that his request was declined, on the grounds that he was probably a US spy. He also visited Hong Kong in 1988 and, according to investigators, may have handed over the first details on the W-88 warhead. Wen Ho crossed the FBI's tracks again, with a strange twist. He and Sylvia approached the bureau's office in Albuquerque, volunteering to inform on visiting Chinese nationals. The FBI thanked them for the offer, elected not to offer Sylvia any assignments, and Mr and Mrs Lee were dropped from the rolls in 1991. Now the FBI and Trulock wanted to have another look at Wen Ho's computer. The bureau petitioned the Department of Energy three times for a warrant, and were three times turned down. There were further frustrations with the managers of the laboratory, which had been contracted out to the University of California. The scientists had adapted happily to the thaw that followed the Cold War, and disliked this taste of the old days. But Wen Ho was made to take a lie-detector test, which he passed (since the scandal, he has failed two subsequent tests). Only later did the FBI discover that, 48 hours after doing so, he desperately tried to delete the evidence of what he had downloaded from the classified disk drives. Notra Trulock was blocked at every turn by his own superiors. He sought an appointment with Energy Secretary Federico Pena, but was kept waiting four months. In April 1996, Trulock demanded to be heard at the White House. He told President Clinton's Deputy National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, that the primary explosive charges in the new Chinese bomb were based on the US W-70 neutron bomb, the details of which had been stolen during the past 20 years. He said he believed the secondary thermonuclear explosion in the new Chinese bomb to have been based on the W-88 multiple-entry warhead. The meeting adjourned. The FBI issued a classified report recommending an urgent review of computer banks at Los Alamos. Trulock traced work from other laboratories in the latest Chinese designs. By June, the bureau was ready to open a criminal investigation code-named 'Kindred Spirit'. But nothing happened. Trulock had a second meeting with Berger in July, offering evidence that Chinese spying was current and dangerous in a number of other laboratories. Berger assigned the case to an aide, Gary Samore, who asked the CIA to come up with a case other than Trulock's. The agency did not reject Trulock's theories, but called them a 'worst-case scenario'. President Clinton was finally informed of the espionage scare in July 1997, according to Berger - although in a contradictory account years later, Berger changes the date to February 1998 (Vice-President Gore says he knew nothing until last March). After the February 1998 meeting with Clinton, the President ordered a tightening of security at nuclear weapons labs - even though Trulock's immediate boss at Energy, Elizabeth Moler, was against it. Moler became acting Secretary of State after Pena's departure, and told Trulock to his face that she did not wish to pursue the espionage matter because of ramifications for trade with China. In May 1998, Trulock was demoted by Moler from his office. Meanwhile, Wen Ho continued to enjoy the highest security clearance, and in early 1998 was transferred to an even more sensitive job at Los Alamos, where he was responsible for updating the blueprints - or 'legacy codes' - for five American warheads. Closer bonds with China was a centrepiece of foreign policy under President Clinton. He had envisaged forging a 'strategic partnership' with China which would embrace commercial, ideological, technological and even military cooperation. Flying in the face of objections from the human rights community on the one hand, and national security concerns on the other, the President's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright coined a diabolically brilliant mantra of realpolitik: 'I would not let any single issue, such as trade or human rights, get in the way of our policy towards China.' In August 1998, Bill Richardson took over at the Department of Energy. He began to receive progressively impatient requests for information from the Cox Committee - chaired by Congressman Christopher Cox - looking into technology exports to China. Then, on 15 October, proceedings took an interesting turn. The committee was questioning Donald Rumsfeld, a former Defense Secretary, and asked how China had modernised its nuclear weapons programme. Rumsfeld replied that the answer was too secret to offer. 'The committee,' says one member, Proter Goss of Florida, 'went through a door into a room, and there was more in that room than we thought there would be.' While the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke over Capitol Hill last winter, the Cox Committee completed its work. On 16 December, it took its last evidence from the star witness, Notra Trulock. On 19 December, the House impeached the President. The report was finished on 30 December; on 1 February, Cox met the President to tell him what he had uncovered. But it was not until March this year that Trulock and the FBI were able to examine the millions of lines in Wen Ho's computer. Even the pessimistic Trulock was appalled by what he found. There were the designs for, effectively, the entire US military system: the neutron bomb. The Trident D-5. Another Trident, the C-4, also from Los Alamos. The Peacekeeper, or MX, system of missiles launched from solos that are mobile to avoid detection, this time from the Livermore laboratory in California. And three entire generations of Minuteman missiles from both laboratories. Most damaging of all, however, were the so-called 'legacy codes'. These were computer codes that distilled 50 years of nuclear research - essential to understanding the workings of nuclear weapons, to enabling their further design, maintenance and adaptation. 'They are codes,' said the dumbstruck director of Los Alamos, John Brown, 'that integrate our best understanding of the processes that go on in a nuclear weapon.' The conclusion was unavoidable: with access to the legacy codes, the next generations of Chinese nuclear weapons would be transoceanic, deadly and mobile. When the scandal broke into the public domain - in the New York Times on 6 March - President Clinton, Vice-President Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reacted swiftly. That is to say, they were quick to insist that the episode would not interfere with 'constructive' relations between the US and China. The thaw in the relationship between the United States and China began under the Cold Warrior himself: the Reagan administration first allowed US satellites to be launched aboard Chinese rockets. Since then, this deployment of satellites has been both lucrative and controversial. In 1996, President Clinton transferred the responsibility for export licensing from the security-minded State Department to the Commerce Department, whose interests were to sell. A study earlier this year by the Wisconsin Project for Nuclear Arms Control calculates that the Commerce Department has licensed more than $15 billion-worth of strategically sensitive exports to China over the past decade. 'Even after stealing the plan for an advanced warhead,' says project director Gary Milhollin, 'one would need high-performance equipment to manufacture and test its precision parts. Sadly, China is getting all those machines from the United States, and doesn't have to steal them.' On 6 April this year, Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji arrived in America for a surreally timed tour aimed at forging the second half of the Great Thaw of China, entry into the World Trade Organisation. Sandwiched in between the detonation of the spy scandal and the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen Square, with the Belgrade embassy bombing just around the corner - it wasn't a blessed historical setting. Zhu did everything he was expected to do: skimmed over human rights and made trade concessions, while insisting that the future prosperity of the United States depended on exporting to China - although, in reality, the US exports less to China than it does to Belgium. And Clinton broadly agreed. When asked about the fact that his guest was stealing America's nuclear secrets, the President echoed Zhu's own reply about Tiananmen Square: 'You know,' said Clinton in his cracker-barrel, down-home thoughtful voice, 'China is a big country with a big government. Occasionally, things happen even in this government that I don't know about.' Then came the legally careful Clintonesque line about not being told about spying activities during his term of office. So everyone is off the hook. Sandy Berger worked behind the scenes to convince the cabinet and the President that allowing China into the WTO was the only way to secure peaceful reform in China, quite apart from the business opportunities. But the timing was not good, and there was no deal. Clinton was optimistic, though, promising that the talks would continue within a month, that China would probably be accepted into the fold by the end of the year, and implying that neither human rights nor spying would be allowed to intrude. 'If China is willing to play by the global rules of trade,' he said, 'it would be an inexplicable mistake by the US to say no.' Zhu was furious nonetheless. He said the US had no right to worry about its trade deficit with China. 'If the US decides that everything has a military application,' he complained, 'and if you can't sell us satellites and computers, and if wheat and fruit are the only products you want to sell us, how can you reduce the deficit?' And, he joked, if he had wanted to influence American politics, 'I would have spent $10 million, not $300,000.' The Cox report was published - or at least that part of it which did not concern the secret projects with which China's spies were very familiar indeed. Last month, Congress unanimously approved every singe security measure it recommended: including greater vigilance over exports and employees at the core of nuclear facilities. Richardson independently announced the appointment of a new 'security czar' to oversee the Department of Energy, and a new Office of Security and Emergency Operations. There were calls for the resignation of Attorney General Janet Reno and Sandy Berger, but to no effect. Wen Ho Lee, fired on 10 March, went into hiding and pleaded, through his Los Angeles lawyer, that he was 'a loyal United States citizen' who had never spied for a foreign power. And as Chinese government-mobilised crowds besieged the US embassy in Beijing, protesting at the Nato bombing of its Belgrade embassy, while the news-papers called the US 'the international arch enemy', there were appeals from the President that the atmosphere not degenerate into a new Cold War. Watching it all from the offices of the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in Washington DC, the sage of Chinese affairs, Robert Kagan, mused: 'The administration believes that if we don't treat China as an enemy, it won't become one. Those who recommend a tougher approach, who call for a containment of China's ambitions, are usually accused of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. But what if the prophecy has already been fulfilled?' In July, Beijing stepped up the war of nerves, confirming almost every word of the Cox report, if not the prophecy. The regime coolly announced that it had all the technical information it needed to develop the neutron bomb and multiple warheads of the W-88 variety. With the traditional mental acrobatics of a Chinese riddle, the Beijing announcement on its own nuclear prowess came as part of a contorted denial of the charges made in the Cox Report. The intended audience was obvious: Taiwan and the US. It came just as the Taiwanese government dropped its adherence to the longstanding principle that it and the Chinese mainland are separately governed parts of the same country. Beijing's retort was an articulate 'Watch out, we've got the nukes.' The response of the Clinton administration's spokesman James Rubin was: 'I don't think it's any secret to the people of the world that China has a very small nuclear capability.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/aug/22/theobserver.uknews2","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-21T23:34:19Z","webTitle":"Killer worms invade Scotland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/aug/22/theobserver.uknews2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/aug/22/theobserver.uknews2","fields":{"headline":"Killer worms invade Scotland","bodyText":"They came from New Zealand. And they are here to kill. In the soil of your garden may lurk the deadly New Zealand flatworm - deadly to native earthworms, that is. While the home-grown worm eats only earth, the flatworm eats earthworms. It kills by night, hiding in moist places during the day. For some years it has been restricted to well-watered gardens, but now it is spreading to arable land, and nobody knows what the long-term effect may be. 'They eat earthworms. They swallow them and then melt the worm in their digestive juices - it's a horrible mess,' says George Bakey of the Agricultural College in Orkney. For reasons unclear, the antipodean predator has managed to flourish in Scotland more than any other part of the United Kingdom, and has now got as far as Orkney. 'They turn up on my desk. I've seen enough of it,' says a worm-weary John Crossley, of the Farming Wildlife Advisory Group in Orkney. The worms come into the UK in the soil attached to potted plants. 'I blame the New Zealand Flax. It's a flowering perennial,' says Crossley. 'We know we have a problem, but we are not aware of the solution,' says Piers Blackster in the Islands development office. But the real fear is that arable farmland is now affected. The smooth skinned worms, which grow up to 15cm long, have broken out of their preferred habitat of well-watered gardens and are now in the fields of Ayrshire. 'We don't know what may happen,' says Dr Andy Evans of the Scottish Agricultural College in Edinburgh. The college is charged with monitoring the worms' progress. The heavy rainfall of the west of Scotland replicates ground conditions of well-watered gardens, and so the worm has a wider habitat. Evans worries that there have been no long-term studies on the effect of the worm. 'There's been a report on the foodchain implications. Other animals and birds live off worms. But we don't know what would happen if the worms became widespread.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/aug/23/paulbrown","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-23T01:48:15Z","webTitle":"From nuclear dream to rubbish tip","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/aug/23/paulbrown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/aug/23/paulbrown","fields":{"headline":"From nuclear dream to rubbish tip","bodyText":"When Margaret Thatcher sanctioned the building of the Sizewell B pressurised water reactor in Suffolk in the 1980s, she turned her back on 50 years of nuclear research and development into British reactor designs. It began with a race to keep Britain in the superpower league by making the UK the third nuclear weapons state after the US and Russia. Originally reactors were designed only to make material for nuclear weapons - then scientists dreamed of electricity \"too cheap to meter\". Because of the obvious dangers, the most remote parts of the country were chosen for a series of experiments. When the most elaborate of them, Scotland's prototype fast breeder reactor at Dounreay, in Caithness, also proved to be the most expensive, Mrs Thatcher pulled the plug on that too. The equivalent of £50bn in today's money had been poured into a technology which had failed to deliver. The reactors were closed and Thatcherite economics took over. The successful commercial spin-offs were privatised as Amersham International and then AEA Technology. The detritus was left to the taxpayer to clear up. The estimate of the bill for cleaning up the four main United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) sites, Harwell in Oxfordshire, Dounreay, Winfrith in Dorset and Sellafield in Cumbria, is £7.1bn. It will take 50 years to dismantle the dream - the same time as it took to build it - and 250,000 years before the radioactivity they created decays away. Paul Brown has visited all four UKAEA sites and looks at their history, the complexity of demolishing such dangerous structures, and the state of the clean-up programme. The first is Harwell, where it all began. • Clement Attlee was given a choice in 1947 - use the scarce amount of available steel to repair the bomb-damaged Houses of Parliament, or to build the first nuclear reactor at Harwell so Britain could join the nuclear arms race. The prime minister chose Harwell and so began what nuclear scientists still call \"the golden age\" of this Oxfordshire atom laboratory. In the days of austerity the budget was unlimited - Britain, having won the war, had to keep her status as a world power. The fruit of Attlee's decision to divert precious steel to Harwell is still there in the form of a giant box called GLEEP (the Graphite Low Energy Experimental Pile), housed in a former RAF hangar. It is a mute but still radioactive testimony to the start of a giant, very expensive, but unfulfilled dream. It was the first of six research reactors built at Harwell. Although the first incentive was military, the scientists also wanted to harness the atom for peaceful means - it was here that the promise of \"electricity too cheap to meter\" was made, if not kept. Quite soon, so much work had been created that the site was not big enough to accommodate all the reactors that the scientists wanted to build, nor remote enough to guard against possible accident. So other sites were opened at Winfrith in Dorset and Dounreay on the northern tip of Scotland. The excitement of the new science attracted the best brains and an extraordinary can-do enthusiasm - and this has left not just a legacy of redundant reactors, but also the Rutherford Appleton space laboratory and a thriving hi-tech science park of spin-off industries. But, as in the 1940s, the taxpayer is having to meet a high price now for those adventures on the frontiers of science 50 years ago. For all the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority sites, the clean-up bill for the taxpayer tops £7bn, with a total bill over the next 40 years of £700m at Harwell alone. This difficult operation has hardly been publicised. The upside of the nuclear dream, the privatisation of AEA Technology, whereby all the inventions and spin-off industries were sold, was trumpeted by the last government. The downside, whereby the taxpayer was left picking up the bills, and until far into the next century, was hardly mentioned. For the staff at UKAEA, adjustment from rolling back the frontiers of technology to cleaning up the mess has been difficult. Their bit of Harwell has gone in the space of 30 years from embodying Harold Wilson's \"white heat of new technology\" to being a rubbish dump. Even though it may be a sophisticated dump, this still entails a big drop in esteem. John Wilkins, head of site, said: \"There are a few people who live in the past, remembering the huge research and development facilities, when we were at the centre of events. We have to face up to the fact that nuclear power has not lived up to the hopes and promises of the early days, it is not part of our role any more. \"There is a growing focus on environmental issues and re-use of brownfield sites, and we match up well against those. We find there is a lot of satisfaction now in removing redundant facilities and adapting to new roles.\" Proof that money was no object at Harwell can be seen in the buildings which are to be demolished. The construction workers lived in pre-fabs, now long gone, but then-scarce materials like stainless steel were widely used in the labs. The former RAF station, from which the glider-borne troops who were the first to land on the Normandy beaches had been launched, was transformed into a top secret science establishment. Dozens of brick and concrete buildings, which eventually housed 6,000 staff, were built in a remarkably short time. GLEEP ran for 43 years and became the world's longest running reactor. It was followed by the much larger British Experimental Pile or BEPO, the prototype of the first Magnox reactor at Calder Hall at Windscale, opened by the Queen in 1956. The Windscale station, now renamed Sellafield, is still running. There followed a series of other reactors with names like Zephyr, Zeus, Zeta, Dido, Pluto and Lido, all to explore the possibilities of the new science. After 11 years of dual civil and military existence, the military applications were hived off to nearby Aldermaston in Berkshire, where nuclear weapons are still made. The feverish work continued at Harwell on a technology its staff believed was going to transform the world. The dream faded when the Conservative government finally pulled the plug on British reactor research. Margaret Thatcher decided to build an American-designed reactor called Sizewell C in Suffolk. This was the end for pure research at Harwell. It caused anger and bewilderment among those scientists who remembered the \"golden age.\" The UKAEA's mission statement no longer mentions harnessing the power of the atom, but now emphasises dismantling and restoring the giant Harwell site to a non-nuclear use. Although this will take more than 40 years, work is well under way. The nuclear legacy will retreat to a small enclave while new industries are established in the science park. Employment, which peaked at 6,000 in the 1950s, fell back to 4,500 in the 1980s and 2,550 last year. Now it is on the rise again. Only last week National Power moved on to the site with 120 staff to begin new battery research into how to store surplus electricity. The UKAEA is tackling the decommissioning work stage by stage. All the reactors have had their fuel removed and they are now on a \"care and maintenance basis\" waiting until the radioactivity inside the hulks has decayed enough for the reactors to be demolished safely. Some of the older buildings, used for labs or storage, have their radioactivity cleaned off. This nuclear waste has to be disposed of in special facilities on site and the rest of the \"clean\" building demolished or refurbished for a new use. The low-level waste is sent to the British Nuclear Fuels disposal site at Drigg in Cumbria, but there is nowhere permanent in Britain for the more dangerous wastes to go. As a result the taxpayer has had to stump up £20m for a new waste store at Harwell. The new store is designed to last 50 years, by which time the AEA hopes the government will have opened a site where all the nation's radioactive waste can go, and Harwell can finally be returned to a non-nuclear use. • Tomorrow: the story of atoms for peace at Winfrith"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/aug/25/features11.g2","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-24T23:31:56Z","webTitle":"Do not adjust your life","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/aug/25/features11.g2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/aug/25/features11.g2","fields":{"headline":"Do not adjust your life","bodyText":"Overlooking Thimphu, Bhutan's capital and the closest thing it has to a city, is a 9,000ft hill called Sangyegang. At the top of it, where the long, thin, spear-tipped prayer flags never stop rippling, a red carpet adorned with loose, elaborate patterns of dyed rice has been rolled to the door of a modest one-storey structure. There, from behind a wooden lectern, Queen Ashi Tshering Pem Wangchuck, the second oldest of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck's four wives - all sisters - steps up to address an audience of A-list monks, ministers and dignitaries. The afternoon's ceremony falls in the middle of a week-long celebration of King Wangchuck's silver jubilee, and the Queen begins by recapping the milestones of her husband's reign. In the past 25 years, Bhutan has added its first system of paved roads and telephones, an airport and a two-plane airline, and enough hospitals and clinics to extend the average citizen's life span by two decades, to 66. But now this last and most wilfully isolationist of the Buddhist Himalayan kingdoms - which, through cunning, diplomacy and blind geographic luck, has somehow avoided getting overrun by history - is bracing itself for the most pitiless invader ever loosed upon this world: television. In two hours, a consultant from Hong Kong will throw a switch in the little studio behind the Queen, and Bhutan will begin bouncing one-kilowatt broadcast signals off its age-old hills. The Bhutanese have long brought up the rear in the global race toward modernity. Serfdom didn't become illegal here until 1958 - and 10 miles outside Thimphu you're still practically in the Middle Ages. Of the country's 600,000 people, 85% are entirely occupied by subsistence agriculture, and are so scattered among remote villages that most of them live at least a day's walk from the nearest road. The novice traveller might conclude from such scenes that a little television could hardly do these folks much harm; at least they could sit and stare at something that moves faster than plate tectonics. But despite its poverty - the average annual income is $550 - Bhutan has never viewed the preservation of its culture as an indulgence, and has expended considerable resources in its defence. In the late 70s, the King coined the phrase \"Gross National Happiness\" to emphasize that, unlike other developing nations, Bhutan would not be bullied into measuring its progress purely in material terms. He established commissions to maintain the country's 2,000 active monasteries, introduced Driglam Namsha, the ancient code of conduct, into the school curriculum, and eschewed the easy money of tourism. Last year, Bhutan, which doesn't maintain an embassy in America, admitted only 6,000 visitors, while Nepal, its neighbour to the west, took in 500,000. As today's tradition-steeped ceremony suggests, Bhutan is determined to access the latest technologies without losing its distinct national self, to cut some kind of unique deal between the old and the new, and travel what an official planning document calls \"the Middle Path\". In fact, the country's tortured decision to set up its own television network - called the Bhutan Broadcasting Service, or BBS - has not been made as a concession to western culture but as an attempt to thwart it. For now at least, the BBS will be broadcast only in Thimphu, be limited to a few hours a day and will consist entirely of national news and documentaries about the Bhutanese themselves. The hope is that television will paradoxically help remind the ancient people of the Dragon Kingdom who they are, not who they aren't. Keeping Pandora's box only halfway open won't be easy. Even before the country's ban on satellite dishes was unofficially lifted just in time for last year's World Cup, 2,000 were already despoiling the landscape. And even if the initial content is a snooze, now that a broadcast infrastructure is in place it seems as if it's only a matter of time before another ancient culture fades to black. As soon as the ceremony ends, each journalist and his assigned press liaison officer race to their waiting cars and drivers to hustle back down into Thimphu in time to catch the first television broadcast at the home of a \"real\" Bhutanese family. I secure a booking in a part of Thimphu called the Lower Market. The house I am staying in is a traditional three-storey structure with the first floor a kind of barn and the top floor an open-air drying shed. Only the second, reached by steep outdoor stairs with railings as worn as an old subway turnstile, is reserved for eating, sleeping - and now TV. By the time I barge in, three generations of the Tshering family, as well as assorted neighbours and cousins, are seated on the polished wood floor looking expectantly at the Sony in the corner. The broadcast features the King's address that morning to about 15,000 of his subjects packed into the stone terraces overlooking the Changlingmithang sports stadium. King Wangchuck speaks briefly and modestly about the progress the country has made, and then walks out onto the stadium's grassy field (with no security) to greet his guests. Afterwards the tall, elegant 43-year-old King - wearing a yellow kilt-like gho and ceremonial boots - goes to the centre of the field to lead a performance of the tshilebey , which is a jig somewhere between a hora and the sun dance at Club Med. The television production is surprisingly professional, and most of the people in the Tsherings' house sit rapt throughout. The 67-year-old family patriarch and his 74-year-old wife have never seen a television broadcast before and don't seem quite sure if they should respond to it as official ceremony or routine entertainment. They sit in respectful silence. On the other hand, their daughter, Chenko, spends most of the broadcast chatting and barely paying attention - she has friends with satellite dishes. Later, a BBS video editor named Ugyen takes me downtown so we can watch people watching television. Halfway up a backstreet we see a flickering blue light outside Sonam Thinley's grocery. We stand on the curb like accomplices at a game of three-card brag and catch up on the local news. We watch a segment Ugyen himself edited. It is about the girl's basketball tournament at a local sports centre. Basketball? I thought the big Bhutanese sport was archery. It was, Ugyen explains, but now with the blessing of the King - who has videotapes of NBA games shipped to him from New York - hoop is huge in Thimphu. Although the audience is nothing compared with that drawn by some comedians around the corner and even smaller than that gathered for the Buddhist movie, the show has stopped about 10 pedestrians in their tracks. Those who drop off and move on are gradually replaced. Yet there is no sense that they feel as if they are witnessing anything of historical import. Of course, that's how TV works - it sneaks up on you. The tall Bhutanese-style chalet where the 15-year-old Amin lives with his family just outside Thimphu has panoramic Himalayan views from every window. But Amin, a bony kid in a Titanic T-shirt, only has eyes for Loveleen - a girl not much older than himself, dancing with conviction on Boogie Woogie, a game show brought to him via satellite each weekday afternoon by Colgate toothpaste. Amin's family has been quietly reeling in inappropriate programming since installing a dish last summer. They watch Chicago Hope and Friends as well as British shows like Thomas the Tank Engine and Teletubbies. And they're briefed by BBC and CNN. Watching with Amin are his nine-year-old niece, 32-year-old sister, parents and grandmother, all sitting so stiff and still against one stark mud wall that they could be posing for a family portrait rather than watching breasts bounce. And although the images on the TV contrast abruptly with the lifesize painting of Buddha in the prayer room next door, where Amin's father has built an elaborate altar with row upon row of sacrificial water dishes and butter lamps, there is no indication that the family elders are the least bit discomforted by the boogie-woogieing. Before getting the dish, Amin's family watched videos. Thimphu doesn't have a single traffic light, but it does have 25 video stores. One of the biggest, a shop run by Mani Orsang, rents 350 tapes a night. When I visit, Mani recommends the recent Brian de Palma bomb Snake Eyes. On the racks, I also see films like Shallow Grave. One night, some Thimphu locals lead me down a back alley to an apartment-building basement that one day a week houses the dance club Ex - so called because all three owners are divorced. I step into a dark, unventilated box where it's about 100 degrees and the strobe light on the low ceiling is reflected in the sweat on the floor. Here, the flower of Bhutan's youth, egged on by a mix of classic dance tunes and unrecognisable Indian mutations, is doing all one room can for Gross National Happiness. Whenever the great timeless choruses arrive - whether it's from Wild Cherry's Play That Funky Music or Culture Club's Do You Really Want To Hurt Me? - all the Buddhists in the house throw back their heads and yell them out in ecstasy, as if they have stumbled upon passwords to a better world. If I still hold out any hope for Bhutan's chances against pop, they die loud and hard at two in the morning. That's when I catch a glimpse of a young woman named Karma, a ferocious Mongolian beauty in a black sleeveless T-shirt, black slacks and white platform flip-flops. Her fists clenched, Karma makes funky little robot-doll moves as the speakers and dancers wail: \"I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world... Come on, Barbie, let's go party!\" But Bhutan's leaders cling to the notion that they can negotiate with pop culture. In the ceremony for the initiation of Druknet, Bhutan's official website, the oldest Queen, Ashi Dorji Wangmo Wangchuck, cheerfully announced that Bhutan would offer 10 days of free mail service to prevent emails from wiping out the art of letter writing. Then, evoking an image as vividly art-directed and patently false as one of IBM's \"Solutions for a small planet\" ads, she said: \"Bhutan's dream for the internet is that its people will gain access to the whole world without ever having to leave the tranquillity of their tiny remote rural villages.\" Admittedly, inner Bhutan has a transcendent tranquillity. An hour's walk in either direction can take you from tropical jungles to an alpine ridge. Yet how many Bhutanese will want to stay put in their cosy villages once they've glimpsed the hubbub beyond? History strongly suggests that few people will choose to spend eight hours a day knee deep in mud behind an ox if there's an alternative. In the end, the only way to slow modernisation is to control it by force. That's what ultimately makes Bhutan's willed provincialism less than charming. In the name of preserving tradition, the most elemental details of your fate, from who gets educated and what you end up doing for a living, are decided from on high. The day television arrived in Bhutan, the chairman of the Council of Ministers said the decision to create a broadcast network was made because it was determined \"that our people had reached the level of intellectual development that was necessary\". How much longer will the people of Bhutan - 43% of whom are 15 or under - be happy to turn all these matters over to their wise elders? If the King can have four wives, why can't Amin have Loveleen?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/aug/25/uk.politicalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-24T23:32:55Z","webTitle":"Warring history ideal background for native son","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/aug/25/uk.politicalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/aug/25/uk.politicalnews","fields":{"headline":"Warring history ideal background for native son","bodyText":"Lord Robertson of Port Ellen regards the place of his birth - and now of his title - as one of the loveliest and most romantic in the world.

Scotland The Best does not think it worth a mention; even the most enthusiastic guides to the Hebrides say Port Ellen and the Isle of Islay do not yield their charms easily. But given Lord Robertson's new role at Nato - a job that requires both political and military capabilities - there are some appropriate connections. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Dunyvaig castle on the island was a MacDonald stronghold and the site of considerable military and political activity. The great Norse warrior Godred Raven, who expelled Fingal from the Isle of Man and took possession of the Kingdom of the Isles, was buried there in 1005. In 1918, the HMS Tuscania, a British battleship carrying American troops, was torpedoed off its coast, with the loss of 266.

The romance of which Lord Robertson speaks could be found on Islay's miles of white sandy beaches, among the 250 species of birds who flock to the island, in the 8th century Kildalton Celtic cross - one of the best-preserved Christian crosses in Britain - or perhaps in the mere fact that Port Ellen was founded in 1821 by Walter Frederic Campbell, who named it Port Eleanor as a token of affection for his wife. More realistically, however, the best chance of romance may come from the bottom of a glass filled with the distinctive smoky whisky of any of Islay's six distilleries."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/1999/aug/26/onlinesupplement1","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-26T02:47:16Z","webTitle":"Week in view","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/1999/aug/26/onlinesupplement1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/1999/aug/26/onlinesupplement1","fields":{"headline":"Week in view","bodyText":"The US Justice Department wants to be able to break into private premises and disable security precautions on personal computers, The Washington Post reported late last week. The envisaged Cyberspace Electronic Security Act is the department's response to the use of encryption programs \"to facilitate criminal activity, such as drug trafficking, terrorism, white-collar crime and the distribution of child pornography\", according to a department memo quoted by the Post. The proposal would appear to trample all over America's Bill of Rights, but why not? US law enforcement officers can already break into premises to install hidden microphones. No doubt crimes could be reduced even further by installing cameras and microphones in every home... and George Orwell's novel, 1984, could be republished with a new date, 2004.

However, Demon's response makes one telling point. \"We believe that if the law enforcement agencies were paying for interception capabilities then this would require them to show that they were getting Value For Money,\" it says. \"If the ISPs are coerced into providing this capability without regard to the cost then the agencies are likely to use interception when other methods of investigation would be far cheaper when considered overall.\" Clearly, any analysis of Value for Money should also include the cost to UK competitiveness, the loss of overseas business and other incidentals.

It was the world's worst nuclear disaster prior to Chernobyl. A small band of courageous people, some of whom later contracted cancer, fought to prevent the fire getting out of control. For 40 years, at the heart of Britain's biggest nuclear complex - now called Sellafield - this silent monument to the arms race has remained as a constant threat. The industry was forced to wait until the technology to deal with it was developed. A necessary breakthrough was a swimming robot able to operate in the dark to locate and pick up nuggets of plutonium contaminated fuel and carry them to submerged skips. This fuel needed to be hauled to safety on an underwater railway, and then, without ever being exposed to air, dismantled and dissolved in acid. That, according to site manager, Barry Hickey, was the easy bit. The more difficult task is yet to come. It means opening up the Windscale pile, a brick tower, and getting out the melted interior. The plan is to flood the entire reactor with inert argon gas to exclude air and prevent spontaneous ignition of uranium hydride that may be disturbed in the operations. Because the area is still highly radioactive, remotely operated robots will be used to dismantle the core. Mr Hickey said: \"We no longer think as we arrogantly did in the 1960s that no one knew better than us. If we had a problem we would develop our own research and development to solve it at God knows what cost. Now our culture has changed, now we realise we have a lot in common with other hi-tech industries.\" The fire-damaged No 1 pile and its undamaged twin, No 2, are at the base of the two tall concrete towers in the middle of the Sellafield site in Cumbria. They are on an island still controlled by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) in the middle of the British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) site. The costs of dismantling the site are all borne by the taxpayer but mostly come from the budget of the ministry of defence which was seen to \"benefit\" most from production of plutonium. One of the anti-nuclear lobby's enduring beliefs is that Windscale changed its name to Sellafield in the hope of changing its image. Those on site claim it was merely to distinguish the BNFL site from the UKAEA site. Sellafield continues to recycle spent nuclear fuel. The chimneys of No 1 and No2 tower above a third UKAEA relic, a giant metal football, prototype of the current generation of advanced gas cooled reactors (AGRs) built for the peaceful purpose of generating electricity. This too is to be taken to specially developed robot machines. The chimneys are a monument to the late 1940s when Britain was desperate to retain its status as a world power. They were to remove the heat and gases discharged from the uranium in the graphic piles, the whole operation designed to make plutonium - an essential ingredient for hydrogen bombs. The proof that public safety took second place to the arms race is in the tell-tale square platforms near the top of the chimneys. These contained filters to prevent the people of Cumbria being sprayed with radioactive dust when the piles were operated. Common sense would have dictated that the filters were built at the base of the chimneys but they were almost complete by this time - and so the filters were built at the top and a lift constructed . \"After the war, there was a great public drive for a deterrent so it could not happen again - that is what all this was about,\" said Rob Dodgson, manager for dismantling the mess that pile No 1 became. The fire began on October 8 1957 and burned until October 11, when 200 gallons of water a minute were poured into the pile. It was not known that such drastic action would not cause an explosion and meltdown. As it was, the whole truth was not disclosed. Millions of gallons of milk laced with radioactive iodine were poured down the drain for months as a precaution, but many of the locals out potato picking were not warned of the fall-out. In a calculation 10 years ago the National Radiological Protection Board estimated that around 100 people \"probably\" died from cancers as a result of the releases over 40 to 50 years. The cover-up that followed, in which an official inquiry failed to reveal the true extent of contamination, is now part of history. It will have cost £50m by 2008 to remove all the spent fuel and the damaged interior of the pile. The idea is to leave the concrete shell for BNFL to dispose of in the future. This will have to remain until the government has made a decision on the final destination for Britain's nuclear waste. The metal golf ball is to be left intact until a disposal decision is made. The giant heat exchangers from the prototype AGR have already been lifted through holes in the roof and taken to the Drigg low-level nuclear dump nearby for encasement in concrete and eventual burial. It has cost £25m to develop the method for demolishing the reactor and it will cost the same again to take it to bits.

He said they had helped cause a glut of older sheep on the market where prices are a third down on last year. Farmers reacted angrily to the \"misleading\" claims as Mr Brown and his Welsh counterpart, Christine Gwyther, also condemned \"unlawful and irresponsible\" dumping of animals to highlight the crisis. The argument mainly concerns older breeding ewes sold for cheap meat, often used in processed foods. Mr Brown said farmers had reacted to falling prices last year by not selling such sheep and that had worsened the position this year. \"The industry has seen it coming. Individual farmers realised what the consequences of breeding animals, that they could get a low price for years ago, was going to be. It wasn't a very good idea to let the market in the United Kingdom become so oversupplied.\" Buying up so-called cull ewes was not an option for the government. It would be unlawful under European Union rules, he said. There was little room for manoeuvre and just under £500m of taxpayers' money was already going every year into sheep farming. Mr Brown attacked farmers who abandoned animals. \"They have to accept the obligations that go with rearing livestock and that means treating animals kindly. Clearly abandoning them isn't doing so.\" Mrs Gwyther, who discussed the crisis with him yesterday, said she was considering asking the Welsh first minister, Alan Michael, to \"raid\" the principlality's budget for more cash. \"It's important we keep the industry going and that we do that with the support of the public. The tactic of dumping animals I absolutely deplore.\" But the National Sheep Association said Mr Brown's information was inaccurate. Government rules imposed on the sector caused major problems. \"They put high cost onto the industry and result in a heavily devalued product, said a spokesman. \"We now import significant quantities of ewe meat because many of our ewes have become uneconomic to process.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/aug/28/3","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-28T01:46:40Z","webTitle":"A world away from the sales game as King Ronnie marries in Kampala","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/28/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/aug/28/3","fields":{"headline":"A world away from the sales game as King Ronnie marries in Kampala","bodyText":"It was not long ago that Friday mornings meant an early start for Ronald Mutebi - the beginning of a long day spent traipsing the streets of south London selling double glazing door to door. But yesterday the 43-year-old Cambridge dropout who became king of the Ugandan kingdom of Buganda six years ago spent the morning in St Paul's cathedral, in the Ugandan capital Kampala, in front of a congregation of royalty and dignitaries who had gathered to witness his wedding. The spectacular three-hour ceremony was the culmination of a 30-year struggle for a man who was born to be the king of 8m African tribespeople, but who has spent most of his life in exile in London. The Baganda are Uganda's largest ethnic group and the wedding is particularly important to the many of them who hope it will ensure the succession and future of their monarchy. \"After all the persecution that we Bagandans have been through, this wedding will make our future secure again,\" said Geraldine Makayizo, 34, who attended the wedding. King Ronnie, as he is known to his friends, was a student at King's Mead school, Sussex, in 1966 when Uganda's first post-independence leader, Milton Obote, abolished the monarchy and ordered his army commander Idi Amin to storm the king's palace. Died penniless Ronnie's father, King Mutesa II, scaled the walls of the palace in the face of the attack and slipped away into the evening rain. He re-surfaced in Burundi three weeks later. From there he was flown to London, where he died three years later in Bermondsey, a penniless alcoholic. Times were hard for Ronnie in London and his stint selling double glazing was reportedly followed by work as a pipe fitter for British Gas. But the political situation in Uganda was changing. Idi Amin's murderous rule had been ended and a guerrilla army led by current Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni was fighting a winning campaign against Obote. Ronnie visited areas of Uganda liberated by Museveni's guerrillas and helped shore up civilian support for the rebels. In 1986 Museveni assumed control of the country and invited the future king back to the country. Mindful that restoration of the Bagandan monarchy would ensure him the support of the 8m Bagandan people Museveni began the slow process of rehabilitation that culminated in yesterday's wedding. When President Museveni arrived at the cathedral just before the king - or kabaka - he received a rousing reception from the congregation, in an expression of their gratitude for the role he played in the restoration of the monarchy. Men in traditional Kaazu dress and women draped in silk, and dripping with gold and pearls, filled every inch of every pew, sitting on cushions printed with pictures of the couple. Dignitaries arrived according to a staggered schedule, reflecting their importance. When the kabaka himself entered the cathedral to begin the first royal wedding in Uganda for more than 50 years he walked solemnly down the aisle to thunderous applause. In an atmosphere more akin to a football match, the master of ceremonies announced his arrival over a loudspeaker, straining to make himself heard over the cheers of the guests. Sylvia Nagginda, the kabaka's bride who was born in Britain and has lived most of her life in the United States, walked towards the altar occasionally tearing her gaze away from her feet and towards her husband to be. The kabaka's youngest sister Princess Diana looked on from her seat in the front pew. Names are not the only thing the Bangandan monarchy has in common with the House of Windsor. Rebellious members of the royal family caused a scandal earlier this year when they questioned Ronnie's paternity, suggesting that his father was not King Mutesa II but rather one of his mother's lovers. Ronnie weathered the accusations and the ensuing storm and went on to announce his choice of bride in May this year. Most Bagandans greeted the news with delight but there were some who openly criticised his choice. At the age of 35 she was too old, said some, while others complained that his fiancée belonged to a Buganda clan that more commonly provided the royal household with cleaners. \"Her clan is Musu - meaning edible rat - and that might not be a good omen for our king,\" said 25-year-old Christine Kasakende as she stood outside the cathedral waiting for the kabaka to leave. Furthermore Ronnie has fathered a child with a Rwandan woman, and local newspapers have reported rumours that he is in love with another woman. One Ugandan journalist said: \"It's a bit like your Charles and Camilla.\" Finest clothes Outside the church thousands of people lined the steep hill that runs down towards the city centre, each one dressed in their finest clothes. Many of them had been waiting for hours for a glimpse of the couple as they drove to their reception and their honeymoon. Bagandan tradition dictates that no Bagandan other than the royal couple should have had sex last night, though King Ronnie is said to have given his subjects permission to ignore the ruling. As the service drew to a close, the peal of church bells gave way to claps of thunder and heavy rain began to fall on the waiting crowd. \"I have been waiting here for six hours,\" said Immaculate Nampoza as she fingered a souvenir brooch depicting the happy couple. \"I love our kabaka so much I don't care if it rains all day. I'll wait here until I see him.\" The normally busy Kampala streets were mostly quiet as people of all tribes gathered round television sets and radios to listen to the ceremony as it was broadcast live across the city. James Bagaza, who works as a baggage handler at nearby Entebbe airport and is a member of the northern Acholi tribe, said: \"Even though I am not Bagandan I am very much excited about the kabaka's wedding. It is bringing all Ugandans together.\" The journalist and political scientist Andrew Mwenga agreed. \"This wedding has come at a time when our country is polarised. We had been looking for something around which we can reassert ourselves as one people and this wedding is a unifying event.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/aug/28/guardianobituaries.annemcilroy","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-28T01:46:44Z","webTitle":"Jean Drapeau","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/aug/28/guardianobituaries.annemcilroy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/aug/28/guardianobituaries.annemcilroy","fields":{"headline":"Jean Drapeau","bodyText":"In 1967 the visit to Canada of France's President Charles de Gaulle culminated with his arrival in Montreal in Quebec. Jean Drapeau, who has died aged 83, was then that city's mayor, as he was for almost three decades until 1986. Apprehensive about the general's likely utterances, Drapeau had the public address disconnected as De Gaulle waved to the crowds from the city hall balcony. But someone else reconnected a microphone, and thus was the French leader able to shout: \"Vive Montreal, Vive le Quebec. Vive le Quebec libre!\" The result was a globally reported diplomatic incident. De Gaulle's visit to Canada's largest English-speaking city, Ottawa, was abandoned, and the day after his outburst Drapeau made a nationwide broadcast reiterating the province's place within Canada. If Drapeau had not been known outside Quebec before, he was then. He transformed Montreal from a provincial town to a global city, with a combination of dreamy ideas and tough-mindedness. History and geography had conferred on Montreal the challenging mission of being a mirror for Canada, he observed in 1967. The city was \"a link between cultures, religions and traditions; a witness of the past and precursor of a more magnificent future still\". It was Drapeau who attacked organised crime, brought Montreal Expo 67 - for which he had hoped to borrow the Eiffel Tower from Paris - and the 1976 Olympics. He provided the city with its underground transit system and the country's first major-league baseball team. But he also saddled the metropolis with a huge debt from the Olympics, which are believed to have cost $3.5bn, a bill taxpayers will be paying off well into the next century. Drapeau meanwhile insisted that \"the Olympic Games can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby\". The mayor was a man of simple tastes, never moving away from his modest bungalow in the French-speaking east end of the city and drinking hot water every morning for breakfast. He was small and balding, but at times he seemed above his citizens, speaking impeccable French, lecturing world leaders like De Gaulle and governing, at times, like an emperor. \"For him, the only vote that counted was that of the electorate every four years,\" wrote Claude Masson in Montreal's La Presse. \"Democracy had its moment of glory on election day. Period. Between votes he ruled the kingdom, and the consultation was limited to a small circle of intimates\". Drapeau came from a political family. His father, an insurance broker, was a city councillor. Educated at St Jean de Brebeuf College, he graduated from the University of Montreal - where he was influenced by Abbé Groulx, the French Canadian nationalist - and became a criminal lawyer in 1943. He ran for office in a 1942 parliamentary by-election as an anti-conscription candidate and lost, losing again two years later in a Quebec provincial election. His life in the public eye began when he took on organised crime - death threats and all - as a crown prosecutor. In 1954 he was swept into mayoral office by a public appreciative of his efforts to clean up the city. Brothels and gambling and drinking dives were closed, but three years later, what was labelled a dirty election saw him ousted. In 1960 he was back, and went on to win six more times, outlasting seven prime ministers and nine Quebec premiers. The Quebec of 1960 was undergoing what was labelled the \"quiet revolution\". Control of the provincial government had shifted from the conservative Union Nationale to a revitalised local Liberal Party. The power of the Roman Catholic church in Quebec weakened, the economy grew, new welfare measures were introduced, and a confident French-Canadian nationalism developed. It was a political environment in which Drapeau flourished. With that 1960 victory he returned to his war on crime and even brought in police consultants from London and Paris. But Drapeau was also interested in the oddest of details. Thus, in his city, no food vendors are allowed on the streets - the mayor wanted to encourage fine cuisine. The 1968 de Gaulle rallying cry came as Québecois separatism was becoming a significant factor. The Parti Quebecois was formed that year, and outside mainstream politics the Front de Libération du Quebec kidnapped a British trade commissioner and murdered a Quebec minister. Drapeau was targeted and his family home was destroyed by a bomb in 1969 although luckily no one was home. Drapeau cried when he retired 13 years ago. He then became Canada's ambassador to Unesco in Paris for five years. He leaves his wife, Marie-Claire, and three sons. • Jean Drapeau, politician, born February 18, 1916; died August 12, 1999."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/aug/28/weekend.julieburchill","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-28T01:46:53Z","webTitle":"Misdirected male","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/aug/28/weekend.julieburchill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/aug/28/weekend.julieburchill","fields":{"headline":"Misdirected male","bodyText":"I still remember the day I first read the amazing quote by that society broad who turns down a suitor with the words, \"No, darling, I only sleep with the first 11.\" I remember running to my friend, Viking Ann, to ask her with a tremulous voice, \"I only slept with the first 11, too, didn't I?\" Viking Ann roared, \"Course you did, darlin'! The first 11 that asked you!\" This was, perhaps, the one time in my life that I have been forced to admit that women can be as evil as men. Most of the time, there's no competition. No matter how rabid a masculinist he is, I do not believe that any father of small children has not said to them at some point, \"If you get lost, go and tell a LADY!\" No parent, not even David Thomas, says, \"Go and tell a MAN!\" It remains a statistical fact that a girl child is safer, sexually speaking, sleeping under the roof of two strange lesbians (though not too strange) than she is sleeping in the same house as her blood father. Women may not be nicer than men, which was always used in the past as an excuse for men to behave like beasts and women to put up with it, but there can be no doubt that they behave better. Despite all the tired gags about PMT, they do not seem half so ruled by their emotions as men - for what is a murderer but someone who has completely lost control of himself? Men are far less capable of objectivity than women: when a judge, say, lets off a rapist with a pat on the head, you just know that, nine times out of 10, he's looked at the victim, fancied her and thought, \"Cor, I'd rape her myself if I thought I could get away with it!\" You know it's silly season when the newspapers start banging on about how much more violent women are getting: invariably, the headline will be the reekingly cheesy Deadlier Than The Male (question mark optional). This searingly original query also raises its head whenever a cold-blooded female killer is sighted - though, of course, the fact that we can recite the unholy canon of Myra Hindley, Mary Bell, Beverley Allitt and Rosemary West simply demonstrates how rare such women are. If we tried to recall the list of cold-blooded male killers who've been brought to justice over the past 40 years, we'd still be here at Christmas. Christmas 2005. Last week, The Daily Mail ran a piece about how the female prison population has doubled in five years - that is, 17% of prisoners are now women, in for shoplifting, fraud and dropping fag ends out of moving car windows, while men, the veritable little peace pledgers, remain steady at 83% with rape, murder and child molestation. Attaboys! Why can't a woman be more like a man? We have become so used to men being rapists, murderers and child molesters that we - least of all the Daily Mail - never question why they feel the need to do these things. But I'm old enough to remember the 70s, before the Daily Mail became the champion of our \"dusky\" brothers via the Stephen Lawrence case, when the headlines came thick and fast as to how black youth was driving a violent crime wave that would one day engulf the country. We can only surmise that the accused's families read them, too. Questions are constantly posed by the right wing about race and criminality, but no one ever sees fit to ask why 83% of all prisoners are male, and what can be done to stop men raping, murdering and molesting. I'd like to point out here that I am not speaking with my feminist hat on, but rather my Responsible Citizen chapeau. It is a fact that young men are more likely to be victims of violent crime at the hands of a stranger (women are lucky: they get killed by their nearest and dearest) than any other group. On behalf of us all, women and decent men, it would behove right-wing pundits to tackle the sticky problem of why a minority of men are so responsible for wreaking such havoc on society. I think I have the answer. I've known lots of gay men and lots of genuinely straight men, and most of them were absolute angels. However, I have also had the misfortune to come across a large number of men who pretended to be straight - worked overtime at it, in fact - but who, in their heart of hearts, were profoundly gay. This made them misery buckets when sober, dangerous when drunk and a thoroughly unhealthy influence on society in general. I'm not going to name names, but we all recognise those men who have what can be politely called \"a tormented masculinity\" built on sexual confusion. (Hemingway was one.) The novelist who takes karate lessons. The actor who says that being in borstal was the best time of his life. The rastafarian who won't let his girlfriend into the kitchen when she's \"on the rag\". The wife-beating footballer who never seems happier than when he's got his tongue down the throat of his equally repulsive \"mate\" (that word is such a giveaway). Any man under the age of 50 who loves football or boxing - though not, paradoxically, all footballers or boxers. Men who talk about 'ard men or geezers, or who read books by violent criminals, or who liked Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. Benders, benders, benders. It is the desire and fear of a large minority of men when it comes to bending that, I believe, causes so much upheaval and misery in our society. Earlier this month we were warned by the boys in blue that the blessing of live football on TV several times a week would damage the level of policing generally as more resources were poured into keeping the peace around various hotspots. Can you imagine women's hockey causing such bother to any civilised society, or that society putting up with it? Just so a bunch of pencil-dicked dickheads can have an excuse to get pissed and grope each other. If women think they may have lesbo tendencies, they get merry on Babycham and fall giggling into bed with their second-best friend; we're brought up with so much soft-core, girl-on-girl eroticism that it doesn't seem a big deal. Men, though, have still got this ludicrous, operatic solemnity about their \"manhood\", and not being made a \"woman\" of. So they bottle it up, and it makes them ugly. Eventually, they are violent one too many times and get sent to jail. Where - hey presto! - it's acceptable to bend, blow and bugger to kingdom come. It's very clever, what these geezers do, when you think about it; like a dog eating grass to make itself sick. They end up with exactly what they want. It's the rest of us who have to suffer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/1999/aug/29/highstreetretailers.observerbusiness","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-29T01:47:35Z","webTitle":"Trapped in a shag pile time warp","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/aug/29/highstreetretailers.observerbusiness","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/aug/29/highstreetretailers.observerbusiness","fields":{"headline":"Trapped in a shag pile time warp","bodyText":"Three years ago Ray Nethercott, then managing director of Allied Carpets, proclaimed his intention to obliterate the small high street independent. The boss of Britain's biggest carpets chain had good reason to be upbeat. The firm had just successfully floated on the stock exchange, making Nethercott a multi-millionaire. The carpet market, too, was - and still is - one of the great unreconstructed sectors of British retailing. Just two national chains, Allied and Sir Philip (now Lord) Harris' Carpetright vied with more than 5,000 independent specialists, who looked ripe for the picking. This Bank Holiday weekend is crucial for furnishings retailers, as stores pray for sunshine and home-owners, in the midst of the property boom, mull whether to splash out on new carpets, rugs or a wooden floor or - worried about interest rates - decide to skip to the beach at Blackpool or Brighton instead. Right now, however, it is Allied, not the independents, that stands to be carved up - by either a voracious City conglomerate, France's carpet king or the South African-owned Poundstretcher discount chain. Nethercott, though, will play no further part, having left under the cloud of an accounting scandal four months ago. Industrial predator Wassall's £77 million hostile bid for Allied, announced last Thursday, marks the end of two years of despair for the carpet chain's shareholders, as sales have stagnated, profits have disappeared and the management's hubris has been exposed by lies over the group's accounting policies. Shortly, after Allied finally unveils its much-awaited new business strategy this week, Tapis Saint-Maclou, France's top carpet retailer, is likely to trump Wassall's 80p a share bid, kicking off the endgame for the chain proper. Brown &amp; Jackson, which owns the Poundstretcher chain, is still poring over Allied's books, but after offering just 50.5p a fortnight ago, looks set to be comprehensively floored. It speaks volumes for the inadequacies of one of retailing's top household names that Wassall and the French - neither of whom have experience in the carpet industry in the United Kingdom - can offer twice as much as Allied was worth before Poundstretcher's approach and still count on making a pile. It also says much about the time warp in which the big carpet sheds are stuck in a fast-changing, fashion conscious market. Want a cheap carpet at less than £10 per square yard? Then by all means go to Allied or Carpetright. Want to look at something of a higher quality and, at the same time, get the right advice between carpets, wooden parquets or natural fibre floorcovers? Then go to an independent specialist. The trouble for Allied is the choice increasingly being demanded by the sort of ABC1 customers it aims to attract, but simply turns off instead. 'Allied is just so old-fashioned. Its range is neither full nor appealing. And its traditional offering of beds and curtains is appalling too,' said retail analyst Richard Ratner of City broker Seymour Pierce. Four years ago, the UK carpet market was worth more than £1.8 billion a year. Now annual sales have stagnated to £1.7bn, with a growing proportion - currently £500 million, or 30 per cent - accounted for by house-builders and developers interested in a quick and cheap in-and-out. True, the downward trend has been closely correlated with the slowdown in housing transactions. Over the past year, however, the property market has picked up, while carpet purchases - which can easily be put off - have yet to recover. Increasingly the fraying of the carpet market can be laid at the door of fashion and not just the quirks of the housing market. Flooring really started to become a fashion statement among the middle classes, Allied's target market, with the vogue for stripped pine floorboards in the 1970s. But in the last few years, helped by the proliferation of glossy magazines, the lifestyle element has really taken off. City loft-living may be indulged in by relatively few, but the fashion exposure of wood, slate and stone is huge. Woven natural materials, such as rush-matting, jute, seagrass, coir and sisal - made variously from coconuts and pineapple leaves, of all things - have also enjoyed a renaissance. Health consciousness has also played its part, alongside increasing affluence: carpets suffer periodic bouts of bad press over asthma caused by the ubiquitous dust mite. The only 1970s floorcovering not back in vogue, indeed, is the shag pile carpet, which is seen not only as naff, but dirty in the tradtional sense of the word. 'There are such a lot of products on the market, so you have to offer a good range or specialise and give great service,' said Anthony Morris, manager of the Westbourne Park showroom of upmarket floorcoverings firm Crucial Trading in West London. 'The major chains do neither, and that's where they fall down.' DIY has also become all the rage again. And while you can easily fit parquet flooring from Homebase or B&amp;Q (which the carpet chains still largely ignore), try doing that with a heavy roll of carpet. As a result, analysts estimate that woodstrip alone now accounts for 5 per cent of the flooring market against just half that a few years ago. Neither Carpetright nor Allied can claim that a new out-of-town depot is demolishing all local opposition, as does a new B&amp;Q with DIY. So while the big two have expanded their chains, the net effect of the housing market, fashion and failure to freshen up with the times has been nothing but gloom of late. This year, like-for-like sales fell 3.5 per cent at Carpetright - now the market leader with an 18 per cent share from 333 stores, which also trade under the Carpet Depot, Carpetland and Harris Carpet labels. At Allied, despite a brief pick-up through price promotions under new chief executive Geoff Brady over the last three weeks, the despondency has been even worse. Allied's own broker, ABN Amro Hoare Govett, is forecasting losses of £6m on sales down seven per cent to £246m when the company reports its 1999 results this week. Much of the sales drop is accounted for by the sale of 27 Carpetland stores to Harris last November, which left Allied firmly number two with just 14 per cent of the market and 232 outlets. But ABN Amro has also been forecasting similar losses and another sales drop, to £241m, this year. Meanwhile, far from obliterated, the small independents are maintaining their grip. Buying to order is one way they keep price-competitive. Avoiding the majors' huge holdings of stock diminishes the chains' advantages of economies of scale. And then again there is good old fashioned choice and service. 'The independents will always beat the chains. We compete on knowledge, product range and quality of staff,' said Barry Halket, owner of Barry's Place in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. 'In the industry Allied has the worst reputation. Walk through the door and you either get pounced on or ignored. My staff are better paid and, unlike Allied, no one is on commission.' Even after Wassall's bid, Allied shareholders who invested at 215p in the flotation are still nursing heavy losses this weekend. Given the history of carpet retailing in the UK, however, they should not be surprised. The original Allied chain was first snapped up by supermarket group Asda at the top of the market in 1978, and then sold to Carpetland for a nominal sum in 1993 after heavy losses in the recession. Carpetland itself emerged as a buy-out in 1991 - headed by Nethercott - from the heavily indebted Lowndes Queensway (the old Harris Queensway), which went into receivership as the 1980s boom fizzled out. As the French contemplate their move this weekend, they and Wassall will be reflecting that the only investor to make a pile from the business in the UK has been Phil Harris, the lord of carpets himself. He luckily sold Harris Queensway to the late Sir James Gulliver for £450 million in 1988 before it crashed, collecting £70 million from his stake. His shares in Carpetright - which he then started from scratch from one store in London's Canning Town - are still worth £65 million. Harris also owns a property empire and a large slice of Harveys, the home furnishings chain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/aug/29/observerbusiness.theobserver10","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-29T01:47:36Z","webTitle":"Profit is the motive for enemies of BBC's digital television future","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/aug/29/observerbusiness.theobserver10","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/aug/29/observerbusiness.theobserver10","fields":{"headline":"Profit is the motive for enemies of BBC's digital television future","bodyText":"A curious alliance emerged in the wake of the Davies Panel, the Government's independent review into the funding of the BBC. It was an alliance of commercial interests which are more normally employed trying to consume each other. But like the warring tribes of Iron Age Britain suspending internecine warfare to resist the civilising force of the Romans, it seems Britain's commercial broadcasters have momentarily patched up their differences to exploit a common opportunity to wound the BBC. Commercial broadcasting makes enormous contributions to culture and commerce in the United Kingdom. Britain's commercial broadcasters have businesses to run, and it is in the interests of all of us that they run them well. But there is too much at stake for commercial interests alone to be allowed to dictate broadcasting policy. Because, although broadcasting doesn't have to be an important part of a society, in the UK it is. Partly a result of the very success of the BBC and commercial television when they were cosy partners in a public service duopoly, it has been a benign influence on daily life in this country over several generations. The battlecry of the alliance is that a digital licence fee will impede development of the digital industry. I am suspicious of this somewhat opportunistic line of argument. Only a few years ago, the attraction of the BBC's services for digital viewers was implicitly recognised by those digital broadcasters who seized on the offer of BBC services as central components in their bundles of channels. Digital will work if there are high quality new services that deliver real value to viewers over and above what the market alone will provide. And the BBC's services are highly attractive to retailers who feature them prominently in their adverts for digital systems. Where else would you find programmes of the sheer range and quality of Life of Birds, Goodness Gracious Me or The Cops; Great Expectations, Spoonface Steinberg or The Secret Life of Twins; Delia Smith's shows, The Naked Chef, Match of the Day or Home Truths? As ITV's Richard Eyre pointed out recently, would the bores who drone on about what bad value the BBC is really swap all its radio, television and Online services for the equivalent of one tabloid a day? Because that is what the BBC costs - 28p per day. Now we are told to believe that the BBC is apparently an obstacle to the success of the digital universe. Is it or isn't it? The Davies panel found conclusively that it was not. It clearly believed that digital will only succeed in the UK if there are high quality new services of real and perceived value on offer - not just what the market alone will provide. The BBC can guarantee for the digital age a range of programmes that other broadcasters will not, and universal availability in an increasingly fragmented digital environment. The BBC's free-to-air digital offering - BBC1 and BBC2 on digital platforms with high quality pictures and sound, BBC Choice, BBC Knowledge, BBC News 24 and BBC Parliament, with a children's channel a glint in our eye - is more likely to encourage households to switch to digital rather than to discourage them. A recent report by the independent consultancy London Economics found that the upfront costs of hardware and installation were a much greater obstacle to consumer take-up than ongoing costs, and judging by their actions the commercial broadcasters already know this. They have regularly raised subscription prices (BSkyB's full package has risen from £276 per annum in 1995 to £384 today, an increase of 39per cent) and hiked up digital subscriptions by £24 a year. Yet at the same time, BSkyB and On Digital have introduced 'free' set-top boxes - a business model that was favourably received by the City, where the consensus view is that all digital platforms can coexist profitably. The BBC is a business, too: it is the country's only mutual broadcasting organisation. Our responsibilities are to our licence fee payers, and we will seek to serve their interests as vigorously as the commercial alliance seeks to serve those of its shareholders. We want to earn the loyalty and respect of the licence-paying public by providing something distinctive for everyone. We don't take public support for granted. We try to ascertain our audiences' needs and tastes, and produce programmes and services which the average household watches, listens to or uses for more than 40 hours every week. The Davies Panel's own survey found that, currently, 70 per cent of people expressing a view were satisfied with the BBC. This rose to 77 per cent among our younger viewers. The BBC was the preferred supplier of 11 of 14 programme genres. But if it is starved of funds, the contract with our customers will come under strain and the rationale for public service broadcasting will be weakened. The commercial sector stands to gain a greater share of the converged media, IT and telecoms market with new revenue opportunities including more pay-per-view (PPV), the launch of discounted telephone and free Internet services and the growth of e-commerce transactions. Informed forecasts indicate a market size £17 billion by 2006. By then, BSkyB and On Digital's annual revenues alone are expected to exceed £4 billion, with operating profits of more than £1 billion. The need for content will increase programme sales. Already BSkyB reports digital subscribers buying one movie per month £2.99 (or £36 per annum). The commercial sector is also guaranteed a handy cashback from a generous Government and regulatory policy environment. Commercial TV broadcasters stand to gain nearly £400m per annum once analogue transmission ends. That's approximately £280m per annum in reduced licence payments via the Independent Television Commission's digital dividend. ITV is already estimated to have saved £100m. This is alongside approximately £120m savings on analogue transmission costs. With this wall of money there is a risk that the relative balance in funding between the BBC and the commercial sector could swing decisively against the BBC. Behind the smokescreen of argument about a digital licence fee, there is the reality that, for subscription broadcasters and their shareholders, the biggest single obstacle to increasing profitability is the existence of a successful, low-cost, high-quality alternative. One which, to boot, has the biggest terrestrial portfolio of sport in the world. But there is a social as well as an economic incentive. The BBC's remit to provide something for everyone - from quality home-grown children's output to broadcast experiences in which the whole community can share - will strengthen, rather than weaken, social cohesion. Without this commitment, the power of television, radio and online broadcasting as a major social and cultural force for good will wane. The Davies Panel's report endorsed the BBC's role in the digital future because of the diversity and ambition of our future plans and the responsibility we hold as part of the UK's cultural fabric. It firmly supported the BBC's basic argument on the value of the licence fee, and conceded that the BBC had been on a diet for a long time. The BBC wants to stay trim. But it needs enough nourishment to keep up with phenomenal industry growth. If the BBC gets it right, the whole broadcasting industry will benefit. But the funding needs to be right too. If the BBC is diminished, the likelihood is that the whole industry - and the wider society we all serve in different ways - will suffer. • Will Wyatt is chief executive of BBC Broadcast."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/aug/30/northernireland.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-30T00:56:10Z","webTitle":"The real news is that peace can't be imposed in Belfast","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/aug/30/northernireland.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/aug/30/northernireland.comment","fields":{"headline":"The real news is that peace can't be imposed in Belfast","bodyText":"There is hard news and soft news, according to the sainted John Humphrys. (He likes the hard stuff; his BBC employers have gone soft at Six). But you can split categories of news every which way - including, as Mo Mowlam might add, real news; the news where reality bites. Consider: I'm sitting a few weeks ago with a very senior copper discussing the aftermath of the Jill Dando murder. Where did the hit man buy his gun? Surely Jack Straw's dynamic ban on gun ownership has made the whole firearms scene much tighter? Not really, says top cop reflectively. He can rattle out a long list of pubs where anyone with a wad of fivers can pick up a pistol in 30 minutes flat. Laws don't get in the way of trade. The Straw package may make life tougher for deranged amateurs: fewer guns in legal circulation mean fewer fumbling fingers on triggers. But don't, for a second, suppose that the professionally determined are much incommoded. There's a sharp bang a couple of streets away as I leave. A dodgy exhaust - or a touring Yardie? In other words, if you want a gun and know where to look for it, the underworld is your oyster. Parliament can pass laws till kingdom come - but, for the drug runners, bank robbers and terrorists, life and death continue as though nothing had happened. And if that's true in the east end of London or Manchester Moss Side, it must be even truer in Belfast (where the Straw law, remember, doesn't run anyway). Did anyone seriously suppose that the Good Friday agreement would lead to complete disarmament along the back alleys and side roads of Northern Ireland? Did David Trimble suppose that the IRA would turn in every last armalite and stash of grenades? Did Gerry Adams suppose that the UVF and the rest wouldn't forget to turn in the hardware under the floorboards? Of course not. They 're talking symbolism, not reality. See how, across Europe, the Kosovo Liberation Army claims to have met its own disarmament obligations. Nobody believes that - and the murder of Serbs continues unabated. Kosovo, in any case, is a vast dump of weaponry left behind: enough to keep the black markets of the west stocked for years. Even if the IRA, in some unimaginable circumstance, turned in every last gun tomorrow, it could be up and shooting again in three months. The reality of peace isn't turning revolvers into ploughshares: it is, slowly, painfully, ensuring that fingers slide away from the triggers. But unreality, alas, is so much easier to play with; the mouthings of unreality glide so much less painfully from political lips. And one unreality feeds on another. Thus the unreality of a symbolic start to disarmament (which wasn't in the agreement to begin with) leads, over stretching time, to a deliberative pause in which our secretary of state is required to deem the ceasefire firm or illusory. Mo Mowlam does what she was always going to do, what she had no option but to do. She deems the process battered but fundamentally intact. The IRA have not taken up guns again against the army or the police or the leaders of unionism. There has been no return to sectarian killing. The gangs and the protection racketeers are still operating with some brutality. But no Good Friday words on paper ever could or ever will do much about that - just as no words of Straw, transmuted by parliamentary draftsmen, could stop Dando's murderer going to a pub he'd heard about from the friend of a friend. The essential, basic peace remains. Again: everybody intimately involved knows this. David Trimble, first minister designate of Northern Ireland, knows it. Even the suddenly omnipresent Jeffrey Donaldson, Ulster Unionist MP, knows it. The roars of outrage and threats of legal action, the prating calls for Mo Mowlam's head, are ritualistic and synthetic. They are either a way for weak men of moderate goodwill to hang on to power in the hope that better times will come - or a thinly disguised attempt to wreck the agreement and shelve every vestige of what process remains by men who never wanted peace on these terms in the first place. The real news is that divide and that debate: not the flummery of fury. And the real issue behind it needs to be put still more starkly - in a way that even John Humphrys might quail over. Back to my truth-telling top cop. Can we (I once asked him, in the darker days before Good Friday) ever defeat the IRA? Can our army ever bring peace at the point of a gun? Is there a military answer of enforcement and internment and massive policing which is the alternative to accommodation and compromise? Straight questions: straight answer. No, there isn't an alternative. Good intelligence can abate the violence for a while, but it can't stop it. There is no law and order solution here (any more than a large army billeted in Kosovo can prevent ethnic cleansings or simple gangsterism). The alternative to the way things are is a return to the way things were. Two years ago, both sides implicitly recognised that. Nobody was winning and nobody losing. The conflict was just pottering bloodily on, in increasing futility. So there was a halt (perhaps, says my wise copper, only the first of several as the lessons are gradually learned). But time, in the passing, is another enemy here. Men with guns and politicians with restive constituencies forget. They load back the unreality. George Mitchell becomes a strolling player, not a saviour. The words of hope become ever more strained, the deadlines ever more malleable. The devil of the situation, though, is that the truth of our impotence in all its bleakness can never be voiced openly by those who understand. Neither Tony Blair nor Mo Mowlam can admit the inability of the state apparatus they control to impose a solution - and the Conservatives have all too swiftly forgotten what they learned through 18 bitter years. The ordinary people of Northern Ireland are left darkling among the posturers and the bigots. The ordinary voters of the rest of the UK are given no chance to tell the minority over the water what they think should be done. Real news? Real news gives you the real options and the real assessments - and confronts you with the real decisions. Real news gags on the surface show and shrugs off facile connections to four frightened lads in Dungannon. Real news deals in the fundamentals of life and death. Harder than hard, truer than truer. But there isn't, it seems, much of it around - at Six or any other spot on the clock."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/aug/30/guardianobituaries1","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-30T00:56:14Z","webTitle":"Bastiaan Meeuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/aug/30/guardianobituaries1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/aug/30/guardianobituaries1","fields":{"headline":"Bastiaan Meeuse","bodyText":"Bastiaan Meeuse, who has died aged 83, was a distinguished botanist with an international reputation for his research into strange and exotic plant species able to generate heat so intense that they can burn human skin. He was particularly known for unlocking the mysteries of the voodoo lily (Sauromatum guttatum), an extraordinary specimen now the target of extensive genetics research in America and Europe. There are many plants with flowers that are not conventionally beautiful either to the eye or nose, yet they fascinate botanists for other reasons. The voodoo lily is prominent among them, and it has an aroma that is more than just bad - it stinks. Fortunately its bloom is short-lived. Meeuse spent much of his research career at the University of Washington, Seattle, unravelling the mechanism by which these huge, smelly flowers, weighing up to a half-pound, generate so much heat that they reach 108F inside. Meeuse and a series of collaborators published 200 papers on the voodoo lily in his 50 years of research. Meeuse was born in Sukabumi, a small town on Java, Indonesia, where his parents, who were teachers, had been sent by the Dutch colonial service. When he was 11 years old, he and his family moved to Bogor, an important colonial outpost and one where Dutch biologists had established world-famous botanical gardens. The beauty and variety of the plants he saw triggered Meeuse's awareness of the natural world, and set him on course to become a biologist. In 1931 his family moved back to the Netherlands where Baastian studied biology, zoology, chemistry and physics at the University of Leiden and received his PhD at the University of Delft in 1943. He stayed at Delft as a laboratory assistant and lecturer until 1952, interrupted by two years as a Rockefeller Foundation Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania where he studied the metabolism of pea seeds. In 1952 he joined the University of Washington and became a professor of botany in 1960. His lectures as a student at Leiden alerted him to the existence of an unusual group of exotic plants that generated considerable amounts of heat, produced the most foul-smelling flowers, and were a botanical mystery. This fired Meeuse's curiosity and he devoted much of his career to exploring the phenomenon and its possible implications for horticulture and agriculture. He explored other aspects of plants such as the medicinal value of natural extracts and the intricacies of pollination provided by insects and birds: his The Story of Pollination (1961) is still in demand. He was also the co-author, with Sean Morris, of The Sex Life of Flowers (1984). His research work on plant extracts showed that salicylic acid, the active ingredient of aspirin, was spread widely throughout the plant kingdom and was an essential agent in the regulation of growth in many botanical species. In the 1950s he accidentally discovered a moss enzyme that burns oxalic acid. It has since been used to regulate the blood of people whose circulatory systems overproduce oxalic acid, a condition that could result in a potentially fatal kidney disease. But Meeuse's main preoccupation remained with thermogenic and usually malodorous plants and the processes responsible for the heat they liberated. In a paper in 1987, he identified salicylic acid as the substance behind the heat-producing respiratory explosion in thermogenic plants: Meeuse's team found that the salicylic acid levels in their lilies rose a hundredfold before flowering. Biotechnologists are now isolating the genes that control the production of proteins involved in the heat- generating processes Meeuse unravelled, and are studying how to use them to breed frost-resistant crops. In 1978, Meeuse established a unique herbarium collection of the species Garden loosestrife (Lysimachia vulgaris) at Washington University. The plant, a native of the wetlands of eastern Europe and Asia, became the focus for research that continues into the potential threat it poses to the native character of environmentally sensitive wetlands. Meeuse is survived by his wife of 57 years, Johanne, and a son and daughter. • Bastiaan Jacob Dirk Meeuse, botanist, born May 9, 1916; died July 27, 1999"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/1999/sep/01/guardiansocietysupplement2","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"1999-08-31T23:52:04Z","webTitle":"Public spirit","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/sep/01/guardiansocietysupplement2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/1999/sep/01/guardiansocietysupplement2","fields":{"headline":"Public spirit","bodyText":"It is two years since my conscience (green) and my lifestyle (downsizing) drove me to dispose of my car. My enthusiasm for public transport, apparent in the article I wrote at the time, caused a degree of wry laughter from friends and generated more than a little irritation among colleagues and acquaintances. People told me I was being naive, overly optimistic and short-sighted. They predicted I would want my car back before a year was out, and that public transport being the inconsistent creature that it is, I would be screaming about its inadequacies within a matter of months. None of that has happened. Good riddance to the car. My love affair with public transport continues. I cannot deny it has imperfections, but I have been fortunate. In two years I have never been late for work. My buses are on time every day. The drivers are courteous and good natured, and cope brilliantly with traffic which would give me nightmares if I had to handle it myself. If it can be done where I travel then it can be done everywhere in the country. I am so convinced of this that I spend evenings composing letters to John Prescott offering him advice on how to persuade people to use the very excellent facilities on offer. I even wrote a catchy song about it that started, \"Mr Prescott, Mr Prescott, let me be your right hand man; I'll get the punters on the bus if anybody can.\" Of course, I won't. And neither will he - not on his present form. His current campaign lacks weight and centrality of purpose because he does not really know what he wants. Sure he wants to see a reduction in traffic jams and pollution, but apart from tinkering at the edges of the present system by making people pay tolls or higher parking charges and hoping that this will deter them, he is vague and unrealistic in his objectives. In his shoes I would be much more determined. The object of the exercise is to stop, or at the very least reduce, the proliferation of vehicles on the roads. It cannot be done by persuasion or by making people pay a bit more. Legislation is the only way to tackle it. Raise the age at which people can begin to drive to 25. Take driving licences away from people at 70. Only give out as many licences in any one year as those which have been handed in. Simple. Outcry? Yes. Huge. People think they are going to hate using public transport. They will for a bit. Of course, they will. It's like leaving mummy when you're five and you have been the centre of attention in your own little kingdom, and you're forced to go to school, where you have to share everything with other people. If that seems like a fatuous analogy, I can only say that after speaking to many people about why they won't give up their cars, at least to travel to work, the most common response has nothing to do with speed, convenience, economy or poor services; it is about sharing space with other people - rude people, dirty people, common people, people who (heaven forfend) talk to you. The excessive use of the car, apart from its obvious detrimental effects on our environment and health, has turned us into a nation of reclusive snobs. Of course, changing the law with respect to who can and cannot drive would be deeply unpopular with the motor industries, insurance companies, and obviously those affected directly. But, on the upside, the young and the elderly prohibited from driving would create massively strong lobbies for the improvement of the public transport services. Alongside the obvious advantages of less congestion, healthier air, and stress-free driving, maybe in 20 years from now the rest of the buses in the country would run as efficiently as they do here in Yorkshire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/sep/02/northernireland.johnmullin","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-02T01:06:47Z","webTitle":"Don't give up on talks, pleads Mowlam","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/02/northernireland.johnmullin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/sep/02/northernireland.johnmullin","fields":{"headline":"Don't give up on talks, pleads Mowlam","bodyText":"Mo Mowlam, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, yesterday pleaded with Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein to attend ex-US senator George Mitchell's make-or-break review of the ailing Good Friday Agreement when it gets underway at Stormont on Monday. Bertie Ahern, Irish Taoiseach, backed her call. Ms Mowlam denied her decision last week that the IRA ceasefire was intact despite its murder of an RUC informer and attempts to smuggle guns from Florida was to surrender to terrorists. She also rejected Unionist accusations of naivety. She said: \"What we are doing is not about appeasement or turning a blind eye, but about helping this society end historic conflict. And I believe the basic desire is still there, despite the recent problems. And that is why the parties should be in there, talking to each other, in the Mitchell review, not walking away.\" She paid tribute to David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, as a recognition of the pressures on those who supported the Agreement who had rivals sniping on the sidelines. She said: \"They are the brave ones who held their nerve and are now taking Northern Ireland forward to the future, not back to its past.\" Both Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein parties are so far refusing to commit to the review, which the British and Irish governments see as the last chance for the 16-month-old Agreement's implementation. Mr Mitchell will try to break the impasse over IRA decommissioning and the formation of a power-sharing executive. Sinn Fein, which will make its decision on Saturday, criticised what it saw as Ms Mowlam's defence of the RUC in her speech, to Catholic and Protestant pupils at Ulidia College in Carrickfergus, Co Antrim. Mr Trimble, First Minister Designate, hinted that it could be Monday before his party makes up its mind. He said it would be meeting today, Saturday and probably on Monday. He dismissed Ms Mowlam's speech. He said: \"There is nothing new in it. It merely repeats what was said last week.\" Ms Mowlam's plea came as Tory leader William Hague launched his most savage criticism yet of the Government's approach to Northern Ireland, accusing Mr Blair of a \"betrayal of trust\". He recalled Mr Blair's definition of the type of ceasefire required from groups linked to paramilitaries before they could join govenrment. Mr Hague wrote in the Daily Telegraph: \"The Prime Minister was quite clear what was required: 'That the ceasefires are indeed complete and unequivocal; and end to bombings, killing and beatings, claimed or uncliamed; and end to targetting and procurement of weapons; progressive abandoning and dismantling of paramilitary structures actively directing and promoting violence'. \"In the light of this, it is no surprise that the Government's judgment that the IRA ceasefire remains intact has been met with a mixture of anger and bewilderment throughout the United Kingdom. It flies in the face of the admitted facts and smells unacceptably of fudge and sham.\" Ms Mowlam, who received a rapturous welcome from the pupils, condemned the IRA's move to exile youngsters from Northern Ireland. She condemned \"kangaroo courts\" of any kind. She added: \"But life in Northern Ireland is sometimes not as straighforward as it would be elsewhere. When the IRA ordered teenagers to leave Dungannon last week, some, at least, small in number, in the local community supported that action because they could not support the police. That I find very disturbing\". She called it the reality behind Chris Patten's Commission on Policing, which is due to deliver its recommendations for RUC reform next Thursday. She wanted a force to be as widely acceptable as possible in both communities, making punishment beatings and paramilitary intimidation unimaginable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/sep/02/scotlanddevolution.devolution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-02T02:27:12Z","webTitle":"Competing members","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/sep/02/scotlanddevolution.devolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/sep/02/scotlanddevolution.devolution","fields":{"headline":"Competing members","bodyText":"It is the near future, hard by England's northern border. Reynard is running over the fells north of Bewcastle, a pack of John Peel wannabes at his heels. Where does any self-respecting fox head? To Scotland, of course, land of the free. There, if Labour MSP Mike Watson gets his way, fox hunting will be banned long before Tony Blair's recent promise on the subject is redeemed. It may be that the father of the nation (aka Donald Dewar) will come down hard on his backbencher and the forces of party discipline will persuade him to stick to a script drafted by Blair with the (English) Countryside Alliance in mind. But Edinburgh's dynamics are not so easily predicted. There are spicy new ingredients, among them the new parliament's understandable desire to do things differently from England. A ban on the pursuit of foxes north of the Tweed while hunts ride on in the English shires would add to the diversity of the kingdom. Some other issues could prove even more embarrassing. Will Edinburgh intervene to rescue farmers while London refuses? Then there are student fees. To secure a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Labour set up an independent review committee. In an admirable exercise in public involvement, the committee is listening hard. If Scotland chooses to speak out on who should pay for educating lads and lassies o' pairts, the survival of the coalition will surely depend on Donald Dewar's willingness to break ranks with London and abolish tuition fees for Scottish students. And such an outcome would be welcome. Of course much of the new parliament's business will relate to home and hearth: a priority this autumn is abolishing what remains of feudalism and emancipating rural Scots from oppressive landlords. But one of the great potential benefits of subordinate parliaments within the United Kingdom is the way policies and payments may vary. It is about time we had more experimentation. Let there be a liberal Scottish freedom of information statute that shames Straw. Let Scottish motorists pay tolls and enjoy more dual carriageways.

Perhaps you'd like to download details of MI6 operatives. Or perhaps the minutes of the last cabinet meeting. You'd quite like to find out what official records are stored on you and download those too. And that's all between filing your tax return, and organising your travel arrangements by ordering a new passport and getting your visas sorted. But you can't do any of this now (certainly not officially, in the case of MI6). Not that it's technically impossible or even difficult. You just can't do it. That's not because there's nowhere to do it. It's de rigueur for all government departments or agencies to have their own site nowadays. And if the government ever introduces anything resembling a real Freedom of Information Bill, then those sites would be vital conduits of information and services. In the aftermath of the last election, there was much good white-heat-of-technology talk about. The information superhighway was the way for the Blair government to distinguish itself from its predecessors. The prime minister's declared aim in October 1997 was that \"within five years a quarter of dealings with government can be done by a member of the public electronically, through their telephone, TV or computer\". And every six months it produces a briefing on the \"25%\" project while the clock ticks on the self-imposed deadline of 2002 and the next general election. It's an issue that could soon become even more important: the national audit office has contracted out a major research project into the state of government websites which will shortly come before the public accounts committee. That's besides the latest \"modernising government\" action plan. Launched last month on the back of the Modernising Government white paper - which means by the end of the this year, there will be a trial government gateway, providing one-stop access to government. And, by October, all govern ment departments and agencies have to have standards in place. Some departments have taken this to heart. To see how a good government site can work, look no further than the foreign and commonwealth office at www.fco.gov.uk. The site has just won two more awards to add to its growing collection - Best Use of New Media from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising and Best Government/Charity site from online magazine New Media Age. Relaunched in May 1998 it's the most-visited government site. Looking for a ministerial speech from this morning? You'll find it there, together with regularly-updated travel advice, a personalised front-end and a powerful archive, as well as an invaluable email service. During the Kosovo crisis, it ran a special joint site with the Ministry of Defence at www.mod.uk/news/kosovo with the FCO providing most of the (English and Serb-Croat) content while resting the pages on the MoD server. During the war, it had at least 1,300 hits a day from Yugoslav addresses. In its first year, the site provided the equivalent of 60,000 hours of customer service based on a time-cost of 4000 person-hours. Use of the site has grown by 60%. Mike Butcher, editor of New Media Age, says it was the obvious winner of the NMA award. \"It was offering the sorts of services you might expect to find on a commercial site but not on a government site,\" he says. For Moray Angus, the FCO's head of new media, recognition is particularly gratifying. The site is run by \"two and a half\" staff who have to integrate their software with the FCO's aged Uniplex system. \"Reports come from all around the world, and all around this building - often on scrappy bits of paper,\" says Angus. \"And, to be effective, you have to be quick. But it's getting to the point where we get much more of a response internally. They're coming round to the idea that it's a good way to get the message out to a lot of people.\" He sees potential outside his own department for what the site provides. \"There are other departments whose work is much more appropriate for the net than we are. Apart from travel advice, we don't have that much of a service role - we don't do passports or visas,\" says Angus. But it's the constant updating and general availability of information that makes it impressive. While few other departments match up to the quality of the FCO, they have improved in the last two years. The department of trade and industry at www.dti.gov.uk has a well-designed site that reflects its erstwhile secretary of state, Peter Mandelson. Mandelson embraced the technology fervently after being shown the net for the first time by the actor Stephen Fry. In November 1998, Mandelson announced the appointment of a high-ranking digital envoy to spearhead the government's drive to make the United Kingdom the best environment in which to trade electronically. It was to be reflective of the government's attitude to technology. The job still hasn't been filled - although an announcement is due next month. But Mandelson's former department maintains a competent site which includes new links for business in Kosovo although, as one commentator noted recently, the huge amount of DTI statistics that could be online are nowhere to be found. It's the same with departments such as culture, media and sport at www.heritage.gov.uk or the weaker home office site at www.homeoffice.gov.uk. Looking for full statements? You can usually find them, if not immediately then usually within a couple of days (speed is still a problem for many of the sites). But try to access anything a little more interesting and the site sticks up a wall as surely as any Sir Humphrey might have done. And those are the sites that know how to use the net. Some agencies are clearly not quite comfortable with being online. The benefits agency at www.dss.gov.uk/ba supplies information on specific benefits. Yet you can't apply for them online. The passport agency at www.open.gov.uk/ ukpass provides background information on applying for a passport and a statement of the obvious on the waiting situation (\"Some customers are experiencing delays with their passport applications\") yet, again, you can't apply online or even print off an application form. NHS Direct at www.doh.gov.uk/nhsexec/direct.htm , the new flagship medical advice service has a homepage too. But if you're looking for medical advice, forget it - it just gives a phone number. \"Government sites tend to do this in a very small fashion,\" says New Media Age's Mike Butcher. \"They think it's just about getting a home page - it's all very 2D thinking.\" And according to Butcher, it's not getting any better. \"They're all losing the plot,\" he says. A story doing the rounds of technology journalists reflects, many say, the real government attitudes not the far-sighted speeches. At a press conference on the vital issue of encryption, a journalist asked the civil servant running the show what would happen when a user lost their digital \"keys\" (ie, their access to the information). The civil servant replied, in all seriousness, that when he lost his keys he usually found them down the back of the sofa. Good as some British government sites are, they compare poorly with their US equivalents in terms of awareness. In 1994, Vice President Al Gore was talking about the importance of the web. Now the government, by and large, practises it there. Combined with the advanced US Freedom of Information legislation, it means there's very little you can't get online on the US government. The CIA recently published thousands of previously secret reports on its involvement in revolutionary Nicaragua - all were available online. You can also find, on other sites, bankruptcy filings, the federal budget, election funding details (with presidential candidate filings) and a database of property ownership. And you can file your tax return. It's all public information and it's all publicly available. But even without the same freedom of information, there are many public facts in the UK that could be widely available. However, if you wanted to get hold of government statistics for a particular street or area, the first port of call would be the award-winning UpMyStreet.com - rather than a government site. One day you will be able to log on and do all those nasty personal admin tasks online, conveniently, while finding out what the government is really getting up to. One day you'll even get \"25% or more\" government services available electronically. One day it will all be easy. But don't hold your breath.

The cable company NTL was included in the deal, enhanced by the return of the English clubs, which will see matches televised live nationally on Grandstand with games in Wales, Scotland and Ireland likely to be screened live locally on Friday nights or Saturday afternoons. NTL's involvement means ties will also be shown on Eurosport in Britain. The deal reverses a trend for the BBC, which has seen the corporation lose many sporting events to BSkyB, ITV and Channel 4, and enhances the BBC's prospects of regaining the total UK rights to the Six Nations Championship when current contracts end in 2002. BSkyB presently holds the rights to all England matches at Twickenham, with the exception of the World Cup, but the Rugby Football Union will have to negotiate a joint television agreement with the other home unions, whose championship matches are all currently televised live by the BBC. Yesterday BSkyB was playing down its European Cup failure; the company had been told from the outset its only chance of securing the rights lay in finding a terrestrial partner. The BBC and Channel 4 were approached, but the BBC was asked to pay millions for rights which did not include the final and Channel 4 demurred because it was bidding for Italian football. The defection of the presenter Des Lynam from the BBC to ITV proved fortunate for European Rugby Cup Ltd, the competition organisers. After his departure, the BBC was strongly criticised for surrendering rights to sporting events and it re-entered European Cup negotiations with a substantially increased bid. By the time BSkyB realised what had happened, it was too late. The BBC-NTL deal is worth £24m with ERC estimating it will receive another £4m because it has kept the rights for the overseas market, the internet and videos. With the French arm of the television contract worth £26.8m, it means ERC will bank £55m. The fact that the matches will be broadcast largely on television enhances ERC's hopes of landing lucrative sponsorships. It is looking for six blue-chip backers to contribute at least £4m a year, which would see the French and English clubs receive an estimated £750,000 each. If the BBC had failed virtually to double its previous offer, there would have been pressure for another English boycott of the tournament. \"This is an excellent deal,\" said an ERC insider. \"We wanted to ensure that we had a large terrestrial input and the deal we reached with the BBC will serve both British rugby and television well. The fact that matches will be staged live on Grandstand on a Saturday is a significant development for the sport and we expect that Rugby World Cup will lead to a heightening of rugby's profile which the BBC will be able to exploit.\" There will be more sparring as the Six Nations' contract comes up for negotiation. BSkyB's public insistence that it was not interested in the European Cup does not square with the negotiations it had with ERC. As in 1995, the satellite company thought it could succeed with a knockdown price only to be thwarted by a terrestrial rival - ITV's £5m bid four years ago compared to BSkyB's £500,000. An independent arbitrator is currently considering how much, if anything, the Rugby Football Union should pay its home union partners from the £87.5m deal it negotiated unilaterally with BSkyB three years ago. The Celts are claiming £38m, a sum disputed by the English union which has put in a counter-claim for a share of the championship television money enjoyed by the other three. A decision is expected this month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/1999/sep/05/3","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-04T23:05:56Z","webTitle":"When Harvey met Kate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/05/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/sep/05/3","fields":{"headline":"When Harvey met Kate","bodyText":"1. Holy Smoke Stars Kate Winslet, Harvey Keitel The Pitch Re-Educating Rita The Story Teenage Australian traveller Kate Winslet goes to India and joins a religious cult. On hearing the news back in the suburbs, her horrified white trash family trick her into returning home and enlist the help of famed deprogrammer, Harvey Keitel. Secluded in the outback, Winslet soon sees through Keitel's tired routine of disempowering and psychological techniques. The struggle to undermine her spirituality quickly takes second place to a compelling battle of wits between the two protagonists as sexual attraction rears its ugly head. The Prospects Expect something closer in tone and quality to director Jane Campion's stirring The Piano than her disappointing follow-up, Portrait of a Lady. (Released 15 October) 2. The Sixth Sense Stars Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams The Pitch The thinking moviegoers' ghost story The Story Suspenseful adult horror film that has terrified and thrilled record audiences in America. Apparently at the top of his profession, psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe's (Bruce Willis) life is far from perfect. His wife (Olivia Williams) is on the brink of an affair. A traumatic encounter with a psychic former patient, whom he was unable to help, nearly destroys his life and he is determined to aid a young boy who displays similar ESP ability. Turns out his new patient (Haley Joel Osment) has a hotline to the dead, especially those who endured a horrible demise. Willis steps away from his action man image to give a sensitive performance while Osment has already been tipped for an Oscar. The Prospects It's a movie that repays repeat viewing due to complex plotting and clever hints littered throughout. The final twist will leave audiences stunned. (5 November) 3. The Fight Club Stars Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter The Pitch Raging Bull meets Wall Street The Story This movie wants to tap into pre-millennium male angst. The Zeitgeist-friendly set-up sees timid corporate wage slave, Edward Norton cast aside his inhibitions on meeting self-styled anarchist, Brad Pitt. The pair get immersed in illegal top-secret 'fight clubs' where similarly dysfunctional males indulge in extreme bare-knuckle fighting. Of course, there's a bizarre love triangle involving Helena Bonham Carter, and a descent into degradation... The Prospects Reuniting the Seven team of Pitt and director David Fincher obviously seemed like a good idea to everyone involved. The casting is intriguing: Should Pitt and Norton have swapped roles? And can you see Bonham Carter as a jaded, grunge femme fatale? (12 November) 4. The Blair Witch Project Stars Heather Donahue, Michael C.Williams, Joshua Leonard The Pitch Little Red Riding Hood revisited The Story Alongside The Sixth Sense this movie made it the summer of the scare in the States, offering an antidote to the Scream teen school of movies. Three student documentary makers head off to the Maryland woods in search of the fabled, titular phantom. They disappear, but the apparently recovered video camera footage provides a grainy record of their terrible plight. An inspired idea, skilfully executed, Blair Witch has been the surprise US hit of year despite a cast of unknowns and lack of special effects. The Prospects Word-of-mouth has generated great advance buzz for this chiller. Wildly hyped low budget, (roughly $40,000 and falling) should guarantee must-see status amongst hip movie-goers and spark endless dinner party conversations. (29 October) 5. Election Stars Reese Witherspoon, Matthew Broderick The Pitch Fear and Loathing in the classroom The Story Satire about the bitter rivalry during the election of the high school council president. Narrated by Matthew Broderick, on sabbatical from big-budget no-brainers (Godzilla, Inspector Gadget), it's a teen comedy with adult appeal as a parable for grown-up elections. Broderick is an overly conscientious teacher who decides to thwart the campaign of ambitious student Reese Witherspoon. She believes it's her destiny to win, but Broderick's scams threaten to derail her carefully orchestrated bandwagon and even rouse the apathetic electorate. A dark-hearted treat. Prospects A companion piece to recent school comedy of over-achievement, Rushmore. Another quirky success which will alleviate 'teen movie fatigue'. (24 September) 6. Felicia's Journey (pictured) Stars Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy The Pitch The Odd Couple meets Silence of the Lambs The Story Canadian director Atom Egoyan's first film set in Britain, based on William Trevor's novel. A naive, pregnant Irish teenager (Elaine Cassidy) flees to the mainland in search of the father. There she befriends Bob Hoskins, a bachelor who pays meticulous attention to culinary matters. Unfortunately, Hoskins is a serial killer with a predilection towards runaway girls. Egoyan casts a veil of menace around suburbia in this deliberately paced film, adeptly creating mood and character. The Prospects Favourable festival reviews and a scene-stealing performance from Hoskins suggest good things. Egoyan's loyal fan base won't be disappointed with this superior serial killer themed two-header. (8 October) 7. Tarzan Stars Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Nigel Hawthorne, Glenn Close The Pitch 'Beauty and the Beastman' The Story This Disney animated version of the Edgar Rice Burroughs classic tale doesn't take the action back to Britain, probably to restrict kiddie-friendly running time. However, the other major plot elements are present. The orphaned hero, brought up by family of gorrillas, finally questions his parentage on meeting a group of ever-so English explorers. A lively and appealing film, with more intimate scenes than most recent Disney cartoons. Fun for all the family, literally. The stand-out scene near the beginning sees the infant in a perilous encounter with a predatory leopard. The Prospects Shades The Lion King in the animal kingdom politics. But thrilling visual effects create an incredibly lifelike background and visceral action sequences. (22 October) 8. The Limey Stars Terence Stamp, Peter Fonda, Lesley Ann Warren The Pitch Out of Sight: Twenty years on The Story Steven Soderbergh's follow-up to Out of Sight deals with a similar theme: career criminal's disenchantment. Old school London villain heads off to LA to discover the truth behind his estranged daughter's death. Once there he finds he's out of touch and no one understands his accent. A disjointed narrative form and occasional witty asides from fringe players boost the enjoyment factor in this stylish and offbeat thriller. Relatively inexpensive, sandwiched between last year's Clooney-Lopez vehicle and next year's Julia Roberts' drama, Erin Brockovich, The Limey sees Soderbergh playfully revisiting the genre. The Prospects A sixtysomething thriller may not prove multiplex filler, but the acting and directing is immaculate. Stamp's handsome, Mount Rushmore features perfectly sum up his character's tale. (12 November) 9. Ratcatcher Stars Bill Eadie, Tommy Flanagan, Mandy Matthews The Pitch Ken Loach meets the New Wave The Story An outstanding success at the Edinburgh Film Festival, Lynne Ramsay's debut is set to be one the arthouse hits of the year. Set in working class Glasgow of the Seventies, it follows a young boy (Bill Eadie) who harbours a terrible secret after being involved in a tragic accident. Ratcatcher is less a coming of age drama than a tale of adolescent disaffection and loneliness. The story is reminiscent of Trauffaut's breakthrough, The 400 Blows and first-timer Ramsay is a talent to watch. The Prospects Likely favourable reviews should help this movie find an appreciative audience, although its uncompromising approach may deter those of a weak disposition. (19 November) 10. Bowfinger Stars Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham The Pitch The Player meets The Three Stooges The Story Films about Hollywood are virtually a genre these days, but this effort written by and co-starring Steve Martin is one of the best. Martin is Bowfinger, a sleazy B-movie producer offered the chance of a big budget movie if he can persuade popular action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to headline. He can't. Undeterred, he decides to film Ramsey surreptitiously. Much hilarity ensues as Bowfinger's inept crew of misfits and chancers work towards their big break. Occasionally acerbic, often warm-hearted and consistently funny. The Prospects Don't be deterred by the leading pair's recent CV; Bowfinger marks a return to form for Murphy and Martin. Recently Murphy has eschewed adult-flavoured comedy for adolescent movies (Dr Dolittle, The Nutty Professor). All should be forgiven after Bowfinger. (22 October) Best of the rest The General's Daughter Director Simon West, Responsible for the Nic Cage action movie Con Air takes on the military with the help of the always bankable John Travolta. The US military extablishment was not at all pleased, refusing inside help. (Released 1 October) Summer of Sam Spike Lee revisits the Son of Sam serial killings of New York City 1977 (touching on some punk in the process). John Leguizamo is the errant playboy Vinny who loses his job and wife in an hysterical city. It offers Lee's first all white cast, but typical idiosyncratic style. (Released 19 November) Drop Dead Gorgeous Ellen Barking, Denise Richards and Kirsty Allen star in a dark comedy in which the mothers and daughters of a small Minnesota town sink to new depths to secure victory in a beauty contest. (Released 17 September) American Pie Four American lads make a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the year. The result is an extreme example of 'gross-out' humour as the boys work their wicked way towards the school prom.

The tanned Tuscan man who stares back at him is reinvigorated for the next great leap forward in what he calls his 'revolution'. He is relaxed - or anyway only mildly ratty - about the attacks on his holiday arrangements. 'This froth comes in and it comes out.' No, he will not be taking the advice to spend his next holiday in Britain. What he does not recognise is the image painted by his critics of a Prime Minister who runs his government like another zealot for improving public services, Benito Mussolini. 'You're either a weak Prime Minister - in which case they'll knock you for that - or if you appear to have a clear sense of direction, and know what you want to do, then you are a quasi-dictator. And all this President Blair rubbish, it's absolute rubbish.' It's also rubbish that he so distrusts his Cabinet that he tries to do all their jobs for them. 'I don't believe you'll find any of them will say they are micro-managed by me. What I do is this. Constantly, I will sit down, for example, with Frank Dobson and say: \"Right, Frank, how are we doing on this? What are the strategic objectives?\" I believe in unremitting focus on the Big Picture.' The Blairite canvas is the ongoing modernisation of Britain, but several components of the kingdom are proving less than tractable to his mission. Northern Ireland, to begin with, where bipartisanship with the Conservatives has broken down in acrimony. Blair denies he is suggesting 'people should not make criticisms of our Northern Ireland policy - that would be absolutely fatuous. Neither do I think what the IRA have done - threatening people out of their homes, the murder of that person - is anything other than totally reprehensible.' But for William Hague to talk about 'betrayal' was 'name-calling' which didn't help the process. 'You can argue that we are doing the right thing or the wrong thing, but we should respect each other's motives. We are all trying to do our best.' Blair fiercely rebukes David Trimble and his Ulster Unionists for demanding the head of Mo Mowlam. 'Mo is not the problem in Northern Ireland. Mo has worked night and day to bring about a solution. I can tell you: nobody has worked harder, nobody has spent more hours, more emotional energy on the problem. She is not the obstacle in getting it solved. I do plead with people to remember how much we have achieved in Northern Ireland, because if they forget it, they'll learn it again if they throw it all away. 'Look at what is happening on the ground. Yes, appalling things are still happening. But you drive through Belfast, and compare it with six or seven years ago. Look at the levels of violence now and compare it with then. There is an immense amount that has been achieved.' Many still expect Mowlam to leave Belfast when he reshuffles his Cabinet. 'I'm not saying she will,' comments Blair guardedly. The name of Peter Mandelson has been linked with the job as it is linked with every potential vacancy in the Cabinet. He has repaid his debt to Geoffrey Robinson and to the building society. Does Blair think Mandelson has repaid his debt to society? 'When and if Peter returns to Government is my decision.' Would he describe his old friend and ally as a man without a stain on his character? 'It's not a question of whether he's a man without a stain on his character. He resigned. He paid the price. And that's that.' Blair's next comments may give further heart to his modernising comrade that the Prime Minister wants to res urrect him from the backbenches. He dismisses the Tory argument that there can be no return for Mandelson, at least until after he has faced the voters of Hartlepool at the next election. 'I've absolutely no intention of letting the Tories decide who goes in the Cabinet.' Nor, he says, will he be deflected by any criticism from Labour MPs. 'The decision is mine, and it will be taken by me, because that's what happens in our country. The Prime Minister takes the decision.' Gordon Brown and John Prescott, both of whom are known to be resistant to seeing Mandelson around the Cabinet table again, have no veto over Blair's decision. He repeats emphatically. 'I will decide.' It is a paradox of this missionary of modernisation that one of the themes that has always most engaged him is the traditional family. He has pledged his Government to reducing the number of teenage pregnancies in Britain, currently the highest in Europe. In the last week there have been two cases of 12-year-old mothers. Blair addresses this issue in his most urgent speaking mode. 'I think it's appalling and it should be a matter of anxiety and concern to anyone who believes in the future of the country.' The practical solutions are 'complex' and he half-confesses that he is struggling for the full answer. He checks off hostels for teenage mothers, parenting helplines and the opportunities provided by the New Deal. None of which, I say, would have made any difference in the case of a 12-year-old who, according to her mother, set out to get pregnant by a 14-year-old boy who could be prosecuted. Should he be? 'That's a matter for the legal authorities,' Blair swerves. 'But I don't think that's the issue. The issue is how you could get to a situation where you have 12-year-old girls becoming pregnant by 14-year-old fathers. That's not in their interests or in the interests of the child. We should be asking: why? That is not the right age to have a child. You've got to make youngsters aware of the undesirability of having sex at the age of 12.' Sex education, though it brings a blush to the face of David Blunkett, is part of the solution. The answer was cer tainly not 'to go back to the old days when sex wasn't talked about - it doesn't mean you revisit a whole series of old prejudices.' What it does mean is this: 'Parents have got to take responsibility for their children. 12-year-old kids should not be on the streets at night.' The prose of legislation may help, but Blair reaches for the poetry of the Big Picture to describe a much larger ambition. 'We need to find a new national moral purpose for this new generation. People want to live in a society that is without prejudice, but is with rules, with a sense of order. Government can play its part, but parents have to play their part. There's got to be, if you like, a partnership between Government and the country to lay the foundations of that moral purpose.' He endeavours to find a link with another of his large ideas. 'If the economic imperative is to develop what we call the knowledge economy, the social imperative is to develop a modern, responsible notion of citizenship.' Everyone assumes Blair will have at least two terms in Government to pursue these designs. Everyone knows the next election is already won for New Labour. Everyone, that is, except Tony Blair. 'You never take it for granted: that's part of our mantra.' Does that explain the strange insecurity of this mammothly powerful Government? 'It's not insecurity,' he insists. 'It is a desire to do it right. No Labour government has ever won a full second term. You are never bound to win. I want to create a Labour Party that is a real alliance for progress and justice for the 21st Century and that requires constant working at. I want to make a real 21st Century model country, which it can be. I tell you, it's amazing how the world is changing, and so quickly, and if you get left behind, you get left behind.' This is quintessential Blair-speak in which nothing is more important than momentum, even if sometimes it is only the momentum of his words. The Prime Minister does reveal some of his plans for making certain of that famous second term. It is safe to assume, from what he said to me, that there will be cuts to income tax. The working fam ilies tax credit, which comes on stream this week, will 'give a huge boost to two million low income families'. Gordon Brown has already cut the basic rate of income tax once and will cut again before the election if Blair has his way. 'We want to achieve for ordinary families as lower a tax burden as possible. No one likes paying tax. Get the fundamentals right, get the public finances sorted out, get the investment we need in the public services, then get the tax cuts.' He is eager to address the discontent of relatively modestly paid people - such as teachers and police officers - who find themselves in the top rate bracket. 'I totally understand that. Absolutely,' he says. 'I want to do something for middle-income families and we'll try to do that.' This suggests New Labour plans to raise the thresholds at which people start paying the 40 per cent rate. He also flags cuts to the basic rate. 'I look at the person earning £15,000, the person earning £20,000, they're people who need to keep more of their own money.' The tax-cutter Blair will be regarded with apprehension by the Tories and meet with antagonism from Labour supporters who think that any surpluses at the Treasury should be spent on improving public services. 'You spend what you need to spend,' replies Blair. 'You invest in the public services to the level you need to, but it is also important that you get people's taxes down if you possibly can. The New Labour way has been to do everything we can to let people keep as much money as they can.' He attempts to smooth over the abrasion caused by his notorious remark that grappling with the public sector had left him with 'scars on my back'. It was 'just a phrase'. He wasn't attacking public sector workers, but 'the system'. Mmm. The system is made up of people. What will happen to those people working in schools or hospitals who didn't or couldn't respond to his demand that they 'change and adapt', modernise or die? 'If people aren't up to the job, they are not up to the job.' He takes teachers as his example. 'The vast majority do a good job, but everyone knows that there are those who don't.' Even when he is trying to sound admiring about public services, Blair can't help expressing it in words which draw an unflattering comparison with what he sees as the dynamism of the private. 'It is far harder to change the way a public service works because it doesn't have the great engine that the market is always creating for change in the private sector. You don't want the health service to be turned into a marketplace, but you've got to look at ways of pioneering change.' He speaks glowingly of the one-stop centre for elective surgery at the Middlesex Hos pital that he opened last week. 'All your problems are taken care of on the one site and you're out again in a far quicker space of time. That is what I mean by putting the customer' (a Freudian slip he hurries to correct) 'er, the patient, first. We've got to drive that revolution right through the health service.' The next big dose of modernisation' will involve more performance-related pay, however much it arouses the hostility of the public sector unions. 'Let's be honest about it, the private sector, in its reward and motivation, has moved on apace. The public sector is still incredibly inflexible.' He concedes there is dis gruntlement within his party, but refuses to compromise with these discontents. Wait, he says, until the Left see the whites of the electorate's eyes. 'As we move into the election, people will see the alternative. The choice is not between the Labour Government you have and Utopia. 'The choice is between the Labour Government you have and a Conservative Government that is more extreme than ever before. You wait till people see that - and they'll be out there.' They should be out there now, selling the minimum wage, increases to child benefit, £100 for every pensioner family. 'We have done more as a Labour Government for, if you like, traditional Labour supporters than any Labour Government there has ever been. But we don't do it by alienating new support, middle-class support.' It is of keen interest - not least to Gordon Brown - how many terms Tony Blair thinks he needs to complete his Project. The answer - sorry, Gordon - is that it appears to be open-ended, ever-rolling into the next millennium. 'When you say: when does the revolution ever stop? I'm not sure the revolution ever stops.' I've now counted at least a dozen uses of the word revolution or its variants in our conversation. There is, however, a limit. He is weekending with the Queen at Balmoral. How, I wonder, does a hereditary monarchy of German extraction fit in with his modernised, meritocratic New Britain? 'Fine. It's better than a President.' Why? 'Because it provides a sense of continuity and tradition.' But aren't we all about modernity? 'We modernise things that need modernising and the monarchy has changed enormously with the times.' Really? How has it changed since the death of Diana? Blair sips at the lager and crunches some nuts, looking for closure on a subject which exposes a contradiction in Blairology. 'The monarchy has evolved and changed and I think it's better than an elected president. That's all I'm prepared to say on this subject. And I want my dinner.' One family of public sector employees is safe from the great revolutionary. Blair on Blair 'You're either a weak Prime Minister - in which case they'll knock you for that - or if you appear to have a clear sense of direction, and know what you want to do, then you are a quasi-dictator. And all this President Blair rubbish, it's just rubbish, absolute rubbish.' On Northern Ireland 'Mo is not the problem in Northern Ireland. Mo has worked night and day to bring about a solution. I can tell you: nobody has worked harder, nobody has spent more hours, more emotional energy on the problem. She is not the obstacle in getting it solved.' On Mandelson 'When and if Peter returns to Government is my decision. He resigned. He paid the price. And that's that.' On teenage sex 'You've got to make youngsters aware of the undesirability of having sex at the age of 12.' On tax 'I also look at the person earning £15,000, the person earning £20,000, they're people who need to keep more of their own money.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/sep/05/politicalnews.observerpolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-05T00:21:08Z","webTitle":"My moral manifesto for the 21st century","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/sep/05/politicalnews.observerpolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/sep/05/politicalnews.observerpolitics","fields":{"headline":"My moral manifesto for the 21st century","bodyText":"Between sips of cold lager and gobbled handfuls of peanuts, Tony Blair describes what he sees in his shaving mirror.

'You can argue that we are doing the right thing or the wrong thing, but we should respect each other's motives. We are all trying to do our best.' Blair fiercely rebukes David Trimble and his Ulster Unionists for demanding the head of Mo Mowlam. 'Mo is not the problem in Northern Ireland. Mo has worked night and day to bring about a solution. I can tell you: nobody has worked harder, nobody has spent more hours, more emotional energy on the problem. She is not the obstacle in getting it solved. I do plead with people to remember how much we have achieved in Northern Ireland, because if they forget it, they'll learn it again if they throw it all away. 'Look at what is happening on the ground. Yes, appalling things are still happening. But you drive through Belfast, and compare it with six or seven years ago. Look at the levels of violence now and compare it with then. There is an immense amount that has been achieved.' Many still expect Mowlam to leave Belfast when he reshuffles his Cabinet. 'I'm not saying she will,' comments Blair guardedly. The name of Peter Mandelson has been linked with the job as it is linked with every potential vacancy in the Cabinet. He has repaid his debt to Geoffrey Robinson and to the building society. Does Blair think Mandelson has repaid his debt to society? 'When and if Peter returns to Government is my decision.' Would he describe his old friend and ally as a man without a stain on his character? 'It's not a question of whether he's a man without a stain on his character. He resigned. He paid the price. And that's that.' Blair's next comments may give further heart to his modernising comrade that the Prime Minister wants to res urrect him from the backbenches. He dismisses the Tory argument that there can be no return for Mandelson, at least until after he has faced the voters of Hartlepool at the next election. 'I've absolutely no intention of letting the Tories decide who goes in the Cabinet.' Nor, he says, will he be deflected by any criticism from Labour MPs. 'The decision is mine, and it will be taken by me, because that's what happens in our country. The Prime Minister takes the decision.' Gordon Brown and John Prescott, both of whom are known to be resistant to seeing Mandelson around the Cabinet table again, have no veto over Blair's decision. He repeats emphatically. 'I will decide.' It is a paradox of this missionary of modernisation that one of the themes that has always most engaged him is the traditional family. He has pledged his Government to reducing the number of teenage pregnancies in Britain, currently the highest in Europe. In the last week there have been two cases of 12-year-old mothers. Blair addresses this issue in his most urgent speaking mode. 'I think it's appalling and it should be a matter of anxiety and concern to anyone who believes in the future of the country.' The practical solutions are 'complex' and he half-confesses that he is struggling for the full answer. He checks off hostels for teenage mothers, parenting helplines and the opportunities provided by the New Deal. None of which, I say, would have made any difference in the case of a 12-year-old who, according to her mother, set out to get pregnant by a 14-year-old boy who could be prosecuted. Should he be? 'That's a matter for the legal authorities,' Blair swerves. 'But I don't think that's the issue. The issue is how you could get to a situation where you have 12-year-old girls becoming pregnant by 14-year-old fathers. That's not in their interests or in the interests of the child. We should be asking: why? That is not the right age to have a child. You've got to make youngsters aware of the undesirability of having sex at the age of 12.' Sex education, though it brings a blush to the face of David Blunkett, is part of the solution. The answer was cer tainly not 'to go back to the old days when sex wasn't talked about - it doesn't mean you revisit a whole series of old prejudices.' What it does mean is this: 'Parents have got to take responsibility for their children. 12-year-old kids should not be on the streets at night.' The prose of legislation may help, but Blair reaches for the poetry of the Big Picture to describe a much larger ambition. 'We need to find a new national moral purpose for this new generation. People want to live in a society that is without prejudice, but is with rules, with a sense of order. Government can play its part, but parents have to play their part. There's got to be, if you like, a partnership between Government and the country to lay the foundations of that moral purpose.' He endeavours to find a link with another of his large ideas. 'If the economic imperative is to develop what we call the knowledge economy, the social imperative is to develop a modern, responsible notion of citizenship.' Everyone assumes Blair will have at least two terms in Government to pursue these designs. Everyone knows the next election is already won for New Labour. Everyone, that is, except Tony Blair. 'You never take it for granted: that's part of our mantra.' Does that explain the strange insecurity of this mammothly powerful Government? 'It's not insecurity,' he insists. 'It is a desire to do it right. No Labour government has ever won a full second term. You are never bound to win. I want to create a Labour Party that is a real alliance for progress and justice for the 21st Century and that requires constant working at. I want to make a real 21st Century model country, which it can be. I tell you, it's amazing how the world is changing, and so quickly, and if you get left behind, you get left behind.' This is quintessential Blair-speak in which nothing is more important than momentum, even if sometimes it is only the momentum of his words. The Prime Minister does reveal some of his plans for making certain of that famous second term. It is safe to assume, from what he said to me, that there will be cuts to income tax. The working fam ilies tax credit, which comes on stream this week, will 'give a huge boost to two million low income families'. Gordon Brown has already cut the basic rate of income tax once and will cut again before the election if Blair has his way. 'We want to achieve for ordinary families as lower a tax burden as possible. No one likes paying tax. Get the fundamentals right, get the public finances sorted out, get the investment we need in the public services, then get the tax cuts.' He is eager to address the discontent of relatively modestly paid people - such as teachers and police officers - who find themselves in the top rate bracket. 'I totally understand that. Absolutely,' he says. 'I want to do something for middle-income families and we'll try to do that.' This suggests New Labour plans to raise the thresholds at which people start paying the 40 per cent rate. He also flags cuts to the basic rate. 'I look at the person earning £15,000, the person earning £20,000, they're people who need to keep more of their own money.' The tax-cutter Blair will be regarded with apprehension by the Tories and meet with antagonism from Labour supporters who think that any surpluses at the Treasury should be spent on improving public services. 'You spend what you need to spend,' replies Blair. 'You invest in the public services to the level you need to, but it is also important that you get people's taxes down if you possibly can. The New Labour way has been to do everything we can to let people keep as much money as they can.' He attempts to smooth over the abrasion caused by his notorious remark that grappling with the public sector had left him with 'scars on my back'. It was 'just a phrase'. He wasn't attacking public sector workers, but 'the system'. Mmm. The system is made up of people. What will happen to those people working in schools or hospitals who didn't or couldn't respond to his demand that they 'change and adapt', modernise or die? 'If people aren't up to the job, they are not up to the job.' He takes teachers as his example. 'The vast majority do a good job, but everyone knows that there are those who don't.' Even when he is trying to sound admiring about public services, Blair can't help expressing it in words which draw an unflattering comparison with what he sees as the dynamism of the private. 'It is far harder to change the way a public service works because it doesn't have the great engine that the market is always creating for change in the private sector. You don't want the health service to be turned into a marketplace, but you've got to look at ways of pioneering change.' He speaks glowingly of the one-stop centre for elective surgery at the Middlesex Hos pital that he opened last week. 'All your problems are taken care of on the one site and you're out again in a far quicker space of time. That is what I mean by putting the customer' (a Freudian slip he hurries to correct) 'er, the patient, first. We've got to drive that revolution right through the health service.' The next big dose of modernisation' will involve more performance-related pay, however much it arouses the hostility of the public sector unions. 'Let's be honest about it, the private sector, in its reward and motivation, has moved on apace. The public sector is still incredibly inflexible.' He concedes there is dis gruntlement within his party, but refuses to compromise with these discontents. Wait, he says, until the Left see the whites of the electorate's eyes. 'As we move into the election, people will see the alternative. The choice is not between the Labour Government you have and Utopia. 'The choice is between the Labour Government you have and a Conservative Government that is more extreme than ever before. You wait till people see that - and they'll be out there.' They should be out there now, selling the minimum wage, increases to child benefit, £100 for every pensioner family. 'We have done more as a Labour Government for, if you like, traditional Labour supporters than any Labour Government there has ever been. But we don't do it by alienating new support, middle-class support.' It is of keen interest - not least to Gordon Brown - how many terms Tony Blair thinks he needs to complete his Project. The answer - sorry, Gordon - is that it appears to be open-ended, ever-rolling into the next millennium. 'When you say: when does the revolution ever stop? I'm not sure the revolution ever stops.' I've now counted at least a dozen uses of the word revolution or its variants in our conversation. There is, however, a limit. He is weekending with the Queen at Balmoral. How, I wonder, does a hereditary monarchy of German extraction fit in with his modernised, meritocratic New Britain? 'Fine. It's better than a President.' Why? 'Because it provides a sense of continuity and tradition.' But aren't we all about modernity? 'We modernise things that need modernising and the monarchy has changed enormously with the times.' Really? How has it changed since the death of Diana? Blair sips at the lager and crunches some nuts, looking for closure on a subject which exposes a contradiction in Blairology. 'The monarchy has evolved and changed and I think it's better than an elected president. That's all I'm prepared to say on this subject. And I want my dinner.' One family of public sector employees is safe from the great revolutionary. Blair on Blair 'You're either a weak Prime Minister - in which case they'll knock you for that - or if you appear to have a clear sense of direction, and know what you want to do, then you are a quasi-dictator. And all this President Blair rubbish, it's just rubbish, absolute rubbish.' On Northern Ireland 'Mo is not the problem in Northern Ireland. Mo has worked night and day to bring about a solution. I can tell you: nobody has worked harder, nobody has spent more hours, more emotional energy on the problem. She is not the obstacle in getting it solved.' On Mandelson 'When and if Peter returns to Government is my decision. He resigned. He paid the price. And that's that.' On teenage sex 'You've got to make youngsters aware of the undesirability of having sex at the age of 12.' On tax 'I also look at the person earning £15,000, the person earning £20,000, they're people who need to keep more of their own money.'"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/sep/06/israel1","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-06T01:00:59Z","webTitle":"Bombs mark Israeli peace deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/06/israel1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/sep/06/israel1","fields":{"headline":"Bombs mark Israeli peace deal","bodyText":"Opponents of the Middle East peace deal detonated two car bombs in northern Israeli cities yesterday, only hours after the prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, signed an agreement to revive the frozen peace process. The first vehicle exploded in Tiberias, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, at about 5:30 pm local time. Less than half an hour later, a second car blew up in the Mediterranean city of Haifa, about 60 miles to the west. The remains of two bodies were found at the site of the mangled blue hatchback in Tiberias, leading Israeli police to conclude that they were probably suicide bombers - the preferred means of attack of militant Palestinian Muslim groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Four Israelis who were passing at the time were injured, one woman critically. Soon afterwards, another car exploded in Haifa. The man inside the car was also presumed to have been sent on a suicide mission to register opposition to the peace deal, sealed on Saturday night in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The explosions came barely an hour after Mr Barak, heralding the revised version of the Wye accord, won almost unanimous approval for the deal in his cabinet. In attacking Tiberias, the bombers had targeted a resort town crowded with end-of-summer holidaymakers. Haifa is a quiet, workaday port city that has usually been spared the terror attacks that have in the past targeted Israelis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Police in Haifa said that preliminary evidence showed that the bombers were working on staging the explosion and accidentally set it off too early, explaining the limited number of Israeli casualties. News of the second bombing unfolded just as the two men who hammered out the peace deal, Israeli lawyer Gilead Sher and Palestinian chief negotiatior Saeb Erekat, were being interviewed on CNN about the auspicious prospects for peace in the coming year. Dr Erekat immediately condemned the attacks. \"I think it is really very unfortunate,\" he said. \"I hope that the enemies of peace will not resort to such activities to subjugate the peace process. We are going to continue. It is time to heal and it is time to move forward.\" But Mr Sher said he could not foresee Israel continuing implementation of the land-for-security deal under a cloud of violence. \"If we have terrorism [and] no personal security, no peace process shall prevail over the security of the people of Israel.\" Israeli intelligence officials said they had had leads earlier yesterday that Hamas had been planning attacks to try to scuttle the new burst of momentum towards Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation. The spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, denounced the new accord over the weekend and said that Palestinians would continue the armed struggle against Israeli occupation. If responsible for the attacks, Hamas may risk a widespread security clampdown. The offices of Hamas were closed in Jordan last week and several of its representatives there were arrested in an unprecedented move by the Hashemite kingdom. The military wing of Hamas in the West Bank and Gaza sometimes receive orders, information and financial support from the Jordanian offices. Also last week, two Israeli hikers were found murdered in Megiddo in northern Israel. Hamas claimed responsibility for the attack, but the main suspect - who re-enacted the crime for the police - has turned out to be an Israeli Arab and not a resident of the Palestinian territories. Israeli officials had said that the first handover of land, totalling 7% of the West Bank, was to be transferred to Palestinian civil control within a week, and the first of two prisoner releases were to begin next weekend. It is not clear whether the attacks could lead Mr Barak to postpone the scheduled peace moves. Mr Barak later convened his security cabinet for an emergency session to discuss the attacks."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/sep/10/northernireland.audreygillan","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-10T01:02:42Z","webTitle":"Renamed force must abandon old loyalties","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/10/northernireland.audreygillan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/sep/10/northernireland.audreygillan","fields":{"headline":"Renamed force must abandon old loyalties","bodyText":"Chris Patten's radical overhaul of the 77-year-old Royal Ulster Constabulary will see it renamed the Northern Ireland Police Service if the 175 recommendations in his report are implemented in full. The blueprint for the future of the province's force advises that it should adopt a new badge and symbols which are entirely free from any association with either the British or Irish states. It says that the union flag should no longer be flown from police buildings. The colour of the police uniform could be retained but it should be in a \"new, more practical style\". The report says the RUC, which the commission criticises as militaristic and hierarchical compared to other police forces, has, as a result of the security threat and in order to protect itself from attack, resorted to methods of policing that have separated its officers from the community. Because of this, the RUC has been \"slow to move towards the culture of customer service, public consultation and openness, problem-solving community based policing and devolved management that many other police services are now well into the process of developing.\" The commission, which was set up in June 1998, recognises that the proposed changes cannot be introduced all at once, but says the recommendations are interlinked. \"Together they amount to a transformed police service in Northern Ireland, to the new beginning called for in the [Good Friday] agreement and to the sort of police service which we believe most people want - open, accessible, responsive to local needs, effective and efficient ... the full transformation of policing envisaged in this report will be possible only with active community support and with a continuing commitment to peace.\" The commission says it is essential that the force - currently 92% Protestant - be \"representative of the society it polices. Since 1922 and the establishment of the Royal Ulster Constabulary the composition of the police has been disproportionately Protestant and Unionist. This has become much more pronounced during the last 30 violent years ... Both in the past, when the police were subject to political control by the Unionist government at Stormont, and more recently in the period of direct rule from Westminster, they have been identified by one section of the population not primarily as upholders of the law but as defenders of the state, and the nature of the state itself has remained the central issue of political argument. \"This identification of police and state is contrary to policing practice in the rest of the United Kingdom. It has left the police in an unenviable position, lamented by many police officers. In one political language they are custodians of nationhood. In its rhetorical opposite they are symbols of oppression. Policing therefore goes right to the heart of the sense of security and identity of both communities and, because of the differences between them, this seriously hampers the effectiveness of the police service in Northern Ireland.\" The authors say that violence has increased intolerance. It says: \"Policing cannot be fully effective when the police have to operate from fortified stations in armoured vehicles, and when police officers dare not tell their children what they do for a living for fear of attack from extremists from both sides.\" As part of this \"new beginning\", policing should be seen as a matter for the whole community and not something that the community leaves the police to do. The report says that the new type of community policing would have implications for \"the structure of the police which should become more open and delegated; and for the manner of policing down to beat level, which should become more orientated towards active problem solving and crime prevention, rather than more traditional, reactive enforcement\". It says: \"It is our strong view that peace and decency on the streets and in the villages of Northern Ireland can only be achieved on those streets and in those villages. It will take time and it will not be easy. It is the right way, the only way, to make certain that the rule of law, not the rule of the gun and the baseball bat, prevails in every community. A sustained commitment to community policing, the creation of a police service not a police force, has implications for every aspect of the work of the police\". Community policing would be impossible, however, if the composition of the police service bore little relationship to the composition of the community as a whole. The report makes recommendations under the following headings: Human rights The commission found that the RUC's human rights training lagged behind other forces. It suggests that all new and existing officers take an oath expressing an explicit commitment to upholding human rights. The report recommends a code of ethics, integrating the European convention on human rights into police practice and suggests that all officers be trained in the fundamental principles of human rights. It also advises the appointment of a lawyer with specific expertise in the field of human rights be appointed to the staff of the police legal services and says that performance in relation to human rights should be monitored by the policing board. Accountability The commission criticises the fact that the police authority in Northern Ireland does not, unlike forces in the UK, meet in public. It says: \"There needs to be a culture of openness and transparency in a police service as a whole.\" The report recommends the creation of a new policing board, replacing the current policing authority, its statutory function being to hold the chief constable and the police service to public account. The board should monitor police performance, watch crime trends and patterns and police performance in public order situations. It should also work in close coordination with other agencies. The report suggests that the board should appoint all chief officers and should have the power to call for the retirement of the chief constable. The board should have 19 members, 10 of whom should be assembly members drawn from the parties that comprise the new Northern Ireland executive. This means that Sinn Fein will have two representatives deciding policing strategy for the first time. Ministers in the new Stormont executive will be excluded from sitting on the board, which will replace the present Northern Ireland police authority, which was rejected by Sinn Fein in the past as ineffective. After the 11 members are appointed, nine independent members should then be selected from a range of different fields. Appointed for four years by the secretary of state, they will probe and scrutinise different area of police performance, from management of resources to the safeguarding of human rights. It should meet, in public, once a month. Policing with the community The commissioners found that there was an absence of community policing in many parts of Northern Ireland. They suggest that neighbourhood policing should be the core of police work and the structure of the police service should be organised accordingly. The report concludes that officers should have their names clearly displayed on their uniforms and, where practicable, should patrol on foot. Policing in a peaceful society Police stations built from now on should have, so far as possible, the appearance of ordinary buildings; they should have low perimeter walls, and be clearly visible from the street; but they should have security features which may be activated or reinforced as necessary. Existing police station should be made less forbidding and more accessible to public callers. The report recommends that armoured Land Rovers should continue to be substituted with patrol cars and that they be kept in reserve for public order policing. It says there is no reason that the Land Rovers should look as forbidding as they do. Three holding centres at Castlereagh, Gough barracks and Strand Road should be closed and all suspects held in police custody suites. Records of stops and searches should be made and interviews in police custody suites be videoed. Public order policing In the 30 years of the troubles, 302 police officers have lost their lives in 30 years, and about 8,500 have been wounded and disabled. The commission wishes the force to move towards becoming unarmed. It recommends that only a small number of specially-trained officers should be allowed to use plastic bullets and that their use should require the authorisation of a district commander. It suggests a substantial and immediate investment to find an acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternative. Officers should also be equipped with a broader range of public order equipment. Structure The commission recommends reorganisation of the command structure of the RUC, including a slimmer structure at police headquarters with only one deputy chief constable, the number of assistant chief officers reduced from 12 to six and the rank of chief superintendent phased out. It suggests that special branch and crime branch be brought together under a single assistant chief constable and that the future police service should not include a full-time reserve and be replaced with an enlarged, part-time reserve. Size of the police service The commission suggests that if the peace holds, police numbers should be substantially reduced. There are currently 13,000 RUC officers - made up from a regular force of 8,500 and a full-time reserve of 2,900 and a part-time reserve of 1,300. Comparing these figures with an area the same size in the UK, the province should have only 4,300 officers but the report suggests that the number remain at 7,500 full-time officers, provided the peace process does not collapse. Composition and recruitment Only about 8% of the RUC's officers are Catholic, while more than 40% of the country's population is Catholic. The report recommends that all community leaders should take steps to remove discouragement to members of their community to apply to join the police. It recommends that the Gaelic Athletic Association repeal its rule 21, which prohibits members of the police in Northern Ireland from being members of the association. After passing merit tests, an equal number of Protestants and Catholics should be drawn from a pool. Young people should not be disqualified for relatively minor criminal offences. All officers should be required to register their interests and associations. Catholic officers in other areas should be contacted and encouraged to apply for jobs in Northern Ireland. Culture, ethos and symbols The Royal Ulster Constabulary should not be disbanded but renamed the Northern Ireland Police Service. It should adopt a new badge and symbols which are entirely free from any association with either British or Irish states. The union flag should no longer be flown from police buildings. When a flag is flown it should be free from associations with either state. The colour of the uniform should be maintained but its style should be modernised. Memorials to fallen officers should remain in place."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/sep/10/16","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-10T01:02:53Z","webTitle":"Vickers joins charge of light armoured vehicle brigade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/sep/10/16","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/sep/10/16","fields":{"headline":"Vickers joins charge of light armoured vehicle brigade","bodyText":"Vickers, the marine engineering and defence group, yesterday moved into the fast-growing £8bn light armoured vehicles market after announcing a shake-up of its defence division and a series of acquisitions. Analysts welcomed the deals, saying that it would reduce Vickers' dependency on the more static market for battle tanks, an area which has traditionally formed its core business. VDS, the company's defence division, is to pay South African conglomerate Reunert up to £11.6m for Reumech, which makes big-wheeled defence vehicles. Chief executive Paul Buysse said the acquisition gave Vickers \"a rapid and cost effective entry into this valuable new market sector\". He said the global market for light armoured vehicles is poised to grow by about 10% per year over the next decade and Mr Buysse also announced plans for a joint-venture with Mowag Motorwagenfabrik AG of Switzerland to develop light armoured vehicles and also market the Piranha IV and Eagle II family of vehicles in the United Kingdom. In further deals, Vickers announced an agreement with Singapore Technologies Automotive to develop jointly the Bionix light tracker armoured vehicle family for European markets. It also unveiled a contract with Krauss Maffei Wegmann of Germany to market a four wheel drive armoured personnel carrier APCV2 in the UK. The final deal saw Vickers set up a joint venture company with Adval Group to provide training services to the international and UK defence markets. Analysts said Vickers' decision to enter new markets was particularly pleasing in view of the winding down of Challenger II tank deliveries in 2000 which have tended to form the core of the company's business. \"These deals give VDS a very good foothold across the light armoured vehicles market,\" one analyst said yesterday. He added that the moves had also increased Vickers sales and marketing reach and the number of its potential partners \"at little expense to themselves\". Vickers said there is likely to be further consolidation in the land defence business and the company was continuing to talk with other parties about ways of rationalising the industry. Vickers shares, which have performed strongly over the last six months rising 25%, closed unchanged at 183p."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/1999/sep/10/4","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-10T15:01:00Z","webTitle":"Banderas makes directorial debut at Venice","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/sep/10/4","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/sep/10/4","fields":{"headline":"Banderas makes directorial debut at Venice","bodyText":"Antonio Banderas made his directorial debut yesterday at the Venice film festival with Crazy in Alabama, but said he had no plans to give up acting. The film stars his wife Melanie Griffith as an abused southern belle housewife who murders her husband and hightails it to Hollywood to become a star. \"I felt the need to take the reins myself,'' he said after 52 films as an actor. \"When you go onto the set and start questioning the director, that's the time for you to take the risk and do it yourself.'' Banderas said he had fallen in love with the novel on which Crazy in Alabama is based, and knew he \"just had to jump ahead and do it.\" The story, set in 1965 against a backdrop of racial tension, deals with the search for liberty. \"At the end of this millennium, we are living with racism, nationalism and abuse all around the world,\" Banderas said. \"So I think the issues I had in my hands were timeless.'' Early critical response is good. Variety reckoned the film was \"a creditable directorial debut\". \"The picture leaves a much better impression at the end than it does in the first few reels,\" the review continues, \"and it's to []Banderas' credit that the initial tonal problems are eventually ironed out. The director has assembled some good thesps and handles them well; there are also signs that he is alert to visual considerations. The impression we get is that of a potentially talented filmmaker just getting his feet wet.\" Banderas already has plans for his second movie, and is close to securing the rights to the novel Malaga is Burning, which recounts the Spanish Civil War period through the eyes of the American wife of writer Gerald Brenan. Destroy the real Phantom Menace For those who didn't like The Phantom Menace, Producer Rick McCallum promises an opportunity to blast Jar Jar Blinks into oblivion in the interactive Star Wars DVD project. McCallum said that the DVD may contain a \"silent version\" of the film (which kills all bad dialogue) and a \"blue screen version\" (which leaves only human actors - which may be zero by Episode III). \"We're really struggling with what is going to be the most interesting thing for people, because the great idea of the DVD format is that you've got so much opportunity to express yourself and show the process for those people who want it. It's a fantastic format,\" he said. Lucas has different plans for the DVD. \"He wants to show the process of how creatively you come to grips with the compromises you make when you make a movie,\" said McCallum. \"what it's like to write something, try and build it, and the compromises you make because of money and schedule and technology, and then the final product. So you're going to be able to see that on DVD,\" he revealed. Meanwhile the Star Wars rumour mill grinds on unabated. McCallum has scotched early rumours that Leonardo DiCaprio will appear in Episode II. Leo did indeed visit the set of Episode One but, said McCallum, this was just to see the movie. \"I knew he was a big Star Wars fan,\" said McCallum. \"He was very anxious to see Episode One in one of the best surroundings...\" Which must surely mean a bored looking Ewan McGregor, plenty of blue screens and slavish adherence to computer technology. A little like the DVD in fact. Love Affleck-tion Taking a leaf out of Groucho Marx's book, who said he would be a member of no club that would have him, Ben Affleck says he is currently single \"because I wouldn't want to be with anybody right now who would be willing to be with me.\" In an interview with Vanity Fair Affleck takes the opportunity to deny the rumours that he and Matt Damon are lovers. \"I like to think that if I were gay I would be out, Rupert Everett-style,\" says Affleck. One man not short on his love energy is Michael Douglas. Unable to spend a day apart from current sweetheart and fiancee Catherine Zeta Jones, Douglas has dropped out of Mandalay Pictures' The Score to find a project that he and Zeta Jones can do together.

The overhaul follows accusations that trainee nurses were not getting enough first-hand experience since the introduction of the Project 2000 training system 10 years ago and its subsequent move into the universities. The shake-up also aims to stall the move towards a graduate profession, enabling people with vocational qualifications and relevant health care experience to enter training. The changes have been accepted by the United Kingdom Central Council for nursing, midwifery and health visiting (UKCC), the profession's statutory body, and moves to implement them are under way. But ministers may feel they do not go far enough. The department of health said: \"We will be responding to the UKCC shortly and look forward to working with all the key stakeholders to deliver change to nurse education.\" The changes are set out in a report by an education commission established by the UKCC under chairman Sir Len Peach, a former NHS personnel director. The commission took evidence from 450 organisations and surveyed 84,000 nursing staff and students. Endorsing the underlying approach of Project 2000, Sir Len said: \"None of the evidence pointed to a return to the old style of training.\" There were, however, shortcomings in the new system. \"By re-emphasising the value of practice-based education within modern, university settings, and reorganising the nature of its delivery, the commission believes it has struck the right balance.\" The main changes include shortening the initial foundation programme for students from 18 months to 12, thereby lengthening to two years the further period of more specialised training. Practical work should be introduced earlier, says the report, with longer clinical placements. At the end of training, NHS staff would then decide whether students were fit to practise. Sue Norman, UKCC chief executive, said the idea was to reaffirm that 50% of the three-year training had to be practical, as originally envisaged in Project 2000. \"It's not so much that the recipe was wrong, but rather that things happened to weaken that 50% practice requirement,\" Ms Norman said. The thrust of the shake-up follows the principles set out earlier this year in the government's nursing strategy, Making a Difference. But ministers may want to force through more radical change. A health department spokesman said: \"We hope that the commission's report will help us build on the proposals we made in Making a Difference.\" • Pay rises for nurses, doctors and therapists next year should be \"affordable and realistic\", the government said yesterday in submissions to the professions' pay review bodies. Recruitment of nurses was \"tight but getting better\", the health department said. Fewer than 3% of vacancies for qualified nurses and midwives had been unfilled for more than three months - the official definition of a problem vacancy. In all, however, there are more than 15,000 vacancies for qualified staff in England and 85% of hospital trusts report recruitment difficulties."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/sep/12/nelsonmandela.theobserver","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-12T01:46:46Z","webTitle":"Nelson Mandela's long walk to freedom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/sep/12/nelsonmandela.theobserver","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/sep/12/nelsonmandela.theobserver","fields":{"headline":"Nelson Mandela's long walk to freedom","bodyText":"It was the biggest story the South African Broadcasting Corporation had ever had. The apartheid government had given it exclusive rights to broadcast the pictures of the release of the most famous political prisoner in the world. But it was under strict instructions not to 'glorify' the release: the African National Congress was still banned at this time and its members - of which Mandela was the most famous - could not be quoted. 'We filled the airtime with nonsense,' admits the then SABC political editor Andre LeRoux, who produced the broadcast and was responsible for the pictures seen worldwide. 'We waffled about the weather and talked about how long 27 years was. The top management at the SABC were very jittery about the impact the release would have on the national psyche - by that, they meant the white psyche. As a result, we had to keep the thing going without talking too much about what was actually happening. 'But on the ground, it was chaos. We should have been talking to the people at the prison gates about their feelings but, as the producer, I was prohibited from doing so by the SABC stance at the time. The release was not to be glorified.' The SABC broadcast began at 1pm and it was expected that Mandela would be released at 1.15pm. But presenter Clarence Keyter and a worldwide audience waited and waited. LeRoux didn't want to go back to the studio or cut to other programming for fear of missing the live moment but, at the same time, the reporters were too frightened to say anything that the authorities would not like. Instead, LeRoux telephoned the prison authorities. It was just after 3pm. He asked a prison official to ask Mandela, who was to have driven down a long path and out through the gates of Victor Verster, to stop the car short and allow the SABC cameras to capture his final steps to freedom. With 150 yards to go the car pulled up. Mandela and wife Winnie jumped out and walked toward the prison gates and one of the most important television images of the late 20th century was born. 'We were all in awe of the moment,' says LeRoux, 'to be there, to see this man was indescribable. It has become an infamous broadcast moment.' In the UK and across other parts of the world, television schedules were cleared to wait for the first public sight of Mandela in 27 years.

It is not a trusted market,\" she said. Her comments came alongside unconfirmed reports in the United States suggesting that illicit Russian funds were channelled through at least 20 accounts at the City branch of the Bank of New York. Both British and US investigators are probing alleged money-laundering through the bank totalling more than $10bn. Speaking at Cambridge university during an international symposium on economic crime, Mrs Wright warned: \"Secrecy surrounding transactions, secrecy in banking arrangements and the fraud that feeds on both constitute a threat to the reputation of the United Kingdom as an honest, trustworthy market where you can safely do business.\" She quoted the City solicitor and member of the square mile's promotion panel, Jeremy Carver, who, she said, stated recently that \"in the US there was a view that London had become the money-laundering capital of the world\". The Russian funds were reportedly fed into the London accounts and then allegedly transferred to various offshore banks in the Isle of Man and Antigua, according to a report yesterday in USA Today. Separately, bank accounts in Cyprus are also understood to be under suspicion. More than 3,500 pages of records from the Bank of New York allegedly show that \"several billions\" of dollars were removed from Russia just days after a $4.8bn loan from the International Monetary Fund was made last July. The Bank of New York yesterday declined to comment on the allegations. The USA Today report links the capital flight to inside information about the government's plans to devalue the currency at about the same time as the loan was made. Tom Dawson, the director of external relations for the IMF, said yesterday that the fund had \"every indication that its loan was used for permissible purposes\". He downplayed the importance of an internal IMF memo which has fuelled the story by saying that the $4.8bn loan had originally been made to help the Russian government shore up the rouble because of capital flight. Therefore, any concerns about such flight were natural and not connected to any suspected disappearance of funds. In Cambridge, Mrs Wright - whose agency is not currently involved in the Bank of New York investigation - referred to the investigation, and said that better cooperation among law-enforcement bodies around the world \"will help to stamp out the villains\". She backed controversial suggestions from the Home Office for \"civil forfeiture\" - seizing the wealth of people thought to be criminals but unconvicted of any crime - and called for those who laundered criminal funds, including bankers, financiers, solicitors and accountants, to \"suffer financial loss at least to the same amount of the proceeds of crime that they have laundered as well as any other penalties that may be inflicted by the criminal court. Confiscation would be a greater deterrent in their cases than many other measures.\" She warned: \"London's huge financial markets are not surprisingly a magnet for the launderer; $1000bn a day is exchanged in the foreign currency markets and the sheer volume of transactions makes it impossible to check every single one.\" The SFO director was outspoken in her criticism of financial centres that use banking confidentiality laws to block inquiries from foreign investigators, singling out Liechtenstein, where \"there are no fewer than 17 avenues of appeal the account holder can use to delay access to his bank account or details of his secret trust\"."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/sep/15/ewenmacaskill","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-15T01:27:01Z","webTitle":"MI6 must explain itself, says Rifkind","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/15/ewenmacaskill","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/sep/15/ewenmacaskill","fields":{"headline":"MI6 must explain itself, says Rifkind","bodyText":"The former Tory foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, expressed bafflement yesterday at the failure of MI6 to inform ministers about Melita Norwood, the Soviet spy. Explaining in detail for the first time his own role in the extraordinary saga, he said that as foreign secretary he would not have expected to have been told but that the then home secretary, Michael Howard, the attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, and possibly the prime minister, John Major, should have been. Mr Rifkind gave the go-ahead in 1996 to publish the material brought to Britain by the defecting KGB archivist, Vasili Mitrokhin, but insisted that MI6 had not drawn his attention to the revelations about Mrs Norwood. He shared the concern that MI5 had unilaterally taken the decision not to prosecute Mrs Norwood rather than consult ministers. The onus was now on MI6 and MI5 to provide a satisfactory explanation of their actions. He said yesterday: \"If they can provide a convincing explanation, a satisfactory one, then clearly there will be no need for concern. But the onus will have to be on them to provide that explanation because... if information is obtained by anyone that points to the identity of a Soviet spy who operated in the United Kingdom, that is information that, on the face of it, should have been made available to the relevant ministers.\" Mr Major, Mr Howard and Sir Nicholas appear not to have been told. Although the interest has been in Mrs Norwood, the bulk of the material brought in by Mr Mitrokhin - six trunks full - was not about individuals but about KGB policy in broad terms since 1917, he said. \"It was that breadth of information which explains why it took four years between 1992 and 1996 for the information to be analysed and scrutinised and it was at the end of that stage, the analysis having been completed, [that] the recommendation came to me as foreign secretary that... a lot of this material, there was no reason for it to be kept classified or confidential.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/sep/15/ruralaffairs.countrydiary","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-15T01:27:16Z","webTitle":"Puffin parade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/15/ruralaffairs.countrydiary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/sep/15/ruralaffairs.countrydiary","fields":{"headline":"Puffin parade","bodyText":"Lundy The blue sky reflects in Pondbury, a pool in the midst of the kingdom of Heaven, the surrounding sea - a butterfly-wing blue. Owned by the Heaven family in the last century, Lundy used to be a mere blurry landmark, its distinctive outline visible from Cornwall's north coast and Bodmin Moor on clear days only. Today's trip, in perfect late-summer weather, has changed that perception and in future we will strain our eyes from the top of Kilmar Tor and Beeny Cliff, aware of the island's landscape. This morning we walked into Clovelly between red fuchsias, past picturesque cottages and flowery gardens, descending cobbled paths towards the sparkling sea. A clinker-built tender took us off the lowest slippery steps, around the jetty, away from the north-facing bouldery shore to MS Oldenburg. Heading northwest through rolling swell, passengers' shadows reflected on the bow-wave as we looked over the port beam towards receding wooded cliffs, hanging valleys and Hartland Point. One and a half hours later, we disembarked on the new jetty, alongside turquoise water lapping the old landing beach, protected from rough white water by Rat Island and jagged, shaley rocks. An engineered track cuts across stablised landslips, up towards wind-blasted oak and sycamore around Millcoombe and its derelict walled gardens.

St Helena's isolated church tower is dwarfed by the Old Lighthouse, its lantern 567ft above sea level, towering above the 4th-century cemetery. Superseded by north and south lights in 1896, the adjoining keeper's quarters, like most other houses, now provide holiday accommodation. Old Quarter, Halfway and Threequarter walls dissect the heathery plateau, running east from vertiginous, craggy cliffs. We return south along the lighthouse keeper's way, edged with granite blocks, once essential markers in fog. The boat leaves for Bideford at 4.30pm.

Not the two green mohicans bouncing to the sound of Blink 182. The hottest group in skate punk open with a barrage of obscenities set to a fuzz-guitar assault that lasts just 30 seconds, and their fans fling themselves into a maelstrom of bodies. It's like a bouncy castle for grown-ups. The tight set that follows is full of short, cheerful bursts of energy. Imagine Nirvana jamming with the Undertones at an under-18s disco, and you're halfway there. \"What's up, United Kingdom?\" asks bassist Mark \"Fish Guts\" Hoppus. \"I remember a couple of hundred years ago you started a war with us which was fucked,\" adds guitarist Tom \"Hot Pants\" DeLonge, in a futile attempt to wind up the audience . But this fresh-faced threesome are more naughty than nasty. \"I'm gonna have sex tonight,\" announces Fish Guts, who's taken his shirt off, perhaps in anticipation. Blink 182, whose album Enema of the State has already gone platinum in America, are young, dumb and full of three-minute come, but when they get the punk power-pop thing right, as on Dumpweed, where the chiming guitars of the verse give way to a double-speed pile-up of a chorus, they're impressive. The only downside is a lack of the kind of memorable hooks that characterise forthcoming single What's My Age Again? With its powerchord chorus, instant melody, and tales of dating failure, this is already all over Radio 1 and shaping up for a chart entry. It's more than 20 years since the Sex Pistols burst onto the scene, and we don't shock so easily these days. Punk now seems more amusing than threatening.

I guess as purveyors of the hip-hop culture it allows us to actually have 85% of it exposed instead of the 15% that's subject to the politics of the normal areas of music. It eradicates the dominance of the middle man over the public and also over the artist. Hence your advocacy of MP3? As I said, downloadable music eradicates the dominance of the middle man - it doesn't take them out completely. Everybody's trying to figure out how they fit into the new scene but this will force the people who were totally dominating to adapt and it will force people who previously dominated to share. How did you first get into computers? It was suggested to me in 1991 by Harry Allen, a publicist, and in the 1994 Muse Sick In Our Mess-Age album, track 20 explains the whole thing I'm doing now five years before its time. What kind of computer do you use? I'm a Mac man. My pet personal tool and toy is my G3 Mac Powerbook. Any favourite software? Adobe Photoshop because I design album covers. At the same time, other software that goes through my Powerbook is the musical streaming stuff like the Real Network. What kind of websites do you visit? Other than the ones I work with like www.bringthenoise.com , which is our radio network, and the www.publicenemy.com there's stuff like www.rapstation.com. Other ones I deal with could be anything from hiphopsite.com to any of the entertainment sites. Do you think information is any more free in the computer age? The ability to spread information is also matched by the ability to spread disinformation. Do you think the net will, or can, be regulated? It might be more difficult to regulate the internet, without all governments agreeing to one accord, than anything else that's ever been invented. But as soon as you think the government won't control there's always something else that surprises you - I feel that now is an important time to build your stake in your own private Idaho. The new album is very millennium-conscious. Have you any thoughts or fears about Y2K? It's the small things in smaller countries that will prove more catastrophic than in \"civilised\" countries like the USA and the United Kingdom. Grassroots countries probably won't even be affected as much as those countries stuck in the middle. Any favourite gadgets? No. I don't play video games or any stuff like that. I do carry my lap-top, I carry my suitcase radio with two CDs, a condenser microphone, a mixing board and two small speakers.

One person's car was swept off the road by floodwaters and 40,000 are in shelters. The storm, diminished in strength but still packing winds of up to 110mph, pounded the US coast at Cape Fear, North Carolina, with heavy rains. Floyd, at one point three times bigger than the costliest hurricane in US history, is expected to weaken significantly by the time it reaches New York city late this evening. It has already created massive disruption in a wide swathe of the US. More than 2.6m people left their homes in coastal areas from Florida to South Carolina as Floyd shut down Florida's tourism industry, including Walt Disney's Animal Kingdom, Magic Kingdom, Disney MGM Studios and Epcot. Georgia and South Carolina officials also issued evacuation orders and Virginia's governor declared a state of emergency. \"These states are now engaged in the largest peacetime evacuation in our history,'' President Bill Clinton said during a stopover in Hawaii on his flight home from a state visit to New Zealand. \"We will continue to take extraordinary measures to protect lives and property.\" Ron Goodman of the national hurricane centre said Floyd, which had weakened from its earlier maximum sustained wind speeds of 155mph, made landfall around 3.00am eastern daylight time. \"It's accelerating up the eastern seaboard, but it's not the same storm it was three days ago,'' said Mr Goodman, who expects Floyd to weaken from category two to category one status, classified by winds of between 75 and 95 miles per hour. Floyd continues to move north-northeast at 22 miles per hour. Its leading edge was battering coastal towns and knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes. The storm, which started as a category four hurricane, was downgraded to a category two when winds slowed to 110. Heavy rains caused surge flooding of between 7ft and 11ft, while flooding is expected at the heads of bays, estuaries and rivers. Isolated tornadoes are possible in eastern North Carolina and Virginia, the hurricane centre said. US Marines evacuated 7,000 recruits from its Parris Island, South Carolina, boot camp, joining businesses and residents clearing out of the path of the hurricane. As Floyd hit the coast, rains of up to 13in fell and tornadoes were reported in several counties. ''The biggest thing we're seeing is a lot of flooding,'' said North Carolina emergency response spokesman Mark Van Sciver. ''Sections of Interstate 95, which runs all the way down to Florida, are under almost waist-deep water.'' Floyd could cost insurers $4-$10bn and \"losses up to $12bn,\" said analysts. That would leave Floyd's effect short of the $15.5bn in insured losses caused by Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida in 1992. Andrew caused 65 deaths and $26.5bn in damage, making it the most expensive storm in American history. This time, Florida escaped with relatively light damage, though power is out for almost 235,000 customers along the central coastline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/sep/17/features11.g23","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-17T00:25:05Z","webTitle":"Specialities of the House","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/sep/17/features11.g23","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/sep/17/features11.g23","fields":{"headline":"Specialities of the House","bodyText":"\"If this stays the same until winter there could be trouble,\" the Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Robert Brown declared earlier this week. \"Politicians will be bringing their own packets of porridge to the canteen and even resorting to, dare I say it, the microwaveable variety.\" So ran the Scottish parliament's porridge campaign, a cross-party affair begun by the SNP which members of the assembly intend will make porridge a fixture on the breakfast menu at the parliament's temporary home off the Royal Mile. The campaign has thrust the whole question of our legislators' food into the daylight, begging such questions as: has devolution to Cardiff and Edinburgh changed parliamentarians' dietary habits? Do they eat differently there? Can Westminster at last compete with the north European fare offered by Brussels and Strasbourg? Most weekday mornings, MPs, Commons clerks, workmen, policemen and media early-birds can be seen crossing Westminster, heading for one of the best \"cholesterol special\" breakfasts in the capital - at the refurbished Strangers' Cafeteria overlooking the Thames, or at the police canteen (Plod's) off Westminster Hall. Of course, not everyone opts for sausage, bacon, eggs, tomatoes, beans, black pudding and hash browns. Healthy food options like grapefruit and muesli, croissants and multi-flavoured yoghurts are now present. Some 10,000 people work regularly in the Victorian Palace of Westminster, often from dawn to long after dusk. The place is like an ocean liner and there are two dozen points of sale for food and drink of all sorts - much of it subsidised to keep the Mother of Parliaments ticking over during highly irregular hours. A £25m kitchen refurbishment is close to completion. The options range from the grandeur of the Members Dining Room and the Peers Grill Room (the one without the long mess table) to the highly democratic Sports and Social Club - probably the jolliest - and the Press Gallery Bar where the takings per capita remain impressive in these health-conscious times. In Scotland, Des McNulty, the Labour MSP for Clydebank and Milngavie, who sits on the Edinburgh parliament's presiding corporate body, says that the new arrangements are definitely superior to Westminster, with more healthy food, lots of customised sandwiches, even yoghurt. The Scottish parliament's temporary home is healthier for an accidental reason, too: being located in the assembly hall of the Church of Scotland below Edinburgh Castle, it is alcohol-free. But Edinburgh's Royal Mile is awash with bars, cafes and restaurants, and in that respect it is much luckier than Westminster: apart from a few uninspiring tourist cafes, middling pubs and plush lobbyists' restaurants, the area is a foodie's black hole. Cardiff's temporary home in Crickhowell House on Cardiff Bay, which middle-aged Welsh politicians share with the youthful staff of the Welsh Health Common Services Authority, gets a bad press by comparison. \"It's worse than Westminster, actually,\" says Rhodri Morgan. The veteran MP and novice Welsh Assembly Member speaks bitterly of cheese sandwiches which do not taste of cheese and are sprinkled with salt. Things may improve when Richard Rogers' new building is completed, since he is expected to design everything down to the sandwiches. Meanwhile, Cardiff and Edinburgh can unite behind one progressive development in common. Whereas Westminster has an elaborate eating and drink ing hierarchy, in Cardiff and Edinburgh the cafes are open to everyone, elected, appointed or invited. Morgan rightly defends the reforms made at Westminster's table in recent years, partly health-driven and partly the impact of women MPs. Ciabatta bread, mozarella, even unpressed grapes are all available in the legendary Members' Cafeteria, though bacon sarnies piled with beans (baked, not green) remain more popular - it is classic comfort food for late-night legislating. Upmarket comfort food is still available, too, in the shape of the public school and clubland equivalents of bacon and beans, the delicious roasts made from BSE-free beef. There is game in season, decent clarets, sticky puddings worthy of Nicholas Soames's personal attention. It is still rather too male (satellite football in the Strangers Bar) for many women MPs, and mushy peas remain an all-party favourite. But MPs have tried to move with the times. Really. Menus boast tiny hearts printed next to low-fat offerings and tiny ticks to denote vegetarian, advances unimaginable 15 years ago. There is even a gym, where Paddy Ashdown has pumped more iron than the Ruhr Valley. Does Strasbourg or Brussels, between which the European Parliament trundles up and down the Rhineland Middle Kingdom, do better? They are both foodies' paradises, gastronomic cities, with hundreds and hundreds of restaurants. Brussels boasts a cafeteria and a sit-down restaurant with relatively cheap steaks, oceans of frites and lashings of sauces. The Strasbourg parliament has plush French cuisine and very good regional Alsatian cooking. As every good European knows white wine is non-alcoholic and red wine is good for the heart: you cannot lose. All the same, British MEPs have been known to admit a homesick longing for sausage, bacon and fried egg with all the greasy trimmings.

Dobbs had him fall from the roof at Westminster at the end of the original story, but TV knew better, and pushed his girlfriend down to her death instead, leaving Urquhart free to contend for the premiership. The alternative is to keep making the programmes, but to claim that the crimes now being examined took place decades ago. They should perhaps shoot them in sepia. An urban dean writes: Was Urquhart, whom you have just mentioned, some relation of Thomas Urquhart, to whom you adverted last week? Smallweed smarmily oozes: I'm obliged. You give me the opportunity to correct what I said about Urquhart last week. A letter from Boston (my colleague, Richard, not the excellent town on the coast in Lincolnshire) has put me straight on several points. According to Richard's book, The Admirable Urquhart, published in 1975 and unavailable from most good booksellers, Sir Thomas, who was born in 1611, came from Cromarty, which as those who have seen it will know, is not Glasgow, to which I wrongly assigned him. The dispute which figures in his translation from Rabelais which I quoted is between the cakemakers of Lerné, which lost its acute accent last week, and the shepherds (not cakemakers) of Gargantua's country. Where Rabelais armed them with a mere 28 insults, Sir Thomas managed 43. It is possible, Boston says, that Smallweed is unaware that Urquhart wrote a biography of the Admirable Crichton, that he invented a universal language, and that he is reputed to have died of a fit of laughter on hearing of the restoration of Charles II. Right on all counts. Ann Mervy, of Ashburton, Devon, writes to the Daily Mail rating George Carey the worst Archbishop of Canterbury ever. How can she be so sure? Has she closely assessed all the others? How does she rate, for instance, Aelfheah, Aelfric, Aethelheard, Aethelnoth, Athelm, Berhtwald, Bregowine, Byrthelm, Ceolnoth, Cuthbert, Deusdedit, Honorious, Jaenberht, Justus, Lanfranc, Laurentius, Oda, Plegmund, Robert of Jumièges, Sigeric, Stigand, Tatwine, Theodore and Wulfred, to take only some of the earliest incumbents? The great historian Stenton says of Deusdedit: \"His one recorded act is the consecration of a bishop of Rochester.\" Consecrating bishops of Rochester, even in that turbulent era, would account for only a modest slice of any archbishop's time. How did he use the rest of it? Robert of Jumièges, I see, was driven right out of England by a popular uprising in 1052, a fate which has yet to befall George Carey, though perhaps the forces of Mervyism are working towards it. Moving onwards, I see from JL Carr's excellent mini-book,Wellbourn's Dictionary of Prelates, Parsons, Vergers, Wardens, Sidesmen &amp; Preachers, Sunday-school Teachers, Hermits, Ecclesiastical Flower-arrangers, Fifth Monarchy Men and False Prophets, that Archbishop George Abbott (died 1633), while out hunting, shot Lord Zouche's gamekeeper, who died. I dare say, given time, I might assemble quite a collection of naughty archbishops, though nothing to match my collection of naughty popes. As for Ms Mervy, I think she is over-excited, a state not uncommon in Ashburton. A rural dean writes: Could Jaenberht by any chance have been related to the present supreme primate of the BBC, Johnberht? Smallweed brusquely responds: : Despite my appearance, I am no genealogist. The organisation Conservative Future wishes to call itself CFUK, the UK meaning the United Kingdom. In this it might seem to resemble the clothiers French Connection, who use FCUK. The Advertising Standards Authority, in its kindly way, thinks CFUK is not so offensive, since it is aimed at students. A statistician writes: There is a further reason appreciable only by people like me. With FCUK only two letters of a word which this form coincidentally resembles are differently placed, in each case by only one slot. Were we to score each unchanged letter at 4, each letter shifted one place at 3, each letter two places out at 2, and each letter three places out at 1, the index of identity for FCUK would be 14. That for CFUK would only be 12, making it less objectionable. The general secretary of the Kent Federation of Christian Unions writes: How would we fare on this basis? Smallweed fondly vouchsafes : You score a mere 10, and leave the court without a stain on your character."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/1999/sep/19/letters.letters1","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-19T22:37:42Z","webTitle":"Go for the euro, not Portillo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/19/letters.letters1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/sep/19/letters.letters1","fields":{"headline":"Go for the euro, not Portillo","bodyText":"In an excellent comment on the long-term implications of Michael Portillo's recent political resurrection, Andrew Marr (Comment, last week) posed the question that all serious observers on Britain's tortured relationship with the European Union must have at the back of their minds: Will it be the euro or the dollar in the pockets of Britons a generation hence?

Fidel Castro. Josef Stalin. What is the main thing they have in common? That's right. They believed in gun control. That, at any rate, is the belief of the National Rifle Association. Photographs of the three appear on posters advertising the NRA's latest bid to fight what they see as a rising tide of liberal opinion that threatens to change the laws on gun ownership and registration in the wake of the latest gun atrocity. And the atrocities seem to come so fast and so furious that it is hard to separate one from the other. The poster was part of a stall set up by the NRA at a Los Angeles street festival last weekend. Should not Tony Blair, or indeed Margaret Thatcher, have been pictured next to Hitler and Stalin since they both believe strongly in gun control and have led governments that severely restrict the ownership of firearms? \"You British have a much higher burglary rate than we do because you can't protect your homes properly,\" said the man in the NRA baseball cap running the stall. But the American rate of death by firearms, which involves losing your life rather than your television set, is now more than 30 times higher than in the United Kingdom, is it not? \"Most of the victims are criminals,\" came the response. \"And if that Jewish community centre [where a white supremacist shot five children last month before killing a postman because he was a government employee and not white] had had proper protection, he would never have been able to do what he did.\" So should all non-white people and government employees be encouraged to carry weapons? The NRA man paused for breath, possibly mindful of the shiver that went down the collective white spine when the Black Panthers arrived on the scene in the 60s with their guns, and their leather jackets and berets proudly proclaiming the right to bear arms. His colleague stepped into the breach. \"You're just being slippery,\" he said. \"Slippery.\" This is how the pro-gun lobby, which represents between 60-65m American gun owners, sees its European critics. They see slippery people from over-bureaucratised, over-centralised, cowed nations that have no concept of an essential and traditional element of American society, a right guaranteed under the second amendment to carry, keep and bear arms. It is not only the boneheaded end of the NRA with their infantile posters (Castro, incidentally, had armed militias) who treasure the right to bear arms. \"Arms discourage and keep invader and plunderer in awe and preserve order in the world as well as property,\" said Thomas Paine, hardly a bone-head baseball-cap wearer. Many who would describe themselves to the libertarian left of American politics believe that the old right to carry arms gives a symbolic protection to the citizen from big government. Many liberals who have grown up in hunting families see it as no stranger to own a rifle than a fishing rod. Many regard a gun as sensible protection in violent times. Banning guns is not an option. The only option is gun control. We are now entering the presidential election period and, for the first time perhaps since the Kennedy assassination, the issue of firearms is high on the agenda. The massacres over the past few months are the reason, not least because they involve (white) schoolchildren, (white) church-goers, (white) day-traders and (white) hospital workers while the culling by gun over the past decade or so has been mainly of young black men. The vice-president, Al Gore, acknowledged at the weekend that gun control must be an election issue. The NRA is opening its war chest and flexing its muscles. It knows that it can inflict great damage on politicians who seem to be straying from the fold. Bill Bradley, hardly a front-runner, is the only one of the half-dozen main candidates offering genuine hope of restrictions. George W Bush has already made it clear he has little intention of reining in the gun lobby if he is elected. The latest opinion polls show that the public is marginally closer, by 34 per cent to 26 per cent, to the Democrats (some mild reforms) than to the Republicans (loosen even the few existing restrictions.) This indicates that there could be a wide gap for an independent or Reform party candidate who chose to make gun control a major issue. Meanwhile, two items of news from Los Angeles, where the debate is perhaps at its fiercest. On Tuesday, a man who believed that his recently deceased mother had not been properly treated in an Anaheim hospital walked into a related medical establishment and shot three people dead. On Thursday, an icecream vendor was found to have been selling toy plastic guns to his young customers from his van. There has been an angry call by an LA councilman for the banning of - plastic guns in ice-cream vans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/1999/sep/20/newsstory.sport","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-20T19:45:55Z","webTitle":"Jeffers gets in swing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/sep/20/newsstory.sport","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/1999/sep/20/newsstory.sport","fields":{"headline":"Jeffers gets in swing","bodyText":"In the kingdom of the mediocre even a barely competent team will build bricks from straw and duly prosper. Both Everton and West Ham United are, indeed, competent but in a division which is liberally strewn with the mediocre and the downright incompetent neither can seriously expect to trouble the Premiership's elite come season's end. As West Ham's manager Harry Redknapp observed afterwards, this was a game which always seemed destined to finish goalless. He was right, too. \"I thought it was going to be a draw - it looked a banker 0 - 0 to me,\" he said. \"I just couldn't see them getting a goal from anywhere. I never felt we were under any real pressure.\" Those who decry the avarice of the modern footballer would have enjoyed certain aspects of the afternoon because there really can be no finer sight than that of the cultured and pampered sliding around ungraciously like hung-over Sunday morning pub players. It rained and it rained and it rained, so reducing an admirable playing surface to a treacherous one on which to try to produce anything that was even remotely appealing. It was a shame because both of these sides have opened the campaign with something of a flourish, accruing points while successfully embroidering their reputations for orderly and decent football. If the sight of the rich and famous sliding around on their rear ends amused, initially at least, it was insufficient to engender any sense of tension or drama. Everton were diligent and uncommonly tidy in midfield, particularly the latest addition to the true blue roster, Abel Xavier - Portuguese, young and, perhaps worryingly, already much travelled. Inclement weather usually makes for chances aplenty but there were relatively few as two thoughtful teams prodded away in the hope of establishing a foothold. West Ham enjoyed the better openings in the first half simply because they opted to try their luck at every opportunity. Paulo Wanchope twice went close during this period, shooting low and hard from distance and then sprinting clear of the Everton defence, only to be denied by the alertness of their goalkeeper, Paul Gerrard. Everton always struggled to transform possession into something of tangible worth but in Kevin Campbell and Francis Jeffers they possessed two forwards who work well in tandem and who personify the work ethic which, in recent seasons, has helped to preserve a great club fallen on barren times. Once the rain had eased to a mere downpour Everton emerged blinking into the daylight like a hibernating animal prematurely awakened from its deep slumber. But they still could not summon up a real sense of urgency although belatedly they did at least begin to appreciate that the onus was on them to seek out an end to the stalemate. With a slightly increased workrate came a cluster of chances, Nick Barmby and Jeffers both being denied by Shaka Hislop. But Hislop's afternoon had peaked rather early and it was to be his basic error on 65 minutes which was to settle a strangely soulless scrap. Barmby's dart forwards into the penalty area was sufficiently incisive to see the West Ham defence part but, unable to find the room in which to deliver his shot, he allowed Jeffers to take possession. Time was still short and space still tight, so Jeffers swung his boot back with youthful exuberance. Hislop dropped down smartly, only to permit the ball to roll from beneath the outstretched fingers of his left hand. And that, as Redknapp was to observe wryly afterwards, was that. \"Our goalkeeper does so well for us so, to be honest, he is entitled to make one or two mistakes every year,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/1999/sep/21/artsfeatures1","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-21T07:15:40Z","webTitle":"Unsound heroes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/sep/21/artsfeatures1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/1999/sep/21/artsfeatures1","fields":{"headline":"Unsound heroes","bodyText":"Peter Cook died in January 1995. The obituaries and TV tributes painted a picture of a charming, witty but haunted man who had done a lot of funny things in his twenties and thirties, and then spent his waning years knocking about with a bottle of vodka. Recordings of Cook's park-bench bore EL Wisty - in which he lamented not having sufficient Latin to become a judge and being forced to be a miner instead - were endlessly reshown. All these extracts, however, seemed to terminate in 1970 when Cook and Dudley Moore finished the third series of Not Only... But Also. The implication was that Peter Cook contributed nothing meaningful to the world of British comedy after that. When I set out to write a book about Cook and Moore, my original brief was to write an illustrated biography - a coffee-table book for fiftysomethings with good memories. But, being part of a younger generation than Peter Cook's ur-fans, I felt obliged to put right what I felt to be a glaring omission in the paeans of praise. For everyone (even Cook's third wife and widow, Lin Cook) seemed to have overlooked the corner of Pete and Dud's oeuvre that made the greatest impact on me, and an entire generation of juvenile males: the three Derek and Clive albums. There are clearly good reasons for this, since references to handjobs, blowjobs and colonic cancer are not everyone's idea of a fun night out, but I felt then, and still do, that Derek and Clive had been undervalued. Barbra Paskin, Dudley Moore's most recent and best biographer, was scandalised by the recordings. Harry Thompson, in his magisterial biography of Peter Cook, praises the first album, Derek and Clive (Live), but slams the next two. (Thompson, incidentally, is in good company: Dudley Moore feels pretty much the same way.) But for me, and for thousands more, Derek and Clive were a revelation. To hear two famous comedians abusing each other was unmitigatedly liberating. It felt as if they had enfranchised a whole section of working-class society, giving it a comic voice that had been overlooked by middle-class comedians for years. Pete and Dud were permanent outsiders, looking in at a world they didn't understand. Derek and Clive recognised the simple but overlooked fact that ordinary people swear a hell of a lot, but the way that Cook - especially Cook - used language was so casually evocative that he achieved something that surpassed mere obscenity. Released between 1976 and 1978, the Derek and Clive albums pre-dated alternative comedy by several years. Their barrier-shattering range of topics - obscenity, blasphemy, masturbation, sodomy, cottaging, phlegm, cancer, farting, etc - was also a comic prelude to the punk revolution that was about to descend on the United Kingdom. Cook and Moore were a uniquely incongruous couple who were different in just about everything. Their lives were a study in contrasts, with Cook fancying himself as a latterday Elvis Presley despite being unable to hold a tune in his head, while Moore was an organ scholar who loved Erroll Garner and Bach. Cook was a wit and part-time satirist who could not recite other people's lines, while Moore was a clown, a mainstream entertainer and a brilliant actor. Cook drank; Moore binged on pills. Cook was famous; Moore is a celebrity. Cook is dead; Moore is, somewhat raggedly, alive. I travelled from London to Los Angeles via the BBC Research Centre in Caversham to research the lives and works of two people whom even the hardiest of fans seemed to treasure as cuddly pieces of 60s nostalgia. In fact, when the very first episode of Not Only... But Also was transmitted in 1965 on the minority interest channel, BBC2, and Peter Cook delivered his famous tirade accusing \"bloody Greta Garbo\" of stalking him, it went down so well with audiences that the then controller of BBC2, David Attenborough, and the assistant head of light entertainment, Frank Muir, immediately suggested a repeat on BBC1. Reaction to the second showing, just a few weeks later, was less enthusiastic. BBC1 researchers reported that \"a not inconsiderable majority of the sample were clearly quite unable to make anything of the comedy of NOBA, but the main reason... seemed to be the far too liberal use of the expletive 'bloody'. It was felt to be a great pity that these two undoubtedly brilliant young men had chosen to introduce such a sour note into this otherwise refreshingly 'different' show.\" Cook and Moore were still, and would remain, too wild for the mainstream. The wildness spilled over into their personal lives. Cook's early death dazzled a lot of journalists, who were subsequently unable to refer to it without making casual but cutting references to alcohol, waistlines and wasted lives. As usual, though, Cook was his own most incisive critic. On Derek and Clive (Live), he famously droned: \"But I'll tell you one thing Tony Newley said to me: 'Who are you?' Just like that. And I thought that made Tony Newley a wonderful human being.\" The thrust of their work was in some sense, an exploration and an elaboration of this one sketch. • Alexander Games is the author of Pete &amp; Dud: An Illustrated Biography, published by André Deutsch at £14.99.

The case may not be a rerun of the OJ Simpson trial but it has provoked a major debate about how domestic violence is prosecuted and has divided civil rights activists normally on the same side. Jim Brown, aged 63, is a football hero in the US, a Hall of Fame running back with the Cleveland Browns who was every bit as revered as OJ Simpson during a glorious career. Like Simpson, he is black; like Simpson, he went into acting, only more successfully, in such movies as The Dirty Dozen, Ice Station Zebra and LA Heat. But over the past few weeks he has been in the news for reasons that have nothing to do with his twin careers. On June 15, police were called to Brown's home in the Hollywood Hills by his 25-year-old wife, Monique. In a 911 call (the equivalent of calling 999 in Britain), she told the operator that her husband had 'smashed things', that he had a gun in the house and had threatened to kill her. She said that although he had not yet hit her, he had done so previously and he had already attacked her car with a shovel. Fifteen squad cars arrived at Brown's home and he was double-handcuffed before being taken down to the police station and charged with making terrorist threats and vandalism. The penalty for the former is up to 18 months in prison. After the charges, the Browns appeared together on television news programmes to claim that the whole matter had been blown out of all proportion. Monique retracted her statement, declaring that she had made the claims only because she believed her husband was having an affair and she wanted to hurt him. She repeated her retraction on two major television programmes, The Larry King Show and Rivera Live, and said she had been suffering from premenstrual tension at the time. 'I was in no harm, there was no threat towards me,' she said. She added that she had told her husband to go ahead and smash her car windows and anyway the car really belonged to him. Partly as a result of the Simpson case, in which it became clear that he had previously attacked his wife - police had been called to his house on nine occasions and never prosecuted him - the authorities in LA now have an official policy of proceeding with domestic violence cases even if the alleged victim withdraws her statement. Prosecutors argue that often a woman may be intimidated into withdrawing a claim because her husband has threatened her. When the Browns' case came to court, Monique repeated her assertion that she had over-reacted and had not been in fear of her life as she had claimed in her 911 call. Jim Brown did not give evidence because he said there was no case to answer. His lawyer told the jury that Monique was a mentally unstable young woman. After 10 hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on the threatening charge but guilty of vandalism for which Brown will be sentenced this week. Outside the court, he expressed his satisfaction that he had been cleared of the main charge and called the prosecution 'ruthless and vulgar'. While comparisons with the OJ Simpson case have inevitably been drawn, the difference is that Brown - who is said to hate Simpson and to have called him a 'phoney' - has a high political profile, has been instrumental in brokering gang ceasefires and is highly regarded for his work with disadvantaged youth. Brown claims he has been prosecuted because he is a prominent black figure and that this, combined with the running debate about domestic violence, is what has led to the controversy. In the Nation of Islam's paper The Final Call, Charlene Muhhamad writes that 'attempts to prosecute... Brown on a domestic abuse charge (are) a further attempt to smear strong Black leaders'. To which Jason Zengerle in The New Republic has responded by accusing Brown of 'playing the race card (to activate) the old Free OJ Coalition'. Brown's lawyer, William Graysen, says a different path would have been taken if the alleged wife-batterer had not been black. 'The city attorney's office does not prosecute white couples in the west side of Los Angeles or the San Fernando Valley who commit physical violence against each other,' he says. Meanwhile black civil rights campaigner and lawyer Melanie Lomax backs the prosecution: she points out that Brown has a history of being charged with but not convicted of violence against women and says she had been aware of his reputation for violence against women since she was in high school. He was accused of throwing one girlfriend off a balcony in 1968, of battering two women in 1971, of rape in 1985 and assaulting a woman in 1986. None of these cases was proceeded with after the women involved withdrew their evidence. Women's rights lawyers have also come out strongly in favour of the prosecution, even while accepting that Graysen may be right (about white middle-class people escaping charges). Brown's supporters in the civil rights end of the legal profession say he was never convicted in any of the previous cases and should therefore be presumed innocent. The issue at stake is a familiar one to lawyers in the United Kingdom. In 1987, the Metropolitan police changed their policy on domestic violence by announcing that they would arrest alleged batterers even when a woman withdrew her accusations. This was a major sea-change in police thinking which had previously regarded 'domestics' as a bit of a waste of time. The new policy meant that a man was taken down to the station and, even if the case did not proceed to court, he was at least confronted with his actions. The advantage of this policy was that it did not require a frightened woman to proceed with her claims; the disadvantage was that the man might still take it out on her because of the humiliation of being locked up for the night. Partly as a result of this and partly because of a large influx of female officers over the past decade, police thinking on domestic violence has changed radically. For the police and the prosecuting authorities, the issue remains the same on both sides of the Atlantic: do you proceed with a case even if urged by the woman not to and even if to do so may be to expose her to more violence? Or do you accept her word that nothing happened and allow a potentially violent man to take that violence to its logical and murderous conclusion because he believes he is untouchable? Which is where many people feel the OJ Simpson case is now so relevant."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/sep/21/food.foodanddrink","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-21T07:15:55Z","webTitle":"Welsh and Scots ministers defy Blair over beef ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/21/food.foodanddrink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/sep/21/food.foodanddrink","fields":{"headline":"Welsh and Scots ministers defy Blair over beef ban","bodyText":"Tony Blair wants the beef-on-the-bone ban to be lifted immediately throughout Britain but is being thwarted by Labour ministers in the newly devolved bodies in Scotland and Wales. Ministers in Cardiff and Edinburgh are refusing to accept the advice of England's chief medical officer that it is safe to lift the ban, which was introduced soon after the general election. The row, which prompted Tory claims that the Welsh and Scots have been given a veto over how England is governed, overshadowed an announcement by the government of an extra £150m for farmers in Britain to ease the pressure on the agricultural industry. The split between Whitehall and the new devolved bodies surfaced yesterday when Nick Brown, the agriculture minister in London, announced a delay in the lifting of the beef-on-the-bone ban because of objections from Cardiff and Edinburgh. Mr Brown, who has come under intense pressure from Downing Street to lift the highly unpopular measure, said he was happy to end the ban after advice from Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer for England, that it was safe to allow butchers to sell beef-on-the-bone. However, the ban should remain on manufactured products such as bone marrow. Mr Brown said he could not act because Welsh and Scottish ministers are sticking to the advice of their own chief medical officers who are insisting that it would be unsafe to lift the ban. In Northern Ireland, where power has yet to be devolved, Mo Mowlam is also accepting the advice of her chief medical officer that the ban should be upheld. Mr Brown said he hoped that the ban could be lifted by November or December. But he added: \"I am not setting any targets. That is an aspiration.\" His remarks in London were seen as an attempt to step up the pressure on ministers in Scotland and Wales to accept the advice of Prof Donaldson. One senior ministry of agriculture source said: \"We hope that the publication of Prof Donaldson's evidence will inform the debate throughout the United Kingdom.\" The split is believed to be the first time that Britain's new constitutional arrangements have affected people in England. Separate chief medical officers operated in the four parts of the UK before devolution, but when they offered conflicting advice ministers were able to resolve their differences in cabinet. Michael Ancram, the Tory chairman, said that the row showed the dangers of devolution. \"Nick Brown is giving the Scots and Welsh a veto over how England is governed,\" he said. \"When is Tony Blair going to give the English people a fair deal too?\" Mr Brown attempted to show that his writ can run across the UK when he announced an extra £150m for farmers throughout Britain. The government is to maintain last year's £60m increase in the hill livestock compensatory allowance to help struggling hill farmers. It is also to fund inspection charges for cattle and sheep carcasses at a cost of £44m. A further £45m is to fund a cattle passports scheme, while a final £1m will be provided to help with marketing support. The announcement came as Tony Blair attempted to allay the fears of rural communities by insisting that a ban on hunting would not lead to bans on shooting and fishing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"football/1999/sep/21/match.sport13","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-21T10:38:41Z","webTitle":"Jeffers gets in swing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/sep/21/match.sport13","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/1999/sep/21/match.sport13","fields":{"headline":"Jeffers gets in swing","bodyText":"In the kingdom of the mediocre even a barely competent team will build bricks from straw and duly prosper.

Once the rain had eased to a mere downpour Everton emerged blinking into the daylight like a hibernating animal prematurely awakened from its deep slumber. But they still could not summon up a real sense of urgency although belatedly they did at least begin to appreciate that the onus was on them to seek out an end to the stalemate. With a slightly increased workrate came a cluster of chances, Nick Barmby and Jeffers both being denied by Shaka Hislop. But Hislop's afternoon had peaked rather early and it was to be his basic error on 65 minutes which was to settle a strangely soulless scrap. Barmby's dart forwards into the penalty area was sufficiently incisive to see the West Ham defence part but, unable to find the room in which to deliver his shot, he allowed Jeffers to take possession. Time was still short and space still tight, so Jeffers swung his boot back with youthful exuberance. Hislop dropped down smartly, only to permit the ball to roll from beneath the outstretched fingers of his left hand. And that, as Redknapp was to observe wryly afterwards, was that. \"Our goalkeeper does so well for us so, to be honest, he is entitled to make one or two mistakes every year,\" he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"news/1999/sep/21/derekbrown","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-21T11:24:33Z","webTitle":"Quake horror in Taiwan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/21/derekbrown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/sep/21/derekbrown","fields":{"headline":"Quake horror in Taiwan","bodyText":"The latest grisly pictures from Taiwan are horribly familiar: dazed survivors wandering in devastated streets; rescuers scrabbling through the rubble, and medics frantically working on shattered bodies. We've seen such sights before, all too recently. The appalling damage done in Turkey, and the less severe but similarly harrowing destruction visited upon Athens, are still raw memories. No doubt, we will hear from millennial nutters that this is part of a divine or celestial pattern; that we are all doomed. And it's true that the horrors are increasing. Already, this year's global earthquake death toll is double last year's - and that in turn was twice as high as in 1997. But we should not be sidetracked by such foolishness. The average annual death toll in earthquakes this century is around 10,000. Of course, that masks terrific peaks and troughs, according to where the quakes strike. Last's year's most powerful shock hammered the ocean bed off the Australian continental shelf. Not a single human was harmed. The great single misconception about earthquakes is that their effects can be measured by the Richter scale. In fact, Richter tells us virtually nothing about the destructiveness of a quake. The scale refers to the force of the shock at its epicentre, which may be a long way from human habitation - as in the Australasian shock last year - or else so many miles underground that it is all but imperceptible on the surface. It didn't matter very much that last month's Turkish quake measured 7.8 on the Richter scale. What mattered a lot was that the epicentre was shallow, and underneath a densely populated area where masses of people lived in appallingly substandard buildings. Seismologists believe that the global earthquake death toll is steadily falling both because of better forecasting techniques and, primarily, rising building standards - in developed countries at least. That, early evidence suggests, may be the case in quake-prone Taiwan, where a very severe shock has caused less spectacular damage than the broadly similar quake in Turkey. For all that, the carnage is real and so too is the miserable plight of the victims. As the rescue work continues and the death toll inevitably rises, offers of help are pouring in. Most touching was the instant, heartfelt message of sympathy and support from Beijing, sent by China's president Jiang Zemin. His unqualified offer of help is an echo of the extraordinary rapprochement between the ancient enemies Turkey and Greece in the aftermath of their respective earthquake horrors. The sight of Greek rescuers digging in the Turkish rubble, and a few weeks later of Turkish teams rushing to the aid of their Greek neighbours, was more than sentimental symbolism. It has brought about an unprecedented diplomatic warmth between Ankara and Athens which would have been unthinkable a few short weeks ago. It is much too early to be speculating about the political aftermath of the quake in Taiwan, but we may quietly hope that it too will include a new relationship between the two Chinas.

His counterparts in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland disagree, and want to wait for yet another report, due out in November. Agriculture minister Nick Brown is in a tizz. He wants the ban to be lifted across the United Kingdom, but his writ no longer runs in the \"devolved territories\", as he calls them. It's difficult to see why this is an issue. Does Brown imagine that marrow-lusting Celts are going to be crawling all over the Marches with smuggled English rib-joints? If he believes that the ban should be lifted in England, let him do it. It won't matter a scrap to those of us who have been buying the stuff all along. And if our neighbours want to keep the silly, meaningless ban, that's up to them.

Compared with Africa, India and Asia this is nothing, but it will add to the pressures of life in one of the most crowded islands in the world. There is little doubt that our economy can cope with the extra numbers, but unless we become healthier, and learn to live together more and use less power, it will mean significant extra spending on schools, hospitals, housing, pollution, infrastructure, and water supplies. Britain led the way in population explosions during the industrial revolution. In 1801 we had fewer than 11m people. By 1891 we had 33m and now, after a series of rapid rises due to baby booms and immigration, we are at about 57.8m. We do not know exactly what our numbers are, partly because so many students and others did not fill in their census forms in 1991 due to the poll tax, and also because population is subject to unexpected social and economic changes. Nevertheless, Britain is one of Europe's few countries expecting an increase in numbers. We should peak in 2023 at 61.5m, then fall back slowly to a mid-1980s figure of about 54m, says the office for national statistics . Apart from Ireland, we are Europe's youngest country with almost 20% of people under 14. Where most other EU countries have a declining population, we have more teenage births and one parent families than any other. Women in Britain on average are giving birth to more children than anywhere else except Ireland and Sweden. The population rise is expected to come largely from the Asian and black communities. According to Manchester university research on the 1991 census, 19% of white households will achieve the traditional two children per household, compared to 41% of Asian households. The population shifts between regions are dramatic. Central London is growing again, after decades of falling numbers, but the old northern industrial cities like Liverpool and Glasgow are expected to shrink significantly. The office for national statistics expects hundreds of thousands of northerners to move to the south-east over the next 20 years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/sep/23/alexbrummer.larryelliott","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-23T01:19:48Z","webTitle":"Chancellor wins IMF praise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/23/alexbrummer.larryelliott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/sep/23/alexbrummer.larryelliott","fields":{"headline":"Chancellor wins IMF praise","bodyText":"The chancellor, Gordon Brown, last night won the plaudits of the International Monetary Fund for his management of the economy and received backing for his cabinet battle with high-spending ministers. As Mr Brown's colleagues pile on the pressure for a share of the treasury's estimated £12bn surplus, IMF economists warned that the windfall gain to the public finances was vulnerable to economic changes. The IMF praised the way in which Mr Brown had steered the economy clear of recession in the face of last year's global crisis and made possible a return to higher growth. The praise comes on the eve of the Labour party conference and at a time when Mr Brown's political stock has been rising. Mr Brown flies to Washington tomorrow for the G7 meeting of the richest industrial countries. He will chair the IMF's main interim committee for the first time before going to Bournemouth to deliver his speech to conference on Monday. In its half-yearly world economic outlook, the IMF raised its forecast for UK growth by almost half a percentage point to 1.1%, with the economy picking up momentum to reach 2.4% growth in 2000, 0.3 percentage points above its May prediction. Figures released by the office for national statistics yesterday showed growth slightly higher than estimated in the first two quarters of this year. The IMF was more doubtful about the wisdom of the contentious increase in interest rates by the Bank of England earlier this month. Its economists said the bank was proving more ready to move interest rates than other central banks, and needed to make sure that it would be as quick to lower the cost of borrowing if the economy were to falter. The IMF added that an adverse effect of the quarter-point increase in rates had been to push up the value of sterling, adding to the woes of the manufacturing sector. Overall, however, it was complimentary about the handling of monetary policy, which with a \"markedly improved labour market performance\" had kept inflation subdued. The IMF noted that the absence of inflationary pressure from the labour market was partly due to the Thatcherite reforms of the past two decades. Contrasting Britain favourably with its European partners, it added: \"The United Kingdom made significant progress in addressing labour-market rigidities and this has led to reductions in structural unemployment.\" The IMF has increased its estimate of the growth potential of the US economy following a boost to productivity from new technology, but said there was no sign of a similar improvement in Britain, where the underlying rate of growth remained stuck at 2.25 to 2.5%. Despite the better-than-expected performance of the US economy in recent years, the IMF issued a stark warning that \"large strains and imbalances\" were building up in America and could prompt a new bout of global turbulence. In particular, it focused on the sharp rise in the US trade deficit and the \"generously valued\" stock market, which, if it were to go into steep decline, could cascade through the US economy hitting consumption and confidence. This in turn would pose a threat to global prospects when Japan is struggling to pull out of its nosedive and Europe is still in the early stages of recovery. Along with its forecast for a soft landing for the UK, the IMF views Mr Brown's handling of public finances as among the best of G7 countries, with budget surpluses this year and next - nicely timed for the run-up to the election. The IMF also believes the UK can sustain low unemployment, with a jobless rate of 4.8% this year, rising to 5.3% in 2000. Meanwhile, with foreign exchange markets in turmoil after the dollar fell against the yen, the IMF's chief economist, Michael Mussa, argued that there was a strong case for G7 stepping into the markets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/sep/23/food.foodanddrink","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-23T01:20:07Z","webTitle":"Ministers are afraid of the Celts, and unable to let go","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/23/food.foodanddrink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/sep/23/food.foodanddrink","fields":{"headline":"Ministers are afraid of the Celts, and unable to let go","bodyText":"The people of England have been cleared to eat beef on the bone. It's what the doctor ordered. The risk, he says, is \"tiny, and unquantifiable in any meaningful way\". But the minister, for whom the doctor works, says the English may still not eat beef. After years of culinary deprivation, not to mention multiple farmers' suicides, the politician aborts what the expert says is permissible. \"Science\", to which every BSE decision has been attributed, approves a way out of the scandal, and, when it is at last being helpful, is spurned. You could hardly make this story up. But science never was a match for politics. The minister who should be most worried is not Nick Brown, the agriculture man who overruled the chief medical officer, but John Prescott, who, faute de mieux , is making himself into the minister for England. For what this absurd decision springs from is a disregard for England as compared with Scotland or even Wales. It comes out of the nether regions of the policy Tony Blair is said, among the few mistakes he might admit he has made, most fervently to regret. No victim is too large to be protected against his determination to tell the Celts, and especially the Scots, who is really in charge. The English and their beef-deprivation are a demonstration. The agents of this are the medical officers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who all happen to be saying that beef-release must await yet further study. The English doctor, Liam Donaldson, is, in formal fact, the chief medical officer for the whole United Kingdom. But this makes no difference. Because London values UK uniformity higher than the rights of the English, we wait upon the grace and favour of the lesser places, which now have independent power. The decision is as telling as it is perverse, and Mr Brown didn't make it on his own. Though the losers are the English, the targets are the Scots and the culprits are ministers who don't really believe in devolution. To them, the power of separate decision-making inflames all kinds of nerves. Scotland and Wales retain vestigial presences in the cabinet, and if England were to eat beef alone, there would be friction, especially with the Celtic nationalists. Any concession to sub-national privilege will be a hostage to Scots on future questions. Fluoridation of Scottish water is just one upcoming nightmare. Politicians wholly formed in centralised decision making, for what the gentleman in Whitehall knows to be the greatest good of everyone from coast to coast, find this hard to take. In Whitehall, actually, there is less resistance to devolution. The bills were drafted, the acts were passed, and they pose the kind of problems that intrigue civil servants: how to make the machine work smoothly, how to divide up the myriad, tedious little powers and duties that keep the trains running on time and child support in the right bureaucratic framework. \"Are you speaking as a UK civil servant, a GB civil servant [the UK minus Ulster] or an English civil servant?\" is a question now frequently exchanged between Whitehall officials, as they pick their way through issues such as health reform or the modernisation of government - to name two major green-paper topics, close to the heart of Blairism, where the issues crossed frontiers between these overlapping estates. D epartments vary in their approach. I'm told the department of health, under an alert permanent secretary, Chris Kelly, is further advanced than most in the systems it has set up to think about a policy-field where the problem of universal standards poses a lot of choices. As a bureaucratic matter, separation is in many areas a done deal. In the way the administrators arrange themselves, the UK is becoming a quasi-federalist society, without a true federal structure. One official close to the centre summed up the attitude of the mandarins in language that cuts through the normal political refinements. \"I find that quite a lot of them,\" he said, \"are treating Scotland like an independent country.\" There are, however, limits. The practical meaning of devolution, as it works its way up the blood-stream of the body politic into many unlooked-for corners, can't be reduced to a single rule. University tuition fees are an obvious counter-case. The British university structure, a unified entity from which the Scots gain both kudos and commerce far beyond their numbers, should not have become the cat's-paw of Liberal Democrats in the Scottish parliament who are foolishly committed to abolishing the fees that apply in England. That kind of differentiation, while offering an opportunist point to the SNP and the Tories, would create unacceptable chaos, as well as being sharply anti-progressive. Short of destroying the entire existing system, devolution has to respond to what actually happens on the ground: which in this case is not separation, but a massive flow of English students into excellent Scottish universities. Whether the English will wake up to what devolution means is debatable. Although many pens and voices, not least the leaden trumpet of William Hague, have been trying to rouse the spirit of English nationalism - while shedding crocodile tears at the prospect of a Mosleyite rebirth - there is no sign of the natives being much bothered by the democratic asymmetry and other unfairnesses produced by the sub-national assemblies. They may even be so punch-drunk with food scares, and so forgetful of the pleasures of beef on the bone, that Mr Brown's sneaky rejec tion of the doctor's scientific judgment will not strike them as outrageous. But it should do. And he should rescind it, even though the National Farmers' Union, playing politics of its own, also seems to favour uniformity over devolved propriety. We learn that, for all their rhetoric of change, and the measures which they have brought in apparently to bring change about, ministers, in the arena where raw power is collected and dispensed, have an addiction to no-change. They like things to be neat and tidy, under their control. Above all they want the Scots, on whom, in a new parliamentary configuration, their whole fate could depend, to be fed no precedents that might make them restless. Changing a governmental culture is, admittedly, big work. Nothing happens quickly. Look at the impatience Mr Blair is having to show, in order to get anywhere with his urgent belief that the civil service itself needs to modernise. Freighted on his back are 150 years of a British governing machine whose momentum has never been centrifugal, and arguably an eternity of power-hungry leadership by everyone who ever filled his post. But it was he who talked about being different, and pacified Scotland with a promise. The beef of England seems an exquisitely inappropriate way to break it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk/1999/sep/23/davidhencke","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-23T10:53:24Z","webTitle":"Museum stays a treasure house of secrecy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/23/davidhencke","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/sep/23/davidhencke","fields":{"headline":"Museum stays a treasure house of secrecy","bodyText":"The British Museum, the epitome of scholarship and rigorous research and custodian of the nation's treasures, has shown itself also to be a centre for censorship, prevarication and high political intrigue. Prompted by the culture secretary, Chris Smith's, decision to extend John Major's \"open government\" code to the British Museum on April 1, the Guardian requested the release of all documents held by the museum on the return of the Elgin marbles since two successive Labour leaders, Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock, pledged their repatriation to Greece. The issue, although highly contentious since Lord Elgin obtained dubious permission from the rulers of the Ottoman empire to dismantle them from the Acropolis in 1803, is not one that affects national security or secret policy making. The Guardian also requested the release of papers on how the British Museum has cared for the marbles since it acquired them in 1816 after Lord Elgin was paid £35,000 to hand them over \"in perpetuity\" to the nation. This followed a lively academic account by the former treasury and ministry of defence mandarin, William St Clair, of the suppressed damaging and illegal cleaning of the marbles in 1939. But the museum has refused to release any of the \"confidential documents\" held since 1968, and says - contrary to the wording of the code - that it is not required to give any reason for its refusal. Robert Anderson, director of the museum, said: \"The code...does not override the statutory disclosure period of 30 years for public records, or a right to obtain copies.\" He has since been unwilling or unable to respond to letters seeking clarification. The only access the museum has provided is to its own archives, including the full report of the internal inquiry - suppressed for 50 years - into the illegal cleaning of the marbles in 1939 by staff employed by Lord Duveen, an entrepreneur with a reputation for \"touching up\" European masterpiece paintings for sale to American buyers. The \"cleaned\" marbles are now displayed in the museum's Duveen gallery. The museum officially sticks to a statement virtually unchanged for 20 years. \"The sculptures from the Parthenon constitute one of the greatest and best-loved of its treasures; and the fact that they exemplify, in a unique manner, the aesthetic genius of classical antiquity, which has exerted so profound an influence on the subsequent history of mankind, makes it all the more approporiate that they should find their setting in a museum which is universal in its scope and designed to present as complete a picture as possible of the development of different, but related, cultures through the ages. \"The trustees of the British Museum would regard it as a betrayal of their trust to establish a precedent for the piecemeal dismemberment of collections which recognise no arbitrary boundaries of time and place.\" The British Museum decision not to release or add to any information since 1983 is contrasted by a request to the Greek embassy in London. A file of documents shows that in 1983 the British Museum was circulating an aide memoire through the foreign office to British embassies abroad defending its ownership of the marbles. The documents released by the Greek embassy also show that the British government has faced regular requests from the Greek government for the return of the marbles. So far it has not responded even after Unesco declared the Parthenon a World Cultural Heritage site and supported their return. This argument was put to Mark Fisher, the former arts minister, in a private memorandum from the Greek ministry of culture six weeks after Labour won the general election. The memo, released by the embassy, says: \"The call for the restitution of the marbles is not made by the Greek government in the name of the Greek nation or of Greek history, but in the name of the world's cultural heritage... \"Confident that British cultural sensibility and tradition render the UK government a positive recipient of the calls for the restitution of the marbles, Greece is handling this issue with discretion vis-a-vis the United Kingdom.\" Chris Smith, the culture secretary, however blew the Greeks' discretion out of the water by publicly stating the marbles would not go back. In November the issue will be raised all over again when the British Museum holds a conference on the cleaning of antiquities. The Greeks are boycotting the conference following Mr St Clair's disclosures of the museum's having cleaned the marbles by scraping them with tools made out of copper bars. Mr St Clair's book on Lord Elgin and the marbles is not for sale inside the British Museum bookshop. The official guide to the marbles does not disclose the details of the scandal either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/sep/24/scotlanddevolution.devolution","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-24T01:21:54Z","webTitle":"Climbdown by heir apparent after gaffe over 'offensive' union flag","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/sep/24/scotlanddevolution.devolution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/sep/24/scotlanddevolution.devolution","fields":{"headline":"Climbdown by heir apparent after gaffe over 'offensive' union flag","bodyText":"One of the Scottish National party's leading lights, Andrew Wilson, was yesterday forced to apologise after he threw the SNP conference into disarry by branding the union flag an \"offensive symbol\". His spectacular gaffe risked alienating the many Scots - two-thirds by Mr Wilson' s own estimate - who retain affection for the idea of Britishness. It also threatened the efforts of the SNP leadership in recent years to foster good relations with England and the rest of the United Kingdom. Mr Wilson MSP, 28, the front-runner to replace the SNP leader Alex Salmond when he stands down, had compounded the mistake by linking the union flag to the divisive politics of Northern Ireland. He also claimed the flag was a hang-over from colonial times. Backtracking after his attack, Mr Wilson, the Scottish shadow finance minister, said: \"When the union jack is misused at any time - for example as it has been by the far right - it can be offensive. I make it absolutely clear that I do not find it offensive when used in the proper way, and I apologise to anyone who has gained any other impression.\" The Scottish secretary, John Reid, said Mr Wilson's original attack was an insult to the rest of Britain and those who had fought the two world wars under the flag: \"It is one thing to be Scottish and proud of it; it is quite another for nationalists living in freedom to drag that flag into the dirt.\" David McLetchie, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, accused Mr Wilson of making offensive remarks and called on Mr Salmond and the SNP leadership to distance themselves from them. Mr Wilson made his remarks after a speech at a fringe meeting which was sup posed to persuade nationalists there was nothing to fear from the continual affection for Britain felt by many Scots. The speech was meant to lay the foundations for a campaign to woo Scots fearful of the break-up of the United Kingdom. Mr Wilson said many Scots felt bound to Britain through national institutions like the monarchy - and EastEnders - and claimed that after independence Scots may even be tempted to support the England football team. But then he launched his attack. \"The union flag is an offensive symbol which does not refer to anything other than colonialism and some of the worst things happening in Northern Ireland,\" he said. The gaffe is a blow to Mr Wilson's leadership ambitions after he achieved a minor victory when he forced the Sunday Times to agree to print an apology over its handling of a preview of his speech. The Sunday Times will issue an apology to Mr Wilson this weekend following its decision to publish a mocked-up picture of him standing alongside a union flag. Mr Wilson has been barracked and ribbed by other nationalists at the conference over his attempt last weekend to make a case for being Scottish and British. For a politician who has held a parliamentary seat for only four months, such public derision may have provoked him into his remarks yesterday. His comments overshadowed the preceding speech, which was supposed to square the circle by simultaneously reassuring Scots who feel British and nationalists who feel allegiance solely to the Saltire.

Despite the SNP's good performance in Thursday's byelection in Hamilton South, the fundamentalist wing of the party, which believes the SNP should push for immediate independence rather than using devolution as a stepping stone towards that goal, is pushing for a change in campaign tactics, and, ultimately, leadership. Margo MacDonald, one of the leading lights of the fundamentalist faction, said she had been extremely reticent about backing a Scottish parliament and thought its poor reception in the media and among the public may deter Scots from backing independence. \"They'll think if they can't get devolution right, how are they going to get independence right. Devolution can only disappoint in what it can deliver. It might therefore deaden the movement towards independence.\" Andrew Wilson, the SNP's shadow finance minister in the Scottish parliament, whose gaffe in calling the Union flag an offensive symbol overshadowed proceedings at yesterday's conference, said devolution would show Scots how much more they could achieve separate from the UK. \"No one can say devolution is the settled will. It is a step down the road but it is by no means the end. It shows more than anything the inadequacies in the present situation.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/sep/25/britishidentity.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-25T02:47:58Z","webTitle":"Sense of place","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/25/britishidentity.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/sep/25/britishidentity.comment","fields":{"headline":"Sense of place","bodyText":"At the time the Guardian began its move to London, about 40 years ago, the largest part of its circulation was still where it had always been since the paper's foundation in 1821, around its birthplace in Manchester. Now the largest part by far, roughly half the paper's readership, is in London and the south-east. That also means, of course, that half our readers do not live in London and the south-east and occasionally one of you reminds us of that, complaining that the paper has developed a metropolis fixation, has forgotten its roots, and from its \"new\" home in grimy Farringdon Road surveys the rest of the United Kingdom, when it bothers at all, with only a vague sense of geography. Despite the fact that only readers who are, as I am, getting on a bit can remember the traumatic period of the Guardian's removal from Manchester to London, some of you still, from time to time, point our history at us like an accusing finger. Manchester, in fact, was dropped from the title in 1959, the first issue was printed in London on September 11, 1961, and the paper's editorial headquarters moved from Manchester in early 1964. Is our history to be an encumbrance or an asset or is it just history? Sensitivities are such that promotional or publishing activities conducted exclusively in the paper's area of most concentrated circulation, the area circumscribed by the M25 - the paper's belly button - sometimes excite a feeling of grievance or neglect among readers thus excluded. Space, our property and design supplement, published with the paper in the London area on Thursdays, is one example that has this effect. Another, recently, was the free paperback of an Arthur Schnitzler story which all readers in London had stuck to their copies of our magazine, Guardian Weekend. Cost, I am told, is the main reason why these things are not extended across the country - although that is what we would like to do - and, to a lesser extent, logistics. Free offers such as the Schnitzler book have to be stuck on to one of the preprinted sections by hand; a small army is employed in warehouses to do this, capable in the way we have done it so far, of dealing with a little less than half the copies printed. Our marketing department points out a few things: the success of the Schnitzler operation, and others like it, in boosting circulation, has an overall benefit for all readers (by keeping us competitive and profitable); the vast majority of promotions involve offers that are open to all or nearly all readers (film previews in regional centres, for instance, and discounted flights, where there is always an effort to include a spread of regional airports). More often, though, the cause of annoyance is the detection of something in the editorial content that looks like disregard for readers outside London, little things such as a restaurant guide published with all editions but concentrating its attention on London. One reader complained that, odd though we might consider it to be, he enjoyed eating even though he never went to London and lived his life between Leicester and, I think he said, Manchester. A story that deals with house prices without acknowledging that the boom leaves untouched swathes of depressed property in some parts of Britain is an isolating experience for readers in such areas. Our regional correspondents - I spent a couple of days last week with those who work from Manchester and Leeds - are dedicated to the principle that the energy and variety of life outside London is under-represented in, well yes, I can say it, in a paper that was itself an expression of the vigour and intelligence of regional life. Our regional affairs correspondent, who lives in Newcastle but works out of Manchester, and whose brief enables him to write about regional matters anywhere in Britain, believes the Guardian and the press in general have not responded appropriately to the changing state of the United Kingdom: to devolution, to delineating and looking at the implications of the north/south divide, to looking at the regeneration of regional cities: Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, were his examples. Let's put the question another way: does the Guardian think its history gives it any special responsibilities towards the regions? The editor of the paper says yes, he firmly believes it does. It is something he is thinking about very actively. The correspondents themselves are a resilient and patriotic lot. They all carry out a lot of speaking engagements amid the reporting duties. It is, I was told, a matter of making your presence felt. Every now and again they put their ears to the ground to listen for the drumming of hooves that would tell them the cavalry was coming. • Readers may contact the office of the Readers' Editor by telephoning 0171 239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

The certificate proving it hangs in the 14-year-old's home for visitors to scrutinise. It proclaims Valentia a virgin. \"This shows I have not been touched by evil things,\" she said. Valentia is not alone. Many of her friends at school in northern KwaZulu-Natal have earned their certificates in a resurgence of the ancient custom of virginity testing. And it is not only girls in this South African culture who seek to proclaim their abstinence. The Zulu tradition was originally intended to assure the purity of brides. It fell into disuse in many parts of the kingdom when migrant labour, forced removal and what passed for white civilisation eroded family structures. The scourge of Aids, already rampant in the north-eastern state of KwaZulu-Natal, has revived the practice, encouraged by a revival of black consciousness. In Osizweni township the revival is being driven by Sipho Malinga, deputy headmaster of Qophumlando school and head of the All Africa Cultural Organisation. At Qophumlando school (motto: First Things First), about half the 1,500 pupils have undergone a virginity test. Fewer than 30 failed. The testing can be individual or part of a broader celebration of Zulu culture, involving the slaughter of cows and homage to the monarchy. In either case the girls are told by the female teacher who checks them, Thabile Ngcobo, to remove their knickers and lie on their backs. She then checks to see if their hymens are intact. \"I don't use my fingers as some others do because it can damage the girls and the next time they will fail the test,\" she said. A group of giggling young women comes forward to declare themselves proud to be virgins. \"Our parents encouraged us. They want us to stay virgins. People are happy about what we are doing and they are encouraging us to carry on,\" said Susan Hadebe, 15. Mr Malinga, who is also the science teacher, tests the boys. First he checks their penises. A hard foreskin is considered a sign of purity. Then they are asked to urinate. \"If the urine is in the form of a shower it shows you are unfit. If it is straight, you are a virgin. We get them to urinate in the sand. The urine of a virgin makes a straight hole. We also test the knees. If the fingers go in above the knee he has done the job,\" he said. Among those with a virginity certificate on his wall is Raymond Malakoana, 20. \"Virginity testing protects you from different types of evil. It makes you avoid Aids and many other diseases. It assists you to abstain from crime and drugs and to avoid bad friends who can spoil your life,\" he said. Critics of the testing contend that there is no scientific standard by which to ascertain whether a girl is a virgin, let alone a boy. Doctors point out that hymens can tear accidentally. Occasionally a girl is born without one. South Africa's Commission on Gender Equality held a special meeting on virginity testing and concluded that on the whole it is a bad thing. There is also a danger in being recognised as a virgin. In some parts of South Africa there is a belief that sex with a virgin cures Aids. The police believe it is a major contributor to the rising numbers of child rapes. But those who favour testing argue that the certificates help young women resist the enormous pressure for sex. \"We have got a problem as Africans because we don't have babysitters,\" Mr Malinga said. \"Parents come back from work at dusk. They are exhausted. They don't know what has been happening during the day, if their children have been exposed to violence, crime and sexual practices. \"We have to show that we think all of those things are wrong. This way virgins will congregate with virgins. It will be a proper cure for Aids.\" Qophumlando school says no one is forced to be tested, but there are pressures. Some of the girls taunt those who refuse to be examined, saying it is an admission they are not virgins. Mr Malinga thinks that is probably true in many cases. To encourage the pupils, one of the teachers said that she too would be examined. At morning assembly it was announced that Philisiwe Hlatshwayo, 25, had passed. Testing is conducted at five other schools in Osizweni, on children as young as six,\"so they get used to it\". Parents from outside the township also bring their offspring. It does not always go according to plan. \"One time there were about 380 boys we were expecting for tests. Someone told them we were using electricity on their scrotums so they ran away,\" Mr Malinga said. But sex education is off the agenda, he said. \"We are against the use of condoms. We think condoms promote lust for sex. If a person has condoms he can go to another man's wife knowing he will not get her pregnant. \"I don't think we should teach children about such things.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/1999/sep/29/drugsandalcohol.drugs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-29T14:48:15Z","webTitle":"Testing time for crime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/sep/29/drugsandalcohol.drugs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/1999/sep/29/drugsandalcohol.drugs","fields":{"headline":"Testing time for crime","bodyText":"Tony Blair yesterday defended his plans to introduce new powers including the mandatory drug testing of all those arrested by the police. He had launched this plan under the impression that hard drug abusers - particularly those on heroin and cocaine who steal to feed their habits - are one of the engines driving the crime rate in Britain. His claim rests on research which showed that 61% of those arrested in some inner city areas had illegal drugs in their system. For the prime minister the study provided further evidence for his long-held belief that drug-related offences account for a major proportion of all crime committed in Britain. This in turn justified introducing new police powers to allow the testing of those arrested. In addition, bail will be denied to those found to be heroin or cocaine abusers, whatever their original crime. But if tackling drugs is to form the centrepiece of this autumn's Queen's Speech, the government's well-intentioned long-term drugs strategy is clearly in the doldrums. Despite the appointment of a drugs tsar and the welcome change in emphasis from punishment to education, prevention and treatment, the new strategy has not yet made much of an impact. A national audit of policy earlier this year had to conclude that many of the initiatives launched in the drive against drug abuse were overloaded, ineffective or had never even been evaluated in the first place. There are no signs that any headway has been made in stemming the availability of drugs to young people. A closer look at the research on which this new clampdown is based shows that the prime minister is only giving half the picture. The ground-breaking study was carried out by Trevor Bennett, deputy director of Cambridge University's institute of criminology. Commissioned by the home office it tried out for the first time in Britain a well-established US research programme based on voluntary urine tests on some of those arrested. It included people arrested over a two-year period by officers based at police stations in Cambridge, Hammersmith, Nottingham, Sunderland, and Trafford in Manchester. The research did indeed find that 61% of those interviewed had taken at least one illegal drug. But what Tony Blair did not mention was that cannabis was the most common drug found in their blood with 46% testing positive. And as the research report puts it : \"Those who tested positive for cannabis alone were not heavily involved in acquisitive crime.\" The second major finding - also ignored by Blair - was that, at 25%, alcohol was actually the next most common drug found. In fact heroin users, at 18%, did account for a surprisingly large proportion of those arrested but nowhere near the 50% plus implied by Blair. Cocaine users also accounted for 10% but the study found a lot of overlap between class-A drug users who had multiple drug habits. The last group are undoubtedly responsible for a significant amount of property crime in Britain. It is estimated that a heroin addict who also uses crack raises about £20,300 a year illegally with about a third spent financing their habit. A heroin user alone raises about £13,500 a year illegally to spend on smack. This compares with an estimated annual illegal income of about £4,000 a year for the others arrested in the study. Those who tested positive for alcohol were much more likely to be involved in crimes of disorder than property. But the research suggested the group of class-A hard drug abusers were less likely to be burglars (only one in 10 arrested burglars tested positive for opiates) than shoplifters (of 90 shoplifters half tested positive for opiates and 30% for cocaine). This raises the question of whether addicts who have been arrested for shoplifting will be denied bail and kept on remand for such a minor offence if their drug test proves positive. What the research actually shows, then, is that although illegal hard drugs are a significant factor in driving up crime they are nowhere near as big an engine as Blair has implied. The next question is: what will happen to those who test positive once the new powers are introduced? Presumably most will be bailed for their original offence - having traces of cannabis in your bloodstream is not a criminal offence. Research into the effectiveness of the mandatory drug testing programme in Britain's prisons has yielded some interesting results. A study last year by the national addiction centre and a home office study based on interviews with staff and prisoners found that mandatory drug testing had had a substantial impact on the prevalence of drug misuse. Some 27% of those who had formerly misused drugs when in custody had claimed to have stopped completely; a further 15% said they had reduced their consumption; 6% reported they were taking less cannabis but continuing to use heroin; and 4% said they had experimented with heroin to avoid detection but had not carried on. The results show that if money is spent on providing treatment it can work. The government already has drug treatment and testing orders which can enforce attendance for those convicted of an offence. If the mandatory drug testing of arrestees is to produce any good Blair should make sure that there are sufficient drug treatment services to give those who test positive a chance to kick the habit. Now that could cut crime. Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor.

After wrapping up the day's events, the newsreader turns to the latest press release from the interior ministry telling how many people were beheaded by sword in a public square that day. Saudi Arabia has executed at least 87 people so far this year, a chilling increase on 1998, when 29 were beheaded. The state executes murderers, drug smugglers, rapists and those convicted of other violent crimes, all in the name of sharia law. In 1997 - when at least 100 people were reported executed in the first nine months - a Syrian man who worked for a nephew of King Fahd was put to the sword for practising witchcraft. Last Friday Saudi Arabia beheaded a Pakistani man convicted of trying to smuggle heroin in his abdomen. The Friday before that an Afghan and an Indian were decapitated, also for drug smuggling. Two Saudi men were beheaded in July for drug trafficking, robbery, and raping several boys. The sharp increase in the number of executions in the kingdom has alarmed human rights groups and shone a light, albeit a faint one, on the judicial practices of one of the most secretive societies in the world. Richard Bunting, a spokesman for Amnesty International, said the Saudi Arabian government had increased the list of offences which carried the death penalty in the past few years, but that it was not clear why the number of executions had risen so sharply this year. \"It is not clear what it is achieving,\" he said. \"There is still no clear evidence it deters crime internationally. Yet the Saudi Arabian government seems to have moved to increase executions and the wide range of offences carrying it. \"The Saudi Arabian government has been very unwilling to respond to our appeals to clarify details. Many processes are very secretive and there is a lack of transparency.\" Just as worrying, Amnesty says, is the number of foreign nationals who have been executed this year. In 1998 six non-Saudis were executed. So far this year at least 55 foreign nationals have been put to the sword. In its latest report on the issue, Amnesty said it was \"concerned that capital trials in Saudi Arabia do not comply with internationally recognised standards\". It said that defendants did not have the right to legal representation, that confessions had been used as the sole basis for convictions, and that foreign nationals were reportedly not always given sufficient translation facilities. Saudi Arabia has dismissed such allegations in the past, saying sharia guaranteed justice for all defendants. In its 1999 annual report on Saudi Arabia, Human Rights Watch said: \"The UK continued to subordinate human rights concerns to its military and commercial interests in the kingdom\". It was equally scathing about the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/sep/30/guardianobituaries","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-30T00:56:00Z","webTitle":"Theodora Turner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/sep/30/guardianobituaries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/sep/30/guardianobituaries","fields":{"headline":"Theodora Turner","bodyText":"Memories of matron in her tall Nightingale cap may belong to another age, but the career of Theodora Turner, the former Matron of St Thomas's Hospital who was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk and who has died aged 92, illustrates the power and scope of strong nursing leadership. She served as a bridge between the old and new order; the old with its near apostolic succession of powerful matrons at St Thomas's, and the new with the impact of the National Health Service on hospital staffing and advances in nursing and medical techniques. Her concerns, particularly her emphasis on student support and what we would now call quality audit and patient-centred care, have a resonance for the challenges facing today's NHS - without the jargon. Encounters with Theodora Turner were seldom forgotten. . Former students and nursing colleagues remember her sense of duty and discipline, her kindness and humour. The latter is, perhaps, most neatly encapsulated in her belief that her pet mynah bird, presented to her by sailors when working at Liverpool Royal Infirmary, was a foolproof burglar alarm because of its ability to mimic her laugh. She saw her 10 years as matron of St Thomas's and superintendent of the Nightingale training school from 1955-65 as a time of great social change and was eager to relax the strict rules which she believed had governed nurses' lives for too long. As well as St Thomas's and the nursing school, she was responsible for five other hospitals in London and Surrey. Born in Congleton, Cheshire, Theodora Turner was one of five children. Her father, a Cambridge graduate, served in the first world war and later became Conservative Party agent in Salisbury where Theodora attended the Godolphin School. Her parents sent her to the Edinburgh School of Domestic Science but she had already decided to become a nurse and, in 1929, entered the Nightingale School of Nursing at St Thomas's. She became an outstanding senior probationer, winning the silver medal - the highest award of her year - before undertaking midwifery training at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. In 1939, Theodora joined the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service and was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk, served in Iran and was later posted to the military hospital at Bari, Italy, working in the neurological unit. The war had a profound effect on her, in particular her experience in Bari when the port was bombed, ammunition ships blown up and she treated the terrible burns suffered by naval servicemen. After the war she became matron of the Royal Infirmary at Liverpool where she faced the challenge of amalgamating several training schools. She left after six years to care for her ageing parents and became education officer at the new Royal College of Nursing education centre in Birmingham. For Theodora, what was important was loyalty to work, colleagues and to the hospital. Patients, she told her nurses, must be respected. Her concern for nurses and nursing was obvious in her work with the Royal College of Nursing. Elected a member of the RCN Council while at Liverpool, she served on the staff side of the Whitley Council which negotiated nurses' pay, which she believed was \"disgraceful\". She retired in 1965 and moved to Scotland. In 1966 she was elected president of the Royal College of Nursing and the National Council of Nurses of the United Kingdom for two years. She was appointed OBE in 1961. At her retirement, colleagues remembered that \"The dullest conference or the most tiresome meeting could be enlivened by the faintest rustle of paper and a hint of peppermints in Miss Turner's row.\" Theodora Turner, matron, born August 5, 1907; died August 24, 1999"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/1999/sep/30/7","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"1999-09-30T00:56:31Z","webTitle":"Euro Disney revives plans for new extravaganza","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/sep/30/7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/1999/sep/30/7","fields":{"headline":"Euro Disney revives plans for new extravaganza","bodyText":"Euro Disney is to build a brand new £400m theme park dedicated to film and television alongside its present Disneyland Paris Magic Kingdom. The Disney Studio, a combination of theme park and working production studio, is due for completion in 2002 - 10 years after the Mickey Mouse extravaganza first opened for business in France. The new project will offer visitors a behind-the-scenes glimpse of movie-making and TV production, together with heart-stopping rides, an insight into the art of animation and a live car stunt show. The existing Magic Kingdom, at Marne-La-Vallee, east of Paris, is Europe's biggest tourist attraction, pulling in some 12.5m visitors a year. The new movie park, which will create 5,000 jobs, is expected to attract an additional 4.5m tourists in its first year. A second park was part of the original agreement between Disney and the French government in 1987, but the plan was abandoned in 1993 as Euro Disney struggled with mounting debt and a shortage of visitors. In the early years it reported massive losses, but its debts have since been restructured. The Saudi businessman Prince Alwaleed now owns 24% of the park and last year, after recording a £29m profit, plans for the second park were revived. Gilles Pelisson, president and chief executive of Euro Disney, yesterday spelled out details of the attractions that would greet visitors to the Disney Studio. Just inside the turnstiles will be a central plaza complete with fountains and palm trees, and tourists will walk down Studio Boulevard, lined with movie sets. They will be able to watch animation artists at work, take a tram tour of the studios and experience the thrills of special effects, such as earthquakes and dam bursts, in Catastrophe Canyon. Another attraction will be The Rock 'n' Roller, where visitors will be hurled by catapult into the world of pop video production accompanied by music specially composed by the rock group Aerosmith. Disney Studio will be financed with a mixture of new shares and loans. Euro Disney is selling Fr1.5bn (£146m) in new shares, of which 39% will be bought by the US-based Walt Disney Corporation, in line with its existing shareholding in the Paris park. The remaining Fr2.5bn will be borrowed from French investment firm Caisse des Despots et Consignations.

Whoever becomes mayor next May will be directly answerable to more voters in western Europe than anyone except the president of France. So if the best a free and democratic vote Tory party members can muster is an ageing Tory Lord with a propensity for mistaking Hindus for Muslims or a former conservative MP and legendary philanderer, what does that say about the whole institution of the London mayorship? Not a lot, the cynic might argue. The Archer-Norris contest only underlines the lack of credible mayoral hopefuls across the political spectrum. The Liberal Democrats' Susan Kramer is as yet invisible, while the motley crew vying for Labour's backing comprises the renegade Ken Livingstone, the political novice Trevor Phillips and the ministerial nonentities Nick Raynsford and Glenda Jackson. Cynics might add that this paucity of talent shows that political insiders realise the new mayor will be a mere figurehead, a \"glorified, though inexperienced, traffic controller\", in the words of one Guardian columnist. Outsiders may see the mayoral office as another sign of the skewed nature of power in the United Kingdom, with the capital perpetually attracting money, resources and media attention at the expense of the rest of the country. Norris's ludicrous pledge to put an \"end to the inequitable distribution of national spending which currently leaves London billions short\" only confirms the suspicion that the new mayor will accentuate the north-south divide. It's a lengthy charge-sheet, but it's largely wrong. London may not deserve more of the nation's resources, but it deserves democracy. Margaret Thatcher's abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986 was an unprecedented act of democratic vandalism and the capital has been bereft of a London-wide government ever since. The mayor's 25-strong assembly, to be elected by citizens of London next spring, is a fraction of the size and power of the GLC, but it will do more than merely attend finger buffets in the City. Although lacking the GLC's tax-raising powers, the mayor and assembly will take responsibility for transport in London, oversee the Metropolitan Police and direct urban regeneration in London. The best testament to the mayor's power is the apparent unwillingness of the control freaks at Labour HQ to allow Livingstone a clear run at the Labour candidacy. Tony Blair confirmed today that Labour still hadn't decided on a way of selecting its candidate; he obviously fears that Red Ken could be a real and radical threat to his elective dictatorship, just as the Livingstone-led GLC was a thorn in Thatcher's side. Ultimately, the new mayor will be judged on the impact he or she makes on ordinary Londoners' lives. The mayoral hopefuls are already generating a raft of innovative ideas for London - buying tickets at bus stops, free travel for students, issuing bonds to raise tube investment, a commissioner for dirt, free internet access in libraries, and provision of subsidised housing so that nurses and teachers can afford to live in central London. The quick implementation of some of these modest proposals is the essence of bringing government closer to the people. The mayor can make it happen. The cynics, and the control freaks in the Labour party, only need let it. Respecting codes of privacy When hackers break into your hotmail, you may not care very much. But you probably don't care for police searches without a warrant or submitting to drug testing on demand. You probably agree that the right to privacy is a fundamental one. The US government begs to differ and yesterday won a new hearing to seek to suppress the use and sale of encryption codes. The justice department argues that regulation is crucial to prevent data-scrambling technologies getting in terrorist hands. Never mind the fact that the US government isn't so careful with who they sell arms to. By trying to regulate encryption, the US is leading the way in undermining the security (and future success) of e-commerce, as well as trampling individuals' right to privacy. And the danger is that the other governments of the western world will follow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/oct/02/paulbrown","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-02T01:28:17Z","webTitle":"Political fallout deals blow to Sellafield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/oct/02/paulbrown","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/oct/02/paulbrown","fields":{"headline":"Political fallout deals blow to Sellafield","bodyText":"The fallout from the Japanese nuclear disaster could severely damage British Nuclear Fuels' (BNFL) business interests and increase UK safety concerns that have already prompted a 13-strong inspection team to visit the Sellafield plant after a series of \"incidents\". Sellafield is Britain's biggest yen earner because of its reprocessing of spent fuel from Japanese reactors, but BNFL's reputation suffered in Japan when it revealed last month that documents supposed to be a record of safety checks on newly made plutonium fuel had been falsified. Yesterday as the first shipment of this plutonium fuel, known as MOX, arrived in Japan from Sellafield a spokesman for BNFL conceded that Japan's worst nuclear accident had come at a difficult time for the company. Although there was absolutely no connection between MOX fuel and what had happened at the Japanese plant, it would affect public opinion. \"It is too early to say whether it will hit our business plans for new contracts,\" he said. Getting new contracts is vital to the future of Sellafield's reprocessing works and a new £300m MOX fuel plant attached to it which the government has yet to give permission to start production. The decision has been awaited for more than three years and been referred back to ministers twice after doubts that it could ever make a profit. The issue of the falsified documents and the public antagonism to nuclear power in Japan that is bound to follow the accident may slow the conversion and licensing of Japanese reactors to allow them to take MOX fuel. The problem for BNFL and the Japanese is the increasing build-up of plutonium, for which there is no other market and no use apart from turning into expensive fuel for reactors that would otherwise be powered by cheaper uranium. Plutonium is described as the most toxic material in the world and unless carefully handled is capable of \"going critical\", replicating the kind of accident that occurred in Japan. It has the added disadvantage of having to be constantly guarded to avoid it falling into the hands of terrorists or unsavoury regimes. Fears of lax safety have surfaced in Britain as a result of moves towards privatisation of 50% of BNFL, which the government announced this summer. The Japanese plant where the accident occurred is privately owned and workers were said to have cut corners to speed up processes. As well as the privatisation of British Energy, which owns eight of Britain's newest nuclear stations, the use of private contractors has been increasing in the rest of Britain's nuclear industry and causing concern for the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII). The inspectorate is currently conducting safety audits at British Energy which made safety staff redundant. Leaked reports suggest it has been ordered to re-employ some of them. Two years ago, in the worst condemnation ever written by a government safety inspector, the United Kingdom Atomic Authority was condemned for letting safety standards slip at its Dounreay plant in Scotland. Lack of control of private contractors was said to be a primary cause and the inspectorate made 146 recommendations for safety improvements."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/oct/02/duncancampbell.linusgregoriadis","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-02T01:28:28Z","webTitle":"Family tell of their shock at nanny's harsh jail term","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/02/duncancampbell.linusgregoriadis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/oct/02/duncancampbell.linusgregoriadis","fields":{"headline":"Family tell of their shock at nanny's harsh jail term","bodyText":"The family of nanny Manjit Basuta last night spoke of their shock at her 25-year prison sentence for causing the death of a child in her care in San Diego, California. Amarjit Singh, her brother, was one of many relatives and supporters who had gathered at a Sikh temple in Slough, Berkshire. He broke down in tears when he heard the news. Vowing to clear her name, he said he was shocked by a justice system that could give his sister a sentence comparable to that given to the serial killer Myra Hindley. He added: \"We will appeal. An appeal will get our questions aired. There has been an injustice here. \"Devastation is not the word. Shock is not the word. The American legal system is supposed to be one of the best in the world but they still use chains, for God's sake. Was this racially motivated or was it politically motivated?\" Sukdave Singh, another brother who lives in Britain, said: \"This was a gutless judge who has put an innocent lady behind bars.\" John Cooper, a member of Basuta's legal team, called on the government to support their campaign to overturn her conviction. \"We have seen the course things have taken in America and we'll be looking to Tony Blair to intervene on behalf of Manjit,\" he said. Mr Cooper also called for Basuta to begin her sentence in the United Kingdom while the appeal process got under way. Zafar Ali, chairman of the campaign to free Basuta, said her supporters were angry that she had been forced to wait for a sentence which could have been given after her conviction in June. Stephen Jakobi, of the British organisation Fair Trials Abroad, last night said he was hopeful that she would be given a retrial. \"What is very important is that this was a deeply flawed trial, and when people look at the sentence it is quite obvious that the case is eminently appealable,\" he added. \"I have no doubt that a court of appeal will find a case for ordering a retrial.\" In August, the judge said he had a choice between granting probation and sentencing her to a minimum of 25 years. He had asked both sides to make submissions on the issue. Mr Cooper said the statute which meant that the judge could only choose between these options was inhumane. He said: \"If this sort of sentence was passed in a so-called lesser developed country, the whole world would be up in arms.\" Amarjit Singh accused the judge of being spiteful in delaying the sentencing. He said: \"He put us on hold for two months, giving Manjit and the family a ray of sunshine which we put our hopes on.\" He accused the judge of increasing their suffering by keeping her waiting yesterday. \"He could have sentenced her four hours ago. Was this his way of punishing Manjit in a cruel and deliberate manner? The way the sentence was given was appalling.\" The judge said that his request for more submissions from both sides had been misconstrued as a sign that he was favouring probation."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/1999/oct/02/food.foodanddrink","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-02T01:28:30Z","webTitle":"French keep ban on British beef","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/oct/02/food.foodanddrink","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/1999/oct/02/food.foodanddrink","fields":{"headline":"French keep ban on British beef","bodyText":"The European commission threatened legal action yesterday over the French government's decision to retain the ban on British beef imports because a report from its national food safety agency concluded there were insufficient scientific guarantees to lift it. David Byrne, the new commissioner in charge of health and consumer protection, said the commission had scrapped the three-year EU-wide ban from August 1 based on sound scientific advice, and the French government had come up with no new evidence to disprove it. The French health and agriculture ministries said Paris had decided to \"interrupt the process of lifting the embargo on British beef\" after a report from the French health and food safety agency, AFSSA, that \"given the latest data and analyses, there were insufficient scientific guarantees to lift the embargo\". AFSSA said the risk of the United Kingdom exporting contaminated beef \"cannot be considered to have been totally brought under control\", adding that based on current data, some 3,000 cases of BSE could arise in British cattle in 1999 - far higher than in France, where 19 cases have been reported so far this year. The announcement was met with outrage by British farmers and incomprehension from the agriculture minister, Nick Brown. Downing Street said Tony Blair would leave his French counterpart, Lionel Jospin, \"in no doubt about our feelings on this. We will be pressing the French government to reject this advice.\" Mr Byrne said the commission would be \"obliged to take the necessary infringement proceedings under the treaty\" - which could eventually lead to the European court of justice - if Paris used the report as a pretext not to lift the ban, imposed in March 1996 after evidence emerged linking BSE-infected meat to a new strain of the fatal human brain disease CJD. The incoming Irish commissioner said that at first sight the French report seemed to include no information not already considered by the EU's scientific steering committee. \"The grounds for the decision to lift the ban were taken on sound scientific advice and on the basis of strict safeguards designed to ensure that UK beef exports pose no threat to public health,\" he said. The National Farmers' Union said it was \"absolutely staggered\" by theFrench move. \"There is no justification for a ban of any sort on British beef,\" said the union's president, Ben Gill. He said the NFU expected the government to take the firmest possible action to ensure that the law was upheld, adding that British farmers had put in place all the measures asked of them and were confident their product was now safe. In Paris, however, the French consumer group Que Choisir applauded the decision and said it could trigger similar moves in other EU states. \"We are very satisfied that France has decided to show more respect for the consumer than the European commission, which took a premature and irresponsible decision,\" it said. Mr Brown said the advice presented to the French government seemed to have underestimated the \"very powerful\" public protection measures now in place in Britain. He said he had told his French counterpart, Jean Glavany, that the government's case was based on science and the technical implementation of the export scheme. \"British beef that leaves our country is among the safest in the world,\" Mr Brown said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"travel/1999/oct/02/3","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-02T17:56:21Z","webTitle":"Night of the headhunters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/1999/oct/02/3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/1999/oct/02/3","fields":{"headline":"Night of the headhunters","bodyText":"It was another day in the rainforest. Overhead, a sound like a cascading cutlery drawer indicated that something, a hornbill or an orang-utan, had collided painfully with a trellis of palm leaves. Somewhere to the right, something, possibly a bearded pig, or possibly worse, was fidgeting through the liquorice-dark foliage. On the ground, scavenger ants the size of small spanners hopped over ground pockmarked by the tunnels of burrowing reptiles. The thrill about a holiday in Borneo is that you are never quite sure what - human or animal - might be about to emerge from behind a strangler vine and scare you stupid, or possibly shred you limb from limb. Winston, our sallow lamp-post of a guide, squinted through his spectacles at a concrete slab just visible through the sharp-thorned undergrowth. This, he whispered, reverently tilting back his bush hat, was the grave of a great headhunter that had found itself encircled by the grounds of the new Holiday Inn. He thrust his hand into the undergrowth and pulled out a half-full bottle of rice wine, which he tipped into a concrete slot aligned with the departed warrior's stomach. \"Chief, I am come,\" Winston intoned as if pleading through a student keyhole for entry to a party. \"Yes, I have brought my friends. Do not harm us.\" This was our second encounter with headhunter culture in 24 hours. The practice was outlawed by the British regimes which used to run the northern rim of the world's third-largest island, but tourist authorities know that \"Borneo\" and \"headhunting\" fit together in the traveller's subconscious like \"rude\" and \"French\". A word with one of the agencies in Kuching - the capital of the north-western segment of Borneo that is now the Malaysian state of Sarawak - and you are soon skidding into former skull-collecting country onboard a 20ft long, V-shaped canoe propelled alternately by a very large outboard motor and a pole clasped by a teenage native balanced precipitously on the bow gunwale. Sarawak was run between 1841 and 1945 by the fabulous Brooke family. Their dynasty began when 38-year-old James, a liberal adventurer from Bath, put down a rebel lion in the interior and was promptly granted rajahship, by a grateful Sarawak court, over 200,000 Malays, Chinese and Dyaks. A man of some style, James impressed the head-hunting Land Dyaks with magic-lantern shows of Napoleon at Waterloo, and they in turn impressed him with an unexpected sociability. Their affectionate disposition also drove them to an extreme form of body-piercing. In the national museum at Kuching, a display cabinet is devoted to the delicate art of lacing miniature wooden battens into the male reproductive organ, an idea apparently borrowed from the rhinoceros. Whether that tradition still thrives remains unclear: the figures who sprang from mangrove bushes to heave our canoe on to its final sandbar were clearly Trouser Dyaks. The instinct for hospitality remains intact, however. After we had fought our way up the river bank, we were conducted on to the veranda of what turned out to be a sort of Dyak guest house for passing backpackers. \"Coke or Seven-Up?\" enquired the Dyak concierge, prising open the lid of a chest freezer. The natives themselves lived on the opposite bank of the river in the traditional stilted longhouse, a wood and corrugated-iron structure that is rather like an expanded version of the old-style railway carriage. The open corridor, or veranda, serves as a general lounging area and community dormitory for unmarried Dyaks. Families cook and sleep in the darkened cabins that run off the corridor at right angles. The corrugated iron was a recent government innovation, we were told, as too many longhouses had been catching fire. The longhouse veranda appeared entirely populated by old men snoozing on rush mats and mothers bouncing babies. But by the time our heads poked over the shaky 10ft ladder that connected the veranda to the jungle floor, it had magically filled up with Trouser Dyaks earnestly chopping firewood, grating coconuts, stringing necklaces, shelling peanuts and weaving mats. The headman, a tiny, stern-faced figure in grubby chinos and green synthetic shirt, greeted his visitors solemnly and shuffled us into his gloomy private suite, where we noted two gas cookers, two television sets and a ghetto-blaster. Behind the headman's bedroom door was a large safe which, he explained, stored the takings from his in-longhouse grocery business. \"These are for you and your people,\" the tour leader beamed, staggering across with a mailbag's-worth of cigarettes and chocolate. Each longhouse received two per tourist, but the guide had explained during the four-hour drive from Kuching that Dyak tradition demanded a more personal gesture from their jungle guests. The headman's eyes lit up and he passed round a bottle of rice wine. We had been warned that this was an extremely potent brew, likely to plunge feeble-bodied Westerners into heavy hallucination, but it turned out to have the punch of a mild sherry. Feeling a bit like parents caught up in an ambitious school production of the Tempest, we settled down to watch a languorous display of dancing performed by women in glitter waistcoats and men in feathers and dusty, cucumber-green Y-fronts. After 15 minutes, the dancers retired, to be replaced by a line of sarong-clad women selling blow-pipes and wooden carvings. Be warned: blow-pipes can prove a troublesome investment. The most attractive ones have a built-in spear attachment which is guaranteed to snag on designer jungle kit. And Malaysia Airlines' stewardesses will confiscate the best-camouflaged blow-pipes on the grounds that they are a lethal weapon. As we sluiced our way back to civilisation, our group debated whether artificial encounters like this did anything more than inflate the profits of Sarawak travel agencies. On balance, though, it was felt likely that Dyak self-image could only be enhanced by the knowledge that out-of-condition Westerners were prepared to travel thousands of miles to watch their dances and drink their rice sherry. The two principal cities of northern Borneo are Kota Kinabalu, in the Malaysian state of Sabah, and Kuching where James Brooke established his private imperial headquarters in 1841. Kota Kinabalu is a pragmatic sort of place, largely as a result of being obliterated in turn by the Japanese and Americans during the second world war. Kuching means \"Cat\" in Malay and is an altogether more exotic place. The Kuching hotel, coincidentally, was the worst we stayed in, which still made it superior to most British city centre establishments. In their regular, querulous, memos to the bored Foreign Office, the Brookes predicted that \"the dark-skinned races\" would certainly take over the East and probably the world. In terms of hotel management, at least, they have been proved correct. T he three major seaside facilities at Damai Beach (Sarawak), Tanjung Aru and Rasa Ria (both Kota Kinabalu) are not so much five-star lodgings as ethereal compositions of foliage, light and ingenuity. And when you finally get bored with watching sunsets on the South China Sea, you can head off on carefully-supervised excursions into the Bornean wilderness. Speedboats zip Tanjung Aru clients into the offshore 12,000-acre Tunku Abdul Rahman national park, where the feeblest snorkellers can admire 3ft sea slugs and the carcasses of defused (hopefully) second world war bombs. This hotel even has a private nature reserve with a private orang-utan - Jagot, a five-year-old male, who bounces after visitors attempting to wrench their trousers down. Borneans have a particular affection for the orange-haired apes, whose name means \"forest person\". The apotheosis of Bornean eco-tourism lies four hours up-country from Kuching. The Batang Ai Holiday Inn, the same one that \"captured\" the headhunter's grave, is probably the most ecologically-correct hotel in the world. Allegedly built with non-endangered hardwoods in the style of the Land Dyak longhouse, the Batang Ai is accessible only by helicopter or 30-seater launch that takes 20 minutes to traverse the artificial lake that shields customers from distasteful petrol fumes and the attentions of Mugging Dyaks. Inside, guests wash with the contents of economy-size detergent bottles rather than wasteful individual soap bars before moving on to meals from which all left-overs, we were assured, were fed to the staff. After browsing through hotel copies of Fascinating Snakes of South-east Asia and Poisonous Plants of Malaysia, guests relax with a lecture by the Batang Ai's resident naturalist. Winston Marshall is a laconic, 60-year-old self- styled \"jungle wallah\" with Scottish, English, Irish and Bornean grandparents and a spectacular curriculum vitae. At five years old, he was imprisoned by the Japanese; a decade later, he ran away from his father's logging camp. After a variety of employers, including the British diplomatic service, he ended up in the Sarawak police army fighting rebels in neighbouring Brunei. He became a guide after spending a boring six months in his wife's tribe's longhouse: \"I kept seeing the same faces every day.\" Winston is clearly the first man to recruit for any rainforest expedition. \"If it is useful, medicinal, or edible, I will know about it,\" he boasted as we squeezed painfully through another clump of Wait-a-Minute Thorn. He pointed out which green leaves cured boils, epilepsy and flatulence, which ones served as sandpaper and cooking foil, and which one is being investigated by the Cancer Research Institute of Maryland for possible Aids applications. He swore he had known a native chief who had survived a brutal chainsaw accident by the swift application of Straits rhododendron to his bleeding stump. \"There are some edible ferns here, but they've all been taken by the staff,\" he grumbled later, poking his machete about a hotel flowerbed. Awe at being this time in the presence of a genuine Prospero was only slightly compromised by the later revelation that damming the Batang Ai lake for hydro-electricity had meant submerging 10 longhouses and relocating 29 others, along with their 3,000 inhabitants. Ruefully, it has to be acknowledged that there are some forces even Dyaks cannot resist.

Judging by his interview on Radio 4's Today programme last week, it is the journalist rather than the politician. Three times, and with increasing exasperation, he men tioned \"the Daily Telegraphs of this world\", a synonym for those rightwing \"forces of conservatism\" he detests. It was significant too that on the last day of the Labour conference one of the loudest laughs was for a speaker who suggested that high street shoppers would soon be confronted by two sets of paper sellers. Opposite the students crying \"Buy your Socialist Worker\" would be a group of Tory fanatics shouting \"Save Britain from Blair! Get your Daily Telegraph here.\" The paper's new rightist crusade also coincides with the emergence of Moore on the public stage as an increasingly political figure in the rather surprising form of agitator and activist. A couple of weeks ago he addressed a rally in Belfast aimed at defeating Chris Patten's suggested reforms of the RUC. Last Monday he was on the countryside march in Bournemouth during the Labour party conference, complaining about the threat to fox hunting. Both protests have also figured sympathetically in the Telegraph's pages. On Tuesday, the paper launched a Save the RUC campaign with a front-page colour blurb urging readers to turn to a thundering editorial. Two days later, the paper published a tabloid-style cut-out-and-send-in petition coupon. At 42, and after four years as Daily Telegraph editor, what is Moore up to? In his modern Canary Wharf office with its reminders of times past - the old Telegraph leader-writing desk and a cartoon of his former mentors, TE (Peter) Utley, Colin Welch and Bill Deedes - he tackles every question with a characteristic combination of hesitancy and forcefulness. Replies are punctuated with \"ers\" and \"ums\", sudden changes of tense or direction, but the meaning is always clear. \"Most Telegraph readers are unpolitical,\" he says. \"They may have strong beliefs, but they don't spend all day thinking about politics. When I was on the countryside march, people kept coming up to say how much they liked the paper and were so grateful for what it's doing. One girl even came whizzing out of the crowd, kissed me, and ran off again. It does make you feel you mean something to people. I can't imagine the equivalent happening to the Times.\" Was this what he meant previously when suggesting the Telegraph had a soul which the Times lacked? \"Soul may be an over-exalted word for it. See it instead in terms of the agglomeration of things in a person's character, their beliefs, behaviour and mannerisms. That's also what people value in a newspapers: character. They know it, like it and, in such circumstances, will even forgive it its faults.\" He regards the Times's price-cutting strategy as having weakened that paper - \"it is down-market and incoherent\" - and blames its owner, Rupert Murdoch. \"He is a very cynical and destructive person who plainly doesn't want to build a good broadsheet paper.\" To illustrate the relationship between his own paper and its readers, he cites the publication a few months ago of a six-part supplement on the history of Christianity. \"It had no TV advertising, but sales went up each week. It was a hunch, but it showed we know our readers.\" But do they have the same enthusiasm for his paper's relentless assault on the government? I suggest he has been much more hostile towards Blair than rivals. \"I wouldn't say much more, but we've certainly been less illuded [he pauses briefly to ask \"Is that English? I'm not sure\"] than some other conservative papers. Too many rightwing newspapers are power-worshippers, so they suck up to whoever is boss. They allowed themselves to be fooled into thinking that Blair was somehow on the side of what they believe in. That's because he's good at flattery and seemed like a winner, and they like winners.\" Then his real feelings shine through. \"I do think Blair is very arrogant and I don't think he has any understanding about the restraints of the constitution. We were right to say he was a good choice to be leader of the Labour party because the party needed it. The question is: does the country?\" At that point cartoonist Nick Garland arrives to show Moore his offering. After a week in which the main subject of Garland's work has been Blair's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, I ask if he features yet again. Moore laughs. \"Actually, he does.\" Campbell, he says, is becoming Garland's motif, echoing Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell's use of John Major's underpants. This eccentricity sets the Telegraph apart from the rest of the Tory press. Moore returns to Blair, saying of his conference speech: \"It was rather demented. The sheer venom was interesting. When he came to power, it was all about \"the giving age\" and \"we'll all be nice to one another\". Now he's quite embittered. I don't understand it because he's miles ahead in the polls, so why pick a fight with the people whose votes he sought? \"He seemed to accuse Daily Telegraph readers of killing Stephen Lawrence, assassinating Martin Luther King, imprisoning Nelson Mandela and refusing to give votes to women. He has a curious hatred for many strands of what I would see as the backbone of Britain, the small 'c' conservative-minded people. Though he got into power on their backs, he seems to have a great detestation for them.\" Moore sees this in Blair's attitude towards fox hunting and it is one of the reasons for his joining the countryside protest. The other is personal: for the last three years he has ridden with the East Sussex and Romney Marsh Hunt - so he was supporting his team. I ask him if he has ever caught a fox? \"Of course... but not personally, no. That's not how it works.\" He insists that his paper's pro-hunting stance is based on more than a simple personal interest: \"The Telegraph has strongly identified itself with the countryside movement and a lot of our readers come from rural areas. We're probably read by more farmers than any other paper. After last year's march we sold 25,000 more copies than usual.\" Commerce aside, his opposition is political. \"People feel persecuted for all sorts of reasons, not just to do with hunting, and it's important for the paper to be a conduit for those feelings.\" Northern Ireland is surely a different matter. Moore is a leading member of Friends of the Union, a disparate group of politicians, academics and journalists, formed in angry reaction to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. He concedes that his commitment to the full integration of Northern Ireland into the United Kingdom - no Stormont, no power-sharing, no devolution - is a personal one, but argues that it is relevant to Telegraph readers because it is \"related to the whole way we govern a free country... it matters and it should be part of the current political discourse.\" Why save the RUC though? \"I think it's odd that people think it's odd. Why shouldn't a British quality broadsheet defend the part of our police force which happens to be the best in the world at defending a free people against terrorism? There is nothing more important for us than that people uphold the rule of law. It seems a core thing for a paper like the Telegraph.\" But it's 93% Protestant and there is compelling evidence that RUC officers have colluded in murder. He admits only to \"anxieties\" and counters that it has a higher approval rating among nationalists than has been publicised. Patten's name also comes up when talking about the Times because it initially failed to report the fact that Murdoch's publishers had rejected Patten's book on Hong Kong. For Moore, it was \"a classic case\" of bad editorship, allowing news values to be distorted by other considerations. But was there not a similar case recently when the Telegraph failed to carry the Bloody Sunday report which revealed, at last, that none of the victims could have been carrying a weapon? He hesitates. \"I think it did appear in early editions but it got chucked out on the night. It was a mistake and should have run all through.\" Why no mention then of last week's Mori poll finding that Blair's and Labour's popularity had strengthened? \"It was in the final edition, I think. But it wasn't a big story. Our poll has been saying the same every month, which isn't good for the Tories.\" I note that the Telegraph has soft-pedalled on Hague, observing that it's as if he's not there. Moore exclaims: \"Isn't that what people in the country feel?\" and then adds: \"We're quite strongly, if undramatically, supportive of him, actually.\" But that's clearly a secondary matter. Moore's primary engagement is fighting Blair. Watch out for those Telegraph paper-sellers any day now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/oct/06/pinochet.chile","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-06T16:17:52Z","webTitle":"Pinochet was this country's staunch, true friend","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/oct/06/pinochet.chile","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/oct/06/pinochet.chile","fields":{"headline":"Pinochet was this country's staunch, true friend","bodyText":"My friends thank you for the fantastic welcome.

But first I want to extend a personal welcome to our Chilean guests, who have come half way round the world to be with us. They should understand the deep sense of shame and anger we feel at the way in which Chile - its honour, its dignity, its sovereignty and its former ruler - have been treated. I do not know when or how this tragedy will end. But we will fight on for as long as it takes to see Senator Pinochet returned safely to his own country.

Our ties are very close and have been ever since Admiral Cochrane helped free Chile from oppressive Spanish rule.

During the Falklands War the Chilean airforce was commanded by the father of Senator Evelyn Matthei, here with us this evening. He gave us early warning of Chilean air attacks which allowed the task force to take defensive action. The value of the intelligence was proved when it stopped. One day, near the end of the conflict, the Chilean long-range radar had to be switched off for overdue maintenance. That same day - Tuesday 8th June, a date etched in my heart - Argentinean planes attacked and destroyed our ships the Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram. They were landing ships with many people aboard and they left us with heavy casualties. Altogether some 250 members of our armed forces lost their lives during the Falklands War. Without President Pinochet there would certainly have been many more. We all owe him, and Chile, a great debt of gratitude. But how did the authorities under this Labour Government chose to repay it? I will tell you - by collaborating in Senator Pinochet's judicial kidnap. The precise extent of Ministers' and officials' involvement with the Spanish authorities is still obscure. But we know a good deal about the catalogue of abuses which occurred. We know that Senator Pinochet was treated on his arrival, as on previous occasions, as an honoured guest. We know that the Chileans were led to believe that he was safe when the British authorities already knew that to be false. We know that he was arrested by night, on his bed of pain after a spinal operation, in circumstances which would do credit to a police state. We know that he was held first in a tiny room at a clinic under sedation, and then in a house where he wasn't even allowed to set foot in the garden. We know that this was done under what the courts later ruled was an unlawful arrest warrant. We know that the authorities knew it was unlawful because they hurriedly sent lawyers to Spain to draw up a new one. We know that Senator Pinochet's guilt was publicly prejudiced by a Labour Cabinet Minister. We know that for the first time in its history the House of Lords had to set aside its ruling because a Law Lord failed to declare an interest - and that the judge in question was then publicly exonerated by Labour's Lord Chancellor. I never thought in my lifetime to see the honour of Britain and the reputation of British justice so demeaned as in this affair. All those responsible must be shamed and held publicly to account. As has been confirmed at the recent hearing Senator Pinochet is still legally prevented from answering in a British court any of the charges against him. And his accusers do not, it seems, have to present here any evidence of guilt as several speakers have mentioned on this point. Under the Extradition Treaty the case can only be heard in Spain. That treaty envisaged of course that all the courts of countries which signed the Extradition Convention would behave in an honest and equitable fashion and that those extradited would receive a fair trial. But the Spanish judicial procedure in this matter has been little short of scandalous. The Spanish Socialist prosecuting magistrate has simply assembled any charge whatsoever that he thinks might fit the bill - even though there is no evidence of Senator Pinochet's involvement in, or even knowledge of, the cases concerned and even though not one concerns a Spaniard. It is well known that counselling this prosecuting magistrate at every stage is Allende's former political adviser, working with a network of other Marxists in Spain and Chile. The chance of Senator Pinochet's receiving anything resembling what we in Britain would recognise as 'justice' in a Spanish court as minimal - not least because key witnesses for his defence run the risk of immediate arrest if they set foot on Spanish soil. What is planned is a [show-style] show-trial with a preordained outcome - lingering death in a foreign land. All this has many implications. There are implications for Chile where the small minority of communists who once nearly wrecked the country under Allende will now be encouraged to overturn the prosperous, democratic order that Pinochet and his successors built. There are implications my friends for Britain whose interests will be jeopardised, not just in the Falklands and South America, but in isolated enclaves round the world where friends will see how we reward past deeds of friendship. And there are implications for heads of government everywhere as they see that at some future date they may be hauled out of hospital in a foreign country at the dead of night to face some trumped up charge. My friends, these are vial matters for our Party to ponder. We must pay heed to the implications of an international lynch-law which, under the guise of defending human rights, now threatens to subvert British justice and the rights of sovereign nations. The people of Britain too should reflect on what has been revealed about the priorities of the Labour Government. For this is a government that grovels to collaborate with Spain, whose bullying of Gibraltar is a daily outrage, yet treats our Chilean allies with contempt. This is a government which reckons that ageing spies, who betrayed our country to Soviet communism, should escape prosecution - yet obsessively pursues the frail 83 year old Pinochet who stopped the communists from taking Chile. This is a government which grants amnesties to unrepentant terrorist murderers yet overturns an amnesty in Chile and imperils that country's young democracy. My friends, this is a government which dishonours and discredits Britain. Make no mistake revenge by the Left, not justice for the victim, is what the Pinochet case is all about. Senator Pinochet is in truth on trial, not for anything contained in Judge Garzon's indictment, but for defeating communism. What the left can't forgive is that Pinochet undoubtedly saved Chile and helped save South America. But don't take my word for it. Listen instead to President Aylwin, Pinochet's democratically elected successor and frequent opponent, who said: \"the Allende government was planning, with the assistance of an armed militia of enormous military power, to establish a communist dictatorship\". That, ladies and gentlemen, was what Pinochet stopped. As he himself admits there were abuses in the wake of the military coup. And some of these continued. The precise responsibility for what happened can only be judged in Chile. But it is an affront to common sense as well as a caricature of justice to maintain that a head of government must automatically accept criminal responsibility for everything that is done while he is in power - whether he authorised it or not. On that basis Messrs Blair and Straw should accept criminal responsibility for everything done in every prison or police station throughout the United Kingdom - and then be extradited to Spain to answer for it. Why is it, I wonder, that those queuing up to accuse Senator Pinochet of every grotesque abuse imaginable don't mention the positive legacy of his rule in Chile? What about the fact that Chile was turned from chaotic collectivism into the model economy of Latin America? What about the fact that more people were housed, that medical care was improved, that infant mortality plummeted, that life expectancy rose, that highly effective programmes against poverty were launched? Above all why don't they tell the world that it was Senator Pinochet who established a constitution for the return to democracy? That he held a referendum to decide whether or not he should remain in power? That he lost the vote (though gaining 44 per cent support)? And that he respected the result and handed over to an elected successor? But of course we know why none of these achievements are talked about. It's because the Left don't want them to be talked about - or even (if they can help it) known about. My friends, the Left lost the Cold War in Chile, as they lost it everywhere else. For our Home Secretary, who visited Chile as a young left-wing activist, that must have been very distressing. It can hardly have been much pleasanter for our Prime Minister, who recently described Allende as his \"hero\". The Left in Chile, and in Britain, had to abandon all the rhetoric and most of the policies of socialism in order to get power. But what they couldn't and wouldn't abandon was the poisonous prejudices they harboured in their youth. And this, of course, was the situation when a trusting, elderly, former Chilean ruler chose to pay one too many visits to his beloved Britain last autumn. When the communists so nearly assassinated him in 1986 President Pinochet knew that he was being fired on by his enemies. Little could he imagine that a new, legal and political assassination was to be planned for him in the Britain he trusted as a friend. Perhaps his enemies will succeed. Perhaps he will die here, as this country's only political prisoner. Or perhaps he will breathe his last in a Spanish hospital, awaiting some interminable, contemptible semblance of justice. But at least he will know, and the world will know that his friends did not abandon his cause and that those whom the Left would like to silence - but dare not - have proclaimed the truth about his treatment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/oct/07/conservatives1999.conservatives6","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-07T13:46:06Z","webTitle":"\"Then he's out on his elephant...\"","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/oct/07/conservatives1999.conservatives6","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/oct/07/conservatives1999.conservatives6","fields":{"headline":"\"Then he's out on his elephant...\"","bodyText":"On the platform today is the hardworking and talented DETR team. There's Bernard Jenkin - our man on the bike. Damian Green - our man in the countryside. Nigel Waterson - our man leading our great recovery in local government. Shaun Woodward - our man on the Tube. Jacqui Lait - our woman with the whip. And our Peers. Let's have a big round of applause for them all. And let's have a round of applause for all those Councillors who have won seats from Labour and the Liberals over the last year. As the Councillor from Blyth said yesterday, if we can win in Blyth, we can win anywhere. There is another member of the team. That's me - your man in the Jag - well, it takes one to catch one. When Tony Blair said to John Prescott he wanted to clear the cars off the road, John Prescott took him seriously. He should have known better. Tony always spins one thing and does another. But when William said he wanted me to shadow John Prescott and try and drive his transport policy off the road. I took him seriously. Because William does know better. William says what he means, and means what he says. That's why William will make a much better Prime Minister than Tony Blair. Well I have a confession to make. I am a motorist. I cannot help myself. I don't have a bus stop at my door or a train station at the bottom of my garden. And I don't want to walk several miles laden with a week's shopping. So I speak for everyone else in this country who has to use their car. We're not out to wreck the planet. We do care about the environment but we often have no choice. I find I am not alone in using the car. When we opposed the M4 Bus Lane, little did I think I would attract so much high level support. Even the Prime Minister himself waded in on my side. It was particularly generous of the Prime Minister to illustrate the insanity of it all - by driving up the bus lane in his own chauffeured Jaguar. What a crazy idea - a bus lane in the fast lane of a motorway. Who would have thought they'd actually do it, rather than just spin it in a newspaper ? Just look at their transport policies. Read their White Paper. No sign of the private money they promised for the Tube. Petrol prices the highest in Europe and going higher. And a long list of cancelled bypasses. John Prescott's idea of a good transport system is one where most of us are priced or forced off the road - leaving them free for New Labour's cronies. Indeed their policy of trying to tax the motorist off the road is very New Labour. If you are rich you can go by car, if you are poor you can't go at all. If you live in a city, there may be a bus or a train. If you live in the country, you've had it. If you give enough money to New Labour then by coincidence you can become a minister. That gives you the all clear to have a chauffeured car and to use it. New Labour ministers don't go for a stroll on the prom, they go for a drive on it. If John Prescott and New Labour want to tell us how to travel, they should show us how to do it first. When I asked John Prescott how many times he had come to the office by train or bus, I was told that he could not answer that question. I can. I reckon the answer is - NEVER. He goes by car - unless it's a photo opportunity. Under pressure, New Labour try to retaliate. They point out that I go to work by car, sometimes. Yes, I confess it - they are right. Sometimes, the car is the best way of travelling. We Conservatives stand up for other people's rights to go by car. By attacking me Labour are just underlining their own hypocrisy. And I do travel by train and by Tube - but I've yet to bump into any Labour ministers when I do. Maybe I should travel by helicopter - then I'm sure I'd bump into John Prescott, Jack Cunningham, Robin Cook and all the rest of them. \"Can you blame them ? They've seen Labour's transport future - and they know it doesn't work. Just look at Oxford, Henley, Bristol and many other places. The road closures in Oxford are so bad, even the Park and Ride buses are now impossibly late. The road closures in Henley have caused so much chaos that traders are likely to go bust. And in Bristol, they've already dug up the roads in anticipation of Prescott's massively-delayed Transport Bill. That's why sensible Labour ministers fly above it all - washing their hands of the chaos they've created below. John Prescott's dug himself into an even bigger hole - promising 'immediate benefits' for the travelling public before the election - and failing to deliver afterwards. We, the public, have paid for the roads. Now the government dares to say we cannot use them. They waste our taxes - only a fifth of all the money raised from motorists is spent on transport. Still, John Prescott certainly brightens up my life. You never know what photo opportunity he is setting up next. One day he is driving a new energy-efficient car - the sort of private vehicle he wants to stop you driving - so he drives it into a taxi. That sums up his whole transport policy in one. Another day he's off on a train. He only goes one stop - then it's back into the Jag. That sums up New Labour's hypocrisy in one. Then he's out on his elephant. Is this going to be the only way left to travel ? I hope not. It's slow. It's unreliable. And it's certainly not pollution-free. But it does sum up how Labour only has one transport policy - trampling on the motorist. Yet even I felt sorry for John at reshuffle time. He was far more sinned against than sinning, or to modernise Shakespeare, as Blair would do, he was far more spinned against than spinning. His boss shamelessly made clear - in an off the record sort of way - that Prescott was not the solution but the problem. But we've had more transport ministers than buses on time under this government. These architects of public transport have slashed investment on the Tube. They shut down a couple of lines for the autumn, presided over 14 station closures last week, watched as temperatures soared underground, and engineered a similar rise in temperatures above ground amongst the travelling public. Meanwhile we Conservatives have been getting on with the job of offering something better. We've set out a fairer deal for the motorist: an end to penal petrol taxes, a no to Labour's congestion taxes, and a no to parking taxes. That's Common Sense for travellers. A green light for bypasses and road improvements where needed, and an end to uncertainty on routes where they're not. Incentives to encourage manufacturers to make greener cars, and incentives for people to buy cleaner cars. That's Common Sense for motorists. But what Labour doesn't seem to understand is that most people use their cars because there is no alternative. I bet that neither Mrs Blair nor Mrs Prescott are expected to do their weekly shop by bus. Conservatives will improve the standards of public transport, so that people will use public transport by choice. For the capital, we have launched an imaginative plan for a Londoner's tube, paid for by private money not public subsidy. What's more Londoners, season ticket holders and staff will all be given free shares in their Underground. A private Tube, with shares owned by its users, will mean more passengers wanting to travel. It will give them a better service. Employee shareholders will not want to strike or go slow - that would be striking against themselves. We want to see new lines, reliable and frequent services, air conditioning, and better surroundings - shops and cafes near the platforms, a safer and more secure environment. We will give the people a real say in the Tube's future and cheaper tickets to encourage them to use it. We pledge the most significant investment in the Tube since Victorian times. Our new candidate for Mayor, Jeffrey Archer, is right to highlight Labour's failure on the Tube. A Conservative Mayor would make a big difference. But unlike the Government, our focus is not just on London and the affluent South-East. Last week, Tony Blair made much of taking people out of his definition of poverty. But as we all know, Tony says one thing and does another. Wake up to the reality of Blair's Britain. For Blair has allowed Two Britains to emerge. How many times have we heard Labour try to blame the Conservatives for the gap between the rich and the poor, employed and the unemployed, the suburbs and the inner-cities, the North and the South ? But let me ask you this, which party was it that rebuilt London's Docklands ? Which party introduced the Rough Sleeper's Initiative, getting homeless off the streets ? And which party created new generations of home-owners, giving tenants a basic right - the right to own their own homes ? The Conservatives did. We did. Look beyond Blair's rhetoric, and you will see a nation that has suffered under decades of Labour councils and now a Labour Government: that means no way out. In Blair's Britain, you can buy a whole street of houses in some northern towns for the price of a garage in smart parts of London. In Blair's Britain, rural communities are being destroyed. A blind eye is being turned to the depression in the South West. Tony Blair would find it more convenient if the countryside didn't exist at all. And in Blair's Britain, there are large pockets of high unemployment, dereliction, social breakdown and welfare dependency. The other day I went to Stoke on Trent. I walked around Etruria, once the home of that potter-businessman-genius Josiah Wedgewood, the cradle of England's ceramic industry. What I saw was miserable. The remnants of a once great industry, now acres of derelict land, thousands of square feet of run down factories, many standing idle. People struggling to make a living or find a job, completely cut off from the six-figure property prices of the South, from the new cars and the gloss of suburban life. I have been to Blair's Liverpool and Blair's Newcastle. There, too, they are taking a pounding under Labour. Their manufacturing is under pressure. They say their government is letting them down. Tony Blair may claim to support Newcastle United, but he's certainly not supporting Newcastle. And you can hardly call this Chancellor Newcastle Brown. For Labour doesn't care. Do they really want the most dynamic and talented people to despair, to leave friends and family behind, to turn their backs on the areas they grew up in and move South ? Our party does care. Our leader cares. William doesn't say one thing and do another. He wants to keep the Kingdom United - not break it up and give it away. New Labour said things could only get better. But Blair is making it much worse. Their transport policies and new taxes are making it too dear for people to invest in run-down areas. Regional talking shops and extra layers of bureaucracy stifle job creation and enterprise. It is time for strong local democracy - something which New Labour doesn't understand. We will abolish the regional bureaucracies. We will give power back to local communities. We will fight tooth and nail against rigged voting - proportional representation. PR takes powers away from voters. It stops them dismissing bad councils. It short-changes us when we win the European elections - as we did. It stops democracy working. Blair's Britain is two-faced. He talks about One Nation whilst creating another. He wants you to believe the spin not the harsh reality. Labour's policies will mean mass migration, out of their northern heartlands, out of the cities, into the South East. Last week we heard that Labour is delaying publication of the forecasts of new houses needed in the South East - until the day after our conference. I would like to thank them for highlighting their duplicity. I have no intention of sparing them the embarrassment of highlighting the issue. Labour is planning a mass invasion of the green fields of England with the bulldozer. They will announce tomorrow that the South East has to open its countryside to a huge invasion of bricks and mortar. It won't be the only area where many green fields will be lost. I challenge John Prescott to delay publishing the new housing dictats for the South East for a few weeks more. I urge him to rethink his planning strategy. He needs to control development on the green fields beyond the cities and channel more development and investment into the run-down areas of our urban landscape. Even Labour's own advisers do not think enough will be built on brownfield sites. Labour have over-stated the need for more housing nationwide. It's not as if there is a baby boom - the population is not growing. Labour's anti-family policies will mean more broken homes, but it won't mean as many people living alone as they are suggesting. So the only explanation for all these new houses is Labour's failure to do the right thing for the North and the cities. Does Tony Blair really envisage a Britain where everyone lives South of Watford ? And what does he want to do with the 55,000 vacant council houses in the north ? It's fast becoming the case that the only people who can afford to live in the South are those who have money-lending friends like Geoffrey Robinson? We don't all possess the skills of Peter Mandelson when seeking several mortgages. Labour's policy is good news for Geoffrey Robinson's money-lending business. He has after all resigned to spend more time with it. So what should be done ? I can announce today that a future Conservative government will change planning policy dramatically. A Common Sense Revolution in planning. We will give more power to local communities over their future. Where an area is over-developed and is enjoying economic prosperity, we will allow local councils to halt housing development on large greenfield sites. They will be able to say their schools are full, their roads are busy enough, so their green fields should be spared. Local people will decide what is best for their area. The Secretary of State and his inspectors will no longer overrule them. Let planning decisions be settled by open, democratic debate and local elections. In areas with higher unemployment and substantial brownfield land, we will encourage councils to bring forward plans for regeneration. If councils fail to put forward imaginative ways of increasing investment, we will make sure that those communities do have a chance to succeed. The South-East is suffering from the consequences of too much growth; some other parts of the UK from not enough. It is time to balance things up. It is Labour that doesn't care. After only two years, they're already talking about the next fifteen or one hundred. They are hypnotised by the trappings of power. They've already given up on their promises. They've started to believe their own spin. But their voters see the reality. Labour will not be forgiven. They're not content with dividing Britain. They want to truss it up and give it away. They want to shatter it into regions. Split it into haves and have-nots. Then transfer the whole thing to Brussels. Tony Blair told Labour his aim was One Nation. Let's ignore the act of theft. Let's expose the lie. Tony Blair is creating two nations of haves and have-nots. He is in danger of splitting the UK into four nations thanks to devolution. And he will end up with no nation if he gives more to Brussels. Labour want nothing less than the death of Britain. The death of the democracy we love. The death of the way of life we have built up over many generations. In a Conservative Britain - our Britain - we will broaden prosperity without destroying local identity. We will not ignore the problems of the North or the South West or the countryside. Let us work for our Britain - A Conservative Britain. It's the only Britain on offer."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/1999/oct/07/consumerpages2","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-07T15:27:42Z","webTitle":"Supermarket swoop","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/1999/oct/07/consumerpages2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/1999/oct/07/consumerpages2","fields":{"headline":"Supermarket swoop","bodyText":"It has been a good week for consumers. The big supermarkets have started battle in what has been described as the \"mother of all price wars\", and motor manufacturers have been given notice that they can no longer overcharge us for new cars. That both industries are the subject of investigations by the Competition Commission is no co-incidence. Complaints about how much more we pay for our groceries and cars in Britain than continental Europeans have to have been growing steadily, and the pressure finally seems to be working. But the bomb that has gone off under our supermarkets has an American tag on it. When the US discount specialist Wal-mart bought Asda in June, both promised price cuts. Last month Asda began to deliver and announced that it would reduce the cost of 10,000 lines by 5 to 10% over the next year and a half - a programme which the company says represents an investment of £180m. Tesco, sensing Asda snapping at its heels and determined to hang on to its position as top dog in the United Kingdom, has fought back by introducing drastic price cuts from this week on 1,000 products. The average cut will be 10% and the campaign represents an investment of £250m a year, it boasts. \"This is huge, it's the biggest thing we've ever done,\" a spokesman told us. Shoppers at Sainsbury's meanwhile were all handed a letter last week from the company's managing director promising to match its competitors' prices on 1,500 key lines or refund double the difference. Sainsbury's has seen its market share drop recently, and \"this will take £20m off our bottom line initially,\" says a spokeman. \"It may cost us more as we match others' prices, but how do you assess what you are losing?\" Clearly the companies have different ways of calculating the value of the cuts to us and the size of the loss to them. Safeway has also promised reductions but has not so far come up with anything to match the scale of discounts elsewhere. If they can afford to reduce prices so much now, we can be forgiven for asking why they couldn't before. Doesn't it prove what consumer groups have been saying about rip-off Britain? Clive Beddall, editor of the independent trade magazine the Grocer, thinks the picture is more complicated. \"I don't subscribe to the view that they are not competitive. The idea that they have colluded on price is crap. As Allan Leighton, boss of Asda says, they all hate each other.\" Beddall says suppliers are being heavily squeezed by the supermarkets. And he, like other analysts of the industry, expects blood to be spilt, with at least one casualty. \"A continental chain will probably snap up one of ours,\" he predicts. Since planning restrictions on out-of-town sites have been tightened up, any major expansion by the big supermarkets needs to come in the form of increased volume and at the expense of their rivals, and that is what is driving the price war. Some of the cuts will be on a regional basis and, as with petrol stations, you can expect to find the best value where there is local competition. If you are using an out-of-town store which has no competitor within miles you are unlikely to see such substantial cuts. Many of us, of course, set off on autopilot to our nearest supermarket and trudge round like zombies. Switching chains, like changing banks, requires a mental agility that is hard to summon up. Is now the time to move? If you were to find the energy to vote with your feet, which supermarket would be cheapest now? To find out what the cuts mean, we put together a list of more than 30 items which we calculate might go into a typical Guardian reader's shopping basket each week. We worked on the assumption that most people set off with a shopping list, and will not necessarily switch brands or varieties just to get the cheapest. We made the further assumption that shopping is done with a mixture of prejudice (\"whaddya mean you bought own-brand cornflakes, don't you know the kids only eat Kellogg's?\") and principle (\"we do try to stick to recycled paper for the loo, we choose a bit of organic where we can afford it\"). We have as far as possible compared like for like in terms of quality and pack size, and have adjusted the figures where necessary to take into account minor variations in quantities. In a couple of instances, where the stores were out of stock of a particular food, we did what the typical shopper would do and chose the nearest equivalent. When we did our spot checks on three London stores, we found prices were being cut everywhere, so much so that labels were often handwritten, missing or in the wrong place. Overall the cheapest was Asda, where the price of the basket was £54.53. At Tesco it cost £55.95 and at Sainsbury's, £60.99. The difference in the totals was accounted for by significant differences in price on just a few items. Many of the cuts were the same in all three supermarkets. Nevertheless, the savings are substantial. Sainsbury's has, of course, promised a refund if you can prove a product is cheaper somewhere else. But how many of us have time for that? The picture might change daily but what we can all enjoy is the heady feeling that, whichever aisle we push our trolleys down, even a zombie's shopping counts these days. What was in our basket Prices: £54.53 (Asda), £55.95 (Tesco), £60.99 (Sainsburys) The products checked in our price comparison were: pears, bananas, oranges, new potatoes, onions, tomatoes, broccoli, organic carrots and organic apples; pasta, pasta sauce, brown rice, tin of chopped tomatoes, Covent Garden soup, McVities chocolate digestives, Kellogg's cornflakes, butter, Cheddar cheese, yoghurt, olive oil, free-range eggs, fresh chicken, Persil soap powder, Jif bathroom cleaner, Colgate toothpaste, PG Tips tea, fresh coffee, Bird's Eye fish fingers, Gillette razor blades, wholemeal bread, fresh orange juice, milk, Jacob's Creek red wine, Becks beer, Kleenex tissues and recycled loo paper."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/1999/oct/07/conservatives1999.conservatives7","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-07T16:15:49Z","webTitle":"Full text: William Hague's conference speech, part 1","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/oct/07/conservatives1999.conservatives7","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/oct/07/conservatives1999.conservatives7","fields":{"headline":"Full text: William Hague's conference speech, part 1","bodyText":"\"In March, our Spring Party Conference met in Reading. Today, the unclaimed cars in Reading Station car park are painful testimony to the loss and distress we all feel in the wake of the awful Paddington tragedy. None of us can fully understand the grief and pain of the families of the victims; but as we watch the terrible scenes from the crash site, each one of us remembers the last journey we made by train - for many of us, only days ago - and we shudder at how fragile life can be. We need to find out what went so disastrously wrong. And we need to find out fast. We welcome the swift decision to hold an inquiry. But the inquiry itself must be swift too. It must not drag on for years and years, or lose its way in bureaucratic procedure. We need clear answers and long term solutions. On this we will give the Government every support as it carries out its work. And we salute, as we have done so often in similar circumstances, the courage and professionalism of our police and emergency services - and we praise the staff of the hospitals who continue to care for the injured. The national grief following this disaster will be intense and lasting. In every family we know that even in the midst of tragedy we have to look to the future. This week we have looked to the future with new confidence. For here in Blackpool we have had the best Conservative Conference for years. The best Conference because we've heard brilliant speeches from the new fresh talent of an outstanding Shadow Cabinet and frontbench. The best Conference because I think we've all been struck by how many younger members have sparkled here this week. The best Conference because everyone who saw our parade of new councillors and MEPs knows that this Party is back winning elections again. We've launched our Common Sense Revolution. We've set out our five common sense Guarantees. I can announce today that we are adding a sixth guarantee. The Blackpool Guarantee. We're coming back to Blackpool every other year. Long after the Labour Party has become too snobbish to go almost anywhere in the country, we're coming back to Blackpool. I've enjoyed this Conference tremendously because of your enthusiasm - and because, as ever, I've had the terrific support and companionship of my wife, Ffion. The whole Conference has been a great contrast to what we saw last week. I sympathise with the Prescotts. Last week they took the car because of what the seaside air did to their hair. I don't blame them. Look what it did to mine. I don't mind. As someone said to me last month in Wigan: \"Don't worry Mr Hague. It's not what's on your head that counts. It's what in your head. \"The Labour Party Conference in Bournemouth was all about staying in power however they can and distorting the past. Our Conference has been about serving the people and preparing for the future. What annoys me most about today's Labour politicians is not their beliefs - they're entitled to those - but their sheer, unadulterated hypocrisy. They say one thing and they do another. They send their children to schools they want to abolish for others. They are driven in cars 250 yards to give speeches telling other people not to drive their own. They tell other people not to have second homes when they've got three themselves. They make their lip-trembling proclamation that the class war is over - while the very same day they boo 14 year old girls because they come from a private school. We're having a Common Sense Revolution so let's have some common sense language about Labour: it's high time this bunch of hypocrites stopped preaching to others what they don't practice themselves. Last year Tony Blair promised a Year of Delivery. If only he'd told us to expect a year of hollow rhetoric, empty gestures and meaningless slogans, for once he'd have told the truth. Now we must offer the people of this country not just an alternative to the arrogance and complacency and hypocrisy of New Labour; but our own fresh ideas. Conservative Governments achieved so much. But there's so much more to be done. For as a country we're spending millions more on our schools and hospitals, and they don't seem to be getting any better. We're paying more and more tax, but no one can understand where the money's all going to. We hear endless stories of new anti-crime initiatives, yet crime is going up. We have more and more politicians, and they are trusted less and less. Let's get it clear: Vast regional bureaucracies and European political superstructures are not the solution. They are the problem. As I travel around our country - to schools and factories and high streets - I listen to a common sense so far removed from how people think in Whitehall that it's no wonder people have lost faith in politics. But this common sense has for too long been ignored. People don't want to be told that what they know to be right, can't work. The people of this country want and deserve straight talk. The people of this country want a government that turns their common sense solutions into government policy. When I sit in the House of Commons and hear Labour Ministers talking about this or that new piece of regulation I think to myself: it's time they listened to the small businessman I met in Nottingham last month who said to me \"at this rate, we are going to have one man working in this country and 55 million checking up on him\"Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When minor operations are carried out to meet political targets while people die waiting for their heart bypass, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When local councils spend more money looking after bogus asylum seekers than after old people in homes, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When twelve year old girls are giving birth while the last recognition of marriage in the tax system is being abolished, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When a householder who uses reasonable force against a burglar ends up in court while the burglar goes free, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When terrorist murderers go free in their hundreds without surrendering one ounce of semtex or a single gun, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When the best schools in the country face abolition simply because they are the best, when 2,000 new regulations on business are passed in two years, when we import food of a quality we would not permit to be produced at home, when the Territorial Army is decimated while our Armed Forces are stretched to the limit, when more layers of government are added to an over-governed society, when we have a Prime Minister who is trying abolish our currency and end our independence as a country, we all know Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. And when the Government of Britain is the most two-faced, interfering, over-regulating, bossy, intolerant, arrogant and crony-run in our history, there is no doubt Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. Before the election Tony Blair claimed to be so admiring of Conservative success. He implied he would be like Margaret Thatcher. He pledged to be against higher taxes; to be tough on crime; to think the unthinkable on welfare; to fight for Britain's interests in Europe. This was their great deception. This was the Great Labour Lie. When Tony Blair told the country he'd \"no plans to increase tax at all\", was he telling the truth? Well was he?Or when he wrote to anxious parents \"A Labour Government will not close your grammar schools. That is my personal guarantee \", was he telling the truth? When Tony Blair wrote in the Sun newspaper before the election about \"my love for the Pound\" and how he felt so emotional about the Queen's head on a £10 note, was he telling the truth? When can you be absolutely, 100 per cent, cast-iron sure that a Labour promise is going to be broken? The moment Tony Blair puts it in his own handwriting. If he was Pinocchio, he'd have a nose bigger than Concorde. Sometimes you have to laugh at it. To the Evening Standard he is the city slicker; to Country Life, he is the rural boy at heart. And my favourite. According to Labour's own magazine, \"Tony's favourite food is fish and chips. He gets a takeaway from his local chippie whenever he is at home in his constituency\"; but when The Islington Cook Book asked him the same question, he said his favourite food was: \"fresh fettucini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes and capers\". I read in the papers the other day: Downing Street sources confirm - Tony Blair thinks he's \"a Napoleon Bonaparte figure\" who's taken \"near total control of the levers of political power\". Well maybe it's not a bad comparison. Napoleon thought he was Emperor; he tried to submerge Britain in a single European state; and he obviously wanted to abolish the pound; he even invaded Tuscany several summers in a row. He thought he was invincible but he was finished off by a plain-speaking Conservative who went on to become Prime Minister. How do we defeat the Great Labour Lie? By fighting a campaign based on common sense, clear convictions and a united Party. We know because we fought such a campaign in the European Elections four months ago and won. The biggest swing to the Opposition in any election since 1918. The lowest Labour share of the vote since Michael Foot. And wasn't the Prime Minister's reaction to defeat so revealing? Did he listen for one single second to the message from the voters?No. Not for one second. He came out and called us extremists - as if wanting to keep control of our your own currency is extreme. He said we were fanatics - as if it's fanatical to speak up for the great majority of British people who want to be in Europe not run by Europe. The people I meet in the cities and towns and villages of our country have a straight-forward desire to live in an independent country with their own currency. I've got news for Tony Blair. These people are not extreme. They're not fanatics. They've got more sense in their gut instincts than in all the collective wisdom of this Government and their fellow travellers. Now our task is to speak up with the same common sense and clarity and conviction on all the other great issues facing our country. Some people won't like it. Our friends in The Guardian newspaper describe the Common Sense Revolution as \"bristling with extreme ideas ranging through tougher welfare rules, tougher prison sentences, less state administration and lower taxes\". If newspapers regard tougher welfare rules, tougher prison sentences, less administration and lower taxes as 'extreme', then it's not just the Government that needs a Common Sense Revolution. It is time to make the case for that revolution. So let us begin. Let's have a Common Sense Revolution for pensioners like Barbara Fitzjohn. 78 years old. Proud of her country. Lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Hall Green, Birmingham. Scared to leave her home after dark. Terrified because she saw somebody get mugged and no one stopped to help. Muggings, car thefts, graffiti, drug-taking and burglary. They're so common that no one feels completely safe anymore. Labour said they'd be tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime. Their first soundbite. Now we know it was the beginning of the Great Labour Lie. Crime is up. Prisoners are released early. Police numbers go down as Labour rhetoric goes up. I say keep criminals in prison longer; make sure the sentence served in prison is the sentence given in court; lock away with life sentences drug dealers who sell to children; make every prisoner do a full working day; help our police get out from behind their desks and onto our streets; stop turning a blind eye to the graffiti and vandalism and truancy - go to war on crime like no government has ever dared before. In the next Conservative Government, when Ann Widdecombe is Home Secretary, I want every criminal in the land to look like Labour Ministers do when she gets up to speak - absolutely scared witless. These are my instincts. They are the instincts of the people of this country. They've been ignored for too long. It's common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen. Let's have a Common Sense Revolution for responsible people like Barbara Evans. 89 years old. Lives in a residential care home in Vauxhall. Through her life set aside money for her retirement. Now everything she's saved could disappear in residential care bills. Labour said they'd do something and they've done nothing. Another part of the Great Labour Lie. Labour's idea of a savings policy is to grease up to Geoffrey Robinson; get him to buy you a half-a-million pound house; sell it for three quarters of a million; keep the change. Easy. Everything Labour has done, from their pensions tax to abolishing PEPs and TESSAs to discriminating against savings in income tax, makes it harder for people to save. I say it's time the government stopped fleecing people who put aside money for the future. I say it's time to help people who help themselves by cutting the starting rate of tax on savings in half and protecting people who've saved for their long term care, so that we don't let another generation have their home and assets eaten up. It's common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen. Let's have a Common Sense Revolution for farmers like John Harrison. Works every day of the year including Christmas day. Made just £5,000 last year with a wife and family to support. Driven to despair by a Labour Britain where the thing that grows fastest is red tape. Labour claimed to be the friend of farming. But it's just another instalment of the Great Labour Lie. I say stop importing food that does not meet the animal welfare and hygiene standards which we expect here at home. Insist food on the shelves labelled British is actually grown in Britain. And make a bonfire of rules and regulations - starting with the totally pointless ban on beef-on-bone. And while we're at it let's force every Whitehall Department to cut its red tape. And let's cut the size of Whitehall itself. Since Labour took office the cost of paying 'political advisers' has risen by £2 million, the cost of all elected representatives in the country by £120 million, the cost of running Government departments by one thousand million pounds. That's the cost of over 40,000 teachers' salaries or a third of a million hip operations. I make you this promise: I'll reduce the size of the Cabinet, cut the number of ministers, reduce the size of the House of Commons, campaign for a European Parliament of 100 fewer members, halve the number of political advisers to ministers and abolish all of Labour's regional agencies and assemblies. And, what's more, I'm going to enjoy it. Now that would be a Common Sense Revolution. Let's have a Common Sense Revolution for people like Jim Macabe. Grandfather. Husband. NHS Patient. Told to wait nearly a year just to see a consultant. So desperate he's going to spend his hard-earned savings on going private. Wouldn't it make sense if patients like Jim Macabe got treated on the basis of medical need instead of political priorities set by Government Ministers fiddling the figures?We offer a Patient's Guarantee. Every NHS patient with an urgent condition will be guaranteed a waiting time based on their need for treatment. If the NHS can't do it in time, the state will pay for a private operation. That means far shorter waiting times for life-saving operations like heart by-passes. They won't take their place at the back of the queue. It's just common sense. It's been welcomed by the medical profession. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen. Let's have a Common Sense Revolution for the Begbie family. Their eleven year old daughter Heather was excelling at school on an Assisted Place. Before the election Tony Blair wrote promising she'd \"continue to receive support until the end of her education\". This year he broke that promise and Heather now faces leaving her school. It's clear now that when Tony Blair wrote to people like Heather Begbie saying he was committed to excellence in education, it was all part of the Great Labour Lie. They seem to think that destroying the best schools somehow improves education for everybody. Well I say you don't improve schools with difficulties by suppressing the work of outstanding schools; you cannot raise the average by destroying the best. \"The class war is over\", says Tony Blair. Tell that to thousands of vindictive, mean-spirited, class-obsessed Labour Party activists who at this moment are trying to destroy the best state schools in the country and are doing so at the behest of the Labour Leadership. Each year as Secretary of State for Wales I looked at the exam results of every school in Wales. If any school showed a dramatic improvement, I asked what had changed at that school since the year before. The answer was always the same - the head-teacher. All my experience is that standards in a classroom don't go up because of Whitehall dictats; they go up because of the actions of parents and governors and head-teachers. We offer parents and children a revolution in our state education. We're going to turn every state-run school in the country into a Free School. We're going to give head-teachers and governors the complete freedom to run their own schools, manage their own budget, employ the best teachers and set their pay, and control their own admissions policy. And we're going to give every parent this Parent's Guarantee: if you don't think your child's Free School meets minimum standards, and enough of your fellow parents agree, then you can sack the whole school management. That's real parent power; that's the way to drive up standards. We will give schools the power to discipline they need, and we're going to deal with truants with this simple rule: any school pupil on the streets during school hours without written permission will be stopped by the police and sent back to school where they belong. It's common sense. Education does not end at school or even at university. It goes on through our lives. We're going to help working women who take a career break to look after their children, by cutting away the barriers that make it difficult for them to get a job again. We will set up Family Scholarships that will give these mothers the professional training and refresher courses they need to get back to work. Free Schools. Real power to teachers and head-teachers. A Parent's Guarantee. Tough Discipline. Higher standards. It's common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen. Let's have a Common Sense Revolution for millions of hard-working families in this country who pay too much tax. All Labour Governments raise taxes. It's just that this Labour Government is sneakier and stealthier about it. They tax your savings, your house, your petrol, your pension, your marriage and your mortgage. All those taxes followed by last week's speech. They passed round the collection plate even before the sermon. It's time we had much more open and honest and transparent tax system. So our Tax Guarantee is this: the next Conservative Government will bring down the total of all taxes taken together as a share of the nation's income. They'll be no place to hide tax increases. They'll be no stealth taxes. Guaranteed. And as we cut tax, the people we will to try to help will include the people who save and who give to charity; the people who aren't rich but who, like thousands of teachers and policemen, find themselves paying the top rate of income tax; the people who want to have the freedom to use the car which they've earned and saved for. And we will introduce an explicit recognition of marriage back into the tax and benefit system. But we all know that the only way the nation can afford to do this and to invest in education and health care is by real reform of the welfare state. Labour promised to be truly radical on welfare. Tony Blair vowed to cut social security spending as a proportion of the nation's income. But that was the greatest part of the Great Labour Lie. Social security bills have soared. Dependency has increased. Despondency has set in. We're going to liberate people from the culture of welfare dependency with a Common Sense Revolution. It's time to insist that those who can work, must work. I guarantee taxpayers that any unemployed person who can work, and who is offered a job, either takes that job or loses their unemployment benefits. We have to create a culture in this country where if you can work, you do workWe're going to transform our Jobcentres so that they get paid by results. I say Jobcentres are not there to pay people benefits for doing nothing. They are there to get people into work. Our Common Sense Revolution is straightforward good sense. We will match our military capability and our military commitments, and we will restore the role of our Territorial Army. We will save our road hauliers by forcing foreign lorries who use our roads to pay a levy, and then use that money to cut road tax. They do it in Denmark and Holland, I saw do it in Britain too. We will require two thirds of all new development to be built on brown-field sites so that we rejuvenate our towns and cities not bulldoze over our countryside. We will protect our fishermen and conserve our fish stocks by returning British fishing waters to local or national control. We champion all these people and their causes because our Party has always been at its best when it champions the instincts of the British people. When, in Randolph Churchill's famous phrase, we trust the people. In Bournemouth last week Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism. I am proud of the forces of Conservatism. I am proud of what they have achieved this century. Winston Churchill and the British people, hand in hand, as we stood alone and saved the people of Europe from tyranny. Rab Butler and the British people, hand in hand, as we extended free education and brought opportunity to millions of children. Harold Macmillan and the British people, hand in hand, as we brought prosperity to the cold grey post war era. Margaret Thatcher and John Major and the British people, hand in hand, as we fought union power, and won the cold war, and restored the dignity and freedom of this nation. It is the forces of Conservatism which in a dangerous century beset by socialism, communism and national socialism, have left our country at the end of that century free and proud and strong. The Conservative Party and the British people, hand in hand, that's how we'll build our Common Sense Revolution. Hand in hand against the patronising elite who think its small minded to believe in our country and the chattering classes who think it's intolerant to be tough on law and order and the progressive intellectuals who think that caring is spending other people's money. And in the 1980s, it was the forces of Conservatism which stood up to the unions and defended our country while Tony Blair was voting against every trade union law and campaigning for unilateral nuclear disarmament. What a speech that was last week in Bournemouth. The speech of a politician for whom the truth has ceased to matter. I do not know which is more worrying. That our Prime Minister actually believes that Conservatives caused the assassination of Martin Luther King, or that he is prepared to read out whatever offensive rubbish is put in front of him. But it wasn't the insults to past and present Conservative voters that was most extraordinary about that speech. It was what that speech revealed about who the Prime Minister really is. At times listening to Tony Blair was like listening to a recording of Conservative slogans from the last twenty years. 'Set the people free' - a long familiar Tory message. So 'set the people free' says Tony Blair last week. 'Opportunity for all' - the theme of our Conference a few years ago. So 'opportunity for all' cries Tony Blair a few years later. 'One Nation' - perhaps the most famous Conservative phrase ever. Tony Blair's favourite phrase? 'One Nation'. You wait. Soon he'll tell us all his policies are common sense. A common sense revolution. If all we had needed to govern the country was someone who repeated everything we'd said before, we could have bought a parrot. For this man's whole political approach has been to parrot the language of Conservatives; to pretend that he understood what Margaret Thatcher had achieved and why Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock were so wrong. This is the Great Labour Lie. Last week Tony Blair showed that he has never understood the real achievements of Conservative Governments. He knows the slogans, but he doesn't have a clue what they mean. A Prime Minister who has the brass neck to stand before his Party Conference vowing to set the people free while at the same time centralising power, increasing taxes and undermining personal responsibility, can only be the perpetrator of the Great Labour Lie himself. He even claimed that 'the establishment' was holding the country back. He's a forty-something, public school-educated, barrister from Islington, with a two hundred seat majority in the House of Commons. Who does he think is the establishment?The man is a fraud. Anyone who so misunderstands or so wilfully distorts who we are as a people or where we come from as a nation cannot possibly know where we should go to next as a people and as a nation. For this was the speech of a man who is embarrassed about where he came from, and the country he lives in, and the century he was born in and the Party he leads. Most of all it was the speech of a man who is embarrassed by the opinions of the people who elected him. Embarrassed by their patriotism and their fierce independence and their pride in Britain. He thinks patriotism is uncool and independence is out of date and pride is undignified. He wants to take on the forces of Conservatism. The forces of Conservatism that trust the common sense instincts of the people of Britain rather than ignore them. The forces of Conservatism that speak for all those who believe we should build on the traditions and institutions and success of our country rather than destroy them. The forces of Conservatism that will be keeping our nation free and proud and independent long after he and his cronies are written off by history as people without principle, purpose, belief or conviction. For when I spoke to you in this hall two years ago I said that New Labour would bring first fascination, then admiration, then disillusionment and finally contempt. At that stage the admiration was running high; now the disillusionment is beginning; and mark my words, they are not so far away from contempt. And so once again it is the Conservative Party that is hand in hand with the British people as we start a new century. For we believe in our country. We believe in a free and independent nation. We believe in the United Kingdom. We believe in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We hope and pray for real and permanent peace in Northern Ireland. We continue to support the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We give credit to the Government for continuing the painstaking work so bravely commenced by John Major. But I renew my warning, made many times this year, that eighteen months after that Agreement, the apparatus of terror is still intact, the violence continues, and not one gun or bomb has been dismantled or given up. I say that until that changes, no more terrorist murderers should be released from jail. The Leader of the Liberal Party, Charles Kennedy, says that I'm irresponsible for saying this. He thinks opposition politicians shouldn't speak out on these vital matters. I say that when murderers are being released onto our streets in direct contravention of the assurances given to the people of Northern Ireland and the Agreement itself, it is the absolute duty of the Leader of the Opposition to raise his voice in protest. God save us from the spineless crawling to the Government of Liberal politicians. We believe in the strength of the Union and our four nations in one nation. That means making the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly work. But it also means that voters of England must be properly represented in the British constitution. I say that issues that only affect England should be voted on only by English MPs. We cannot go on for ever with a situation where the MPs for Lancashire cannot vote on anything happening in Glasgow, but the MPs for Glasgow can vote on everything happening here in Lancashire. So central to our Common Sense Revolution will be this: English votes on English laws. And we believe in the independence of Britain.

In a provocative speech Lord Cranborne said that the principle of consent - which rules that Northern Ireland's constitutional position can only be decided by its population - should be modified to make it more difficult for the province to leave the United Kingdom. His remarks do not reflect the Tories' official position, but show how far senior Conservatives have moved away from mainstream thinking on Northern Ireland since they left office. Lord Cranborne was a member of John Major's cabinet at the time of the 1993 Downing Street declaration that enshrined the principle of consent. The declaration was a watershed because it marked the first time a Tory government and a Fianna Fail government agreed that Northern Ireland's constitutional status would be decided by the formula of 50% of voters plus one. Lord Cranborne's proposal would raise the threshold to 66% of voters who turn out on the day or to 40% of registered voters. In the 1979 referendum on Scottish devolution, the Yes camp attracted more than 50%, but lost because it failed to secure 40% of registered voters. He told a fringe meeting at the Tory conference that it was time to put in place \"safeguards to prevent a bare majority overturning constitutional positions\". His challenge will astonish leaders on both sides of the Irish Sea who believe that the principle of consent has inspired confidence: Unionists have been reassured because it guarantees that they will not be coerced into a united Ireland by a British government, while nationalists have been reassured that a British government will not stand in the way of Irish unity. David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader, attended the meeting. He distanced himself from Lord Cranborne's proposal, saying that he stood by the established principle of consent. Tory sources also made clear that they did not endorse the idea. However, Lord Cranborne's intervention showed how growing numbers of Tories are losing faith with the process started while they were in office. Andrew Mackay, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, underlined the breach with a blistering attack on Tony Blair. Addressing the conference, he said: \"I will take no lessons in bipartisanship from a Labour party that year after year opposed our essential anti-terrorist legislation.\" Mr Mackay called for the immediate halt of the release of terrorist prisoners because of continuing paramilitary violence, and pledged to fight the government's plan to introduce Chris Patten's report on policing in Northern Ireland. \"It would be dangerous folly for Tony Blair to implement changes that affect security until there has been a complete end to violence and the decommissioning of terrorist weapons.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/1999/oct/09/books.guardianreview3","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-09T01:15:12Z","webTitle":"Party on Callisto","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/oct/09/books.guardianreview3","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/1999/oct/09/books.guardianreview3","fields":{"headline":"Party on Callisto","bodyText":"Outer space contains everything you need for a billion-year spree. There are interstellar oceans of alcohol, cosmic glaciers of ice. Monica Grady, meteorite expert at the Natural History Museum in London, isn't sure about the twist of lemon - but otherwise, there are all the ingredients for a jolly good cocktail, she says. One of these cocktails is life itself. The party could be going on, quietly, in the dark underground of Mars. It could be bubbling away under the icy surface of Europa or in crevices on the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter, Io, Ganymede and Callisto. Titan, the moon of Saturn, is awash with alcohol and methane and other hydrocarbons, all components in the great chemistry set of life and death. Nasa scientists have even proposed Charon, the enigmatic partner of Pluto, the planet on the fringe of everything, but Grady isn't so sure. Too cold, too far away. Venus, with a climate of acid rain and a surface hot enough to melt lead, is no place to hold a party either. \"We know so little about Pluto and Charon you could say almost anything you wanted,\" says Grady. \"There is certainly no life on Venus now - it is too hot. But in the past, Venus had an interesting geological history, just like the earth, but it has been completely resurfaced, it is still being completely resurfaced.\" She adds drily that the sun is probably out as a home for life. \"Jupiter itself has been proposed as well, with strange things floating up and down in the gas, but it's not thought likely because of the gravitational problems there.\" But Callisto is suddenly being considered as planetary real estate, with possibilities for tenancy. This is because planetary scientists have detected something unexpected around it: a magnetic field. Something dynamic has to generate a magnetic field. On earth, the explanation is convection in a hot core. So a field round Callisto implies a molten, liquid centre, which in turn suggests heat and water. Liquid water, energy and carbon - practically all you need for life. Grady has been thinking about these things in preparation for a star-studded event - the museum's annual science lecture, on Tuesday. She's only saying Callisto is a candidate: \"If there is anything on Callisto, it is going to be even more primitive than anything on Europa. On Europa, we are fairly sure there is a sub-ice ocean, possibly kept liquid by hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor which might possibly mean - this is all hedged with lots of possiblys and maybes - that there is something slightly more evolved, something possibly higher than a bacterium.\" If there is anything on Callisto, she says, it will be surviving and replicating very slowly in the pore spaces between the grains of rock, something very primitive, something near the lowest rung of life's ladder, hanging on for dear life, like the little microbes discovered in the dry valleys of Antarctica, a forbidding desert region without even an insulating blanket of snow, a place once a byword for sterility. But Callisto is not new to the market for habitation. In 1847, a French astronomer called Francois Edouard Plisson proposed the fourth satellite of Jupiter as possessing conditions favourable for life. For most of recorded history, humans have been half-expecting to meet the neighbours. When Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin came back from the moon in 1969, they and their rock samples were locked in quarantine, while biologists watched for lunar germs. The search for life in the solar system is the oldest game in town. Epicurus proposed, around 300BC, that if atoms were infinite then \"there are infinite worlds both like and unlike this world\". And Lucretius, the Roman scientist-poet, proposed that if the seeds of life were rushing round an unfathomable universe \"it is in the highest degree unlikely that this earth and sky is the only one to have been created\". The Pythagoreans firmly believed in life on the moon. So did Plutarch. Aristotle and the Christian fathers knocked the idea on the head by setting in place a geocentric universe: earth at the centre of things, the circles of heaven around it, and humanity as a kind of salvation experiment supervised by God. Then, 400 years ago, Copernicus began to redraw the map of creation, and Galileo put his eye to a telescope and saw the first four moons of Jupiter; and perceived it, too, as a planet at the centre of its own universe. Kepler almost immediately observed: \"Those four little moons exist for Jupiter, not us. Each planet in turn, together with its occupants, is served by its own satellites. From this line of reasoning, we deduce with the highest degree of probability that Jupiter is inhabited.\" What followed has a name: the debate came to be called pluralism. Atheists welcomed it. So did Christians. Liebniz, probably joking, suggested an ecumenical council to propagate the faith beyond the globe. Bishop Berkeley wondered the sinners of earth bore \"no greater proportion to the universe of intelligence than a dungeon doth to a kingdom\" - in which case, of course, everybody else out there would be wiser, cleverer and happier than us. Kant in 1735 contemplated a solar system in which intelligence increased with distance from the sun: dullard Mercurians, average intelligence on earth and greatly superior intellects on Jupiter and Saturn. Thomas Paine liked the idea of a plurality of worlds because it made Christianity look like a strange conceit. John Wesley didn't like it, on the sensible grounds that he could see the earth was populated but \"of the rest, I know nothing\". Benjamin Franklin asked himself what kind of people could bear the brightness of Mercury, where the heat of the sun was \"seven times as great as it is with us?\" Herschel, the discoverer of Uranus, proposed that the sun itself was inhabited, its light screened by solar cloud for the locals, whose \"organs are adapted to the peculiar circumstances of that great globe\". The argument flowered. \"Barristers and bishops, philosophers and physicists, poets and preachers as well as a shepherd and a secretary of state, published discussions of pluralism,\" says Michael Crowe in his 1986 history The Extraterrestrial Debate 1750-1900, \"albeit frequently for very different purposes.\" Some of these purposes revolved around the nature of God. \"Is it irreverent to suggest that an infinite God could scarcely find the opportunities to enjoy Himself, to exercise His godhead, if a single planet were the sole seat of his activities?\" asked the 20th-century cosmologist EA Milne, echoing a question put 2,000 years earlier. The first mention of astro-theology as a kind of science occurs in 1714 as the title of a book by the chaplain of the young King George II. And in 1828 a Scottish clergyman called Thomas Dick calculated that there would be 2.4 bn inhabited worlds in the visible universe. If populated at the density of England, with 280 per square mile, that left 8,141bn people living on the inner and outer rings of Saturn, alone. Balzac mentioned the extraterrestrial debate, so did Trollope, Mark Twain and Walt Whitman. The rise of scientific astronomy sharpened it. A number of distinguished scientists were utterly convinced that they could see canals and even settlements on Mars. By 1898, when HG Wells wrote The War of The Worlds, his readers were perfectly prepared to believe that they were being watched \"by intelligences greater than man's, and yet as mortal as his own\". Even after the return from the moon, there were expectations of life on Mars: possibly based on silicon rather than carbon. It was not until the Voyager probe actually landed on the surface of Mars that the pluralism bubble burst. There was nothing there at all. We were, after all, quite possibly alone, but now in a universe of 10bn galaxies, each with 10bn stars. But extraterrestrial life is suddenly back. In the last two decades, humans looked more closely at another planet: the one under their feet. They found life in impossible places: down volcanoes, in boiling pools, under the ice, in lakes of soda, in buckets of acid, in gushers of boiling brine in the dark ocean depths, in granite miles underground, living on a diet of rock. Tantalising signs of possible life have been found in stray bits of the solar system: Grady and her colleagues were the first to identify organic molecules in meteorites. She is one of the scientists linked to a British probe called Beagle 2, which in 2003 will land on the soil of Mars and \"sniff\" for signs of life. Mars is the first place anyone is going to check directly for life. Nobody is looking for canals or pyramids or footprints. Sensitive detectors now stalk a different trail. If you detect ozone and methane together in the atmosphere of a planet, she says, you will be on to something. Natural processes remove both of these gases very quickly. If they are there, they are being replenished - by something alive. There are other telltale signs of the presence of living things: distinct ratios of the isotopes of carbon, for instance, or a preponderance of \"lefthanded\" molecules (molecules with a distinctive shape). She doesn't expect the evidence to be clear cut: tantalising rather than conclusive. But the discovery of just a single microbe - a bacterium or something similar - would make not just history, but mark an epoch. Bacteria are life's bottom line. They survive in the vacuum and cold of space, and they thrive wherever there is water and warmth of a kind. The discovery of a microbe on Mars would raise an interesting question, because if Martian meteorites can reach earth, then terrestrial meteorites must also have landed on Mars. \"You have this backwards and forwards thing going on,\" says Grady. \"So it is feasible that something could have evolved on the earth and then carried from the earth and Mars beyond the asteroid belt. So if we do find life on Mars - let's be optimistic, when we do find life on Mars- and we find that it is lefthanded, is it because it has developed independently? Or is it because it has been knocked off the earth by impact and carried to Mars?\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/oct/11/guardianletters","type":"article","sectionId":"theguardian","sectionName":"From the Guardian","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-10T23:43:00Z","webTitle":"Australia under attack","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/oct/11/guardianletters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/oct/11/guardianletters","fields":{"headline":"Australia under attack","bodyText":"John Pilger's latest diatribe against Australia contains a wide assortment of distortions and errors (Australia's under side, October 5). But I cannot allow to go unchallenged his claim that Australia's leadership of the UN multinational force in East Timor reflects concern about the \"stability of Indonesia and the protection of western business interests\". The Australian government and people have been driven by humanitarian concern for the desperate plight of the East Timorese. Of course Indonesia's stability matters to Australia and we want constructive relations with our northern neighbour. But this was not the motivation behind our actions, and indeed we are now going through a difficult period in our relations with Indonesia. It is obscene to suggest business interests are involved. Australia's prime minister, John Howard, has said: \"What we have done in East Timor is not only in Australia's national interests, but it is also overwhelmingly right ... the policy the government has followed was the only policy that could have been followed by a self-respecting country.\" We acted forthrightly after Indonesia failed to maintain order. We make no apology for the lead we have taken. Our actions have been mandated by the United Nations and have the strong backing and cooperation of countries throughout the region and beyond. It is Australia's unambiguous aim, along with many other members of the international community (including the United Kingdom), to rebuild East Timor for her people. While Mr Pilger adopts his familiar denigratory stance towards Australia, his views on this issue are not shared by East Timorese leaders Xanana Gusmao and Jose Ramos Horta. In London this week, both went out of their way publicly to praise Australia's \"courageous and unprecedented\" efforts which they noted had the support of the whole region.

He moved with speed, strength and most of all, grace. Whoever succeeded him, from Errol Flynn to Antonio Banderas, it is Fairbanks who remains synonymous with screen swashbuckling, and to whom overdue homage is being paid at the National Film Theatre on the 60th anniversary of his death. In 1919, the four biggest names in pictures - Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, David Wark Griffith and Charles Chaplin - formed United Artists, because they wanted more independence. The following year, Fairbanks married Pickford - \"America's Sweetheart\" - and they honeymooned in Europe: they needed police to protect them from the huge crowds that turned out to see them. Because there was no language barrier in silent films, Fairbanks and Pickford were known in every corner of the globe where films were shown. Returning to the US, they established themselves as \"The King and Queen of Hollywood\" in Pickfair, a large Tudor-style house on an 18-acre estate in Beverly Hills. To be invited to Pickfair was the pinnacle of social success. They were visited by European nobility, intellectuals, artists, socialites and dignitaries. The 5ft 8in, 160lb Fairbanks was an accomplished boxer, gymnast, swimmer, rider, fencer and tennis player. He walked with an athletic bounce, giving off a sense of controlled energy that exuded confidence. Yet, his persona disguised a deeply insecure man who craved affection and attention. He was born Douglas Elton Ulman on May 23, 1883 in Denver, Colorado. His father, a prominent Jewish lawyer, left home when Douglas was five years old and his mother reverted to the surname of her late husband, John Fairbanks. Throughout his life he was secretive about his real name, about being half Jewish, and about his parents being unmarried. Because his father was a heavy drinker, his mother made him sign the temperance pledge at 12 and he remained a teetotaller all his life, having a strong dislike for drink and drunks. Ironically, Pickford became an alcoholic, a fact that pained Fairbanks more than he ever admitted. He continued to claim that John Fairbanks was his father, that he studied at Harvard (he left school at 15), crossed the Atlantic in a cattle boat and fought a bull in Spain. It was disclosed, long after his death, that a double did many of his most vertiginous stunts. He was abnormally close to his mother and, as a young boy, in order to provoke her concern, he would court danger by climbing trees and buildings. One day he fell off a roof and regained consciousness in his mother's arms, happy to be the centre of attention. He never outgrew the small boy's penchant for showing off, and was rarely referred to as Douglas or Mr Fairbanks; it was always \"Doug\". At his mother's death he left the funeral dry-eyed and expressionless. Later, he told Pickford how much his mother meant to him, buried his face in her curls, and sobbed for 15 minutes. They were married soon after. For each it was the second time: she had been married, unhappily, to the actor Owen Moore, a sad drunk, and he to socialite Beth Sully, with whom he had his only child. When his son was born, Doug confessed he had \"no more paternal feelings than a tiger in the jungle with his cub\". Later, when Douglas Junior grew into a tall, good-looking lad, Douglas Senior, always sensitive about his age, was uncomfortable at being seen with him. In fact, Fairbanks was 33 when he entered films. He had begun to appear on the New York stage from the age of 16. In the long-running Hawthorne of the USA (1912), he leapt over a wall, had a fistfight and jumped out of a window, thus establishing himself as the All-American hero with the ingratiating grin who became one of the highest-paid stars in the world. His early pictures were social satires. In the first United Artists film, His Majesty, The American (1919), he played a New York man-about-town who is heir to the throne of a small European kingdom. In When the Clouds Roll By (1919), one of his most inventive and surreal pictures, there is a weird dream sequence in which he is pursued by giant-sized versions of the food he had eaten at dinner, slow motion revealing his extraordinary athleticism. For sheer movement and excitement, there is little in the silent cinema to equal the climax of The Mollycoddle (1920). Fairbanks leaps from a cliff to the top of a tree and hurls himself on the villain (Wallace Beery). They roll down a hill and over a waterfall before our hero emerges victorious. The Mark of Zorro (1920) began the series of costume spectaculars from which he emerged a major sex symbol. Both as the yawning fop and the swashbuckling Zorro, he was at his brilliant, bouncy best. Fairbanks said he was born to play D'Artagnan in The Three Musketeers (1921) which, with its vast sets representing 17th century France, started a trend towards million-dollar period spectaculars. In plumed hat, long curly wig and wearing a moustache for the first time, he galloped through the stirring tale, and retained the pencil moustache for the rest of his life. Robin Hood (1922) had the biggest sets ever conceived for a silent picture, including a gigantic castle with 90ft high walls built by 500 workmen. The action scenes surpassed anything Doug had done before with hidden trampolines being used to give more lift to his leaps, particularly one across a 15-foot moat. Fairbanks took a hand in all aspects of film-making, and was particularly interested in set design. Made for the unprecedented sum of $2m, The Thief of Bagdad (1924) was his most ambitious and opulent film. William Cameron Menzies constructed mammoth sets including towering minarets and Moorish buildings which gave the film an exotic, fairy-tale atmosphere. It set new Hollywood standards for special effects that still astonish, even though the magic carpet was hung by piano wires from a crane that swung high over the sets. The Black Pirate (1926) was the first two-tone Technicolor movie, and it contained one of the silent screen's most spectacular stunts: in order to capture a ship, Fairbanks climbs up a mast and descends to the deck by piercing the wide sail with his sword, ripping the canvas as he goes. As his chest was exposed for most of the film, the hirsute star had to have it shaved every morning before shooting. In 1929, Fairbanks, now 45, returned to the role of D'Artagnan in The Iron Mask. It allowed for an older and wiser but still agile characterisation. The film's only acknowledgement of sound dialogue was in Fairbanks' speech in a prologue and epilogue. It was the end of the great silent era. When Fairbanks and Pickford co-starred in the \"all-talking, all-scrapping\" The Taming of the Shrew (1929), their marriage and careers were coming to an end. He failed to learn his lines, arrived late and undermined her confidence by being hypercritical.

The offbeat film stars Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam as runaway convicts who get confused for travelling beauty-pageant choreographers. Much camp fun ensues. \"If they're going to make a movie about Happy, then let them make it about the real place,\" said Ed Burk, a farmer. \"There is no gay bar in Happy\". The film was shot in Peru, California. Co-writer Ed Stone, who worked near Happy when in his 20s, defended his movie: \"Like most every small town in Texas, Happy's citizens were just mad when it came to beauty pageants. As a disc jockey I'd sometimes go on the air and poke a little fun at this obsession and you wouldn't believe the angry calls that came in.'' While one of the film's stars, Oscar-nominated William H Macy, argues that Happy, Texas \"could've made fun of people, but it didn't\", the town's great and good are rallying against the film. Patricia Sims, city secretary of the 'town without a frown', argues that, while, 'I haven't seen it and I don't think most folks around here have seen it, but it doesn't sound like anything that could happen here\". Jess Rutledge - another farmer - agrees: \"they could've named it anything. Way it sounds, maybe they should have named it Lubbock or even Dallas.\". Angela's Ashes exposed A critic at Aint-It-Cool-News has reviewed Alan Parker's long-awaited Oscar hopeful, Angela's Ashes, based on the novel by Irish writer Frank McCourt. The book and film recall McCourt's penniless upbringing in rural Ireland. According to the so-called 'Feature Presentation Man', Parker's version, which stars Robert Carlyle and Emily Watson, is 'adapted with exquisite craftsmanship, superior performances, an evocative score by John Williams'. 'Director Alan Parker is a craftsman and brings to this work a passion rooted deeply in his family's heritage. Fine', says this critic. And here comes the 'but'. 'For others we heard enough from our parents [about] how they walked six miles to school every day in snow and rain. So out of respect to their humble beginnings, we'll save the $8 on this glumfest'. The film, this review concludes, amounts to '2 ½ hours of virtuous squalor'. Miramax bag Godfather writer's last novel It was an offer Mario Puzo's estate couldn't refuse: Miramax has acquired the rights to Omerta, the late Godfather author's soon-to-be-published final novel. While observers believe the price to have been around $3 million, Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein would say only that his company paid \"a record sum\" for the sought-after Mafia tale. \"Even though we were going to get higher offers\", greased the Puzo estate spokesman, Bert Fields, \"Weinstein's passion for the subject matter and the locale and his reverence for Mario's work was important Mario would be pleased.\" The deal continues Weinstein's association with all things Italian: \"Over the past two years, I have spent a great deal of time in Italy filming Malena and The Talented Mr. Ripley I have gained a new passion and appreciation for the culture\". Omerta (the Mafia code of silence) features the orphaned son of a Sicilian godfather who is raised by a powerful New York don. When his surrogate father is murdered by a drug cartel, Viola attempts to settle the vendetta the way they use to back in the Old Country. Miramax's purchase brings together the company with the best current Academy Awards track record and the author whose work has generated the most nominations. The three Godfather films accrued 29 Academy Award nods. Mario Puzo died in July at the age of 78. Fighting shy? David Fincher's The Fight Club may well be the most confrontational, explosive film of the year: it stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton as members of a club in which disillusioned young men bare-knuckle fight for kicks. But there were lines even it wouldn't cross, as the writer of the original novel, Chuck Palahniuk, has revealed. There was a point in Palahniuk's book, apparently, at which Helena Bonham-Carter's character addresses lover Brad Pitt with the following sweet nothing: 'I want to have your abortion'. According to the novelist, \"David fought so hard to keep it in the film, but even Brad asked David to take that line out. He said, 'My mother is going to see this!'\" And so the line was changed, in the finished film, to the significantly less poetic, 'I haven't been fucked like this since grade school'.

According to rumours circulating in cyberspace, Jackson agreed to record another album for Sony Music on the proviso that they cleared his path into movies. A deal was reportedly struck between Sony and Columbia, under which the melting-faced singer would headline King Tut. Jackson's Egyptian pedigree includes the video for his early '90s hit Remember the Time. • Edward Norton has signed to Motherless Brooklyn, about a detective suffering from Tourette's Syndrome who must solve the murder of his mentor. That syndrome results in tics, twitches, bizarre speech patterns, and uncontrollable behavior - so expect the Oscars to duly flow. • Djimon Hounsou, star of Speilberg flop Amistad, will headline The Long Run, playing a manipulative athletics coach who undermines a rival, played by Armin Mueller-Stahl (Shine), to win over a top female runner.

A studio is dying, the darkness ready to descend. RKO may have put King Kong on top of the Empire State building and Citizen Kane in the nation's headlines but now it was broke and desperate. Boy wonder Orson Welles had been shown the door; his apprentices and acolytes banished to the B pictures. Was there no one who could give life to the shadows? Enter an unlikely prince of darkness, the \"Sultan of Shudders\", a man who could terrify audiences with half-glimpsed menace... producer extraordinaire Val Lewton. \"I'll tell you a secret: if you make the screen dark enough, the mind's eye will read anything into it they want! We're great ones for dark patches.\" This is how Lewton explained his credo to Life magazine in 1946. He was a funny kind of saviour: neurotic, workaholic, shy and prone to stutter on the telephone. And he hated cats, loathed them. But without Lewton, the history of horror films would have been different and less subtle. Lewton's son, who bears the same name, remembers an anxious figure. \"He was a prime neurotic, there's no doubt about that - but as long as he was working he could keep it under control. There is a journal entry that he wrote about a dream he had when he was on a train, of being pursued by a cat. He did have a strange relationship to cats - he gave ours a wide berth because it had a habit of biting off the heads of ground squirrels for him as a trophy. We'd eat alone those nights.\" Ironic, then, that Cat People tore up the town, and the rulebook of horror. It was made for a pittance and raked in millions. \"I like the dark, it's friendly,\" says sweet little Irina, played by Simone Simon, an ancient girl in a modern world who prowls the zoo, sketching felines, loathing her feral nature and dreading sex that will turn her into a ravening beast. The petite star of Cat People, Simone Simon had worked with Renoir and Gabin before the lights went out in Europe. It was her kittenish beauty and innocence that drew Lewton to her, and she too was won over by his enthusiasm for the new, dark landscape of horror. \"I adored doing it,\" she recalls. \"We plunged into that picture, did it in 18 days and worked very hard at it because there was no time for rest, no time for lunch. But we did it with faith. We were a group of actors who were scared to death to do that story. I worked on that picture with all of my being, in my heart and my head and it was such a strange character and story and many people could have laughed at it. But it was such a success.\" It's clever stuff from Lewton and his writer DeWitt Bodeen, but it's the mood of doubt that's so unsettling - not just in Cat People but in all the nine films his little unit cranked out in four years. Lewton was no fool, and neither did he work alone. He gathered around him a band of neophytes and old hands: editors such as Robert Wise and Mark Robson, still tainted by their work for Welles, were given their first directorial assignments. But it was Jacques Tourneur, son of a great French silent director, who brought screen poetry to Lewton's finest 70-minute creations: Cat People, The Leopard Man and I Walked with a Zombie. Together they crafted images that linger on when the detail has faded. A terrified woman's screams echo from the walls of a dark swimming pool as a growling shadow menaces her. White-robed women trail through swaying sugar cane with a massive, hollow-eyed zombie, the moonlight shining off his undead black body. And worst, most dreadful of all, in The Leopard Man, a mother hears her terrified child beating on the door. Disbelieving, she takes her time before - whump! - a great thud, and the door shudders before thick, dark blood trickles beneath it. Lewton was everywhere, across everything. Developing stories, endlessly tweaking and detailing scripts that became virtual blueprints for rapid shoots. Always urging everyone on and into the dark. His was the freedom of poverty. Tiny budgets, standing sets that Astaire and Rogers had once gambolled on, blood-curdling titles handed to him by the studio already pre-tested on munitions workers for their thrill value. The rest was down to Lewton and his hand-picked team. They sat and studied all the horror that had already unspooled before American audiences and devised their own method for pricking the hairs on the backs of necks. \"Our formula is very simple. A love story, three scenes of suggested terror, one scene of actual violence and it's all over in less than 70 minutes. No grisly stuff for us, no mask-like faces hardly human with gnashing teeth and hair standing on end. No creaking, physical manifestations. No horror piled on horror - you can't keep up horror that's long sustained; it becomes something to laugh at. But take a sweet love story or a story of sexual antagonisms, people like the rest of us - and you cut in, you're here and there by suggestion and you've got something!\" Lewton had come to RKO seeking freedom from the ceaseless demands of monstrous boy wonder David O Selznick. He had spent eight years by Selznick's side, reading the latest novels to him on endless train journeys, advising him on what to adapt next from the \"great works of Europe\", fixing scripts for David Copperfield and Anna Karenina, letting Selznick bark questions about Oliver Twist from the toilet. He had seen Hollywood from the top down, and inside out; and at 34 wasn't getting any of the credit - or any younger. Lewton, originally Vladimir Ivan Leventon, couldn't fail to be a storyteller. He was born in 1904, a boy from the Black Sea paradise of Yalta, a place where folktales mingled with the salon talk of Russia's holidaying literati. An absent father, gambler and womaniser, had left him heavily under the influence of both his mother and a magical aunt called Alla Nazimova, star of the St Petersburg stage; a formidable woman who had found success in New York as the pre-eminent exponent of Ibsen. It was to Nazimova's great house in upstate New York that Lewton's mother fled after struggling to raise her family. Lewton's mother began to write professionally as Nazimova parlayed her stage stardom into the new medium of motion pictures. Vladimir Leventon may have been transformed into Val Lewton, but he wasn't quite the all-American boy. Rather, he was someone who would recite reams of poetry during a school ball game, and invent dangerous encounters with wild animals in the woods - endlessly reinventing himself: a perfect candidate for Hollywood. He did the apprenticeship; journalism - fired for faking a story about overheating kosher chickens; a novelist - eight books before he was 30, including the first Depression bestseller, even some pornography. He'd adapted the latest films for radio and churned out soap operas, always living for the deadline, writing scenes for the actors on-air. Then Selznick came calling and Hollywood took him. Eight years with Selznick; then, beginning in 1942, half as many again in his own little kingdom. But it couldn't last. Lewton was never really one of them: too modest, too subtle, too in love with the art of story-telling. By 1946 the good days at RKO were coming to an end. The aptly-named Jack Gross wanted more blood and monsters, the studio was once again in turmoil. It was time to move on. Robert Wise, now a legend himself, saw Lewton walk out on a world he had made his own. \"Oh it's a very sad story. I think really it was the business, the nature of the business that did him in. He had this marvellous unit at RKO, almost carte blanche, certainly more freedom than most. But his agents said, 'You've got a reputation and you've got to get into A pictures,' and he went up to Paramount.\" Paramount took him and Hollywood politics killed him. Rarely able to confront or express his anger, Lewton took to wearing what he called his dog puke tie, a silk job of outrageous hues, for meetings with those he despised and loathed. No one noticed, of course, and at Paramount he got absolutely nowhere. The truth was that a little bit of Lewton's past had come back to haunt him. No undead zombie, this, but a big gorilla named Henry Ginsberg. Lewton had once played an elaborate practical joke on Ginsberg during his time with Selznick: a big mistake in a small town, especially as Ginsberg became head of Paramount just months after Lewton's arrival. All of Lewton's invention and eagerness was wasted away on endless, stalled projects. Dickens's The Cricket and the Hearth, a Bing Crosby child crusade project, a story about the Borgias. When something did go before the cameras, My Own True Love, it stank. It was the first Lewton film to lose money. Increasingly stressed and paranoid, watching those he'd nurtured make it big in a town that had shut him out, Lewton succumbed to a series of heart attacks. His 13-year-old son was sheltered from the worst, only realising how ill his father was during his last days in hospital. \"It must have been horrible for him because he had an oxygen tent; he was closed in. If you can imagine a man who had spent his productive life describing how horrible it is to be closed in and fearful, here he was.\" Lewton, ever the keen-eyed reader of a good property, died with a copy of From Here to Eternity by his bed. • Cat People and Curse of the Cat People are re-released on October 29."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"politics/1999/oct/16/uk.politicalnews","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-16T02:17:30Z","webTitle":"Muzzle cats and embrace IT say peers pitching for power","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/oct/16/uk.politicalnews","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/oct/16/uk.politicalnews","fields":{"headline":"Muzzle cats and embrace IT say peers pitching for power","bodyText":"One makes the case for muzzling cats. Another boasts that she brings flowers. A third claims to \"have the good of the country at heart\". The nation's hereditary peers yesterday revealed their attempts to come to terms with advertising's principle of the \"unique selling point\" with the publication of their 75-word manifestos for the last remaining places in a reformed House of Lords. The efforts of earls, viscounts and baronesses to embrace the unseemly realities of democratic elections offer an unprecedented display of boastfulness, modesty, eccentricity and the triumph of hope over experience - \"Looking to the future, the House may need IT peers!\" opines technology buff Lord Renwick. The brief electoral statements are the only submissions peers are permitted to make if they wish to apply for election to fill 92 places allocated for hereditaries in the so-called transitional House of Lords, including 15 deputy speaker positions. In order to prevent a full-scale peers' revolt scuppering Lords reform legislation now completing its journey through parliament, the government offered a temporary reprieve for a tenth of the hereditary peers, allowing each party to elect its own share. In a move which discomfited many peers reluctant to submit to the indignity of composing self-promoting slogans along the lines of supermarket competitions, the authorities of the Upper House decreed that each should have no more than 75 words to make their case. The results show an imaginative range of tactics. While many opt for a simple CV-style approach, listing committee positions and directorships held, others outline their occasionally eccentric beliefs in detail. Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, a cross-bencher, calls for action against cruelty to animals, wanting \"all cats to be muzzled outside to stop the agonising torture of mice and small birds\". Conservative Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, meanwhile, promises to speak on, among other subjects, \"the Historic Vehicle Movement and the New Forest\". Tory peer Viscount Torrington prefers a \"man of the world\" approach, without seeking to dwell on a host of achievements. \"At 56,\" he writes, \"I can offer simply the modest wisdom and insight which comes from 35 years of experience as an international businessman, traveller, country-lover, part-time politician and member of your Lordships' House.\" Many of the peers underline their loyalty to the House. Baroness Strange, a crossbencher whose peerage was created in 1628, reveals that she \"Writes Lords diary; brings flowers; loves House of Lords\". Lord Monk Bretton, a Conservative, promises: \"If selected I am now able to shed outside commitments and increase both output and attendance. I see it as a duty that one should offer to serve.\" Other peers clearly find the indignity of having to seek electoral support a little too much to bear. Lord Morris, a Conservative, offers a terse 18 words: \"It is hardly for me to attempt to proselytise my candidature; it is a matter for my peers.\" The Earl of Onslow, a leading critic of the abolition of hereditaries, cannot bring himself to promote his own cause. He writes: \"It would be as vainglorious to proclaim a personal manifesto, as it would be arrogant to list any achievement.\" A further selection of peers' manifestos is due soon, prior to elections for deputy whips later this month, and then for the remainder of the remaining hereditaries, with results due on November 5. Peers who do not make it over the democratic hurdles can take some consolation in the fact that they will continue to have rights to dine and drink in the guest bar and dining room of the Lords even after they lose voting rights. However, even those privileges will end next summer at the close of the next parliamentary session. In not more than 75 words, my unique selling point is... Lord Geddes, Conservative Businessman, aged 62 Spoken on energy, nationality, immigration, transport, industry, EC, China and Hong Kong. 15 years' continuous committee work (currently chairman European sub-committee B). Executive member of Association of Conservative Peers. \"Brains; Breadth; Brevity.\" Earl of Onslow, Conservative Farmer, aged 61 Since I succeeded, aged 33, I have tried to serve my country, the House of Lords and the Conservative Party. It would be as vainglorious to proclaim a personal manifesto, as it would be arrogant to list any achievement. I therefore hope that my fellow peers will honour me with their vote, on account of their knowledge of my endeavours. Viscount Monckton of Brenchley, crossbencher Former senior army officer, aged 83 I support: The Queen and all the Royal Family. The United Kingdom and not a Disunited Republic. Action against cruelty to animals, particularly fishing with rods. All cats to be muzzled outside to stop the agonising torture of mice and small birds.

Ten years ago, no one would have dreamt of asking the then prime minister which team she favoured; partly because Margaret Thatcher would have been too busy trying to get the event banned.

Fellow MEPs are watching in amusement as the patriotic trio spend their daily allowances down to the last euro on smart hotels and restaurants, leaving barely any money for their promised \"fighting fund\" to take Britain out of Europe. Only last week, Strasbourg's four star Sofitel hotel, the city's finest, played host to Michael Holmes, Nigel Farrage and Jeffrey Titford when the European parliament moved to its French base. A single room costs £130 a night, plus £10 for a sumptuous breakfast, in the 155-room hotel, which is within walking distance of Strasbourg's cathedral and its Petite France area. MEPs have a daily allowance of £151.10 when they are away from their constituencies, which last week left the grand sum of £11.10 a day for the UKIP's fighting fund, assuming that the MEPs went without food. After a hectic day's work haranguing Eurocrats in the parliament last week, the MEPs retired to the hotel's well-stocked bar where they socialised with pro-European British MEPs who are regularly vilified by the independence campaigners. The jovial banter in the bar was a far cry from the party's earnest manifesto for June's European elections. \"All UKIP candidates for this election have given written undertakings which prevent them benefiting personally from their expenses and allowances as MEPs,\" the manifesto declared. Mr Farrage, UKIP's chairman, who was elected in the south east England constituency, yesterday defended his stay at the Sofitel, which was booked by the European parliament. \"We are new boys,\" he said. \"We will be looking for more reasonable accommodation so that money can be ploughed back into our campaign fund.\" His expensive tastes were welcomed yesterday by Mr Farrage's fellow south east MEP, the Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne. \"It is a matter of great encouragement to pro-Europeans that UKIP's surplus for its campaign fund to take Britain out of Europe will be rather less than expected,\" he said. The disclosure of the UKIP MEPs' taste for the European high life comes a week after members passed a motion of no confidence in its national executive."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/1999/oct/21/politicalnews.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-21T00:33:33Z","webTitle":"Commons sketch: Solved: the mystery of Hague's Norwegian blues","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/oct/21/politicalnews.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/1999/oct/21/politicalnews.politics","fields":{"headline":"Commons sketch: Solved: the mystery of Hague's Norwegian blues","bodyText":"The great Norway mystery consumed the House of Commons yesterday. All afternoon parliament buzzed with rival theories. What we can say for sure is that no Tory leader has suffered so much from that sea-girt, pine-clad, troll-infested kingdom since Neville Chamberlain resigned after the Norway debate of 1940. It had been a good, combative day for William Hague. So who left it in ruins? I handed the conundrum over to my old friend Nero Wolfe, the gourmet detective who solves cases without moving from his house in New York. \"I decline,\" he said, \"to have my lunch interrupted by the exigencies of mere detection. I shall attend to the client's request after lunch.\" When he had added another inch to his waistline so that he looked more like the Goodyear blimp than ever, which is saying plenty, he finally invited me to take the leather chair in his study. \"Proceed, Archie, and kindly err on the side of brevity.\" \"OK, boss, here's the deal. Prime minister's questions, almost over, the chief is giving both barrels to Hague, the Tory capo - for now. Usual story, Europe. Big territorial dispute going on there. \"Hague says he can renegotiate the deal. Blair says five gets you 20 that he's talking through his fedora.\" \"Be so good as to spare me the colourful details, Archie,\" Wolfe said, pulling on his beer and closing his eyes. This is the only guy I know who's paid more for being asleep than Michael Jordan gets for shooting hoops. \"OK, so Blair fires the big one. You can cut a new deal with the EU mob, huh? 'Name one other country in Europe that supports you. There isn't one.' \"Next thing, it's hell on a skateboard in there. 'Norway?' shouts Blair, replying to some shout he's heard, \"Norway? Norway isn't a member of the European Union!' \"So the Labour gang collapses in a heap like a girls' school trip spotting Brad Pitt on the bus, and Blair gets cheered out. He looks great, and Hague looks so dumb that if you took off his baseball cap his head would rattle. \"So who yelled 'Norway'? That's what the client wants to know and he'll pay 15 big ones if you find out.\" \"Eyewitness reports, Archie. You know the procedure.\" \"You'd get more reliable eyewitness reports if you put LSD in the coffee at St Dunstan's. But here goes. Some say it was Hague himself. \"A couple reckon it was Bercow, the bird who took a 'copter to his selection meeting to make himself look rich, though the bag lady on our stoop is wealthier: at least she has pizza coupons. \"A few of the reporters figure Hague was saying 'No way!' He likes Americanisms. Next week he's going to tell Blair 'eat my shorts' over tax rises.\" \"Pfui!\" said Wolfe, \"Folderol and balderdash. It was none of those things. The mystery is that there is no mystery.\" \"OK, even for you that's crazy. You sat here, you didn't go outside the house, you didn't make a phone call, and you know the answer?\" \"The answer is that nobody said 'Norway,'\" Wolfe replied. \"Blair claimed he heard it in order to get a roar of applause at the end of a diffi cult session. He invented it.\" \"You certain? The hacks say he doesn't have the smarts to pull a stunt like that.\" \"Possibly so,\" said Wolfe. But there is one man who is quite cunning enough to construct a foolish heckle in order to facilitate a crushing riposte. He is a tall, sinister man with a perpetual sneer.\" \"You mean...?\" \"Yes, I refer to Mr Alastair Campbell. I think you will find he was present throughout the exchanges, in order to make certain that his 'boss' did as he was instructed.\" \"Kindly bank the client's cheque, Archie.

The same company has taken rights on six future productions from Franchise, including Steve Buscemi's next directorial effort, the Eddie Bunker adaptation The Animal Factory . * Bless the Child , yet another Biblical prophecy thriller with Kim Basinger, Jimmy Smits and Christina Ricci, sold French and Belgian distribution rights to CLT-Ufa International. *Spyglass Entertainment has chipped in to take continental European distribution rights for two Disney-produced films - Michael Mann's The Insider (with Russell Crowe as a whistle-blowing tobacco company executive, and Al Pacino as a TV journalist) and Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars (starring Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle). Disney hardly ever lets anyone else get involved with studio films, but Spyglass has a network of distribution partners in Europe to pass the films on to. Sid Sheinberg was having a bad afternoon. The 65-year-old ex-boss of MCA/Universal, once one of the most powerful film executives in Hollywood, was in London to try to sell Playing Mona Lisa, a low-budget movie he'd financed himself. \"I wouldn't know a buyer if I saw one,\" he confided. Sheinberg is famous as the man who \"discovered\" Spielberg - he put the young director of Amblin under contract way back in 1968. In his prime, Sheinberg greenlit films from Jaws (in which his wife, Lorraine Gary, co-starred) to ET. \"It's like the difference between flying a 747 and one of those devices that people in the Middle Ages used to put wings on, flap and jump off cliffs,\" he says of the shift from running a Hollywood studio to producing low-budget movies for the independent market. He was clearly finding it a culture shock to have to haggle with the small-timers who swarm into the UK every autumn for the London Screenings. You can't blame him for looking lost. London isn't exactly an organised event. It is run by three different outfits with similar-sounding names - London Screenings, London Premiere Screenings and Film London. Hundreds of producers, distributors and sales agents take up residence at the Meridien, the Hotel Hampshire or, in Sheinberg's case, the Dorchester, and spend five days bouncing like atoms round Soho, haggling, attending screenings, foraging for new product, and making long-winded announcements about films which may never be made. The London Screenings, started up in the early 90s, used to be a small-scale, informal event for executives en route to the main autumn film market in Milan (Mifed). It has evolved into a market almost as big (and just about as absurd) as Cannes itself. This year, there was plenty of hype. Kate Winslet announced to the buyers that she is to executive-produce and star in a new film adaptation of Emile Zola's Thérèse Raquin, while Michael Winterbottom finally sorted out the funding for his long-gestating \"potato western\", Kingdom Come, a $15m epic set during the California gold rush. (Madonna, who was originally pencilled in to play Lucetta, proprietess of the local whorehouse, has pulled out, and the cast is now headed by Charlize Theron, Peter Mullan and Nastassja Kinski.) Various members of the Natural Nylon gang (Ray Winstone in his Elvis suit, Jonny Lee Miller and Jude Law among them) performed karaoke to encourage interest in their north London gangster comedy, Love, Honour and Obey, and one party was invaded by several life-sized Jellykins, the blob-like stars of the new kids' TV series who may well be appearing in their own movie soon. There was also news of two new Noel Coward adaptations; the first, Relative Values, marks Julie Andrews's screen comeback, while the other, Quadrille, is to star Madonna; the BBC hyped up its new Roddy Doyle adaptation, When Brendan Met Trudy; and there was a premiere of Best, an intriguingly cast affair with Linus Roache as Denis Law, Ian Hart as Nobby Stiles, Jerome Flynn as Bobby Charlton and John Lynch (who also wrote the screenplay) as George Best. Lynch clearly regards the footballer as a latterday tragic hero. \"He tried to fill his emptiness with alcohol,\" Lynch writes of the spindly little kid from Belfast who became one of the greatest and most charismatic players in British football history. \"He terrorised his gift and scorned the world. Yet when he played football, forgiveness and wonder sprung to our lips.\" Other high-profile screenings included Shirley MacLaine's debut feature, Bruno (\"very schmaltzy\" according to the buyers) and Joel Schumacher's new film, Flawless (Robert De Niro as a security guard getting over a stroke). As usual, foreign language product was all but snubbed (one sales agent, handling an award-winning Iranian title, reported that nobody turned up to the screening in a big West End cinema), while buyers clamoured after star-driven spectacle. The lines between Hollywood and the British industry are fast blurring. The studios now seem keener than ever on splitting rights (and costs) with the Europeans. This much was proved when, on the eve of the London screenings, Winchester Films announced it had made a pact with producer Chuck Gordon (Die Hard, Waterworld) to co-produce a $500m slate of 15 films over five years, each in the $20m-$80m bracket. Bizarrely, a company that was recently trying to sell a low-budget adaptation of kids' show Mr Benn, is now touting an $80m 18th-century action-drama called Black Rock which Jan de Bont is set to direct and Gordon to produce. Sheinberg had a testing week, attempting to drum up interest in Playing Mona Lisa, which unfortunately isn't in the $80m range and has no big stars attached. \"It wasn't expensive and bloated enough to get the attention of the bigwigs,\" he grumbled from the sanctuary of his suite. \"Everybody sends their minion so you have to work your way up.\" As soon as he left London, he was due in Canada, where his new film, A Fate Totally Worse Than Death (again self-financed) was due to start shooting. It's about teenagers who begin to age prematurely. \"Their breasts begin to droop, their hair falls out and they become incontinent,\" Sheinberg explained. Just for a second, it seemed as if he was talking about all those harassed sales executives who'd been rushing round London for five unhappy days in search of those ever-more elusive buyers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk/1999/oct/21/ianblack.juliahartleybrewer","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-21T01:09:34Z","webTitle":"Protesters dog Jiang's tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/21/ianblack.juliahartleybrewer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/oct/21/ianblack.juliahartleybrewer","fields":{"headline":"Protesters dog Jiang's tour","bodyText":"Pro-Tibet and human rights demonstrators yesterday maintained their dogged pursuit of the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, on the second day of his state visit, as business deals worth $3.5bn (£2.2bn) to British firms were announced. Amid signs that the government was responding to public criticism by raising the case of two dissidents with the Chinese, a lone Tibetan broke through heavy security to weave a bicycle into the presidential motorcade as it crawled down the Strand in central London. Chanting freedom slogans and waving the Tibetan flag, the man cycled directly in front of Mr Jiang's limousine for at least 15 seconds before six police officers wrestled him to the ground. The Chinese leader appeared unruffled as the limousine pulled up at the nearby Savoy hotel for a reception, and the Tibetan was bundled into a police van. On a day largely devoted to sightseeing, Mr Jiang paid brief visits to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, the Millennium Dome and to the Globe theatre on the South Bank to watch a performance of Julius Caesar. But even there the Bard-loving president could not escape reminders of dissent when Mark Rylance, the artistic director, said he had had to consider \"very carefully\" whether to agree to the visit. Some 25 gold-masked protesters from the Free Tibet campaign booed and held banners proclaiming: \"Tibet is the real tragedy\", and another with the words \"et tu, Tony?\". He also faced chanting demonstrators outside the Banqueting House on Whitehall. Mr Jiang sees Tony Blair in Downing Street today for the only substantive political talks of his visit, but officials again played down the question of dissidents. \"The prime minister will express the concern we have about the human rights record ... but he will want to talk about other issues relating to other parts of our relationship,\" his spokesman said. Theory and practice gap Seeking to deflect disquiet about the gap between the theory and practice of an ethical foreign policy, Robin Cook used a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Tang Jixuan, to express concern about the cases of two political prisoners and to call for \"practical improvements on the ground\". Rebiya Kadeer, a wealthy businesswoman and member of China's Muslim Uigur minority, has been under arrest since August 1996 and Wang Ce from Zhejiang province is serving a four-year prison sentence for \"endangering state security\". Both are considered prisoners of conscience by Amnesty International. Yesterday's announcement by the DTI that deals worth about £2.2bn had been signed was a sharp reminder of what is at stake for Britain, the largest European investor in China. BP Amoco's agreement with the China Petroleum Corporation to undertake a joint feasibility project for an ethylene cracker and derivatives complex at Jinshan is alone worth $1.5bn. Other projects involve NatWest, HSBC and Marconi. Downing Street also insisted it had not asked the police to take particularly stringent measures to deal with demonstrators during the visit after complaints about \"heavy-handed\" action. The Liberal Democrat peer and chairman of the all-party parliamentary human rights group, Lord Avebury, said: \"They are not allowed to wave flags or posters anywhere in China, and it is surely incongruous that we should adopt Chinese methods to deal with individual protesters in the United Kingdom. It is not for the government to say whether people should offend him [Jiang] or not. It is for people to express themselves freely in a democracy.\" The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, said: \"If people can protest for and against the extradition of Senator Pinochet and former prisoners of war can protest against the visit of the Emperor of Japan, supporters of a free Tibet and human rights in China must be allowed to protest as well.\" Foreign office minister John Battle said: \"This visit is about more than human rights. It is about trade and other wider cultural exchanges. China is going to be a major global player in the new millennium. \"It is in our interests to have an open, cooperative relationship that enables them to move into the world economy.\""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/1999/oct/21/2","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-21T09:51:51Z","webTitle":"Hey, you wanna buy a movie?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/oct/21/2","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/oct/21/2","fields":{"headline":"Hey, you wanna buy a movie?","bodyText":"Sid Sheinberg was having a bad afternoon.

In his prime, Sheinberg greenlit films from Jaws (in which his wife, Lorraine Gary, co-starred) to ET. \"It's like the difference between flying a 747 and one of those devices that people in the Middle Ages used to put wings on, flap and jump off cliffs,\" he says of the shift from running a Hollywood studio to producing low-budget movies for the independent market. He was clearly finding it a culture shock to have to haggle with the small-timers who swarm into the UK every autumn for the London Screenings. You can't blame him for looking lost. London isn't exactly an organised event. It is run by three different outfits with similar-sounding names - London Screenings, London Premiere Screenings and Film London. Hundreds of producers, distributors and sales agents take up residence at the Meridien, the Hotel Hampshire or, in Sheinberg's case, the Dorchester, and spend five days bouncing like atoms round Soho, haggling, attending screenings, foraging for new product, and making long-winded announcements about films which may never be made. The London Screenings, started up in the early 90s, used to be a small-scale, informal event for executives en route to the main autumn film market in Milan (Mifed). It has evolved into a market almost as big (and just about as absurd) as Cannes itself. This year, there was plenty of hype. Kate Winslet announced to the buyers that she is to executive-produce and star in a new film adaptation of Emile Zola's Thérèse Raquin, while Michael Winterbottom finally sorted out the funding for his long-gestating \"potato western\", Kingdom Come, a $15m epic set during the California gold rush. (Madonna, who was originally pencilled in to play Lucetta, proprietess of the local whorehouse, has pulled out, and the cast is now headed by Charlize Theron, Peter Mullan and Nastassja Kinski.) Various members of the Natural Nylon gang (Ray Winstone in his Elvis suit, Jonny Lee Miller and Jude Law among them) performed karaoke to encourage interest in their north London gangster comedy, Love, Honour and Obey, and one party was invaded by several life-sized Jellykins, the blob-like stars of the new kids' TV series who may well be appearing in their own movie soon. There was also news of two new Noel Coward adaptations; the first, Relative Values, marks Julie Andrews's screen comeback, while the other, Quadrille, is to star Madonna; the BBC hyped up its new Roddy Doyle adaptation, When Brendan Met Trudy; and there was a premiere of Best, an intriguingly cast affair with Linus Roache as Denis Law, Ian Hart as Nobby Stiles, Jerome Flynn as Bobby Charlton and John Lynch (who also wrote the screenplay) as George Best. Lynch clearly regards the footballer as a latterday tragic hero. \"He tried to fill his emptiness with alcohol,\" Lynch writes of the spindly little kid from Belfast who became one of the greatest and most charismatic players in British football history. \"He terrorised his gift and scorned the world. Yet when he played football, forgiveness and wonder sprung to our lips.\" Other high-profile screenings included Shirley MacLaine's debut feature, Bruno (\"very schmaltzy\" according to the buyers) and Joel Schumacher's new film, Flawless (Robert De Niro as a security guard getting over a stroke). As usual, foreign language product was all but snubbed (one sales agent, handling an award-winning Iranian title, reported that nobody turned up to the screening in a big West End cinema), while buyers clamoured after star-driven spectacle. The lines between Hollywood and the British industry are fast blurring. The studios now seem keener than ever on splitting rights (and costs) with the Europeans. This much was proved when, on the eve of the London screenings, Winchester Films announced it had made a pact with producer Chuck Gordon (Die Hard, Waterworld) to co-produce a $500m slate of 15 films over five years, each in the $20m-$80m bracket. Bizarrely, a company that was recently trying to sell a low-budget adaptation of kids' show Mr Benn, is now touting an $80m 18th-century action-drama called Black Rock which Jan de Bont is set to direct and Gordon to produce. Sheinberg had a testing week, attempting to drum up interest in Playing Mona Lisa, which unfortunately isn't in the $80m range and has no big stars attached. \"It wasn't expensive and bloated enough to get the attention of the bigwigs,\" he grumbled from the sanctuary of his suite. \"Everybody sends their minion so you have to work your way up.\" As soon as he left London, he was due in Canada, where his new film, A Fate Totally Worse Than Death (again self-financed) was due to start shooting. It's about teenagers who begin to age prematurely. \"Their breasts begin to droop, their hair falls out and they become incontinent,\" Sheinberg explained. Just for a second, it seemed as if he was talking about all those harassed sales executives who'd been rushing round London for five unhappy days in search of those ever-more elusive buyers. Next year's blockbusters? Some deals clinched at the London screenings • The Rules of Engagement , with Samuel L Jackson as a US Army colonel on trial for killing civilians in a Third World country, and directed by William \"French Connection\" Friedkin, was claimed for UK distribution by Paramount, the US studio that part-financed it in the first place. • Martin Scorsese's period saga Gangs of New York , with Leonardo DiCaprio confirmed to star, was the target of a $65m art-finance offer from Imagine Entertainment Group (Very Bad Things). Gangs is already set up at Miramax, and expected to attract more money from Japan to complete its $90m budget. • British, German and French territories for But I'm a Cheerleader , an independent comedy about a girl sent to a \"cure gays\" summer camp, starring Natasha Lyonne (Slums of Beverly Hills, Everyone Says I Love You), were bought by German company Advanced Medien from sales agents Franchise. Advanced is likely to distribute the movie itself at home but license the movie on to local distributors in other countries. The same company has taken rights on six future productions from Franchise, including Steve Buscemi's next directorial effort, the Eddie Bunker adaptation The Animal Factory . • Bless the Child , yet another Biblical prophecy thriller with Kim Basinger, Jimmy Smits and Christina Ricci, sold French and Belgian distribution rights to CLT-Ufa International. • Spyglass Entertainment has chipped in to take continental European distribution rights for two Disney-produced films - Michael Mann's The Insider (with Russell Crowe as a whistle-blowing tobacco company executive, and Al Pacino as a TV journalist, pictured, above) and Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars (starring Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle). Disney hardly ever lets anyone else get involved with studio films, but Spyglass has a network of distribution partners in Europe to pass the films on to."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/1999/oct/21/sport.comment","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-21T15:32:14Z","webTitle":"International football the rugby way","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/1999/oct/21/sport.comment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/1999/oct/21/sport.comment","fields":{"headline":"International football the rugby way","bodyText":"The curious case of David Johnson has so far aroused a good deal of serious resentment, but its main effect seems likely to be to make football look stupid. The fact that Johnson is black has nothing to do with the rights and wrongs of picking him for Scotland although, as Lawrence Donegan has suggested in the Guardian, it may be partly responsible for the reaction against him by some Scots. To argue that someone is not \"really Scottish\" (or any other nationality) is to tread on dangerous ground. Short of advocating a nasty, racial definition of who does and does not belong to a certain country, it is almost always a mistake. Indeed, teams with a diverse set of backgrounds often say something more interesting about their country than a so-called \"pure\" selection. France's World Cup-winning team is the obvious recent example, although Ireland under Jack Charlton - much ridiculed at the time - also helped create a real debate among Irish people about their identity. Both these examples had a political impact - in the broadest sense - because they reflected a history of immigration in one case and emigration in the other. In the same way, few people saw anything amiss in Jamaica calling up for the World Cup players whose parents left the island a generation ago, as Johnson's did. Johnson's inclusion in a Scottish side would have no such implications, for the simple fact that he does not have and never has had any connection with Scotland. He is understandably keen to play international football, but does not seem too bothered which country it is for. The only thing it would tell us is that the rules of selection for the footballing nations that make up the United Kingdom are absurd. The willingness of Craig Brown (and, before him, Lawrie McMenemy) to exploit them only risks bringing their absurdity into the open. That in turn can only encourage those people in the rest of Europe, not to mention Tony Banks, who believe the very existence of the four separate teams is an anomaly. More important than that, however, is the simple fact that Johnson's selection helps to make international football a laughing-stock, a feeble parody of the club game, where rounding up players from whatever source possible is a virtue rather than an indictment. Games between nations, for better or worse (and when England and Scotland meet it's too often been worse) are about national identity or they are about nothing. Much more of this and they will be left with all the credibility of the rugby World Cup."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk/1999/oct/22/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-22T08:12:09Z","webTitle":"Internment for refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/22/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/oct/22/immigration.immigrationandpublicservices","fields":{"headline":"Internment for refugees","bodyText":"The government is to open a privately run internment camp near Cambridge to hold 400 new asylum seekers a week while their claims are processed on a \"fast track\". Those whose applications are rejected will be told to leave the country without staying in any British town or city. It is planned to open the camp, on the site of a former military barracks at Oakington, near Cambridge, early in the new year. Asylum seekers held at Oakington will not be allowed to leave the camp without permission. Those who do will be regarded as absconders liable to arrest and detention in Campsfield House, near Oxford, or at other secure detention centres. The home office announced the plan yesterday, saying Oakington would be \"a reception facility for asylum seekers where applications could be considered and dealt with promptly on site\". Currently about 800 asylum seekers are held in detention centres at any one time, either because the authorities believe they will abscond or because they face imminent deportation. But the planned internment camp, or \"reception facility\", as it is officially called, represents a major departure in policy in that all asylum seekers discovered arriving clandestinely at Dover or legitimately at Stanstead will be held in the camp regardless of whether or not there is any evidence they are likely to abscond and disappear from official view. It will increase by more than 50% the numbers in detention. At present such asylum seekers are placed in bed and breakfast hostels or other accommodation arranged by so cial services while their claims are considered. A home office spokesman said it was envisaged that Oakington would take asylum seekers who arrived at Dover without papers or were discovered trying to enter the country clandestinely in the back of a lorry. Many are expected to be families. They will be required to stay at Oakington while immigration officials conduct an initial examination of their claim. A home office statement said yesterday: \"The regime will be relaxed with minimal physical security. In certain circumstances applicants would be able with prior approval to leave without escort for specific purposes and periods.\" A spokesman said this would mean doctor's appointments, legal meetings or shopping trips for essentials for their children. The centre will have a perimeter fence but a spokesman said it would not be 12ft high topped with razor wire as was the case in Campsfield House and other immigration detention centres. Officials envisage that the claimants will be held only for short periods of about seven days while their claims are considered. But the latest asylum figures show that in 45% of claims an initial decision takes longer than six months. Those who appeal or whose claims take longer than a week to resolve will either be given temporary admission or moved to an ordinary detention centre, the home office said. The immigration minister, Barbara Roche, said yesterday: \"Recent months have seen unprecedented numbers of asy lum seekers, many of whose claims have been unfounded, arriving in the United Kingdom, putting immense pressures on the resources of the immigration service as well as local authorities in the south-east. \"The reception centre planned for Oakington will assist in several ways. It will provide support and accommodation for people who would otherwise be turning to hard pressed social services departments in the south-east. It will facilitate more rapid consideration of applications and a faster turnaround will help deter prospective abusers of our asylum system.\" But Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said he was fundamentally opposed to the plan. \"This is a detention centre in all but name in a country which already has a reputation for detaining without judicial review more people for longer periods of time than the rest of Europe.\" He said the council welcomed swifter processing of applications in what was a chaotic asylum system, but it appeared that the government was trying to be firm and fast without any guarantee of being fair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/1999/oct/24/humanrights.saudiarabia","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-24T00:14:06Z","webTitle":"Beheadings rise in the desert kingdom","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/oct/24/humanrights.saudiarabia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/1999/oct/24/humanrights.saudiarabia","fields":{"headline":"Beheadings rise in the desert kingdom","bodyText":"They call them the 'Chop Squares', the killing grounds across the kingdom of Saudi Arabia where the condemned meet their deaths at the hands of a sword-wielding executioner. If you are found guilty of any of the following in the kingdom - murder, rape, armed robbery, drug smuggling, apostasy (turning your back on Islam) or witchcraft - the price is beheading. Prisoners are taken to a public place, often outside a mosque where the men have assembled after Friday prayers, thus ensuring maximum humiliation and distress to the prisoner. In recent years, however, the number of public executions carried out under the auspices of Sharia (Koranic) law has escalated so sharply that beheadings are no longer limited to Fridays. The atmosphere during the killings in the 'Chop Squares' is one of spectacle. Women are not exempt from execution. Nor is youth any guarantee of immunity. With the onset of puberty, convicted youngsters are considered adult enough to die. Most of the prisoners beheaded in Saudi Arabia are foreign nationals. In 1998, 29 people were executed. So far this year, 95 people have been judicially killed, 49 being foreigners, including 12 Pakistanis, 10 Nigerians (three were women), nine Afghans, six Indians, as well as citizens from Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Syria, Jordan, Ethiopia, Chad and Yemen. The sharp rise in executions this year has set alarm bells ringing in human rights organisations. Figures for previous years (122 in 1997; 96 in 1996 and 192 in 1995) suggest the relatively smaller number of death sentences carried out in 1998 may have been a glitch. In 1998, the international spotlight focused on Saudi Arabia over the two British nurses, Lucille McLauchlin and Deborah Parry, accused of murdering a colleague. Their sentence was com muted and they were allowed to return to Britain on paying the deceased's relative blood money. Most people who get on the wrong side of Saudi law do not have the advantages of international media interest or legal assistance. This year the UN Commission on Human Rights renewed its call for a worldwide moratorium on executions by 2000, with a view to abolishing the death penalty worldwide. Ninety countries still retain the death penalty although 23 of these are 'abolitionist de facto ', having not carried out any executions for more than 10 years. A further 13 countries have abolished the death penalty for all but exceptional cases; 69 countries have abolished the death penalty absolutely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"theobserver/1999/oct/24/power3002","type":"article","sectionId":"theobserver","sectionName":"From the Observer","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-24T00:14:19Z","webTitle":"From Smith to Lucas","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/1999/oct/24/power3002","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/1999/oct/24/power3002","fields":{"headline":"From Smith to Lucas","bodyText":"211 Jeff Smith, 38 Head of music policy, Radio 1 (271) The fact that Jeff Smith has risen up the list while music stars such as Noel Gallagher (number 49 last year) have sunk without trace underlines where the real power in music lies. Smith is the person who controls what is played on the biggest radio station in the UK. Radio 1 is going through a mini-renaissance (see 288 Zoe Ball) with listening figures on the rise. 212 Paul Berger, 44 Chairman and CEO, Sony Music UK (272) Berger entered the tabloid lexicon with his pursuit and landing of the 12 year old soprano Charlotte Church (Music Week). 213 HRH Prince William, 17 Second in line to the throne (-) He could one day sit on the throne but William's current power lies in his ability to portray a more modern monarchy. He is many things to many people: to teenage girls he is a pin-up; to the public and - indeed the monarchy - he is the last hope for the Monarchy; and to tabloid editors he is forbidden fruit. 214 Anna Mann, CEO, Whitehead Mann (-) Co-founded one of the UK's most influential headhunting recruitment agencies, Whitehead Mann, more than 10 years ago. The Mayfair-based company is notoriously secretive for fear of compromising its blue-chip clients which include the Prudential and Marks &amp; Spencer. 215 Martin Edwards, 54 Chairman/CEO, Man United (-) Having tried and failed to sell Manchester United to the media magnate Rupert Murdoch, Edwards had to be happy with selling half his stake in the world's richest football club earlier this month to city institutions to net £40.9 million. The move is seen as a precursor to Edwards becoming chairman of the plc. Edwards was at the heart of the dispute over United's plan to pull out of this season's FA Cup competition. 216 Dame Judi Dench, 64 Actress (-) There were only eight minutes of Judi Dench in Shakespeare in Love but that was enough to win her an Oscar to sit alongside her Golden Globe award for the Broadway show Amy's View. Dench is at the height of her acting career. But it would be fair to ask whether she is more powerful than some of the behind the scenes power brokers of the film industry, such as Miramax's brothers Harvey and Bob Weinstein who produced Shakespeare in Love and Life is Beautiful, to name but two, who don't make the list. 217 Sir Christopher Hogg, 63 Chairman, Reuters (54) Hogg is also chairman of Allied Domecq, the liquor group. And both companies have come under fire from the City in recent months. Reuters reported a 7 per cent profit fall earlier this year while Allied Domecq was criticised - and Hogg bruised - by the protracted pub portfolio sale to Whitbread which was hijacked by Punch Taverns. 218 Sir Harold Kroto, 60 Royal Society research Professor, Sussex (244) Nobel prize-winner Kroto hit the headlines when he discovered that carbon could form shells called fullerenes in which atoms of the element are arranged in closed sheaths. The implications for the future of materials science from the discovery are expected to be immense. Also set up the VEGA Trust to popularise science through the media. 219 Lord Waheed Alli of Croydon, 35, MD of Production, Carlton Television (48) 5 Having banked £5 million from the deal that saw his co-owned production company Planet 24 sold for £15 million to Carlton - he now sits on the board of Carlton Productions - Lord Alli could have been expected to rise up the power list. He remains close to Tony Blair, a key adviser on the Creative Industries Task Force and within the House of Lords one of the most potent symbols of the attempts to modernise the second House. He began his career in publishing before moving into 'youth' TV with shows like The Big Breakfast and The Word. But he sometimes appears marooned in the Lords. 220 Alan Parker, 55 Chairman, Film Council (-) As the director of films such as The Commitments and Evita, Parker had the power to entertain. But as chairman of the Film Council, armed with £145 million of lottery cash over the next three years, he has a much more powerful brief to promote and produce British film projects. Returned from Hollywood after the Government gave a commitment to back the film industry. 221 Barclay Knapp, 42 Chairman/CEO, NTL (-) The diminutive but undisputed king of UK cable following last summer's £8 billion acquisition of Cable and Wireless Communication's residential business. Now the UK's largest cable company with three million customers, NTL has a global annual turnover of £1.25bn. To secure its recent deals Knapp has had to sell stakes to Microsoft and France Telecom and will bid £1 billion for Premiership football rights when the contract expires next year. 222 Graham Wallace, 51 CEO, Cable &amp; Wireless (-) Wallace has had a roller-coaster ride since becoming chief executive last February. He sold mobile phone network One-2-One to Deutsche Telekom, an underwater cable laying business, a 20 per cent stake in a French mobile phone operator and most significantly the UK residential business of Cable &amp; Wireless Communications. The disposals leave Wallace free to refocus on the business telecoms market. 223 Mario Testino, 45 Fashion photographer (-) You might not recognise the Peruvian photographer Mario Testino in the street, but you have undoubtedly seen billboards bearing his work in high-profile ad campaigns for clients including Absolut vodka, Gucci and Chanel. He is also one of the few world-class photographers routinely requested by celebrities such as Liz Hurley. As such he is in a key position to influence how such people are presented to us, and what that image communicates Ð as demonstrated by his Vanity Fair photographs of Princess Diana. 224 Lord Melvyn Bragg, 60 Broadcaster, author (192) Such is the state of power in the House of Lords that having been ennobled Melvyn Bragg has fallen down the power pecking order since last year. He is an authoritative presenter and editor of the South Bank Show and controller of arts at LWT and thus a pivotal figure in the arts establishment. Recently condemned laddish television. 225 Philip Campbell, 48 Editor, Nature magazine (-) As editor of Nature, Campbell controls a journal that controls the destiny of the nation's young researchers. A paper in Nature is the most prestigious accolade that a fledgling scientist can have and Campbell makes the most of this asset, running his kingdom with fierce determination. 226 David Hockney, 62 Artist (160) The Royal College of Art alumnus was the star of this year's Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, which devoted an entire gallery to six new works, including two panoramic landscape paintings of the Grand Canyon. An influential father figure to modern British painting, despite being based in California. 227 Ian Davies, 48 MD, McKinsey &amp; Co (-) McKinsey is the most influential management consultancy in the world and Ian Davies has been in charge of the secretive firm's London office for the past four years. Davies has worked for McKinsey for 20 years. In that time, he has seen pass through his office a steady stream of people who have gone on to become leading establishment figures including the CBI's Adair Turner and Asda chairman Archie Norman. Oh yes, and a little known politician, William Hague. 228 William Hague MP, 38 Leader, Tory Party (250) The late Alan Clark reckoned Hague will never be Prime Minister because 'he looks like a golf ball'. A successful anti-euro campaign in the European election has moved Hague up the power list. But with his 'Common sense revolution', the increasingly rabid anti-Europeanism which threatens to split what is left of his party, and the re-emergence of Michael Portillo, he is running the risk of becoming an irrelevance. 229 Charles Kennedy MP, 39 Leader, Lib Dems (-) They liken him to Prince Hal. Elected an MP in 1983, at the age of 23, he won a reputation as a talented playboy who enjoyed drink, women and chatshows. Relations with the long serving Liberal Democrat leader, Paddy Ashdown, were poor. But when Paddy went, it was obvious that Kennedy would succeed him. He has charisma, his politics are more radical than Blair's, but to be a major national player, he needs a hung Parliament in place of today's massive Labour majority. 230 Ben Elton, 40 Comedian, author (-) The prolific novelist and playwright is one of the heavyweight comedy writers in the UK, whose work includes Blackadder and The Young Ones, and the best selling novels Popcorn and Gridlock. His latest book, Inconceivable, discusses IVF treatment. That, combined with Elton's established connection with the Labour Party, determines his place on this list Ð he donated more than £5,000 to the party in the year covered by its recent published accounts. 231 Mark Booth, 42 Head, ePartners (-) As chief executive of BSkyB Booth famously didn't know who the Manchester United left back was on the day that the satellite company launched a £623 million bid for the club. He quit BSkyB in April but only to move to another News Corporation-owned venture, ePartners - a vehicle through which News Corp can invest in Internet start-ups. Booth turned down an offer from Microsoft which could have given him £62 million in shares to stay with Rupert Murdoch. He is understood to own 10 per cent of News Corporation's most significant investment in new media. 232 Naomi Campbell, 29 Supermodel (203) The obsession with fame, celebrity and beauty reached its apotheosis with the phenomenon of the 'supermodel'. Their power lies in the way their image has been used to influence style and indeed a generation of young women - with the fashion industry often criticised for perpetuating an unrealistic view of women saying that 'skinny is good'. Streatham's most famous daughter, slipping down the list, has explored a number of other avenues, having co-written a novel, released an album, acted, and got her fingers burnt in the restaurant business when the Fashion Cafe venture failed. 233 Sir Richard Doll, 86 Consultant, Imperial Cancer Research Fund (122) Professor of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology at Oxford, Sir Richard was the first researcher to prove the link between smoking and lung cancer in 1950. In doing so, he helped found the modern science of medical epidemiology. 234 Tony Juniper, 39 Director, Friends of the Earth (-) With a background in biology, Juniper is well placed to mastermind Friends of the Earth's campaign against GM foods. In contrast to Charles Secrett's political lobbying, Juniper works at a corporate level and must be gratified to see most of Britain's supermarkets refuse to sell GM produce. Friends of the Earth aims to work within the law, which is why it hasn not taken part in the destruction of GM crops. 235 Margaret Thatcher, 74 Former Prime Minister (240) Yes, nearly nine years after a grateful nation saw her bundled out of Downing Street in tears, she is still a force in the land. That is not just because the Tory party is so in awe of her that it will risk electoral unpopularity defending General Pinochet rather than upset her. Tony Blair, too, wants a little of that Thatcher lustre, and takes her views on world trouble spots seriously Ð he had a series of meetings with her over the crisis in Kosovo. 236 Lord Jack Lewis, 71 Head of House, Robinson College, Cambridge (-) The principal spokesman on science issues in the House of Lords, until 1992 Lewis ran the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which has influenced environmental policy. 237 Thomas Sargent, 56 Economist, Stanford University (288) The senior fellow of the US Hoover Institute is the godfather of the current economic orthodoxy that it is impossible for government spending to create employment and that the best policy is to keep the budget balanced and inflation low, preferably through giving the task to an independent central bank. Brown and Blair may never have heard of him, but he is a prinicipal author of their policies. 238 Brian Davis, 55 CEO, Nationwide Building Society (-) As the chief executive of the Nationwide building society, Dr Davis has had to be combative in his career. He successfully fought against a bid to convert the society into a bank and also prevented Barclays Bank from charging Link cash machine customers from rival institutions a £1 fee. A market leader in new mortgage and savings business, with bonuses he earned £621,000 this year. 239 Chris Powell, 56 Chairman, BMP DDB (-) Powell has been advising the Labour Party on its advertising and communications strategy longer than some of the new generation of special advisers have even been alive. He is now the chairman of the advertising agency BMP DDB which lists Volkswagen among its many clients, but his real power lies in the length of time he has stuck with the real passion of his life Ð the Labour Party. Powell was instrumental in setting up the Shadow Communications Agency in the mid-Eighties which was the first step in the creation of New Labour. Powell, whose younger brother Jonathan is the Downing Street chief of staff, has advised on every general election since 1983 and will again be on board for the party next time around. 240 Professor Bob Lucas, 62 Economist, University of Chicago (169) Lucas won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1995 for his work on what is known as rational expectations, the body of high, abstract theory that underpins free market economics. Although he is practically unknown outside economic circles, he is the single most important architect of the 'Washington consensus' Ð that low-tax, deregulated, balanced-budget economies are by far the best."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk/1999/oct/25/freedomofinformation.politics","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-25T15:07:48Z","webTitle":"Turkish family 'controls UK drugs business'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/oct/25/freedomofinformation.politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/1999/oct/25/freedomofinformation.politics","fields":{"headline":"Turkish family 'controls UK drugs business'","bodyText":"A close-knit Turkish family organisation - equivalent to the Italian Mafia - has taken over the supply and sale of heroin in Britain, according to an explicit American government intelligence report obtained by the Guardian. The report, released by the drug enforcement agency under the US freedom of information act, coincides with talks between Keith Hellawell, the British drug tsar and General Barry McCaffrey, his US equivalent, in London today. The cabinet office confirmed yesterday that the growing heroin problem - particularly as it is becoming a drug of first choice by teenagers - will be on the agenda on Anglo-American co-operation to fight the menace. Gen McCaffrey will meet Mo Mowlam, the new cabinet \"enforcer\" and home office ministers Charles Clarke and Paul Boateng. He is bringing 18 of his own officials for a range of meetings with government figures. The report released to the Guardian was prepared for a meeting last year between senior DEA officials and Mr Hellawell in Virginia. The DEA warns in it that there is \"a rising popularity of heroin among young people, particularly in the north of England and Scotland\". The report said 95% of heroin seized in Britain originates from south-west Asia, with Turkey \"being the most important transit point\". It flows from Turkey either through the Balkans or via Holland, Germany or Belgium into Britain. \"Much of the heroin smuggled into the United Kingdom is frequently transported aboard ferryboats, and concealed in private vehicles and tractor-trailers,\" added the report. The DEA believed that Turkish residents with connections to suppliers in Turkey dominate the heroin trade. Around 80% of the heroin intercepted by British authorities has been peddled by Turkish gangs. These gangs \"have a cohesive hierarchical structure based on family or village ties\" and are based within large Turkish communities in London and other cities. \"When the heroin arrives, local Turkish organisations break down the shipment into small consignments for further distribution,\" according to the report. \"Heroin use is common not only in major cities, but in medium-sized cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh as well. Traffickers from Scotland typically travel to England to pick up the heroin which is redistributed in Scotland.\" The DEA said Nigerian gangs could also become key players. \"Although there are no well-developed Nigerian organisations in the United Kingdom, there are numerous Nigerian criminals involved in narcotic smuggling as well as other criminal activity. The British realise there is a problem with Nigerians and have a created a special operational group which will focus on Nigerians.\" This group was due to start work last year. The DEA estimated that once heroin was being sold on the street, it was 40 to 50% pure. The Americans noted that Mr Hellawell cautioned last year that in Britain, \"heroin is now the first drug experimented with by some young people - a dangerous trend away from marijuana/hashish.\" \"Many of the same societal ills caused by drug-trafficking in the United States are now mirrored in Britain,\" added the DEA. According to the report, Mr Hellawell requested briefings from the DEA on the Colombian drug trade and a brief summary of the meeting records that the discussion centred on the domestic drug threat in the US. It adds: \"Talked about the problem encryption of telephone communications could be in England in the future for law enforcement and enforcement efforts.\" It says that the DEA was working on this problem."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/1999/oct/26/uk.news","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-26T10:33:22Z","webTitle":"Lars Von Trier film banned in Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/oct/26/uk.news","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/1999/oct/26/uk.news","fields":{"headline":"Lars Von Trier film banned in Ireland","bodyText":"The Idiots, the controversial new film by Oscar-nominated director Lars Von Trier, has been banned in Ireland. The censor, Sheamus Smith, ruled that the story of a group of rich Copenhagen kids who pretend to be mentally handicapped in order to scare potential buyers away from the house they are squatting in, was \"likely to deprave or corrupt\" viewers. The Idiots includes a fumbled orgy scene, a semi-erect penis and a great deal of naked frolicking. Some critics and disabled groups found the subject matter tasteless although others saw it as a satire on middle class mores. Von Trier, the maker of Breaking The Waves and the highly praised TV series The Kingdom, is apparently bemused by the ban. He released a slightly tongue-in-cheek \"black spot\" version of the film in Europe, in which the offending bodily parts were hidden by a black spot which roved across the screen. Despite his love of jokey references and mock dramatic pronouncements, Von Trier is regarded as the one of the best young European directors. The Idiots was passed uncut by the British board for film classification as an 18 certificate, one of several controversial films passed recently under the liberal stewardship of Andreas Whittam Smith. The film has already been shown in at least one small art house cinema in Ireland but did not get a general release. The ruling by the Irish censor effectively bans the video. Geraldine Jeffers, of distributors Metro Tartan, said they were angered by the move. \"Obviously we thought that since the unexpurgated version passed uncut in Britain it would probably do the same in Ireland.\" She said they were considering an appeal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"theguardian/1999/oct/28/features11.g24","type":"article","sectionId":"global","sectionName":"Global","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-28T01:56:33Z","webTitle":"1000 years in 500 days","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/oct/28/features11.g24","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/1999/oct/28/features11.g24","fields":{"headline":"1000 years in 500 days","bodyText":"Home The prime minister, Robert Walpole, abhorred war but there was a strong anti-Spanish mood in parliament, fuelled by rumour and dark tales of insults and slights inflicted on honest British seamen in the Caribbean. In fact, it was the British merchants who were cheating on the terms of trade. In March 1738, Captain Robert Jenkins was summoned to the Commons, where he flourished his ear, severed, he claimed, by a Spanish coastguard. If Jenkins' story was true, it had happened seven years before. But the Commons was galvanised and clamoured for war. Walpole agreed reluctantly to reinforce the Navy, but put all his effort into negotiating a diplomatic compromise, known as the Prado Convention. The Commons was not to be gainsaid and there were furious denunciations of Spain's alleged breaches of the Convention. In October 1739, against his better judgment, Walpole authorised the declaration of the oddest named conflict in history, the War of Jenkins' Ear. Away In India, the decline of the Moghul empire was graphically underlined in 1737 when an army of the powerful Maratha kingdom camped under the walls of Delhi. Baji Rao Peshwa, the Maratha leader, boasted that his Hindu army no longer had reason to fear the Muslim empire. He was right. People In 1738 John Wesley felt his heart \"strangely warmed\" during a prayer meeting in London. Already a pious man, he hurled himself into a lifetime of evangelism. In May 1739 he laid the corner stone of what would become the first Methodist chapel in Bristol. Innovations In May 1733 John Kay revolutionised the textile trade with the flying shuttle. The device caused riots among weavers, who feared it would cost jobs, but it was taken up by manufacturers. They were keen to make money, but not on giving it to Kay, who died in penury. • Daily updates of 1000 years in 500 days are at www.newsunlimited.co.uk/millennium"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"science/1999/oct/28/genetics.columnists","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"1999-10-28T14:41:27Z","webTitle":"Pirates are seizing the genome","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/oct/28/genetics.columnists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/1999/oct/28/genetics.columnists","fields":{"headline":"Pirates are seizing the genome","bodyText":"If today's intellectual property laws had been in force during the 15th century, British researchers have pointed out, Columbus could have patented America. The explorers racing to discover the 21st century's new continent of knowledge, the uncharted inner kingdom of the human genome, have their eyes on riches which the old pirate navigators could only have dreamt of: they can obtain a legal monopoly on everything they encounter. In 1995, MEPs defied the European Commission by rejecting its directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions. Doctors, researchers and patient groups had argued that patenting genes would make the diagnosis and treatment of disease more expensive, laboratories more secretive and scientists less adventurous - disinclined to look for new cures if someone else owned the genes on which they were based. Labour members of the UK parliament signed an early day motion supporting the European parliament's decision and urging \"the European Commission to reassess its policy on biotechnology and genetic engineering to ensure proper respect for human life\". Thirteen of these MPs have since become ministers. In 1997, the commission re-submitted its directive. The new draft proposed that \"An element isolated from the human body . . . including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, may constitute a patentable invention, even if the structure of that element is identical to that of a natural element.\" The directive was supported by a massive corporate lobby and several European governments. Britain's was by far the most aggressive. It argued that companies would be able to use the new law to patent the technologies surrounding genetic engineering, but not the genes themselves. Without \"a favourable climate for investment, based on the security of a firm legal framework\", British-based companies, it warned, would flee Europe for the United States and Japan. The directive would insure that EU patent provisions were \"harmonised\" with those of the United States, as a step towards the global regime for which the big biotech companies had been lobbying. None of the ministers who opposed the bill in opposition raised a squeak of protest. One of them, Kim Howells, became responsible for insuring that British law was compatible with the directive. The bill's critics, the government maintained, were \"scare-mongering\" and \"hysterical\". At length, the European parliament succumbed to the multi-million pound assault on its intellect, and passed the re-drafted directive. On September 1 this year, the bill became European law. The rest of the story hardly needs relating. An American company, Celera Genetics, has done precisely what the bill's opponents predicted, and staked a claim to a great chunk of the human genome. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton have begged Celera to re-consider its application, and Celera has chosen to ignore them. The blueprints of human life will become its private property. It will, if the British and American governments have their way, be able to pursue its claims throughout the world. By January 1 2000, the signatories to the general agreement on tariffs and trade must implement its \"Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights\" (Trips) provisions. Trips came about, according to James Enyart, a senior employee at Monsanto, after \"industry identified a major problem for international trade. It crafted a solution, reduced it to a concrete proposal, and sold it to our own and other governments\". Both India and the Organisation of African Unity have decided to oppose the Trips provisions granting patents on life, on the basis that they legalise the theft of their biological resources. They are demanding that the legislation is re-negotiated. They will fight corporate attempts to force the rest of the world into line with Europe and America by extending global property rights to the human genome during the world trade talks starting in Seattle next month. India and the OAU will be opposed at every turn by the two countries, Britain and America, which claim to be contesting corporate attempts to monopolise humanity. In the past, governments sought to protect their fleets from piracy. Today they arm the pirates and offer them legal protection, arguing that if they failed to do so the buccaneers would sail away and the native cut-throats would lose their jobs. None of this, in the age of corporate government, should be surprising. What does astonish me is that Blair and Clinton should profess themselves nonplussed when the pirates use the weapons they have been given, to open fire."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
