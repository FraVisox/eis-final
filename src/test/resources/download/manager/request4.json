Now 19, Taylor just bought a truck after a summer apprenticing with a crew of electricians installing rooftop solar systems at public schools in the county. He was among a dozen or so rookies paid $17 an hour, plus tools and a travel stipend, as part of the state’s first solar energy youth apprenticeship scheme. “Around here it’s always been coal, coal, coal, we didn’t hear much about green energy,” said Taylor, who comes from a long line of miners. “This is a great opportunity to learn, great pay, and maybe I’ll be able to stay here in the mountains with my family if solar takes off.” In the past decade or so, unemployment and poverty have forced many to leave south-west Virginia as the coal industry’s decline ricocheted across central Appalachia. It’s torn many families apart and any talk of renewable energy was considered anti-coal, but attitudes are starting to change. “We have to get away from fossil fuels that are killing our planet. Technology has come a long way and will keep getting better. This is the future,” said chief electrician Jimmy Rogers, 49, whose family worked on the coal trains in Tennessee. The region’s long-awaited energy and economic transition will be substantially boosted by America’s first climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). It’s far from a panacea, but Joe Biden’s legislation provides $369bn for the transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy – a historic investment that scientists estimate will reduce greenhouse gases by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and create an estimated 1.5m new jobs. Decent well-paid jobs are desperately needed. In Virginia, coal production has declined by 70% since its peak in 1990, and much of what’s left is semi-automated. Those old jobs are largely gone and are not coming back. The IRA provides ring-fenced money for training, innovation and manufacturing, as well as an array of tax breaks and other financial incentives to help consumers and businesses transition away from fossil fuels. And Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat senator from West Virginia played a pivotal role in watering down – and then reviving – the legislation, directing billions of dollars to the economic revival of depressed coal towns. “It’s a game changer for rural and coal communities,” said Autumn Long, a project manager for solar financing and manufacturing workforce development at the non-profit Appalachian Voices. “Renewables are a way to honour the region’s energy-producing legacy and be part of the 21st-century global energy transition. The IRA is a turning point.” ••• Wise county is a picturesque Appalachian community bordering eastern Kentucky where for decades coal dominated the economy – and almost every aspect of life. It’s home to the self-proclaimed cleanest coal plant in America, a sprawling polluting and economically unviable mountain ridge plant currently scheduled to keep operating until 2045. The population has declined by 12% since 2010 to just over 35,000. Fancy houses built with coal wealth are scattered across the mountain ridges, but the poverty rate stands at about 21%, more than 50% higher than the national average, and the county’s schools qualify for universal free school meals. Over the past five years or so Appalachian Voices has been among a consortium of non-profits working with communities, unions, businesses and local governments to help the region transition to a more environmentally and economically sustainable renewable energy economy. It’s taken time to help change local and state laws, but even longer to shift attitudes and the deep connection people feel to coal. “The politics around clean energy are not as simplistic as Democrat or Republican,” said Chelsea Barnes, the group’s legal director. “It’s been difficult even proving that solar jobs can be good union jobs, like coal.” But the work has paid off, and central Appalachia is in a good place to take advantage of the IRA provisions and historic investments. The youth apprenticeship scheme is the brainchild of entrepreneurs at Secure Futures and Got Electric – Virginia-based companies installing distributed solar systems for government agencies, hospitals, schools and commercial properties. Solar is relatively new here as it was only in 2020 that the state allowed public entities and non-profits to access power purchase agreements (PPA) – a third-party financing system which essentially means the solar company pays for upfront costs. Offset schemes like net metering can also lead to substantial savings as excess electricity goes back into the grid and is banked like rollover minutes. So far in Wise county, seven schools have signed 20-year contracts with Secure Futures for rooftop solar. “The IRA is going to help push this further, it’s so exciting,” said Matt McFadden, the company’s business development lead and a Wise county local. “Until two years ago solar was a dirty word around here, not any more. I feel optimistic about the region for the first time in a long time.” The IRA doesn’t solve the hotchpotch access to PPA and net metering, which still depends on state laws and utility regulations, but it does expand access to tax credits which will make installation 30% cheaper for most, apart from the lowest-income households. Compared with industrial solar farms – which create lots of work during the construction phase but few long-term jobs, the distributed rooftop model is more sustainable: environmentally – because it does not require new land, and economically – because it creates long-term jobs as the systems are owned, operated and maintained by the same companies. But the workforce simply doesn’t exist yet – which is what prompted McFadden to partner with vocational schools and community colleges, that have for years been pivoting away from coal jobs. “We have to reinvent ourselves in south-west Virginia, and if we want to attract new industries we have to provide a skilled workforce. We’re trying to train our young people to stay and be taxpayers. We’ve lost too many,” said William Austin, the principal of Wise County career technical center, which also offers ninth, 10th and 11th graders vocational training in welding, plumbing, cybersecurity and nursing. In these parts, almost every family is connected to the coal industry in some way, and most have relatives who have left for work, and others struggling with health problems like opioid addiction. Austin is a former miner, his son an attorney representing black lung patients, and his wife is a respiratory therapist. It’s not uncommon in the county to see black lung patients walking gingerly with an oxygen tank. The attitude shift is not just economics, the climate crisis has also hit this region. Some students travel to the school from Jenkins, Kentucky, where devastating floods in July left roads and bridges unpassable. “The climate crisis is real, we have to do something about it,” said Anthony Hamilton, 18, another solar apprentice. Hamilton and Taylor will continue as apprentices while moving on to Mountain Empire community college, situated about 20 miles south-west. The remit of the higher ed college is to prepare students for jobs in the region, and recent state and federal legislation has kicked the renewables job market wide open, according to the college president, Kris Westover. “Before it was like sending students to dead-end careers, but now we’re ready and chomping at the bit to ramp up our courses to supply the alternative energy industry,” said Westover. ••• The coal region is in many ways ideally suited to become America’s renewable manufacturing hub, with existing plants and rail access that can be directed towards the transition. It will take time for the US to wrestle solar panel and lithium battery production from China, but the IRA includes a range of measures to incentivise innovation and manufacturing. In Bluefield, Virginia, family-run manufacturers have been getting help with market research and technical assistance to transition from serving the coal industry to making parts for electric vehicle charging stations and battery storage containers. “Coal got us to where we are … but it’s always been a boom-and-bust rollercoaster and it’s not going to take us to the next level,” said Melanie Protti-Lawrence, 42, president of Lawrence Brothers – a company started by her grandfather in 1974 to make steel containers to house batteries operated underground. A “friends of coal” sign hangs on the plant’s external wall, and several of the employees are former miners. But the coal industry accounted for less than 5% of their business in 2021, compared with 60% in 2018 and 98% in 2008. The company is just starting to dip its toe into the alternative energy sector, making prototype containers for next generation (Nexus) lithium-ion hybrid batteries, which currently accounts for less than 7% of their business. Coal mining continues for now, but with financial help on the horizon through the IRA, Protti-Lawrence is dedicating half her time to developing renewable energy opportunities in hopes that it will represent 25% of revenue in three to five years. “Central Appalachia has the manufacturing capacity, knowledge, experience and work ethic to serve the energy needs of the country and the world, it doesn’t have to be coal. We’re going to embrace this wholeheartedly. I’ve so many ideas, it’s very exciting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/sep/05/liz-truss-shows-little-sign-she-is-ready-to-meet-big-environmental-challenges","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-05T14:46:15Z","webTitle":"Liz Truss shows little sign she is ready to meet big environmental challenges","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/05/liz-truss-shows-little-sign-she-is-ready-to-meet-big-environmental-challenges","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/sep/05/liz-truss-shows-little-sign-she-is-ready-to-meet-big-environmental-challenges","fields":{"headline":"Liz Truss shows little sign she is ready to meet big environmental challenges","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Liz Truss faces a daunting array of environmental crises, from energy supply to sewage spills on British beaches, with little to show that she has the inclination to take them on. Ben Goldsmith, the chair of the Conservative Environment Network, and a longtime green Tory who was a strong supporter of Boris Johnson, said of the UK’s new prime minister and her defeated rival: “Neither Truss nor Sunak has been known for their passion for nature. Neither has made a name for themselves as an environmental leader.” There is a danger of blackouts this winter, amid soaring energy prices and a potential supply crunch, but Truss has set her face firmly against any form of energy rationing and has so far refused to countenance the idea that consumers must change their behaviour to reduce energy waste. She has not yet set out plans for insulating homes, which experts have said must form the key part of any strategy to reduce energy bills, and is against new onshore wind and solar farms. Instead, Truss has talked of squeezing more production from the North Sea and licensing new oil and gas fields, though these would take years or decades to come on stream. Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, told the Guardian: “[Truss] is facing an in-tray overflowing with immediate and existential threats: the energy crisis, the accelerating climate emergency, an emerging biodiversity crisis, and a war in Europe. “None of these can be solved by pandering to those in her party who are advocating environmental deregulation and new gas, oil and coal extraction. These will do little to tackle the energy crisis and will simply keep our economy locked into costly and polluting fossil fuels for decades to come.” He called for measures that would reduce energy waste and cut people’s energy bills in the short term, such as home insulation. “She must recognise that the health of the economy and people’s wellbeing are intrinsically linked to the health of the environment,” he said. “Among her first decisions must be a commitment to fund a nationwide street-by-street home insulation programme and to remove barriers holding back cheap onshore wind and solar energy. She must also rule out fracking, new coalmines and more North Sea oil and gas extraction.” Truss is likely to appoint Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is from the right of the Conservative party, has voiced climate scepticism in the past, favours fracking and is usually against government intervention in the markets, as the business secretary. Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “That could be very difficult. It matters who is in the cabinet. Without strong proponents, the net zero agenda will be in danger.” During the campaign, Truss’s team heavily leaked plans to deregulate business, which are likely to include environmental regulations. Most of the UK’s existing green regulations come from EU law, and many of them were pushed through in Brussels with UK support while an EU member. Tom Burke, the co-founder of the thinktank E3G, warned that this dismantling was likely to be carried out by stealth. “They know that voters want high environmental standards, so they have to do it by stealth, and that’s what Truss is driving towards.” Food price rises will add to consumer woes, and Truss will face pressure to row back on changes to farm subsidies that would offer incentives to farmers to nurture soils and deliver environmental benefits alongside their food production. Goldsmith said it would be a mistake to reduce the incentives for farmers to protect wildlife and the countryside: “You can do both; you can produce food and take care of the landscape.” Many green campaigners remember Truss as secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs from 2014 to 2016. Privately, they say she made little impact, other than to agree to cuts to the department’s budget that further reduced enforcement of environmental regulation, including of sewage polluting the UK’s waterways. Pat Venditti, the interim executive director of Greenpeace UK, urged Truss to stick to the commitments that had been made in the last general election: “This Conservative government was elected on a manifesto that committed it to reaching net zero, ‘leading a new green industrial revolution’ and rolling out the ‘most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth’,” he said. “There’s no mandate and no public support to roll back on these commitments. Bolder climate action and stronger nature protection is the only way forward for a cleaner, fairer and more affordable society for everyone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T16:03:27Z","webTitle":"More rail strikes announced for September after talks with RMT and operators fail – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/sep/01/liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-tory-leadership-keir-starmer-bills-conservatives-labour-uk-politics-live-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"More rail strikes announced for September after talks with RMT and operators fail – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Here is a round-up of all of today’s top news stories from Westminster: Tens of thousands of railway workers will stage fresh strikes in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions, PA Media has reported. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said its members at Network Rail and 14 train operators will strike on 15 and 17 September. The union said more than 40,000 members would take action, which would “effectively shut down” the rail network. Keir Starmer has denied that Labour’s energy policy amounts to “kicking the can down the road”, but acknowledged that something will have to be done early next year to tackle the crisis in the longer term. During a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live, the Labour leader was quizzed on his plans to tackle soaring energy bills beyond the middle of next year, PA Media reported. One listener told him: “The public is more leftwing than the Labour party at the moment.” Starmer replied: “I don’t accept that is kicking the can down the road.” Boris Johnson has vowed to give his full support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy just days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long-overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. Johnson also said that “only time will tell” what kind of ex-prime minister he will be, and he reiterated that he will give his “full and unqualified support” to his successor. He will leave 10 Downing Street next week when he is likely to be replaced as prime minister by the current foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who leads the former chancellor Rishi Sunak in polling. The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, has said energy supplies should not be cut off if people cannot afford their bills, as the Treasury examines a range of options to help consumers cope with the cost of living crisis. Zahawi promised that the government would expand on the £37bn package of aid announced earlier this year to help households tackle soaring energy costs. He told Sky News: “No one should be cut off because they can’t afford their bills.” Michael Gove has urged Liz Truss to reconsider energy rationing for businesses this winter, after she rejected the idea at Wednesday’s final Tory leadership hustings. Gove said the UK should follow other European countries in urging companies to show restraint in their use of electricity and gas. Michael Gove dismissed speculation he intends to quit politics, saying he is “definitely planning to stay in parliament”. Sacked by Boris Johnson as the levelling up and housing secretary after privately advising the prime minister to stand down, Gove laughed off suggestions he could become a newspaper editor. The energy crisis is hitting UK household budgets harder than any country in western Europe, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. The difference between the cost burden on poor and rich households is also far more unequal in the UK than other countries. The reason is the UK’s heavy reliance on gas to heat homes and produce electricity at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring. In addition, the UK has the least energy efficient homes in western Europe. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, vowed to continue to put pressure on Beijing to end its policies against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, following a blistering report by the outgoing UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, who accused China of “serious human rights violations” that may amount to crimes against humanity. Keir Starmer told listeners to his BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in this morning that he knows what it is like to not be able to pay bills, amid rising concerns over the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader spoke about his own childhood as he was pressed on how his party would help struggling families. Dozens of charities have demanded the government provide urgent financial support to households dealing with the cost of living crisis and have warned of a “tsunami of need” in the UK. The open letter, signed by 48 charity leaders, warns that an “economic crisis of a magnitude not experienced for decades” will push many formerly comfortable households into poverty and desperation. Ambulance handover times is the “No 1 priority” for the NHS in England this winter, the health secretary, Steve Barclay, said in a speech this afternoon. Speaking at the rightwing Policy Exchange thinktank, Barclay said just a small number of hospital trusts accounted for almost half of ambulance delays. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. Thanks for following along. I’ll be back tomorrow morning to continue bringing you all the latest UK politics news. Tens of thousands of railway workers will stage fresh strikes in a long-running dispute over pay, jobs and conditions, PA Media has reported. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said its members at Network Rail and 14 train operators will strike on 15 and 17 September. The union said more than 40,000 of its members would take action, warning it woud “effectively shut down” the rail network. Talks between the union and rail industry have been ongoing but there has been no breakthrough or new offers from either Network Rail or the operators, the union said. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: Our members have no choice but to continue this strike action. Network Rail and the train operating companies have shown little interest this past few weeks in offering our members anything new in order for us to be able to come to a negotiated settlement. Grant Shapps continues his dereliction of duty by staying in his bunker and shackling the rail industry from making a deal with us. We will continue to negotiate in good faith, but the employers and government need to understand our industrial campaign will continue for as long as it takes. The news follows announcements by Aslef and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association of strikes by their members in the coming weeks. Foreign secretary Liz Truss vowed to continue to put pressure on Beijing to end its policies in Xinjiang, following a blistering report by the outgoing UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, who accused China of “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims that may amount to crimes against humanity. Truss said in a statement that the UN’s long-awaited report provided new evidence of “the appalling extent of China’s efforts to silence and repress Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang”. She also said London would continue to act with international partners to “bring about a change in China’s actions, and immediately end its appalling human rights violations in Xinjiang”. The UN’s 45-page report concluded: “The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” The damming report was welcomed by rights activists and families of the victims in China’s Xinjiang region. But they also called on governments around the world to establish formal and independent investigations into the matter. Steve Barclay also said NHS trusts needed to prioritise the three cancers that account for two-thirds of the diagnosis backlog – skin, prostate and gastrointestinal. He said integrated health trusts should prioritise “new cancer pathways”, such as pharmacy and community referrals. He said: Alongside ambulance delays, the second dominant health issue is clearing the Covid waiting list backlog. Over the summer, the two-year waiting lists were virtually eliminated with a final 2,000 cases set to be resolved by the end of September. The health secretary added that patients “need to be able to exercise choice at the very start of their care”. He said the NHS needed to make better use of its app for patients to make appointments. The health secretary wants to “stimulate a conversation” about backroom staffing in the NHS, he said in a Policy Exchange speech about preparing for the winter. Steve Barclay claimed there were 53,000 staff in organisations across the NHS in England, “where the majority are not providing direct patient care”, in addition to hospital and GP management. He added: My point is this is not just an issue of cost. It is also about effectiveness. Because too much management can be a distraction to the front line. Staff at the centre need to streamline the administrative burden of those on the front line and not risk adding to it. If we are to reprioritise back office costs to the front line, there needs to be more transparency. Barclay added he had ordered a digital assessment of staffing in the NHS, telling the audience: It will stimulate, I hope, a conversation within the NHS about how priorities and resourcing is best aligned. Ambulance handover times is the “number one priority” for the NHS in England this winter, the health secretary, Steve Barclay, has said in a speech this afternoon. Speaking at the rightwing Policy Exchange thinktank, Barclay said that just a small number of hospital trusts accounted for almost half of ambulance delays. He said: Targeted help over the summer has been focused on these trusts, including building capacity in emergency departments, introducing pre and post cohorting and observation areas, supporting emergency department triaging and the risk assessment across the hospital as a whole. However, he said that not all of the issues were in the control of the hospitals and instead sat with ambulance trusts, integrated care boards, care homes and NHS England itself. He added: We currently have over 12,000 beds occupied by patients who are medically fit to discharge. This is also resulting in poor patient outcomes, in particular with the frail and elderly because patients often deteriorate if left in a hospital bed for too long. Boris Johnson has promised a £700m investment package if Sizewell C nuclear plant is to be built. He said it would be “madness” not to go ahead with the project, claiming that, if the plant was operational now, it would slash national fuel bills by £3bn. The GMB union national secretary Andy Prendergast has welcome Boris Johnson’s promise of funding for Sizewell C as a “belated step in the right direction”. “With energy prices going through the roof and all bar one of our nuclear power stations due to go off line by the end of the decade, this does at least provide some assurance on our energy security,” he said in comments reported by PA Media. “Years of political failure to make the right decision on new nuclear means we are woefully unprepared for the energy crisis facing us today. This same inertia has resulted in a failure to secure our domestic gas supply. The real-world consequences of this lack of political courage are higher bills and risk of blackouts this winter.” Dozens of charities have demanded the government provide urgent financial support to households dealing with the cost of living crisis and have warned of a “tsunami of need” in the UK. The open letter, signed by 48 charity leaders, warns that an “economic crisis of a magnitude not experienced for decades” will push many formerly comfortable households into poverty and desperation. Describing the challenges facing support organisations, the letter says food banks are “working flat out”, community centres are planning to provide winter “warm hubs”, and disability charities are providing cash to those who can no longer wait. But it warns many support organisations will close as charities cannot afford to keep building open. The letter was organised by the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations and signatories include the National Children’s Bureau, National Voices and Disability Rights UK. It further warns of crises in mental health provision and increased suicide rates while predicting more children will enter care and that animal charities will struggle to cope with abandoned pets. “We are calling on the government to urgently deliver meaningful financial support to those in the greatest need, directly to households and through the benefits systems that already exist to provide support.” Liz Truss, the favourite to become the UK’s next prime minister, has said a damning UN report that Beijing had committed “serious human rights violations” against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province “shames China”. The report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said: “The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups, pursuant to law and policy, in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.” Truss, in her role as foreign secretary, said the report “provides new evidence of the appalling extent of China’s efforts to silence and repress Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang”. “It includes harrowing evidence, including first-hand accounts from victims, that shames China in the eyes of the international community, including actions that may amount to crimes against humanity. “This includes credible evidence of arbitrary and discriminatory detention, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, violations of reproductive rights, and the destruction of religious sites.” She said UN members now needed the chance to consider the report fully. The Chinese government, which attempted until the last moment to stop the publication of the report, said in an official response that it was “based on the disinformation and lies fabricated by anti-China forces” and that it “wantonly smears and slanders” China and interferes in the country’s internal affairs. Victims and human rights groups have said governments around the world should establish formal independent investigations into human rights abuses in Xinjiang. This is Tom Bryant picking up the UK politics live blog for an hour from Tom Ambrose Boris Johnson has vowed to give his total support to the next prime minister, but could not resist using his penultimate speech to take a potshot at Liz Truss’s energy plans. In an attempt to shore up his legacy just days before he leaves No 10, the outgoing Conservative leader hailed the government’s “accelerated, long-overdue reforms” to make the UK more energy independent and announced £700m for the Sizewell C nuclear plant. But he disparaged fracking, which Truss has pledged to lift the ban on, and hydrocarbons, another energy source his likely successor wants to exploit through further drilling in the North Sea. “If we could frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be possibly a very beneficial thing. I’m just, I have to say, slightly dubious that it will prove to be a panacea,” Johnson said on Thursday. “I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant, and where the environmental damage is really minimal.” Johnson later added: “Tell everybody who thinks hydrocarbons are the only answer and we should get fracking and all that: offshore wind is now the cheapest form of electricity in this country … Of course it’s entirely clean and green.” The chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, has said households should not be cut off if they cannot afford their energy bills, as the Treasury examines a range of options to help consumers cope with the cost of living crisis. Zahawi promised that the government would expand on the £37bn package of aid announced earlier this year to help households tackle soaring energy costs. He told Sky News: “No one should be cut off because they can’t afford their bills. “I am working with the [energy] companies ... to make sure those people who are really struggling get that help both financially and personally.” Consumers are not automatically cut off if they do not pay energy bills, but UK charities have warned a group urging consumers not to pay this winter that there could be serious consequences. Zahawi said he was “deeply concerned” about vulnerable people living in freezing conditions this winter because they cannot afford to turn their heating on. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said the £700m announced for Sizewell C “could insulate huge numbers of draughty homes, and cut next year’s bills, instead of being thrown on to the slow-burning financial bonfire that is EDF, to increase our bills for decades”. He added: The contrast between these lumbering white elephants and the dynamic, cost-cutting, innovative technologies in the renewables sector could barely be more striking. While this down-payment on failure shows the government hasn’t noticed, the market has, and investors have fled the nuclear sector. To get Sizewell done, the government would have to step in and add the enormous costs of building reactors to the enormous costs consumers are already paying for their electricity. The “Boris bill” would be the prime minister’s legacy, he added. Michael Gove has urged Liz Truss to reconsider energy rationing for businesses this winter, after she rejected the idea at Wednesday’s final Tory leadership hustings. Gove said the UK should follow other European countries in urging companies to show restraint in their use of electricity and gas. While he admitted it was “not something that would come naturally to me or any Conservative”, he said Truss, who is expected to win the leadership contest and become prime minister next week, should prioritise ensuring there is enough energy for households during the worsening cost of living crisis. Truss has been under pressure for a week to reveal what extra support will be offered to people who will struggle to pay their bills after it was announced that the energy price cap will jump by 80% in October. Further rises are expected in January and April. It comes as health experts warned that cold homes will damage children’s lungs and brain development and lead to deaths as part of a “significant humanitarian crisis” this winter. Unless the next prime minister curbs soaring fuel bills, children face a wave of respiratory illness with long-term consequences, according to a review by Sir Michael Marmot, the director of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity, and Prof Ian Sinha, a respiratory consultant at Liverpool’s Alder Hey children’s hospital. Sinha said he had “no doubt” that cold homes would cost children’s lives this winter, although they could not predict how many, with damage done to young lungs leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema and bronchitis for others in adulthood. Johnson finishes his speech by saying he disagrees with those who oppose the government’s nuclear plans, adding that there “will always be dissenters”. And, with that, he leaves the podium and the speech – one of his last as prime minister – comes to a close. Boris Johnson has said he is not “morally” opposed to fracking, but claimed to be “dubious” it will prove to be a “panacea”. Taking questions from the media after his speech at Sizewell, the prime minister was asked about his position on fracking. He said: On fracking, you know, I am not intellectually, morally opposed to this at all. I think that if we could, you know, frack effectively and cheaply in this country, that would be a positive and beneficial thing. I have to say, I am just slightly dubious it will prove to be a panacea. I would much rather that we focused on the things where we are brilliant and where the environmental damage is really minimal, like offshore wind. Did you pick up just now, can I ask you if you can remember how much cheaper is offshore wind than gas? Nine times cheaper. So, you know, I cannot rest my case. We are brilliant at offshore wind, we need to put in sustainable baseload in the form of nuclear. Of course, we need a diversified policy where local communities want different solutions, they should be allowed to go for different solutions. But I don’t think that particular solution is going to be the panacea that some people suggest. Johnson also said that “only time will tell” what kind of ex-prime minister he will be, and he reiterated that he will give his “full and unqualified support” to his successor. He will leave 10 Downing Street next week when he is likely to be replaced a prime minister by the current foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who leads the former chancellor Rishi Sunak in polling. He said: I think only time will tell is my answer on that one. But my intention and what I certainly will do is give my full and unqualified support to whoever takes over from me. Otherwise, really to get on with life. The outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson says families in the UK are going to face a “very tough winter” and that “we just have to accept that” during a speech at Sizewell this afternoon. He says: Families up and down this country are going to face a very tough winter and we just have to accept that. What I would say to people is that the government really, really understands the difficulties you are facing. We totally get it. He adds that he wants to get over to people the “better future” that he believes is on the horizon once we are through it. He says: Out of this catastrophe of Putin’s war, I think good is going to come. Johnson is asked whether, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have ordered a second national lockdown in the UK during the Covid pandemic. He says that it is important that people remember what the measures to restrict the transmission of coronavirus were trying to do. He adds: We had at the peak of the pandemic, 40,000 people or more in NHS beds and we knew if you had another 20,000, 30,000 more – and it could have easily happened mathematically – in the NHS, then the system would have been overwhelmed. What would have happened then is that all those cases … of people who didn’t get help with their cardiac, concerns with their cancer diagnoses, all those other conditions would have been pushed out even further. The NHS would have been in an even worse position now. Johnson, who is now taking questions from the media, is asked about coming support for households and whether he had spoken to either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak about plans to protect households. Johnson reiterated the support the government had already provided but said it was “clear that come the new administration, there is going to be a further package”. He says: We have the fiscal firepower to sort it out. We do have a robust employment situation, we have the revenues coming to the exchequer to enable us to help people. That gives us the strength to continue to support people. The outgoing prime minister suggested that nuclear energy was one of “medium and long-term” options. Johnson said he expects “substantial sums” of cost of living help to be provided by his successor. Speaking at Sizewell in Suffolk, the prime minister said: We’re helping people now with the cost of living and of course there will be more cash to come, whoever takes over from me, in the months ahead - substantial sums, that’s absolutely clear. He added that offshore wind was now nine times cheaper than gas because of the “insanity of what Putin has done”. Johnson says the Russian leader believes the west will “flinch”. Johnson says he is wrong about the resolve of both the British people and European governments. He will fail, says Johnson. Boris Johnson has claimed that if Hinkley Point C had already been built, it would have slashed fuel bills by £3bn. He already said it would be “madness” not go ahead with the Sizewell C nuclear plant. He went on: That’s why we need to pull our national finger out and get on with Sizewell C. That’s why we’re putting £700m into the deal, just part of the £1.7bn of government funding available for developing a large-scale nuclear project to final investment stage FID (final investment decision) in this parliament. And in the course of the next few weeks, I am absolutely confident that it will get over the line, and we will get it over the line because it would be absolute madness not to. The outgoing prime minister says the main opposition to new nuclear reactors being built is “nimbyism”. He says he has diagnosed the problem as “myopia” and “short-termism”. Johnson adds: It is a chronic case of politicians not being able to see beyond the political cycle. For 13 years, the previous Labour government did absolutely nothing to develop this country’s nuclear industry. They said it didn’t make economic sense, they even said that in their manifesto. Well, thanks a bunch Tony and thanks a bunch, Gordon. Tell that to British industries that are now desperately short of affordable and reliable electricity. Tell that to families struggling with the cost of heat and light this winter. He also goes on to blame Nick Clegg for saying the UK shouldn’t build more nuclear power stations like Sizewell C in the run-up to the 2010 general election because “it wouldn’t even be completed until 2021 or 2022”. As per usual, there is little acknowledgement of the fact the Tories have been in power for 12 years and that he has been prime minister for the past three years… Speaking from Sizewell in east Suffolk, Boris Johnson begins by talking about a “much-thumbed” Ladybird book he owned as a child, which was called The Story of Nuclear Power. He says he was “enthralled” to read how UK scientists split the atom for the first time at the Cavendish laboratories in Cambridge. He said he noted how the world’s first civilian nuclear power station was built in Cumbria. He continues: I look back at the optimism in the pages of that book and I look at what has happened since and at the short-termism of successive British governments and their failure to do justice to our pioneering nuclear history … and I feel like one of those beautifully drawn illustrations of that Ladybird book of what happens in a nuclear pile. The graphite rods are taken out at the wrong moments and my blood starts to boil and steam starts coming out of my ears and I think I’m going to meltdown. I ask myself the question: ‘What happened to us?’. He asks if we have lost the “gumption and dynamism of our parents and grandparents”. The outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson is due to make a speech on energy at midday. It is understood that he is set to predict the UK will enjoy a future involving “cheap, clean, reliable and plentiful” energy, amid reports he will confirm the sign-off for a new nuclear power station. The speech will take place during a visit to Suffolk – one of his last as prime minister – and we will bring you all the top news lines from it here shortly. The energy crisis is hitting UK household budgets harder than any country in western Europe, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund. The difference between the cost burden on poor and rich households is also far more unequal in the UK compared with other countries. The reason is the UK’s heavy reliance on gas to heat homes and produce electricity at a time when Russia’s war in Ukraine has sent gas prices soaring. In addition, the UK has the least energy efficient homes in western Europe. There is widespread agreement from energy experts on the best solutions: a large-scale and rapid insulation programme and a faster roll-out of wind and solar energy, which produce electricity that is currently about nine times cheaper than that from gas, as well as short-term financial support for bill payers. The government has consistently failed over the past decade to deliver major insulation programmes and has effectively banned onshore wind. The IMF analysis assessed the impact of the energy crisis expected over the whole of 2022, based on forward fossil fuel prices in May, since when prices have risen. It found that the average UK household is expected to lose 8.3% of its total spending power in 2022, as a result of having to pay higher energy bills. The figure in Germany and Spain is 4%, while only Estonian and Czech households face higher impacts than the UK in the whole of Europe. Keir Starmer told listeners to his BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in this morning that he knows what it is like not being able to pay bills, amid rising concerns over the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader spoke about his own childhood as he was pressed on how his party would help struggling families. He said: I actually do know what it is like to sit around the kitchen table not being able to pay your bills. It comes as UK households will see spending power cut by an average £3,000 by the end of next year unless the new government acts to counter the biggest drop in living standards in at least a century, research has indicated. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said soaring energy bills would cut household incomes by 10% and push an extra 3 million people into poverty. Starmer said he remembered the phone being cut off for “months at a time”, adding that he was not claiming “great poverty” but he said there were times his family could not pay for utilities. He added: Millions of people will be having that anxious conversation as we speak now. Michael Gove has dismissed speculation he intends to quit politics, saying he is “definitely planning to stay in parliament”. Gove, sacked by Boris Johnson as levelling up and housing secretary after privately advising the prime minister to stand down, laughed off suggestions he could become a newspaper editor. Of his relationship with the prime minister, he dismissed suggestions he had been sacked in revenge for turning on Johnson in 2016. He said Johnson wanted to “stand and fight and in order to do so he needed to show he was reconstructing his government”. He said: “I have both a reservoir of affection for Boris and great respect for what he did in office as well.” Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gove, who is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak to be the next prime minister, said the frontrunner, Liz Truss, had “moved more on to the territory” staked out by Sunak over tackling the cost of living crisis during the course of the Conservative leadership campaign. He said Truss had acknowledged she needed to flesh out some of her earlier points. The Labour leader was also quizzed on how his party would deal with the Northern Ireland protocol during a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live. Keir Starmer told a Belfast listener there could not be a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, adding: “We have got the protocol in place and we should build on that, not rip it up.” Asked by presenter Nicky Campbell why the UK couldn’t just “tweak it”, he said: The government has said it is going to rip it up - that is what is destroying our reputation internationally. Starmer said that a veterinary agreement between the UK and the EU would make a “massive difference”. “The EU has got to give and take as well”, he stressed. Keir Starmer has denied that Labour’s energy policy amounts to “kicking the can down the road”, but acknowledged that something will have to be done early next year to tackle the crisis in the longer term. During a Q&amp;A on BBC Radio 5 Live, the Labour leader was quizzed on his plans to tackle soaring energy bills going beyond the middle of next year, the Press Association reported. One listener told him: “The public is more leftwing than the Labour party at the moment.” Starmer replied: “I don’t accept that is kicking the can down the road.” He said his party’s plan is “meeting the concerns of millions of people”. He added that he understood the scale of the challenge facing households, adding that “many people listening and watching this will be saying: ‘I can’t afford that”’. Pressed on his longer-term plans, he pointed to his party’s call for a national mission on home insulation. “On the question of what we do long term, I am completely up for that challenge,” he told the programme. “I accept the challenge that something has got to be done in April.” Meanwhile, the former Tory cabinet minister Michael Gove has said he will carry on as an MP. He has previously said he does not expect to be in government again. It comes as the Liberal Democrats move to confirm a candidate for Gove’s Surrey seat amid speculation he is considering quitting parliament, which would spark a byelection. Lib Dem officials are planning for a possibly imminent campaign in which the party would fight on issues including the state of local hospitals and plans to drill for gas locally. Gove told Times Radio: I’m going to stay on as an MP. I’m going to make arguments for the vital importance of carrying on with the levelling up mission that Boris [Johnson] started. I’m going to be arguing very strongly for a focus on education, on the environment, on prison reform, that is compassionate, and progressive, and in the best traditions of the Conservative party. And I’ll be doing that as the majority of Conservative MPs do, from the backbenches. I’ll also be looking out for my constituents in Surrey Heath and making sure that I’m representing them effectively. The chancellor’s assertion that “nothing is off the table” came as the Conservative leadership frontrunner, Liz Truss, ruled out energy rationing this winter as she clashed over the cost of living crisis with her rival, Rishi Sunak, at the final hustings in London last night. The foreign secretary rejected the proposal, despite it being a key fall-back measure in the government’s “worst case” contingency planning. However, Sunak said “we shouldn’t rule anything out” after the French government warned it may have to ration energy, urging company bosses to take steps to curb consumption. As he made his final pitch to party members, the former chancellor added: The challenges we face with this crisis are significant. Many European countries are looking at how we can all optimise our energy usage, that is a sensible thing for us to be doing as a country. Asked by the LBC broadcaster Nick Ferrari at the last hustings before voting closes on Friday whether she could rule out energy rationing, Truss replied: I do rule that out. Yes. Under the government’s latest “reasonable worst case scenario”, published in August, businesses and even consumers could face blackouts this winter as concerns grow over power supplies. Officials believe that without energy rationing, the UK could experience blackouts for several days in January if cold weather combines with gas shortages to leave the country short of power. Good morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog. As the race to become the next Conservative leader and next prime minister enters the final furlong, we will be bringing you all the news and reaction from last night’s hustings. But we start with comments from the chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi, who probably hasn’t even bothered unpacking at No 11 Downing Street and is likely to be out of a job by Monday. He said this morning that said “of course” the current level of support offered by government to deal with rising energy prices will not be enough, but that his team is looking at options for the next administration. Speaking to Sky News, Zahawi said: My pledge to your viewers is more help beyond the £37bn will also be coming. At the moment we’re midway of spending about £37bn. Asked whether it went far enough, he replied: Of course it’s not, which is why the moment I walked in to the Treasury on 5 July I gathered my leadership team, I said: ‘One, how are we doing on delivering the help?’ Because it’s one thing to announce it, very different to get it into people’s accounts. And there was a big focus on that. But equally importantly I said we need to prepare options for the incoming prime minister. The chancellor also said that “there’s nothing off the table” in terms of options the government is assessing for how to deal with rising energy prices. He said: There’s nothing off the table. We are looking at all the options. Everything from the chief executive of Scottish Power talking about help where we need to maybe create some sort of a fund for companies to be able to continue to help their customers. All the way through to making sure we target the help to both households and small and medium-size businesses and probably some larger businesses, because one of my concerns is the scarring effect on the economy if perfectly viable businesses in hospitality, in leisure, in high-energy use businesses would actually suffer or no longer exist because of Putin’s use of energy as a weapon."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/sep/01/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T10:27:06Z","webTitle":"Energy crisis: UK households worst hit in western Europe, finds IMF","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/sep/01/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/sep/01/energy-crisis-uk-households-worst-hit-in-western-europe-finds-imf","fields":{"headline":"Energy crisis: UK households worst hit in western Europe, finds IMF","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"The energy crisis is hitting UK household budgets harder than any country in western Europe, according to analysis by the International Monetary Fund.

The figure in Germany and Spain is 4%, while only Estonian and Czech households face higher impacts than the UK in the whole of Europe. Energy bill rises also push up the costs of other goods, as sellers pass on the price rises. These indirect effects will knock another 2% off the money UK households have to spend in 2022. The IMF analysis takes account of people reducing their energy use as prices rise. “The distributional impact is especially skewed [in the UK],” said Oya Celasun from the IMF. The poorest 10% of UK households are expected to spend 17.8% of their budget on energy in 2022, while the richest 10% will spend 6.1%, the analysis found. The difference of 11.7 percentage points is by far the greatest disparity among the 25 European countries assessed. In France, the difference is 3.9 percentage points and in the Netherlands, 2.5. Analysis by Deutsche Bank also shows UK bill-payers are being hit hard by the energy crisis. It found that consumer price inflation for gas and electricity in the UK in 2022 is forecast to be about 80%, compared with an average of 40% across the 19 countries that use the euro. “The UK has higher energy prices, comparative to other economies in Europe” said Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. “The fact of the matter is the UK is more highly dependent on gas.” The vast majority of homes in the UK – 85% – use gas to provide heat, a legacy of exploitation of North Sea gas fields, which are now in decline. In France and Germany, fewer than 50% of homes are heated with gas. The UK also relied on gas to produce more terawatt hours of electricity in 2021 than any of the 39 European countries analysed by the thinktank Ember, except Italy. Electricity from gas is the most expensive for power and sets the price for all electricity, due to the current UK market structure. In terms of the share of electricity generated by gas, the UK is at 40%, Germany at 15% and Denmark at 6%. “The UK energy crisis is a fossil gas crisis,” said Sarah Brown at Ember. “The UK’s reliance on fossil gas is punishing ordinary people.” “Another of the key differences is that houses in the UK are incredibly inefficient,” said Lisa Fischer at the thinktank E3G. The UK’s leaky homes are the least efficient in western Europe, according to one analysis: UK homes lose 3C in temperature in the same time that German homes lose just 1C. The people living in the two-thirds of UK homes that are energy inefficient, rated D or worse, will pay at least £1,000 more this winter. The solution to the UK’s energy crisis is much better insulation, replacing gas boilers with heat pumps and speeding up the deployment of renewable energy, said Raja. Short-term measures include reducing the flow temperature on condensing gas boilers and replacing home appliances with more energy-efficient models, said Fischer. Further financial support for UK households will also be necessary, but Celasun, at the IMF, said this should be targeted at vulnerable households: “For instance, it would be full compensation for the poor and support could be reduced gradually as incomes rise.” She said completely compensating price increases for everyone would remove a strong incentive to consume less energy, which cuts both costs and climate heating carbon emissions. Jess Ralston, at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “The government currently has no serious plan for cutting our gas dependency, so the new prime minister would need to rapidly ramp up existing energy efficiency programmes. With the gas price so high, the return on this investment would be extraordinarily quick.” Increasing the supply of gas from the North Sea would not result in sufficient amounts to reduce energy prices, which are set internationally, said Raja: “When it comes to the UK and energy, we are price-takers.” Fischer also dismissed the idea that fracking in the UK could alleviate the energy crisis, describing it as “nonsense”. “It’s really important to start planning action now, because we know that next winter is likely to be at least as difficult, if not more difficult than this winter,” Fischer said. “Germany is starting to line up things, especially on financing for building efficiency and switching to heat pumps. In the UK, there’s an absolute lack of trying to do those things that help you permanently insulate people from higher energy prices.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-09-01T09:31:06Z","webTitle":"Wife of Malaysia’s jailed ex-PM handed 10 years in prison for bribery","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/sep/01/wife-of-malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-handed-10-years-in-prison-for-bribery","fields":{"headline":"Wife of Malaysia’s jailed ex-PM handed 10 years in prison for bribery","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The wife of the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for soliciting and receiving bribes in exchange for government contracts, one week after her husband was sent to prison for corruption linked to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal. Rosmah Mansor, 70, had pleaded not guilty to three charges of soliciting bribes and receiving 6.5m ringgit (£1.3m) in exchange for helping a company secure a contract to provide solar power to schools. The high court judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan said prosecutors proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. The judge added that her defence was “bare denial and unsubstantiated”. Rosmah also faces a fine of 970m ringgit. She can seek bail while she appeals against the judgment. The verdict on Thursday comes just over a week since Najib began a 12-year sentence for breach of trust, abuse of power, and money laundering in a conviction linked to the 1MDB scandal, one of the world’s biggest financial frauds. Najib and Rosmah have faced various charges since he lost an election in 2018 amid public anger over huge corruption during his administration. In the aftermath of their election defeat, the couple sought to leave the country by private jet, according to a flight manifesto leaked at the time. They were banned from travelling by the country’s then leader, Mahathir Mohamad. Police raids on several properties linked to Najib revealed further details of their opulent lifestyles. Police seized hundreds of designer handbags, including 272 Hermès bags estimated to be worth nearly $13m, as well as 1,400 necklaces, 423 watches, 2,200 rings, 1,600 brooches and 14 tiaras. Rosmah’s corruption case is not related to the 1MDB scandal. Prosecutors had argued Rosmah exerted influence over government spending, despite having no official position, and helped a company secure a 1.25bn ringgit contract to provide solar energy panels to schools on Borneo. They accused Rosmah of seeking a bribe of 187.5m ringgit and receiving 6.5m ringgit from an official of the company that won the project in 2016 and 2017. Her former aide, who was jointly charged with Rosmah but later testified for the prosecution, portrayed her as an influential figure who was often lobbied by businesspeople seeking government contracts. The aide testified Rosmah was feared by civil servants and requests from her staff were often carried out quickly. Witnesses said a special department, called First Lady of Malaysia, was set up to handle Rosmah’s affairs. The court heard she spent 100,000 ringgit a month to hire online propagandists to deflect criticism of her lavish lifestyle, the Associated Press reported. Rosmah has said she was framed by her former aide as well as government and company officials involved in the project. Najib is being held at the country’s largest prison in Kajang, which holds up to 5,000 prisoners. The prisons department has denied claims that VIP inmates were granted more comfortable living arrangements, such as air conditioning and access to TV and internet. His daughter, Nooryana Najwa, was mocked on social media this week after she reportedly lamented that her father would be missing his usual Starbucks order. She said on Instagram that she could not face ordering from the chain because she knew her father, stuck in prison, would be missing his caramel macchiato. Some responded online by announcing they would make sure to buy the drink the next day. Najib faces four other corruption cases. Rosmah also faces 17 charges of money laundering and tax evasion for illegally receiving 7.1m ringgit between 2013 and 2017 in a separate case linked to 1MDB, though her trial has not yet begun. The 1MDB scandal has led to corruption investigations around the world, including the US, Singapore, and Switzerland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/24/media-freedom-fears-in-india-after-modi-ally-adani-buys-29-stake-in-ndtv","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-24T07:04:51Z","webTitle":"Media freedom fears in India after Modi ally Adani buys 29% stake in NDTV","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/media-freedom-fears-in-india-after-modi-ally-adani-buys-29-stake-in-ndtv","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/24/media-freedom-fears-in-india-after-modi-ally-adani-buys-29-stake-in-ndtv","fields":{"headline":"Media freedom fears in India after Modi ally Adani buys 29% stake in NDTV","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"India richest man, Gautam Adani, has launched a hostile takeover of the country’s popular NDTV television network in a deal that has sparked concerns about the future of one of the media outlets prepared to criticise Narendra Modi’s government. In a stunning coup that blindsided the network’s high-profile founders, a unit of Adani’s sprawling conglomerate said on Tuesday that it will be acquiring a 29.18% stake in NDTV in a complex deal involving one of the network’s investors. Under Indian takeover regulations, the move triggers an open offer for a stake of another 26%. If that is successful, Adani would be left with a controlling stake of 55%. NDTV – which was founded in 1988 by journalists Prannoy Roy and his wife, Radhika Roy – operates national channels in English and Hindi, along with a business channel and online news websites. But it revealed on Tuesday that it knew nothing about the takeover until Adani announced its move. “The NDTV founders and the company would like to make it clear that this … was executed without any input from, conversation with, or consent of the NDTV founders, who, like NDTV, have been made aware of this exercise of rights only today,” it said in a statement. One of the nation’s most popular news organisations, NDTV is regarded as one of the few media groups that takes a critical view of Modi’s BJP-led government policies. Guatam Adani is a strong ally of Modi, who has been known to fly on Adani corporate jets. Jairam Ramesh, communications spokesman for the opposition Congress party, said the takeover was “noting but concentration of economic and political power, and a brazen move tostifle any semblance of an independent media”. Dipti Lavya Swain, founder and managing partner at DLS Law Offices, said: “From NDTV’s statements, it seems this may not be a friendly takeover which generally is as per agreed terms and mechanism, and in fact, may end up being a hostile takeover.” The network is also the home of India’s most respected news broadcaster and anchorman, Ravish Kumar, who is also senior executive editor of NDTV. But one media commentator said that the takeover could see an exodus of personalities from NDTV. “[NDTV] was unabashedly pro-Congress and anti-BJP,” said author and media entrepreneur, Minhaz Merchant. “The Adani buyout will see an exodus of anchors and the channel will move editorially from left to centre.” The takeover will also pit Adani against his billionaire rival, Mukesh Ambani, boss of the huge Reliance Industries group, which is already an established power in the country’s media sector through a controlling interest in Network18. In March, Adani, who has seen his wealth balloon in recent years thanks to investments in solar energy, made his first bet in the media sector by taking a minority stake in local digital business news platform Quintillion. But the proposed NDTV transaction marks Adani’s highest-profile media bet to date. “NDTV is the most suitable broadcast and digital platform to deliver on our vision,” Adani Group executive Sanjay Pugalia said in the statement. While Adani did not disclose financial details of the group’s planned 29.18% stake purchase, it said its subsequent open offer would be for 294 rupees ($3.68) per NDTV share, which would be worth 4.93bn rupees. That open offer price is at a 20.5% discount to NDTV’s Tuesday’s close of 369.75 rupees."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2022/aug/20/solar-panels-how-to-fix-your-energy-bills-while-the-sun-shines","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-20T09:00:35Z","webTitle":"Solar panels: how to fix your energy bills while the sun shines","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/20/solar-panels-how-to-fix-your-energy-bills-while-the-sun-shines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2022/aug/20/solar-panels-how-to-fix-your-energy-bills-while-the-sun-shines","fields":{"headline":"Solar panels: how to fix your energy bills while the sun shines","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"British households are racing to install roof-top solar electricity panels amid huge energy price rises, with installers saying demand has “exploded”. Simon Dudson, the chief executive of the Little Green Energy Company, which serves London and south-east England, says: “It’s absolutely crazy times. It’s unprecedented. We have had a 400-500% increase in business.” The soaring price of electricity means a domestic solar panel system can now pay for itself in as little as seven years, and the way things are going, that could go down to five years. About a year ago, installers were saying the “payback” period was 15 years or more. Then there are the environmental benefits of solar panels. But don’t expect to have a system installed by your first-choice company this side of winter. The increase in demand, plus supply problems – about 90% of panels are made in China – mean some installers are warning customers of delays stretching out 10 months or more. Sussex Solar, like many installers across the UK, this week had a blunt message on its website. “We are very sorry but due to an unprecedented level of interest in solar panels and heat pumps, we are unable to accept any new inquiries for the time being. We will reopen our contact page towards the end of August …” Sussex Solar’s director, Amanda Baxter, adds: “It’s absolutely mad at the moment.” The Solar Shed, based near King’s Lynn in Norfolk, had a similar message: “Thanks for getting this far. We’re not taking any new inquiries at present. Sorry. The contact us page will open again when we clear the backlog.” Many reputable installers say they won’t start taking inquiries again until September – but could close again at any time. “The supply chain is the thing that is holding us all back,” Dudson says. “The main issue six months ago was the shortage of skilled labour. Now it’s the global shortage of stock. The panel manufacturers are telling us they shifted as much in the first quarter of this year as they did for the whole of last year.” So if you want to have any chance of getting panels on your roof, you will need to act soon. Keep a close eye on firms’ websites, and also be aware that the prices of panels and batteries are on the march upwards after many years of decline. How much will it cost? As little as £6,000 and up to £20,000 for a large house. It all depends on the size of the system (measured in kilowatts), the battery (optional, and can double the price), the diverter (to feed electricity to your immersion water heater), and whether you choose to install an electric vehicle charger at the same time. “Premium” panels and batteries (such as Tesla’s) cost more. Is it worth it? A 4kW system, suitable for the average home, should generate about 3,500kWh (kilowatt hours) of electricity a year across much of England. At the time of writing, the average 28p unit price of electricity a kWh means the 3,500 kWh produced is worth £980. So if you paid £7,000 for an installation, in theory it’s paying for itself in about seven years. In practice, the precise payback period will be different for every household and could be significantly more than the seven years if the home is unable to use much of the electricity produced. However, the 28p unit price is expected to leap to 45p or more this winter. That would mean the value of electricity produced by a 4kW system would rise to £1,575 or more – suggesting solar panels could in theory pay for themselves in as little as five years. But electricity unit prices could fall back, while the costs of the panels and installation are likely to rise, possibly steeply, so there are no guarantees. Will it supply all my electricity? And heat my water? The typical bungalow or detached home in the UK uses about 4,100 kWh a year, so panels producing 3,500 kWh a year will cover much of your usage. You will want to change your electricity usage habits to make the most use of your panels. That means running appliances such as the dishwasher during the day, not at night. A diverter can send any surplus energy generated by solar PV panels to an immersion heater. Installers say this is now a better option than having separate solar hot water panels. They cost about £500. Should I buy the battery? A battery will store the solar energy produced – but not used – during the day and let you use it at night. On a sunny day, many households will struggle to use half the electricity produced by the panels, so a battery sounds like a very good idea – except they are costly. Kevin Holland of the Solar Shed says: “You can almost double the cost of the installation by opting for a battery.” The batteries cost £5,000 upwards – if you can find one. Installers say they are the most difficult thing to source at the moment. Without a battery to store electricity, home consumption could be in the range of 25% to 30% of the electricity produced by the panels. Can I sell surplus electricity back to the National Grid? The “feed-in tariffs” that kickstarted the UK’s domestic solar industry have long gone. They were extremely lucrative, initially paying households 43.3p for every unit of electricity. But the rate was subsequently cut, then completely axed in 2019. There is a rather less lucrative replacement scheme called the Smart Export Guarantee. The big electricity companies set their own SEG rate – and most pay just a few pence. At the time of writing, the best-paying was Octopus Energy at 7.5p/kWh, with the next best at only 5p/kWh. Octopus also operates a tariff where what customers are paid varies every half-hour, according to day-ahead wholesale prices. Earlier this year customers in London were picking up £1.29 for every unit sent back to the grid. “We choose to give these best-in-market rates on our tariffs because we know that our future energy system will need to include lots of small generators and homes with their own energy sources, too,” an Octopus spokesperson says. Is my home right for solar panels? A south-facing roof, sloping at a 30-degree angle, is best. East- and west-facing panels will produce about 15% to 20% less electricity. The good news is that advances in solar technology mean you need less roof space than 10 years ago to produce the same amount of electricity. You will generally need at least 20 sq metres of usable roof space. Solar panels do not require planning permission but you will need listed building consent to put solar panels on a listed building. If you live in a conservation area, you will also need to contact your local council before going ahead. In a heatwave, do solar panels really pump out the electricity? Not really. What’s important is the intensity of light. Many experts say the panels actually work better at a temperature of 23C to 25C. Scorching weather is good for thermal water solar systems but not for maximising output from photovoltaic cells. “If you compare a 4kW system in Madrid with one in London, on a perfectly clear day you will get more electricity from the one in London,” Holland says. Can I get a grant? Not at the moment. In 2013, the government’s green deal offered loans to help households buy solar panels but it ended in 2015 and there is no funding available for solar panels now. One option is to apply to your bank for a home improvement loan. At HSBC, a £10,000 loan secured against your home would cost £183 a month over five years, with an APR of 3.9%. Will the panels last? The early adopters of solar panels report generally good news on this front, with the panels requiring little maintenance, and new ones expected to last up to 40 years. Their efficiency declines over time – but only slowly. Batteries decline faster and may have to be replaced after 10 years. Aren’t they all just double-glazing cowboys? “There are still a fair amount of cowboys in the industry,” Sussex Solar’s Baxter says. So how do you find a reputable installer? Word of mouth is your best bet. Ask around on your local street WhatsApp forums. Or try Which? Trusted Traders. Traditionally you would expect to obtain three different quotes before proceeding. But as Holland at The Solar Shed says: “I’m just too busy for [that].” The early adopter who now runs a solar business The former Guardian economics journalist Ashley Seager has been so inspired by the performance of his home solar panels – installed 15 years ago – that he now runs a solar business of his own. In 2007 Seager installed a 3kW peak system (about four metres by three metres) on the roof of his Victorian home in south London. It has produced about 2,700 kW hours (kWh) a year – enough for more than 80% of his annual electricity needs – and 15 years later it is still going strong. “The panels are supposed to degrade by about 0.5% a year but they have not. I’d estimate they have declined by no more than 0.25% a year,” he says. “The newer panels are now more efficient. A 3kW roof system now needs less roof space than we needed back in 2007. You can now get a 4kW system in the space needed for a 3kW system years ago.” Seager spent £8,500 on his panels, and they have more than repaid his investment. “Even before prices for electricity shot up we were getting a return of 10% to 15% per annum on the roof panels.” Seager benefited from the government’s “feed-in tariffs” paid to early adopters, which are no longer available. He now thinks the government was overly generous: “They set the tariff so high, there was a massive return on the investment.” However, the falling cost and higher efficiency of the panels since 2007, combined with today’s soaring electricity prices, mean that the financial equation for fitting solar panels still stacks up without any government subsidies. His company, Sun4net, focuses on installing panels on commercial rooftop spaces. But, like everyone else in the industry, he warns of the difficulty in obtaining supplies. “We are busier than ever but it continues a strong upward trend that we saw after Cop26 [the 2021 UN climate change conference]. The value of the projects has really gone through the roof, so to speak. But anyone in the domestic panels business who says they have much stock is not telling you the truth.” He estimates that about 95% of all panels come from China. Its government heavily subsidised its solar PV industry, which helped bring down prices but also drove manufacturers in Europe and North America to the wall. Now, as Europe wakes up to its overdependence on Russian gas, it is realising it has an even greater dependence on China to supply solar panels. ‘My aim is to be off-grid as much as possible in the summer’ Norfolk homeowner Stephen Beardmore says he has just spent £14,500 on a complete home solar system – including panels, battery, diverter and car charger. He made the move not only because of recent electricity price rises but because “for me, it was always the right thing to do”. Beardmore, who works for the Royal Air Force, says: “I’ve been thinking about it for the last two years. I have always been keen on technology and keen on renewables, long before Putin invaded Ukraine.” Like many solar buyers, the biggest initial hurdle was finding a reputable supplier. “As soon as you start doing research, you get bombarded with ads on Instagram and Facebook. It felt like I was walking into a dodgy car sales agency,” Beardmore says. Friends recommended the Solar Shed in nearby King’s Lynn. “My aim is to be off-grid as much as possible in the summer. I agreed a 16-panel, 405W-per-panel system, with an 11kW battery. And I put a car charger in at the same time, even though I don’t have an electric car yet. For me, it’s about a change in lifestyle and the way you use power.” As part of his research, he calculated his household’s overall electricity usage before the panels were installed, which added up to 4,300 kWh over 2021. “They have only been up for six weeks but I’m completely happy with them. We have a smart meter and I’m already down to 80p a day for electricity.” Most of the panels are on a directly south-facing roof, with the rest on a west-facing roof. Installation was done with limited disruption. “I only had to take one day off. After the scaffolder came in, the whole thing only took two days.” As for the aesthetics of the panels, he says: “I don’t even notice them up there.” The only hitch so far is that the battery is yet to arrive, although he expects it to come soon. Would he recommend it? “In the current situation, if people don’t get the message about renewables now, they never will.” This article was amended on 25 August 2022 to add further detail about the potential savings from solar panels, clarifying that the payback period will be different for every household, and that without a battery to store electricity, home consumption could only be 25 to 30% of the electricity produced. • This article was amended on 25 August 2022 to add further detail about the potential savings from solar panels, clarifying that the payback period will be different for every household, and that without a battery to store electricity, home consumption could only be 25% to 30% of the electricity produced."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"politics/live/2022/aug/19/labour-recall-parliament-energy-crisis-cost-of-living-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-uk-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-19T20:30:58Z","webTitle":"Tory leadership race: Truss takes on Sunak in Manchester – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2022/aug/19/labour-recall-parliament-energy-crisis-cost-of-living-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-uk-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/live/2022/aug/19/labour-recall-parliament-energy-crisis-cost-of-living-liz-truss-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson-uk-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"Tory leadership race: Truss takes on Sunak in Manchester – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Michael Gove has backed Rishi Sunak to be the next Conservative leader, accusing Liz Truss of taking a “holiday from reality”. He told The Times: “I do not expect to be in government again. But it was the privilege of my life to spend 11 years in the cabinet under three prime ministers. I know what the job requires. And Rishi has it.” Gove, who was sacked as the levelling up secretary by Boris Johnson, added: “And here I am deeply concerned that the framing of the leadership debate by many has been a holiday from reality. “The answer to the cost-of-living crisis cannot be simply to reject further ‘handouts’ and cut tax.” Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap. The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation topped 10% for the first time in 40 years. At the latest hustings in Manchester, Liz Truss sidestepped a question about a 2009 report which she co-authored emerging today which called for doctors pay to be cut by 10%. She said doctors and nurses “feel like they are being told what to do from Whitehall rather than understanding the situation in their local area and being able to respond to their patients’ needs”. The foreign secretary also called for more transparency about the police’s record on fighting crime and having league tables for forces. At the hustings, Rishi Sunak was asked how he will deal with trade unions and said: “We need to crack on and pass a piece of legislation,” he says, referring to the minimum service bill which means they will not be able to hold the country “to ransom”. On crime, Sunak said he wants a new unit in the National Crime Agency to deal with grooming gangs and says we need to record the ethnicity of perpetrators. A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised. Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall. Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss has been accused of showing “her true colours” in an 2009 paper promoting government spending cuts including slashing doctors’ pay. Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in a controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, TalkTV discovered. Railway changes will be imposed if workers do not agree to new deals, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said. The Conservative party has repeatedly targeted unions with criticism, in a move that the Trades Union Congress has argued is deliberately “picking a fight” for electoral purposes. The frontrunner to be the UK’s next prime minister has made her views on unions clear: she has approvingly tweeted a report that she intends to make striking more difficult. “New laws will make it harder to call strikes and also guarantee minimum levels of service are maintained on public transport”, according to a report by the Daily Express, a newspaper which is strongly pro-government and is supporting Truss in the Conservative leadership race. The under-fire rail operator Avanti West Coast has been “rewarded for failure”, Labour said, after the company was paid more than £17m in taxpayers’ money by ministers for performance and management fees in just two years, despite being the worst-performing operator on the rail network. The figures from 2019-20 and 2020-21 include almost £4m in bonuses to Avanti for “operational performance”, “customer experience” and “acting as a good and efficient operator”. The UK’s transport department has announced £130m of funding for England’s bus network to make up for shortfalls in revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cash would help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England’s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said. A green thinktank has criticised Rishi Sunak’s promise to protect farmland from solar farms, saying biofuels use 77 times the amount of arable land. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: “Solar energy isn’t standing in the way of food production in the UK. Instead, solar panels generate cheap, clean energy that doesn’t depend on Russia, and provide income to farmers too.” Rishi Sunak’s campaign has hit out at frontrunner Liz Truss after she declined to attend a hustings organised by the National Farmers’ Union. Farmers now expect Truss to take part in a hustings with the NFU in September, after she was initially accused of snubbing the organisation by deciding not to attend the event on Friday. Constituents of the Covid rule-breaking MP Margaret Ferrier are said to be “aghast” that she remains in post, as calls for her to resign gathered pace after she pleaded guilty on Thursday to “culpably and recklessly” exposing the public to the virus. The former Scottish National party politician, who now sits as an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, faced immediate calls to stand down. And that brings the hustings to an end. The remaining hustings are Birmingham on August 23, Norwich on August 25 and London on August 31. Truss was criticised by an audience member for “sounding like Labour” in wanting to “borrow £50 billion”. The foreign secretary did not address the criticism but said her fundamental view is that high taxes fail to bring money in to the Exchequer. Asked by an audience member whether she would build more houses to solve the housing crisis, Truss instead cites her plans to help people secure mortgages and criticised the planning system. Truss declares she does “support fracking in areas where there is local support”, adding that the local communities should stand to benefit. The foreign secretary also backs nuclear power and with drilling in the North Sea. Asked whether local objections from “Nimbys” should be overruled, Truss says local communities need to be shown the benefits and this involves “encouraging” rather than overruling. Sunak earlier spoke about wanting his football team Southampton to beat Manchester United this weekend, despite them in fact being scheduled to face Leicester City. He was asked at the Manchester hustings how as a Southampton FC fan how he would get back to winning ways. “I’m going to be unpopular for saying it here, starting by beating United this weekend,” he said. Southampton are not due to play Manchester United until August 27. Truss suggested that retired doctors could be asked to help clear the Covid backlog after many returned to work to help at the start of the pandemic. Truss said doctors and nurses “feel like they are being told what to do from Whitehall rather than understanding the situation in their local area and being able to respond to their patients’ needs”. Earlier today, a 2009 report Ms Truss co-authored came to light, which called for doctors pay to be cut by 10%. Truss also suggested senior police staff could be removed from their posts if their force performs poorly in her league table. It is now Truss’s turn for some questions. The foreign secretary calls for more transparency about the police’s record on fighting crime and having league tables for forces. “It does help the police be held to account,” she added. Sunak is asked about levelling up, weeks after video footage showed him telling Tory members of his work diverting public funds from ‘deprived urban areas’. He responds: “If we define levelling up as something that is only for the north we will pay a political price for it because it’s wrong. “I am proud of my record delivering for the north and I will continue delivering for the north.” On how he will help low and middle earning families, Sunak replies: “The best way to help those people is to make sure it’s only tough for one winter”. He added it will not help families to do things that might make us feel better for “five minutes” and if inflation persists “we are all stuffed”. On how he will deal with trade unions, Sunak says “We need to crack on and pass a piece of legislation,” he says, referring to the minimum service bill which means they will not be able to hold the country “to ransom”. He added that the government must not put “fuel on the fire” of inflation and repeat mistakes that were made in the 1970s. The Guardian’s Peter Walker gives his reaction to the questions posed by host Alastair Stewart. The former chancellor believes countries that the UK agrees trade deals with must agree to take back their “failed asylum-seekers”. Sunak is proposing a £10 fine for missed appointments and replicating the private health sector’s elective surgeries which he said allowed doctors to perform more operations. Sunak said there were 50 million missed appointments in the NHS in 2021 which “deprives people of the care they need” and he calls for the need to be “bold and radical” to reform the NHS and learn from private healthcare. Sunak adds he wants a new unit in the National Crime Agency to deal with grooming gangs. It is now the part where the candidates get the proverbial grilling. Sunak is asked about how he would keep Britain’s streets safe. He claims “we do not talk enough” about grooming gangs and says we need to record the ethnicity of perpetrators. Sunak added we should not let political correctness stand in the way and that we need to toughen up sentencing as people should be given a second or third chance “but not a nineteenth chance”. Truss says before she became an MP in 2010 she was a local councillor and sat on the planning committee. Repeating one of her favourite one-liners, she adds: “Those are hours of my life I will never get back.” Truss reiterates her plan to make the most of the post-Brexit opportunities and get all the EU laws off the statute books by the end of 2023. Truss pledges to build Northern Powerhouse Rail and wants to make the M62 the “super highway to success”. Liz Truss enters the arena after a fairly bland campaign video in comparison. Sunak insists he will not pursue policies that risk making inflation far worse, inadvertently criticising the economic plan of his rival Liz Truss for wanting to pass £50bn of debt to future generations, adding: “That is not right.” Sunak opens with that regularly repeated rhetoric in the hustings about Britain doing something “extraordinary” for his family by allowing them to make a life. He also vows to take on “lefty, woke culture” that seeks to cancel this country’s values and women. Sunak said: “I will never let political correctness stand in the way of keeping us safe.” Protesters gathered outside the Manchester Central Convention Complex chanting “Tories Out” with placards reading “no to Rwanda” referencing the government’s immigration policy. Rishi Sunak is first on stage after his campaign video where the narrator, who sounded similar to actor Ray Winstone, talking about “everyone loves an underdog”. Alastair Stewart, who hosted the first ever televised leaders’ debate between David Cameron, Nick Clegg, and Gordon Brown in 2010, will be hosting tonight’s hustings. The latest hustings is taking place in Manchester from 7pm. You can follow all the action here. Here’s a round up of the key developments of the day so far: Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap.

Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak face another hustings tonight in Manchester. The event is hosted by GB News presenter Alastair Stewart, who will interview both Tory leadership candidates separately from 7pm before they answer members’ questions. Regional bus services in England that were facing the axe have been given a reprieve after the government announced £130m of funding to keep them going for at least six months. Services in the north-east and South Yorkshire were at risk amid concern that many more routes could be cut back when Covid grants, which propped up routes during the pandemic, expire at the start of October. The Department for Transport said on Friday it would provide further support to ensure that services keep running until March 2023. The further £130m of support takes the total degree of pandemic funding to £2bn as bus companies wrestle with rising costs and continued low patronage of their services. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: At a time when people are worried about rising costs, it’s more important than ever we save these bus routes for the millions who rely on them for work, school and shopping. Covid grants for bus companies were introduced to help sustain routes that had lost passengers during the pandemic. They were extended in the spring for a further six months with £150m to stave off feared widespread cuts to services, but the government had previously warned that no further funding would be available.

Farmers now expect Truss to take part in a hustings with the NFU in September, after she was initially accused of snubbing the organisation by deciding not to attend the event on Friday. Sunak, her rival for the Tory leadership, did attend the event in Warwickshire, where he promised to lead the “most pro-farming and pro-countryside government this country has seen in decades”. Sunak’s team said Truss’s absence “raises questions about her willingness to listen to the needs of farmers and the wider food industry”. The NFU president, Minette Batters, told the Guardian on Thursday that it was a “shame” Truss did not want to attend the hustings. Farmers have been among the groups angered by some of the post-Brexit trade deals championed by the foreign secretary, which they see as undercutting their livelihoods. Truss was also expected to be quizzed about claims from the environment secretary, George Eustice, who supports Sunak, that she had been resistant to putting animal welfare standards in UK trade deals. On Friday, an NFU spokesperson said Truss would attend a hustings with the farming body on 1 September. If it goes ahead, it will be one of the final husting events of the leadership campaign. The Sunak campaign said the former chancellor had “announced that he will set a new food security target, aggressively champion local produce, ensure the sector has the labour it needs, and take time to negotiate trade deals in the best interests of British farmers”. A spokesperson added: He will support farmers to boost their productivity and profitability and protect our best farmland. Farmers are the lifeblood of our nation. A Rishi Sunak-led government will make sure there is a bright future ahead for British agriculture, and he will always engage positively with the industry. More than 53,510 UK-based students were scrambling for places on university courses on Friday, the day after receiving lower grades in their A-level results, with many missing out on their offers in the most competitive year for university places in a decade. This year’s number of applicants marked as “free to be placed in clearing” on the Ucas website is the highest in more than a decade, and compares with 39,230 in clearing at the same point last year. Some of these students missed their grades while others declined their offers, and some may decide not to go to university. By Friday, 6,640 UK school-leavers had found places through clearing, a 33% increase on last year. A third more students – 23,640 – accepted their insurance choices after missing the grades for their top choice. University admissions directors reported that they had seen unprecedented levels of demand in clearing, with phone lines busier than ever, including from students with top grades. The UK’s transport department has announced £130m of funding for England’s bus network to make up for shortfalls in revenues caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cash would help to cover six months of operations by the private companies who run England’s buses from October 2022 to March 2023, the government said. Bus companies – like other parts of the UK’s struggling public transport industry – have been fighting to attract customers back to their routes after passenger numbers slumped during the coronavirus lockdowns. The government gave bus providers their first bailout (worth £400m) in April 2020 to protect routes while passenger numbers were down. Since then the value of funding made available to 160 companies had reached £2bn, the government said on Friday. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary who has had a busy day, said: At a time when people are worried about rising costs, it’s more important than ever we save these bus routes for the millions who rely on them for work, school and shopping. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, a lobby group for the bus and coach industry, perhaps unsurprisingly welcomed the money. A spokesperson said: Today’s announcement will help bus operators and local authority partners to balance a network of reliable and affordable services in the short-term as bus networks adapt to new travel patterns. For the longer-term, we will continue to work closely with central government and local authorities to encourage existing and new passengers to get on board the country’s buses, ensuring they are provided the best possible services. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak face another hustings tonight, this time with Conservative members living in the north of England. The event is hosted by GB News presenter Alastair Stewart, who will interview both Tory leadership candidates separately from 7pm before they answer members’ questions. The frontrunner to be the UK’s next prime minister has made her views on unions clear: she has approvingly tweeted a report that she intends to make striking more difficult. “New laws will make it harder to call strikes and also guarantee minimum levels of service are maintained on public transport”, according to a report by the Daily Express, a newspaper which is strongly pro-government and is supporting Truss in the Conservative leadership race. The rule changes could include raising the threshold for strike action – already fairly stringent in the UK – and limit the number of strikes unions can carry out once they have received the backing of votes. She will push through changes “within a month of becoming prime minister”, the Express reported. The European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU) describes UK strike laws as “complex and multilayered with detailed regulations introduced by Conservative governments over years”. This already includes a requirement for 40% of the total workforce (including those who do not vote) to vote in favour of action. Follow our business liveblog here for more on the strikes: Constituents of the Covid rule-breaking MP Margaret Ferrier are said to be “aghast” that she remains in post, as calls for her to resign gathered pace after she pleaded guilty on Thursday to “culpably and recklessly” exposing the public to the virus. The former Scottish National party politician, who now sits as an independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, faced immediate calls to stand down, including from the leader of her former party, Nicola Sturgeon, in October 2020 when it emerged she had visited a number of venues in her constituency and spoken in the Commons while awaiting the result of a Covid test. After Ferrier, 61, admitted she had failed to self-isolate and had “exposed people to risk of infection, illness and death” at a hearing prior to a planned trial at Glasgow sheriff court, those calls for her to resign have once more gained momentum. Martin Lennon, a Scottish Labour councillor for Rutherglen Central and North said: Most people here are aghast that this has gone on so long. The fact that she pleaded guilty is the cherry on top. If she plans to squat in the seat until the next election, she needs to do the decent thing. She had a really good reputation locally, but now has tarnished all that.” Read more here: Following the news that Vladimir Putin will be heading to the G20 meeting in Indonesia in November, Rishi Sunak has said he would lobby the summit to ban the Russian president while Liz Truss said previously she would use it as an opportunity to “call out” Putin. A spokesperson for Sunak said: Our G20 partners and allies have a collective responsibility to call Putin’s abhorrent behaviour out. Sitting round a table with him isn’t good enough when he is responsible for children being killed in their beds as they sleep. We need to send a strong message to Putin that he doesn’t have a seat at the table unless and until he stops his illegal war in Ukraine. Last month, Truss – who is currently the foreign secretary – said it would be important to confront Putin in front of allies like India and Indonesia. She said: I would go there, and I would call Putin out. Indonesia is head of the G20 this year and has faced pressure from the west to uninvite Putin over his invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been invited to attend the summit in Bali.

Here’s the report from PA Media: Figures obtained by the party from the Environment Agency through freedom of information requests indicate that, since 2016, raw sewage has been pumped into the natural environment for a total of 9,427,355 hours. Labour warned that the figures, which equate to 392,806 days’ worth of raw sewage discharge, probably do not cover the full scale of pollution. The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, attacked water companies and the government over the findings. He said: Families across Britain are trying to enjoy the summertime. Whilst water companies are paying billions in dividends, the Tories have allowed them to cut corners and pump filthy raw sewage on to our playing fields and into our waters. Labour will put a stop to this disgraceful practice by ensuring there can be enforcement of unlimited fines, holding water company bosses legally and financially accountable for their negligence, and by toughening up regulations that currently allow the system to be abused. The party said areas affected by raw sewage discharge include popular tourist and bathing spots, such as rivers and beaches. Labour also said the data shows there has been a 2,553% increase in the number of monitored discharge hours between 2016 and 2021, with the party arguing that the situation is “drastically worsening” under the Conservatives. In 2016, the Environment Agency recorded 100,533 hours’ worth of spills. By 2021, that figure had rocketed to 2,667,452. Earlier this month, a story in the Telegraph suggested that official plans to reduce the level of raw sewage discharged into waterways had been temporarily shelved. However, the government now appears to be sticking to the September deadline. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pointed to a statement released on its website on Thursday, which said the government is “taking action” on sewage discharges, with the current administration being the first to set an expectation on water companies to significantly reduce discharges from storm overflows. The water minister, Steve Double, said: We are the first government to take action to tackle sewage overflows. We have been clear that water companies’ reliance on overflows is unacceptable and they must significantly reduce how much sewage they discharge as a priority. This is on top of ambitious action we have already taken, including consulting on targets to improve water quality which will act as a powerful tool to deliver cleaner water, pushing all water companies to go further and faster to fix overflows. Work on tackling sewage overflows continues at pace and we will publish our plan in line with the 1 September statutory deadline. A green thinktank has criticised Rishi Sunak’s promise to protect farmland from solar farms, saying biofuels use 77 times the amount of arable land. Dustin Benton, policy director at Green Alliance, said: Solar energy isn’t standing in the way of food production in the UK. Instead, solar panels generate cheap, clean energy that doesn’t depend on Russia, and provide income to farmers too. A much better way of feeding people would be to stop using food crops to fuel cars. Biofuels for cars are a zombie policy. It’s now cheaper to decarbonise transport by getting more electric vehicles on the roads and freeing up land we’ve used for biofuels for food production instead. Green Alliance said biofuel production covered 108,000 hectares of arable land, enough to grow food for 3.5 million people, while solar farms covered only 1,400 hectares. The thinktank added that land used for solar farms could be used to grow crops at the same time. Conservative leadership frontrunner Liz Truss has been accused of showing “her true colours” in an 2009 paper promoting government spending cuts including slashing doctors’ pay. Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in a controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, TalkTV discovered. It came days after the Guardian revealed a leaked recording of Truss saying that British workers needed “more graft” and suggesting they lacked the “skill and application” of foreign rivals. Polls have consistently put Truss as clear favourite to win the race for No 10, with polling expert Sir John Curtice saying he would be “extraordinarily surprised” if she does not take office. Labour said Truss’s report from 13 years ago, entitled “Back to Black”, revealed that “the reality of her agenda is devastating cuts”. In the document, the seven authors, including Truss, recommended cutting £28bn in a year by introducing “user charges for GPs” and reducing the pay of registrars, consultants, GPs and managers by 10%.

The figures from 2019-20 and 2020-21 include almost £4m in bonuses to Avanti for “operational performance”, “customer experience” and “acting as a good and efficient operator”. At the same time, the firm raised prices, with an open return from Manchester to London – barely a two-hour journey – costing £369.40. The performance-related fees, signed off by transport ministers, came despite Avanti being the worst-performing operator in the country with almost half of its services arriving late. In the last two years alone the firm received more than 50,000 complaints, the most of any operator and almost double that of the parallel east coast mainline operator, LNER. Avanti, co-owned by the Italian national railways, has come under renewed criticism for slashing services between major cities by up to two-thirds on the west coast mainline, and earlier this week passengers were forced to climb a fence at Oxenholme station in Cumbria after being locked in as their train arrived 100 minutes late. Avanti West Coast, whose contract is due for renewal in October, already has the lowest passenger satisfaction rating possible, a figure the transport minister Charlotte Vere said last month was “terrible”. Despite this, the Department for Transport (DfT) confirmed it would continue to hand over millions of pounds in management fees, after ruling out fining the operator for the failing service. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, has warned her counterpart, Grant Shapps, that the government “cannot continue to wash their hands of responsibility, nor reward failure” as the damage to the economy from the ongoing failure of the private operator mounts.

Truss called for patients to be charged to see their GP and for doctors’ pay to be slashed by 10% in the controversial report she co-authored when she was deputy director of the Reform thinktank, PA Media reports. Polls have consistently put Truss as clear favourite to win the race for No 10, with elections guru Sir John Curtice saying he would be “extraordinarily surprised” if she does not take office. He told the Times that the foreign secretary “would have to foul up in some spectacular fashion” for her rival Rishi Sunak to enter Downing Street. Labour said Truss’s report from 13 years ago, entitled “Back to Black”, revealed that “the reality of her agenda is devastating cuts”. In the document, the seven authors - including Truss - recommended cutting £28bn in a year by introducing “user charges for GPs” and reducing the pay of registrars, consultants, GPs and managers by 10%. The report also called for the abolition of universal child benefit, the removal of the winter fuel payment, and the axing of several major military procurement projects including the Royal Navy’s planned aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales – which were described as “inappropriate defence projects”. Truss’s campaign attempted to distance the Tory leadership candidate from the paper, with a campaign spokesperson saying: Co-authoring a document does not mean that someone supports every proposal put forward. Liz is focused on her bold economic plan to boost growth, cut taxes and put money back into hardworking people’s pockets. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: Liz Truss’s track record shows her true colours. She is out of touch and out of step with the public. The reality of her agenda is devastating cuts that risk national security, punishing patients already facing record waiting times and cutting the pay of frontline workers. Her desperate attempts to distance herself from her own views now will fool no one. Railway changes will be imposed if workers do not agree to new deals, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said. The Conservative party has repeatedly targeted unions with criticism, in a move that the Trades Union Congress has argued is deliberately “picking a fight” for electoral purposes. Shapps is likely to remain transport secretary until at least 5 September, when a new Conservative party leader – likely to be Liz Truss if recent polls are correct – will be in place. There is little sign there would be a change of attitude under a new leader. Asked on Friday by Sky News if compulsory redundancies were on the table for rail workers, Shapps said (PA Media reports): The deal that is on the table actually means largely no compulsory redundancies at all. If [the unions] are not prepared to put that deal to your membership we will never know whether members would accept it. What I do know and I can say for sure is if we can’t get this settled in the way that we are proposing, which is ‘please put the deal to your membership’ then we will have to move to what is called a section 188; it is a process of actually requiring these changes to go into place so it becomes mandated. That is the direction that this is moving in now. Shapps claimed that outdated work practices needed to be updated – a characterisation of the industry that is disputed by the unions, who argue that employers are trying to use modernisation as an excuse to reduce members’ real pay and conditions. Shapps said: “If we can’t get those modernisations in place we will have to impose those modernisations but we would much rather do it through these offers actually being put to their members.” Follow our business liveblog for more on the rail strikes: Labour has urged Boris Johnson to recall parliament next week so the government can offer more help to struggling households before the announcement of the new energy price cap. The opposition has written to the prime minister and both Tory leadership candidates warning that it is a “crucial deadline” for government action to tackle soaring energy bills, after inflation topped 10% for the first time in 40 years. Ofgem will announce the new level at which energy bills will be capped next Friday, with forecasts predicting an increase to £3,582, or 82% above the current cap. Annual energy bills are expected to hit £4,500 a year from January, and £5,456 from April, with warnings that households across the country face serious hardship without government intervention. Labour this week unveiled a £29bn plan to freeze the cap at the current level of £1,971 for six months from October, which would save the average household £1,000, piling pressure on the next prime minister to follow suit. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, has now written to the prime minister, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, urging them to recall parliament two weeks early and to freeze the price cap before winter. Across Britain, people are having to make unthinkable choices about how to pay their bills, causing endless worry for households and businesses. In seven days, Ofgem will announce the rise of the energy price cap. Against the backdrop of a rise in inflation to 10.1%, this won’t just send households into a further spiral of worry, pushing them to cut back even further ahead of the winter. But it will create another shock for our economy. With businesses and households on the brink, we cannot wait to act. Families deserve a government that is on their side, and is ready to take the action needed now to meet the scale of this national emergency. Earlier this month, the Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey, called on the government to announce an emergency budget to deal with the cost of living crisis. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, has also urged the prime minister to bring back MPs before the end of the summer recess. Read more here: A former executive at the oil company BP has called for increases to the energy price cap to be scrapped and for suppliers that fail to help households struggling with bills to be nationalised. Nick Butler, who worked for BP for almost 30 years and was group vice-president for strategy and development, said that expected rises in the cap should be abandoned by the industry regulator, Ofgem, which he said had been “overwhelmed by events” after turmoil in the global energy markets sent 29 British energy retailers to the wall. Butler is also calling for a “forensic examination” of the accounts of remaining suppliers to ensure they are still viable businesses. Ofgem is expected to announce next week a rise in the price cap, which is supposed to protect consumers. This could mean annual bills jumping from an average of £1,971 to £3,582. Butler, who was a senior policy adviser to Gordon Brown, echoed the former prime minister’s view that energy firms unable to offer lower bills should be re-nationalised. Writing for the Guardian, Butler said: As with the financial sector in 2008, if the private energy sector fails to meet the needs of the society it serves, its functions must and will be taken on by the government. The companies involved now must show they understand that they must use their skills and resources in the public interest. Butler’s comments come as the government assesses options to help households facing soaring energy bills this winter. His former employer BP has been accused of “unfettered profiteering” during the energy crisis, aided by a rise in wholesale oil and gas prices caused in part by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Read the full story here: Health sector leaders have warned the UK faces a “humanitarian crisis” of worsening health outcomes unless the government does more to help with rising energy costs. Families are looking ahead to a grim winter as experts predict the cap on energy bills will hit close to £3,600 a year from October, before rising again next year, PA Media reports. Surging prices mean people will have to choose between skipping meals to heat their homes or living in poor conditions, the NHS Confederation said in a letter to ministers. Matthew Taylor is chief executive of the body, which represents NHS leaders, and was quoted by the BBC and the Times as saying: The country is facing a humanitarian crisis. Many people could face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions. This in turn could lead to outbreaks of illness and sickness around the country and widen health inequalities, worsen children’s life chances and leave an indelible scar on local communities. The regulator is set to announce the new price cap, which will come into effect from October, next Friday. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have suggested plans to freeze bills at the same level as now, while many of the biggest energy suppliers have backed a similar idea. But the government has made it clear it will not do anything substantial until a new prime minister is in office on 5 September. On Thursday, the trade body for energy companies called for more support on top of the £400 promised to households in May. Dhara Vyas, Energy UK’s director of advocacy, said: Time is running very short ahead of October and we know many customers are already struggling after the last price rise – so the predicted increases will simply be unaffordable for millions of households. Given the urgency, our industry believes the most practical way to help customers ahead of Christmas will be to increase the amount of support made through the existing bills support scheme. Labour is calling for the government to get a grip on the energy crisis and said the two Tory leadership candidates need to show they are “serious” about the problem and back a recall of parliament. Ofgem is expected to announce next week a rise in the price cap, which is supposed to protect consumers. This could mean annual bills jumping from an average of £1,971 to £3,582. The opposition party has written to Boris Johnson, as well as Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, to ask for MPs to return to Westminster on Monday in a bid to propose their plan to freeze the cap. Asked by Sky News what the purpose of a recall would be, shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said: It would be so that we can pass the legislation that would be necessary for us to override the price rise, the rise in the price cap that Ofgem will be announcing in seven days’ time. That could happen next week if we get back to parliament on Monday. That is up to the government to request of the Speaker, and they can do that. The prime minister is perfectly capable of opening his email which I sent him last night asking him to do just this. I have also asked both leadership candidates to back that call. If they are really serious about helping working people and struggling households and businesses through this cost-of-living crisis, they should back our call right now and we should be passing that legislation next week. The Labour frontbencher added: The time to act is now; the government has failed. They could have acted weeks ago, they could have acted months ago in fact when Labour first called for a windfall tax on oil and gas way back in January. Welcome to today’s politics liveblog.

Even the rarest, thulium, is more than 100 times more common than gold. But only a few countries – such as the US, Australia and Brazil – contain deposits substantial enough to mine. Crucially, climate solutions – such as solar energy, wind energy and electric vehicles – depend on rare earth elements, which have unique magnetic and luminescent properties. The trouble is that their production and disposal is environmentally destructive. It is worrying, therefore, that the European Union this week said that it wants lower regulatory barriers to mining raw materials needed for a green transition. To get to net zero, Europe will require up to 26 times the amount of rare earth metals in 2050 compared with today. Demand is also increasing because of digitalisation. The EU, like the UK, is dependent on imports, while the geopolitics of supply chains are increasingly unstable. China is the world’s largest producer of rare earths. Russia is the fourth-largest supplier. The west views this as a significant potential threat to its security of supply. Given Russia’s attempts to weaponise its gas supplies, this is not an unreasonable belief. Consumers would notice if supplies were disrupted. Rare earths are critical to clean energy technologies used today; every Toyota Prius has more than 9kg (20lb) of lanthanum in its battery. It’s not only the future of the planet at stake, it’s the future of our defence too. Nato is almost 100% dependent on rare earth imports from China. A US Virginia-class submarine requires about four tonnes of rare earth materials. China has been willing to use key minerals as a political weapon. After tensions between Beijing and Tokyo boiled over in 2010, China blocked rare earth exports to Japan. Mining for rare earth minerals generates large volumes of toxic and radioactive material. The transition to climate neutrality cannot mean replacing a reliance on dirty fossil fuels with a dependence on raw materials, the extraction of which leaves large tracts of the Earth uninhabitable. Clean ways to recover these rare earths efficiently from discarded products are being developed. More companies are using recycled minerals in their manufacturing processes. Apple’s iPhone 12 is made from 98% reused rare earths. Japanese carmakers are cutting down on their use. Guillaume Pitron wrote in his book The Rare Metals War that over the next three decades “we will need to mine more mineral ores than humans have extracted over the last 70,000 years”. This cannot end up costing the Earth. China established its dominance over the rare earths industry because of lax environmental regulations and a cheap workforce. It has paid a high price. Today, 10% of its arable land is contaminated by heavy metals, and 80% of its groundwater isn’t fit for consumption. Technological advance on a global scale should not replicate such ecological destruction. A scramble for Africa, which is rich in rare earths but largely unexplored, is under way. Major powers are already pushing for deals. Capital would be attracted to a continent where labour is inexpensive and environmental protections are virtually nonexistent. But the world cannot sustain a race to the bottom in rare earths. What is needed is, first, to enact tougher regulations to stem the damage done by mining companies and then for the United Nations to get an enforceable agreement on high global standards for rare earth extraction and processing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2022/aug/17/biden-climate-law-savings-rebate-electric-car-solar-panel-appliance","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-17T12:00:15Z","webTitle":"Electric cars to solar panels: tax breaks in Biden’s climate law for Americans","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/biden-climate-law-savings-rebate-electric-car-solar-panel-appliance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/aug/17/biden-climate-law-savings-rebate-electric-car-solar-panel-appliance","fields":{"headline":"Electric cars to solar panels: tax breaks in Biden’s climate law for Americans","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The giant climate bill signed by Joe Biden on Tuesday is set to touch upon myriad aspects of Americans’ lives, helping shape everything from the cars they drive to the stovetops in their kitchens. Biden has lauded the $369bn of climate spending in the Inflation Reduction Act as the “largest investment ever in combatting the existential crisis of climate change” and predicted it will save people hundreds of dollars each year in energy costs. This claim is based upon a series of investments aimed at shifting buying habits away from a polluting status quo towards cleaner, electrified vehicles and appliances. A US household could save $1,800 on their energy costs each year, according to a recent estimate, although this would require the installation of electric heat pumps for hot water and air conditioning, replacing a gasoline-powered car with an electric vehicle and installing solar panels on the roof. But even without these modifications, the climate bill is expected to lower costs by funneling support to renewable energy projects, such as wind and solar, that will provide a less price volatile source of electricity than gas, coal and oil. “There are people who are really on the frontlines of the inflation crisis and how expensive fossil fuels are because of [Vladimir] Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, and this bill will be delivering big energy savings for those people,” said Leah Stokes, a climate policy expert at the University of California. Electric cars The new legislation, once passed, will provide a tax rebate of up to $7,500 for a new electric vehicle, which can be transferred to the car dealer so it can act as an upfront payment. Electric cars have so far been the domain of the wealthy, accounting for less than 5% of total car sales in the US, and the bill tries to remedy this by also offering a $4,000 tax credit for used electric vehicles (EVs), in the hope that lower-income people will be able to take advantage. It’s uncertain how strong initial take-up will be, however. The tax credit applies to cars made with parts made in the US or from countries that have a free trade agreement with the US, meaning that the leading suppliers of key materials like cobalt and lithium – China and Russia – are excluded. Ongoing supply chain woes also mean that the demand for EVs is currently outstripping supply, with many carmakers having long waiting lists for models, while public charging infrastructure is still patchy in much of the country. Solar panels Anyone who wants to install solar panels on their property can now get a 30% tax credit, a program that runs until 2034. People who use home-based batteries for energy storage can also access the credit. Erecting solar panels isn’t cheap, costing an average of $20,000 according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, but this upfront cost is eventually recouped, and more, by the savings in energy bills. Rooftop panels are becoming more common in new buildings, too, with states such as California passing mandates that new developments must include them. People in apartments can have the option of leasing a rooftop solar system, or joining a community solar farm. Home appliances Some of the biggest changes initiated by the climate bill are likely to be found in the homes of Americans, with up to $14,000 in rebates available to low- and middle-income households to make their dwellings greener and more efficient. An $8,000 rebate will be available to help install heat pumps, which are efficient electrical devices that both heat and cool homes, with a further $1,750 for water heating. A slightly smaller tax break can be applied for purchases of clothes dryers or an electric cooker, such as a high-efficient induction stovetop. Tax credits that cover 30% of the cost of home improvements that reduce heat leakage, such as upgraded windows and doors, are also part of the bill, with a $1,600 rebate to insulate and seal a house, and a $2,500 tax break for improvements to electrical wiring. Household savings “will be reflected in lower monthly energy bills, reduced bill volatility and a lessening of disproportionately high energy burdens within disadvantaged communities”, said Jamal Lewis, director of policy partnerships at Rewiring America, a clean energy research organization."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/aug/11/us-protect-freedom-of-navigation-says-taiwan-envoy-china","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-08-11T17:56:48Z","webTitle":"US and allies should move to protect ‘freedom of navigation’, says Taiwan envoy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/11/us-protect-freedom-of-navigation-says-taiwan-envoy-china","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/aug/11/us-protect-freedom-of-navigation-says-taiwan-envoy-china","fields":{"headline":"US and allies should move to protect ‘freedom of navigation’, says Taiwan envoy","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US and its allies should jointly respond to China’s live ammunition drills designed to intimidate Taiwan by holding “freedom of navigation” operations in the Taiwan Strait, Taipei’s official representative to the UK has said. In an interview with the Guardian, Kelly Wu-Chiao Hsieh also called on the UK to uphold the principles of rules-based international order and forge closer trade and investment relations with Taiwan. He welcomed the decision of the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to condemn the unprecedented Chinese military exercises in the wake of the visit of the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to the island, the most senior US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years. The UK, like most western countries, does not recognise Taiwan and has no formal defence ties with the country. Hsieh said the events in Hong Kong had changed the views of many in Taiwan about China. “There is a new generation of young Taiwanese voters who have been hugely affected by China’s treatment of Hong Kong and have come to realise the Chinese promise of ‘one country, two systems’ was simply a facade or a joke. Many of these young voters are politically active, and are determined not to suffer the same fate as Hong Kong’s civil society movements.” He said: “The scale of these drills were different to what has happened before, and could not have been prepared, and all those resources lined up, in a very short period of time. It was premeditated, preplanned. It was only a matter of choosing the timing, and they just chose Pelosi’s visit. It was a self-orchestrated crisis.” But he insisted the Chinese response would not intimidate Taiwan or stop its supporters from visiting the country. A UK foreign affairs select committee delegation is due to visit the capital, Taipei, before the end of the year. Hsieh said the Chinese had used the Pelosi visit as “a pretext to mount its military exercises” and that, although the drills did not themselves amount to a blockade, “it does not take much imagination to work out what the Chinese are thinking about. They are trying to create a new status quo”. A response asserting the principle of freedom of navigation – international laws protecting freedom of movement at sea – was needed in the next few weeks, Hsieh said, to protect the “median line” in the Taiwan Strait, a tacit maritime boundary between China and Taiwan that has existed since the 1950s. During the week of exercises China passed the median line, defined by Hsieh as the defining indicator of peace and stability in the Strait, by sea or air more than 100 times. Millions of cyber-attacks also hit the self-governed island, including the president’s office, the foreign ministry and the defence ministry, Hsieh said. “Even though China has announced the end of the formal drills, the reality for us is we experience these military drills still humming around us on a daily basis. So anytime in the future, maybe in the next few days, they might just resume again. The key [thing] to watch is if they continue to mess around with the median line,” he said. Asked if an invasion is now inevitable, he said: “Inevitable or not, we we have to make sure that it is credibly deterred. Taiwan will fortify its defence capabilities and continue to look for international solidarity.” He acknowledged that China has the ability to intimidate other countries in the region diplomatically, and said that until the G7 statement on the drills there had been “an eerie quietness”. The US National Security Council coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs, Kurt Campbell, has since summoned the Chinese ambassador to the US to deliver a warning over the military exercises, while Truss conveyed a similar message to the UK’s Chinese ambassador on Wednesday. Truss has landed herself in diplomatic hot water by urging the British government to do more to help Taiwan defend itself militarily. Neither the US or the UK have explicitly said how they would respond if China invaded Taiwan, but UK licences for arms exports to Taiwan have grown in the past two years. Hsieh also confirmed Taiwan and the UK were discussing ways to boost bilateral trade and investment focusing on solar energy, biosciences, hydrogen power, transport infrastructure and the resilience of the supply chain for semiconductors (computer chips), an industry Taiwan dominates. “We are currently in the middle of clarifying areas for the future,” he disclosed.

Boris Johnson, still just about prime minister for another fourish weeks, tried to show he is gripping the issue by unexpectedly turning up at a meeting of energy company bosses on Thursday. However, he told energy bosses that he is leaving any big decisions to his successor, the Treasury said. The government has been careful to keep the option of further taxes on the table for the next prime minister, but it did not express much enthusiasm for more windfall taxes in the meeting, the Guardian’s Alex Lawson reports. An energy industry source briefed on the meeting said: It was a constructive discussion about ways to support customers and accelerate investments in energy security in the UK. It was clear the windfall tax is not a preferred option for anyone – ministers or electricity companies. Zahawi, who is widely expected to be demoted from chancellor by a new leader, said that energy firms agreed to “do more” to help the most vulnerable households with bills, but the Treasury did not provide details of what help that might be, or who it counts as the people who need more help. Johnson also said that he wanted to see more investments from energy companies in renewable energy and biomass, but also added that he wanted firms to do more drilling of oil and gas in the North Sea. Tomorrow we will get a first reading of how badly the UK economy was affected by the energy crisis in the second quarter of 2022, with the Office for National Statistics publishing GDP figures.

Do join me again tomorrow morning for the UK’s second-quarter GDP reading. JJ We have pictures from inside the government’s meeting with energy bosses. All of the photos are focused on outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson, so it is unclear which bosses attended in person and which were on a video call. We also know of several other companies who joined the meeting (beyond those mentioned earlier). They were retailer provider Octopus Energy, oil trader Vitol, generator Intergen, renewables investor Greencoat Capital and lobby group Energy UK. On the other side of the Atlantic the US is coping with its own inflationary pressures. The latest data today suggests those pressures might be easing – even if they remain strong. The US producer price index, which measures what goods cost when leaving the factory gate, rose by 9.8% year-on-year in July, according to the US Labor Department. That is a steep increase, but less than the 11.3% recorded in June and the 10.4% that economists had expected, according to a Reuters poll. The monthly figures also showed that the index actually fell by 0.5% month-on-month. Economists had suggested that the index would rise, so that counts as a genuine surprise. Earlier this week the news that consumer prices remained flat in July sparked a relief rally on stock markets as investors entertained the hope that inflation may have peaked. That might mean that central banks do not have to raise interest rates and tip countries into recession, as is still widely expected. But beware: US Federal Reserve officials last night said the battle against inflation is far from over. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he will keep urging the electricity sector to cut bills after meeting energy bosses today. He asked the oil producers present to keep investing in North Sea oil and gas, citing the UK’s energy security. Johnson, chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng also stressed the importance of investments in renewables, biomass and nuclear energy. Some of the discussions addressed how to lower energy bills, while Zahawi is understood to have told the meeting that the government was considering measures aimed at the “extraordinary profits” of some parts of the electricity generation sector. In written comments after the meeting, Johnson said: Countries around the world are feeling the impact of Putin’s damaging war in Ukraine. We know that this will be a difficult winter for people across the UK, which is why we are doing everything we can to support them and must continue to do so. Following our meeting today, we will keep urging the electricity sector to continue working on ways we can ease the cost of living pressures and to invest further and faster in British energy security. We are continuing to roll out government support over the coming months, including the second £324 instalment of the cost of living payment for vulnerable households, extra help for pensioners and those with disabilities, and the £400 energy bills discount for all households. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said that energy companies who attended a meeting with him and Prime Minister Boris Johnson today agreed to “do more to help the people who most need it” – but did not detail what that would entail. In a readout from the meeting Zahawi said the companies pledged to work “in the spirit of national unity”. However, Johnson also told the meeting that it will be for his successor to make significant fiscal decisions, again ruling out significant policy action before 5 September. Zahawi said: This morning I hosted industry leaders from the electricity sector to discuss what more they can do to work with Government and act in the interest of the country in the face of rising prices caused by Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. We have already acted to protect households with £400 off energy bills and direct payments of £1,200 for 8m of the most vulnerable British families. In the spirit of national unity, they agreed to work with us to do more to help the people who most need it. There is a notable absence from the list of people at the Downing Street meeting between ministers and energy bosses: big oil. Neither of the UK’s “supermajor” oil and gas companies, BP and Shell, were among the chief executives in attendance. Between them the two FTSE 100 oil producers made profits of $35bn (£29bn) during the first half of the year – much of it thanks to surging oil and gas prices following Vladimir Putin’s order for Russia to invade Ukraine. BP talks about a “cash balance point” for the next few years of around $40 per barrel of Brent crude oil. That means that pretty much everything above that price is gravy. With Brent futures prices recovering to $98 per barrel on Thursday, the profits bonanza starts to be understandable. Both Shell and BP say they need the profits to make genuinely large investments in renewable energy – solar energy provider Lightsource BP is a notable example. Yet shareholder returns of $16bn this year from the two companies have far outweighed spending on zero-emissions energy. BP has committed to spending of $2.5bn this year on net zero-compatible energy. • This post was amended on 12 August 2022. The boss of Lightsource BP did not attend the meeting as previously stated. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also joined the meeting of energy company bosses. Johnson had not been expected at the meeting, but was a last-minute addition, it is understood. The prime minister, who will be pushed out of office by 5 September, has been criticised for refusing to act to cut energy costs in recent months. The meeting’s attendees cover a significant proportion of the UK’s electricity generation abilities. They also serve many of Britain’s households with gas. EDF’s generators nuclear power stations generate about a fifth of the UK’s electricity. Centrica’s British Gas is the largest supplier of gas to UK households. Some of the companies have also been among the big beneficiaries of the energy price spike. For instance, Centrica made operating profits of £1.3bn during the first half of 2022 thanks to higher prices for the oil and gas it drills. Others have not fared so well. Gas distributor Uniper required a €15bn (£13bn) bailout from the German government after Russia cut back gas supplies to Europe. France’s EDF Group is suing its own government for €8.3bn (£7bn) after it was forced by Emmanuel Macron’s administration to sell energy to consumers at a loss. The company is being wholly nationalised as part of France’s effort to minimise energy bills. The bosses of some of the UK’s biggest energy companies have started a meeting with the chancellor and business secretary who are expected to pressure them to invest in green energy rather than pay-outs for shareholders. It is understood that attendees of the meeting this morning include Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica, Keith Anderson, the chief executive of Scottish Power, and Simone Rossi, the boss of EDF in the UK. The government has the option of increasing taxes on energy companies, after belatedly introducing a windfall tax in response to the surge in energy prices that has driven inflation in the UK to a 40-year high. However, neither chancellor Nadhim Zahawi nor business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng are thought to favour raising taxes further, and government sources briefed last night that the talks will focus on investments and ensuring security of supply. There is a big question mark over whether investments in new projects can have any effect on the energy price increase expected over the winter. The consultancy Cornwall Insight said on Tuesday that it expected the UK’s energy price cap (the annual rate paid by an average household) to reach £4,266 for the first three months of next year. The meeting this morning is also thought to include the bosses of Denmark’s Orsted, Germany’s Eon, RWE and Uniper, and Britain’s Drax and SSE. • This post was amended on 12 August 2022. The boss of Lightsource BP did not attend the meeting as previously stated. There is an arm wrestle ahead over regulation of the City of London. Earlier this week Conservative leadership race frontrunner Liz Truss signalled (in briefings to allies reported by the Financial Times) that she will bring in powers to “call in” financial regulatory decisions if they are too cautious. Rishi Sunak previously said he would do something similar. That means both the candidates to be the next prime minister want to clip the Bank of England’s wings. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has restated his position that government interference in regulatory decisions would be detrimental to the UK. In a letter to the Treasury select committee (from 27 July, so before Truss jumped on the bandwagon) Bailey wrote: Regulatory independence is important, not least because our international standing, and therefore the competitiveness of the UK financial sector which the reforms are aimed at enhancing, depends on it. Anything that would weaken the independence of regulators would undermine the aims of the reforms. File under one to watch. The UK housing industry’s expectations for the year ahead are the most downbeat since the first coronavirus lockdowns began in March 2020, according to a regular poll of chartered surveyors. The balance of respondents believing prices will fall in the next 12 months rose to 36% in July, up from 21% in June, according to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). Enquiries by potential new buyers dropped for the third consecutive month. The surveyors blamed the prospect of higher interest rates and the cost-of-living crisis for the drop in demand: if borrowing is more expensive as the Bank of England battles inflation and people can save less then a fall in demand would not come as a surprise. Yet one of the defining economic themes of the UK’s last decade has been the way that house prices have defied apparent economic gravity. Rics said “house prices continue to rise across the UK”, with a balance of 63% of respondents reporting that prices increased. Tarrant Parsons, Rics’s senior economist said: Amid a backdrop of sharply rising living costs, slowing economic growth and higher interest rates, it is little surprise that housing market activity is now losing some momentum. With monetary policy set to be tightened further over the coming months, sales expectations point to a further softening in transaction volumes going forward. Nevertheless, with respect to house prices, limited supply available is still seen as a crucial factor underpinning the market. Although house price growth is likely to continue to ease, respondents still anticipate prices will be modestly higher than current levels in a year’s time. Another sign that inflationary pressures in the US economy may have peaked: the average price of US retail gasoline fell below $4 per gallon on Thursday. The national average price for regular unleaded petrol fell to $3.990 a gallon on 11 August, according to the American Automobile Association’s price tracker. That is down from $4.68 a month ago, and above $5 in mid-June. Rising petrol prices have been an important part of the inflationary story around the world, as many people outside urban areas cannot avoid filling up their cars. It filters through to the price of almost everything else via businesses. Fuel subsidies have been used in several countries to cushion the inflationary blow, although many economists and analysts say this can be counterproductive, as it encourages people to continue to buy more fuel. And rich households tend to spend more on fuel, so subsidies help them more. A few more interesting points. Firstly, the American Automobile Association’s map of petrol prices is not a bad proxy for a US election map (albeit with the colour scheme swapped): Secondly American petrol prices enjoy a huge implicit subsidy: prices are fundamentally lower than many other parts of the world. $4 per gallon – a pump price level that prompts howls of outrage in the US – equates to about 87p per litre in British money. That is less than half what British drivers pay, according to the RAC. The FTSE 100 leaders this morning are Ladbrokes owner Entain and Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company, both of which have given their shareholders positives amid a tricky macro environment. Coca-Cola HBC, one of the biggest owners of a bottling franchise for US-based Coca-Cola, gained 3.6% after it forecast operating profits in 2022 similar to 2021 – even after reporting a €190m (£160m) hit from its Russian business, after it stopped selling Coke products following the invasion of Ukraine. Gambling company Entain said it is buying a Croatia’s SuperSport Group bookmaker in a growth drive, and its profits (otherwise known as customers’ gambling losses) were up 20% on a year earlier. Its share price rose by 2.2%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Stock markets around the world have rallied after US consumer price index inflation slowed in July. However, Federal Reserve officials have done their best to emphasise that the world’s largest and most influential economy is not out of the woods yet. The relief rally prompted by the slower inflation (which could imply less need for interest rate hikes to slow economic growth) continued in Asia overnight, with the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index gaining 1.5% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng up 2.1%. In Europe the Stoxx 600 index gained 0.4% in the opening minutes of trading, but the FTSE 100 edged down. Investors are trying to balance their hopes that inflationary pressures may be falling with the knowledge that the US Federal Reserve is still committed to increasing interest rates further, potentially triggering a recession. Falling inflation in the US would feed through directly to economies around the world, including the UK, where the Bank of England has already forecast a year-long recession. Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, last night said the slower-than-expected US inflation reading was “welcome” news but did not alter his expectation that the US central bank would need to raise its rates to 3.9% by year-end and to 4.4% by the end of 2023. The rate is currently in the 2.25%-2.5% range. The Fed is “far, far away from declaring victory” on inflation, Kashkari said at the Aspen Ideas Conference, Reuters reported. Another official, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank president Mary Daly, gave the Financial Times a similar message on Wednesday. She said: There’s good news on the month-to-month data that consumers and business are getting some relief, but inflation remains far too high and not near our price stability goal. We will have a further indication of inflationary pressures in the US later today, with the producer price index giving an indication of the prices manufacturers are charging. The agenda 1:30pm BST: US producer price index inflation (July; previous: 11.3%; consensus: 10.4%) 1:30pm BST: US initial jobless claims (week ending 6 August; previous: 260,000; consensus: 263,000)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-24T10:48:04Z","webTitle":"Barcelona school and residents create solar energy community","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jul/24/barcelona-school-residents-create-solar-energy-community","fields":{"headline":"Barcelona school and residents create solar energy community","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"A secondary school and a residents’ association have teamed up with Barcelona city council to create a solar energy community with the capacity to grow – rooftop by rooftop – across large areas of the city. The solar panels on the roof of Quatre Cantons secondary school in the former industrial district of Poblenou supply power to the school and 30 households in the surrounding area. Each household has 500W of free electricity at its disposal, equivalent to a 25% cut in their bill. The idea was first proposed in 2019, says Marike Charlier, spokesperson for the residents’ association, and began to become a reality in discussions with the Quatre Cantons school. César Ochoa, a maths teacher at the school who also sits on its sustainability committee, said the school’s desire to cut energy consumption dovetailed with the residents’ plans and, in a first for an energy community of this nature, the council agreed to foot the €94,000 (£80,000) cost of installing solar panels on the school’s roof. The 30 households then became clients of Barcelona Energia, the council-run electricity company, replacing the private company Endesa, although the latter has been slow to cede the connection. “Once it’s operational, the school will get 30% of the electricity generated,” Ochoa says. “That will supply only some of its needs, but this is just a pilot project. Obviously, during school holidays this energy will be available to whoever else needs it.” Solar power went into decline in Spain under the previous conservative government after it imposed a “sunshine tax” on individual consumers or energy communities, which the big power companies claimed were unfair competition. The tax was scrapped under the current government and solar installation is soaring, accompanied by a move towards localised, rooftop installations, such as Quatre Cantons, rather than huge solar parks miles from centres of population. Last year Spain produced about 46% of its energy through renewables but solar (1.8%) still lags behind wind (23%) and hydro (11.4%). Under Spanish law, solar installations can only supply power within a 500m radius (the rule is 2km in France and Portugal) but the idea was always to extend it beyond 500m from the school, says Charlier. She points out that there are 11 other public buildings within 500m (1,640ft) of Quatre Cantons where further installations could radically increase the power available and extend the scheme across the neighbourhood. The city council has set itself a goal of a five-fold increase in solar power across the public and private sector by 2030. “These energy communities are really special and they make it possible to find solutions that wouldn’t otherwise be viable, but it isn’t scalable for the whole city,” says Eloi Badia, councillor for climate change and ecological transition. “In the end, the solution for Barcelona is for everyone to have solar panels on their roof.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/live/2022/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-as-russia-intensifies-long-range-bombardment-latest-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-16T23:02:50Z","webTitle":"Russian forces ‘preparing new offensive’ – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-as-russia-intensifies-long-range-bombardment-latest-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2022/jul/16/russia-ukraine-war-air-raid-sirens-in-kyiv-as-russia-intensifies-long-range-bombardment-latest-updates","fields":{"headline":"Russian forces ‘preparing new offensive’ – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: 7 civilians have been evacuated from Sviatohirsk Lavra in Donetsk. Among those evacuated include a family with three children and two elderly people, according to Ukraine’s defense ministry intelligence directorate. The youngest evacuee was born just a few days earlier at a monastery. The armed forces of Ukraine are advancing “confidently” towards Kherson, according to a Ukrainian military spokesperson. Natalia Hemeniuk, the head of the press center of Operation Command South, “Speaking about what is happening directly in Kherson direction, we are advancing there. Maybe we are not moving as fast as those who present positive news would like, but believe me, these steps are very confident.” The war in Ukraine “concerns the West as a whole” but at the same time must not lead to “forgetting Africa’s security” needs, France’s armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu said Saturday. “We have a form of myopia in Europe and France, where the Ukraine war mobilises all our energy, and that is natural - it is a conflict that concerns the West as a whole,” said Lecornu in Ivory Coast after a visit to Niger. “No Russian missiles or artillery can break our unity,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a statement on Saturday. In an address on the anniversary of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, Zelenskiy added, “It should be equally obvious that it cannot be broken with lies or intimidation, fakes or conspiracy theories.” All bodies have been identified after the Vinnytsia missile strike, the region’s governor announced. According to Vinnytsia oblast governor Serhii Borzov, 68 people are currently hospitalized, 14 of them are in serious condition. Rescue operations after Russian missiles struck the west central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia have concluded. 23 people have been killed, 202 have been injured, one person is missing and three others have been rescued, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. Russian forces are preparing for a new offensive, the Kyiv Independent reports. According to Vadym Skibitsky, a representative of the intelligence directorate at Ukraine’s defense ministry, Russian activity signal that “undoubtedly, preparations for the next stage of offensive actions are underway.” Around 100 to 150 civilians were killed by Russian military strikes in Ukraine over the past two weeks, according to the Pentagon. In a briefing on Friday, a senior US military official said, “And I think all told over the week...we’re looking at between 100, 150, somewhere in there, civilian casualties, civilian deaths, this week in Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes.” That’s it from me, Maya Yang, as I hand the blog over to my colleagues in Australia who will bring you the latest updates. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. 7 civilians have been evacuated from Sviatohirsk Lavra in Donetsk, the Kyiv Independent reports. Among those evacuated include a family with three children and two elderly people, according to Ukraine’s defense ministry intelligence directorate. The youngest evacuee was born just a few days earlier at a monastery. The armed forces of Ukraine are advancing “confidently” towards Kherson, according to a Ukrainian military spokesperson. Natalia Hemeniuk, the head of the press center of Operation Command South said on Espresso TV, “Speaking about what is happening directly in Kherson direction, we are advancing there. Maybe we are not moving as fast as those who present positive news would like, but believe me, these steps are very confident. And that is why they are taken in silence and certain confidentiality – in order to gain a foothold in these territories and then announce our victories.” Hemeniuk also said that Ukrainian defenders came across an enemy armored vehicle on Friday while clearing out the territory of Potiomkyne village which the Ukrainian military liberated a few weeks ago. The vehicle turned out to not pose any threats and was transferred to the Ukrainian armed forces. “But we understand that the enemies may leave more threatening ‘surprises’ in the territories they left. Like it was with Snake Island, which the Russians continue to attack with aircraft and try to find out what is actually happening there and bomb it from time to time though failing to hit the island,” Humeniuk said. Deputies in Ukraine’s parliament have formed a new group in attempts to urge the Ukrainian parliament to approve a resolution that declares Russia’s expulsion of Circassians in 1864 an act of genocide. The war in Ukraine “concerns the West as a whole” but at the same time must not lead to “forgetting Africa’s security” needs, France’s armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu said Saturday. Agence France-Presse reports: “We have a form of myopia in Europe and France, where the Ukraine war mobilises all our energy, and that is natural - it is a conflict that concerns the West as a whole,” said Lecornu in Ivory Coast after a visit to Niger. “Yet it should not lead to forgetting about news on security in Africa,” he argued ahead of meeting with Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara. Earlier, Lecornu had talks with Ivorian counterpart Tene Birahima Ouattara on African security, notably in the Sahel. While hailing France’s counter-terrorism efforts with Paris’ partners in the region in recent years, he said Paris had now embarked on a “new agenda” with its main friends and allies in West Africa. Earlier this year, Paris announced the withdrawal of its troops from Mali following the breakdown in relations with the ruling junta in the former French colony. That ended a nearly 10-year deployment against jihadist groups that pose a growing threat in the region. “No Russian missiles or artillery can break our unity,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a statement on Saturday. In an address on the anniversary of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine, Zelenskiy added, “It should be equally obvious that it cannot be broken with lies or intimidation, fakes or conspiracy theories.” All bodies have been identified after the Vinnytsia missile strike, the region’s governor announced. According to Vinnytsia oblast governor Serhii Borzov, 68 people are currently hospitalized, 14 of them are in serious condition. Serhii Morhunov, Vinnytsia’s mayor said that the families of those killed and injured would received $1,700 and $850 in assistance, respectively. Rescue operations after Russian missiles struck the west central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia have concluded, the Kyiv Independent reports. 23 people have been killed, 202 have been injured, one person is missing and three others have been rescued, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. Additionally, the strikes, which hit the city center on July 14, destroyed 55 residential houses and 42 vehicles. Russian forces are preparing for a new offensive, the Kyiv Independent reports. According to Vadym Skibitsky, a representative of the intelligence directorate at Ukraine’s defense ministry, Russian activity signal that “undoubtedly, preparations for the next stage of offensive actions are underway.” He also added that the threat of an invasion from Belarus is no longer as high as it previously was prior to the start of Russia’s invasion in February. Around 100 to 150 civilians were killed by Russian military strikes in Ukraine over the past two weeks, according to the Pentagon. In a briefing on Friday, a senior US military official said: “And I think all told over the week ... we’re looking at between 100, 150, somewhere in there, civilian casualties, civilian deaths, this week in Ukraine as a result of Russian strikes. The recent increase in civilian deaths comes as Russian and Ukrainian military forces remain in a fierce battle on the frontlines of Ukraine’s eastern territories. When asked whether the war had entered a stalemate, the official said: “It’s probably too early to make a determination like that. I think, you know, again, in terms of where you are on the battlefield, I would – I have to believe that the HIMARS have had an effect. I don’t know that that’s – you know, we didn’t think that would be a silver bullet, certainly.” He went on to add: “I think what you’re seeing is ... a matchup between bad morale and strong will.” Hi everyone, this is Maya Yang and I will be taking over the blog and bringing you the latest updates. Stay tuned. On the Russian missiles hitting the city of Dnipro, which killed three people and wounded 15, a local woman who gave her name as Klavdia told Reuters: “When the blast wave hit, there were few shards because all my windows were taped up. “I have a small injury on the left of my body but the people whose windows were not protected like this, there was a lot of blood, their injuries were horrible. “I saw a small child all covered in blood. It was awful.” Russia said it had destroyed a factory in Dnipro making missile parts. US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has said she had productive meetings with a number of countries on the sidelines of the G20 finance leaders meeting about a proposed price cap on Russian oil. Yellen said her bilateral meetings and the overall G20 sessions in Indonesia focused on the human and economic cost of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the US and other countries “unequivocal in condemning their [Russia’s] shameful actions”. Russia says it is engaged in a “special military operation” in Ukraine. The US treasury department said Yellen met finance leaders from Saudi Arabia, Australia, South Africa, Turkey, and Singapore. She also had dinner with Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, a treasury official said. “On energy costs, I had productive bilateral meetings with over a half dozen of my counterparts where we discussed the merits of a price cap and how it can help us achieve our goals of denying Putin revenue for his war machine, while dampening energy costs,” Yellen told reporters outside the meeting venue. She said a price cap was one of “our most powerful tools to address the high prices people are facing in America and around the world”. Yellen said she also underscored the importance of taking action at the G20 to address the global food security crisis, Reuters reports. Yellen met Saudi finance minister, Mohammed Al-Jadaan, Australian treasurer, Jim Chalmers, South African finance minister, Enoch Godongwana, the deputy prime minister of Singapore, Lawrence Wong, and the Turkish finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, the treasury said. Speaking at a summit of Arab leaders, US president Joe Biden has said the United States “will not walk away” from the Middle East and let “China, Russia or Iran” fill a power vacuum in the region. President Biden delivered his remarks at the Gulf Cooperation Council on the final leg of a four-day tour of the Middle East. Biden’s trip aimed to secure stability and a new axis of cooperation in light of growing concerns over Iran’s leadership and Russian president Vladimir Putin. It also aimed to boost the global flow of oil to bring down rising gas prices. A senior Biden administration official, who briefed reporters before the summit, said Moscow’s efforts to acquire drones from Tehran show that Russia is “effectively making a bet on Iran”. Biden said: We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran. We will seek to build on this moment with active, principled, American leadership. Today, I’m proud to be able to say that the era of land wars in the region, wars that involved huge numbers of American forces, is not under way. Biden announced a $1 bn US aid package to tackle a worsening hunger crisis in the region, and pressed his counterparts to ensure human rights are realised, and allow their citizens to speak openly. “The future will be won by the countries that unleash the full potential of their populations,” he said, adding that people should be allowed to “question and criticise leaders without fear of reprisal”. Crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, convened the summit and hinted that the kingdom could put out more oil than it does currently, something Biden is hoping to see when an existing production deal among OPEC+ member countries expires in September, the Associated Press reports. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has reiterated Germany’s climate protection goals despite growing concerns about the country’s energy supply as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a video published on Saturday, Scholz said: Our goal is that we will be one of the first countries to be CO2-neutral and, at the same time, globally competitive and successful as an economic nation, as an industrial country. We will make sure now that the development of renewable energies finally progresses – wind power at sea, on land solar energy, biomass ... We need all this to produce electricity and hydrogen so that we will have an industrial future without CO2 emissions. We want to accomplish this by 2045. The first cluster of corresponding laws, he added, had begun to be introduced. More laws would follow later this year so that plans could stay on schedule. The federal government, the chancellor said, had initially failed on its plan for an overarching and immediate climate programme and had only presented a strategy for transport and construction at first. He added: It’s bitter that we now have to temporarily use some power plants that we have already shut down because of Russia’s brutal attack on Ukraine. But it’s only for a very short time. Because we are really getting started now and want to do everything we can to fight the climate crisis. Scholz did not comment on energy security for the winter. IMF chief, Kristalina Georgieva, has warned officials from the G20 to take urgent action to combat inflation, warning that the “exceptionally uncertain” global economic outlook could worsen if higher prices persist. Speaking at a G20 meeting of finance officials in Indonesia, Georgieva said Russia’s intensifying war in Ukraine had increased pressure on commodity and energy prices, and that global financial conditions were tightening more than expected. At the same time, pandemic-related disruptions and renewed supply-chain bottlenecks continued to weigh on economic activity. Pressure was mounting on heavily indebted countries, and the debt situation was “deteriorating fast”, she said. In its daily update, the UK’s Ministry of Defence says Russia’s momentum has slowed in recent days, with Ukrainian forces “successful in repulsing Russian attacks since Lysychansk was ceded and the Ukrainian defensive line was shortened and straightened”. Ukraine could sue top US and EU banks over oil and gas trade with Russia that has effectively financed “war crimes”, the Financial Times reports (£). The Ukrainian government has told US and European bank bosses, including JP Morgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon and HSBC’s Noel Quinn, to stop financing companies that trade Russian oil. Oleg Ustenko, economic adviser to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the lenders of “war crimes”. He wrote to them this week asking them to cut ties with groups that trade Russian oil and sell shares in the state-backed oil and gas groups Gazprom and Rosneft. In the letters, also sent to Citigroup and Crédit Agricole, banks were accused of “prolonging” the war by providing credit to companies that ship Russian oil, and were told they would be blocked from participating in the postwar reconstruction of Ukraine. Ustenko said Ukraine’s ministry for justice intends to sue the banks at the International Criminal Court once the war ends, and that Ukraine’s security services were collecting information on financial institutions supporting Russian fossil fuels. “In my view, they are committing war crimes because they are helping the Putin regime in this specific way,” he said, arguing that Russian oil and gas revenues fund the purchase of rockets and missiles used against Ukrainians. Although the ICC cannot investigate or prosecute governments or corporations, it can do so with individuals from those organisations. The Ukrainian government is reportedly particularly angry with JP Morgan because the company published an analyst note warning that a price cap on Russian oil could drive global prices to a “stratospheric” $380 a barrel. Finance ministers of the G20 agreed on most issues, including efforts to tackle food insecurity, despite failing to reconcile differences regarding members’ views about the war in Ukraine, Indonesia said on Saturday. Hosting the meeting in Bali, Indonesia’s finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, said finance leaders also agreed to maintain the spirit of collaboration and multi-lateralism. Russian armed forces have destroyed a factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro that produced parts for Tochka-U ballistic missiles, the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. Russian forces have also shot down three Ukrainian airplanes and two helicopters, the ministry said. The number of people killed after a Russian missile strike on the central Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia on Thursday has risen to 24, after a woman died in hospital of her burn wounds, a Ukrainian official has told Agence France-Presse. Russia claims the strikes – hundreds of kilometres from the front lines – had targeted a meeting of Ukrainian military officials and foreign arms suppliers. Kyiv has denied these claims. UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said he was “appalled” by the attack, while the EU has condemned it as an “atrocity”. Russian energy giant Gazprom said on Saturday that it had asked German group Siemens to return a turbine it has repaired in Canada to ensure the Nord Stream gas pipeline to Europe works. Gazprom began 10 days of scheduled annual maintenance on the pipeline on Monday, with EU countries – particularly gas-reliant Germany – waiting nervously to see if the taps will be turned back on. Moscow had already wound down supplies by 60% in recent weeks, blaming the absence of the turbine. Despite western sanctions on Russia over its military operation in Ukraine, Canada has agreed to grant what it has described as a time-limited and revocable permit for Siemens Canada to allow the machine’s return, AFP reports. But Gazprom claims it has received no guarantees of it being sent back. It said in a statement: On July 15, Gazprom submitted an official request to Siemens to obtain the documents ... to allow the export of the gas turbine engine of the Portovaya station, a critical facility for the Nord Stream gas pipeline. Gazprom is counting on the Siemens group to unconditionally fulfil its obligations relating to the repair and maintenance of gas turbine engines on which the reliability of Nord Stream gas pipeline operations and natural gas deliveries to European consumers rely. The maintenance work on the gas link was scheduled long in advance, but amid hostile relations between Russia and the west, some fear Gazprom might seize the opportunity to cut the supply through the pipeline for good. US teasury secretary, Janet Yellen, told reporters on Saturday that finance officials from the G20 reached strong consensus on many issues, including the need to address a worsening food security crisis, despite differences over Russia’s war in Ukraine that prevented leaders from issuing a joint statement, the Associated Press reports. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has ordered Russian military units operating in Ukraine to step up their operations to prevent strikes on eastern Ukraine and other territories controlled by Russia, the ministry said in a statement on its website on Saturday. It said Shoigu “gave the necessary instructions to further increase the actions of groups in all operational areas in order to exclude the possibility of the Kyiv regime launching massive rocket and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure and residents of settlements in Donbas and other regions,” Reuters reports. Two people were killed in Nikopol on Saturday when heavy Russian shelling hit the southern Ukrainian town, the emergency services and regional governor said. The regional governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Valentyn Reznichenko, said Russia fired 53 Grad rockets at the town, Reuters reports. The White House says Russian officials have visited an airfield in central Iran at least twice in recent weeks to view attack-capable drones for use in its war in Ukraine. Joe Biden’s administration released the intelligence information as he was due to meet leaders of six Arab Gulf countries, as well as Egypt, Jordan and Iraq, for a summit about regional missile and defence capabilities on Saturday. Biden is expected to make a “major statement” at the end of his four-day trip, aimed at “laying out clearly” his strategy for America’s engagement in the Middle East and bolstering a unified new regional axis, largely driven by shared concerns over Iran. The US believes Iran showcased the drones to Russian officials at Kashan airfield on 8 June and 15 July. The administration also released satellite imagery of Shahed-191 and Shahed-129 drones on display and in flight at the airfield while a Russian delegation plane was on the ground, the Associated Press reports. White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the administration has “information that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with several hundred UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles]”. He added: We assess [that] an official Russian delegation recently received a showcase of Iranian attack-capable UAVs. We are releasing these images, captured in June, showing Iranian UAVs that the Russian government delegation saw that day. This suggests ongoing Russian interest in acquiring Iranian attack-capable UAVs. Sullivan said US officials believe the June visit “was the first time a Russian delegation has visited this airfield for such a showcase”. In a phone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, on Friday, Iran’s foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, rejected reports about exporting Iranian drones to Russia, calling them “baseless”. “This sort of claims parallel with Biden’s visit to occupied Palestine, or Israel, are in direction of political intentions and purposes,” the website of Iran’s foreign ministry quoted Amir-Abdollahian as saying. “We oppose any move that could lead to continuation and intensifying conflicts.” President Biden plans to announce on Saturday that the US is committing $1bn in food aid to the Middle East and North Africa amid rising food insecurity caused by the war in Ukraine, a senior official told reporters. The G20 will discuss post-pandemic financial stability, crypto-assets and climate-related financial risks among other topics on Saturday, but sources said the two-day meeting in Bali would probably end without a formal communiqué as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to divide the group. Indonesia urged G20 finance leaders to stay focused on their goals for global economic recovery. Senior western officials, including US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, and Canadian finance minister, Chrystia Freeland, condemned the war on Friday and blasted Russian officials for the economic fallout it has caused, Reuters reports. Ukraine’s finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, who addressed the meeting virtually, called for “more severe, targeted sanctions” against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Western countries have enforced strict sanctions on Russia and accused it of war crimes in Ukraine, which Moscow has denied. Other G20 nations, including China, India and South Africa, have been more muted in their response. “We are in a rudderless moment in the world economy with the G20 paralysed by Putin’s war and the G7 unable to lead on global public goods,” said Kevin Gallagher, director of the Global Development Policy Centre at Boston University. Indonesia’s finance minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, had hoped delegates would address rising commodity prices, the worsening food security crisis and the knock-on effects of the ability of low-income countries to repay debt. A Russian strike hit the north-eastern Ukrainian town of Chuhuiv in Kharkiv overnight, killing three people including a 70-year-old woman and wounding three more, the regional governor said. The strike damaged a residential block, a school and a shop, and rescuers were going through the rubble, governor Oleh Synehubov said on Telegram. Russia denies targeting civilians, Reuters reports. Moldova received about €600m in pledges at a donors conference on Friday, an official said, to help the country overcome rising inflation and the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine. More than 500,000 refugees have fled to Moldova, which borders Ukraine, since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The situation has put a huge strain on resources in Europe’s poorest country, which is looking to forge closer ties with the west, the Associated Press reports. Moldova is also fully dependent on Russian gas supplies – prices of which have increased four-fold in the past year – and is now contending with skyrocketing inflation. The Moldova Support Platform donor meeting was held in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, on Friday and was co-chaired by the Romanian foreign minister, Bogdan Aurescu, his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock, and the French secretary of state for development, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou. Delegates from the G7 and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe also attended the event. Baerbock wrote online after the event: We may not have the power to stop the war in Ukraine today or tomorrow, due to Russia’s brutality. But we do have the means to help a democratic country to prevent it from being crushed by the effects of this war. I’m Jedidajah Otte and taking over this live blog for the next few hours. Russia is using Europe’s largest nuclear power plant as a base to store weapons, including “missile systems”, and shell surrounding areas in Ukraine, an official with Kyiv’s nuclear agency said. The president of the Ukrainian state nuclear agency, Energoatom, said on Friday that the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was “extremely tense”, with up to 500 Russian soldiers controlling the plant, Agence France-Presse reports. “The occupiers bring their machinery there, including missile systems, from which they already shell the other side of the River Dnipro and the territory of Nikopol,” Pedro Kotin said in a televised interview. The nuclear plant in south-western Ukraine has been under Russian control since the early weeks of Moscow’s invasion, though it is still being operated by Ukrainian staff. The most recent attack in the Dnipro region left three dead and 15 wounded, regional governor Valentin Reznichenko said on Telegram. The threat of air raids across most of Ukraine was also raised after strikes were reported in areas far from the frontlines. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Russian objective was to “cause maximum damage to Ukrainian cities”. Russia and Ukraine have described progress towards an agreement to lift a blockade restricting the export of Ukrainian grain. Turkey, which is mediating the talks, said a deal could be signed next week. Asked if that timeline was realistic, a senior Ukrainian official who asked not to be identified told Reuters: “We really hope so. We’re hurrying as fast as we can.” Russia’s defence ministry said an agreement was close, but Moscow’s negotiator cautioned that a grains deal would not lead to a resumption of peace talks. A deal would probably involve inspections of vessels to ensure Ukraine was not bringing in arms, as well as guarantees from western countries that Russia’s own food exports be exempt from sanctions. Moscow welcomed a written clarification from Washington on Thursday that banks, insurers and shippers would not be targeted by sanctions for facilitating shipments of Russian grain and fertiliser. Air raid sirens sounded across Kyiv on Saturday as Russia intensified its long-range bombardment of Ukrainian cities that has killed at least 34 people and wounded many more in the past three days. Late on Friday, Russian missiles hit the central city of Dnipro, killing three people and wounding 15, the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, said. Rockets hit an industrial plant and a street next to it, he said on Telegram. Reuters posted footage on social media showing thick black smoke rising from buildings and burning cars. Eight people were killed and 13 were injured in a string of shellings in 10 places in the eastern region of Donetsk, governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said in a television interview. On Thursday, Kalibr cruise missiles launched from a Russian submarine in the Black Sea hit an office building in Vinnytsia, south-west of Kyiv, in a strike Ukraine said killed at least 23 people. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine. It is approaching 10am in Kyiv. Here’s a summary of the latest developments. At least three people were killed and 15 injured following a missile attack on Friday in Dnipro, central Ukraine. “The rockets hit an industrial plant and a busy street next to it,” the regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, said on his Facebook page. The UK said the Kremlin was “fully responsible” for the death of a British captive in eastern Ukraine. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “I am shocked to hear reports of the death of British aid worker Paul Urey while in the custody of a Russian proxy in Ukraine. Russia must bear the full responsibility for this.” Rescue workers were still clearing debris in the wake of strikes in Vinnytsia, central Ukraine, that killed at least 23 people. A top Ukrainian official has accused Russia of deliberately escalating its deadly attacks on civilian targets. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s national security council, told the Guardian that monitoring of Russian strikes suggested an increased emphasis in recent weeks on terrorising Ukraine’s civilian population. “That’s not my emotions but what our monitoring is telling us.” A wounded soldier who returned from Russian captivity has recounted how Russian forces would threaten Ukrainian soldiers with the death penalty if they refused to cooperate. Denys Piskun, an Azov soldier, told Azov Media: “They said that if you don’t testify, if you don’t cooperate, there will be the death penalty. You all have the death penalty on trial as a Nazi terrorist organisation.” Ukrainian officials have confirmed that the US House of Representatives approved $100m in funding to train Ukrainian pilots to operate American aircraft as part of the National Defence Authorisation Act. The pilots will be trained on F-15 and F-16 jets, according to Andriy Yermak, Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff. Ukraine’s military losses peaked in May, the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in an interview on Friday. Speaking to the BBC, Reznikov said: “The biggest peak of our losses was in May,” with up to 100 soldiers being killed a day. Europe has “shot itself in the lungs” with sanctions aimed at Russia over its war in Ukraine, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said on Friday. Orbán, who has ruled Hungary since 2010 and frequently clashes with Brussels, has been a fierce critic of European Union sanctions on Russian oil. In an address on national radio, Orbán urged EU leaders to change the sanctions policy. Ukrainian rocket strikes have destroyed more than 30 Russian military logistics centres in recent weeks and significantly reduced Russia’s attacking potential, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s defence ministry said on Friday. The official, Oleksandr Motuzianyk, emphasised the role played by US Himars (high mobility artillery rocket systems) , one of several types of long-range weapon supplied by the west to assist Ukraine in the war. M270 long-range multiple rocket launch systems have arrived in Ukraine, the Ukrainian defence minister announced on Friday. “They will be good company for Himars on the battlefield,” Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-12T08:58:28Z","webTitle":"Breaking from China’s clean energy dominance ‘imperative’, US and Australia say after new climate tech deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/12/breaking-from-chinas-clean-energy-dominance-imperative-us-and-australia-say-after-new-climate-tech-deal","fields":{"headline":"Breaking from China’s clean energy dominance ‘imperative’, US and Australia say after new climate tech deal","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The US and Australia have stressed the importance of breaking the near-complete reliance on China for zero emissions technology supplies while signing a new agreement that promises to accelerate the development of climate solutions. In a joint press conference in Sydney, the US energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, and the Australian climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announced a “net zero technology acceleration partnership”, including an initial focus on long-duration energy storage and digitising power grids. They said the agreement was motivated in part by the need for a clean energy and critical mineral supply chain that did not depend as much on China, which is responsible for about 80% of solar energy technology manufacturing. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), it is expected to reach 95% by 2025. Granholm compared the risk of relying on China for clean technology to the west’s over-dependence on Russian fossil fuels – a mistake that sparked a global energy crisis after it invaded Ukraine. “I worry that China has big-footed a lot of the technology and supply chains that could make us vulnerable if we don’t develop our own supply chains,” she said. “From an energy security point of view, it is imperative that nations that share the same values develop our own supply chains, not just for the climate, but for our energy security. “We’ve seen what happens when we rely too much on one entity for our source of fuel, and we don’t want that to happen – so to diversify those energy sources and to link up with partners is part of our energy security.” Bowen agreed. “It’s good for our own economies and it’s good for our national security to have supply chains among ourselves, but also amongst friends and allies,” he said. The Australian minister said the partnership would “work to ensure critical minerals supply chains are secure and resilient”. That meant ramping up production, processing and manufacturing capacity, he said. “The partnership is a commitment to make climate change a centrepiece of our alliance with the US,” he said. Granholm said the switch to renewables could be “the greatest peace plan of all” as no country could be “held hostage” over its access to solar and wind resources. “They have not ever been weaponised, nor will they be,” she said. The Australia-US partnership included few details, but said the countries would also focus on supporting the integration of variable renewable energy and the development of hydrogen and carbon dioxide removal, including direct air capture technology. It was revealed on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum, co-hosted by the Australian government and the IEA. A common theme among speakers at the forum was the importance of focusing on renewable energy to address the crisis caused by Russia’s attack on Ukraine. The IEA’s executive director, Fatih Birol, said the world was in the middle of “the first global energy crisis” due to its over-reliance on Russian oil, gas and coal. He said it might get worse as the northern hemisphere entered winter, but expressed hope it could lead to governments accelerating the shift towards renewable energy. Birol said about 40% of energy policies across the globe were introduced as a response to the oil crisis of the 1970s. He was “very hopeful” that the move to clean energy would be accelerated in a similar way now. He said solar power had grown dramatically across the globe because it was cheap, and that people who argued that renewable energy policy was in part to blame for the crisis were “absolutely wrong”. “Factually and, in my view, ethically, this is very wrong and misleading,” he said. The forum was opened by Anthony Albanese arguing Australia had rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partner”. The prime minister later told reporters it was time for Australia to “stop the nonsense”, “wake up” and work across the political divide to end the climate wars. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese said the latest round of catastrophic flooding made the case to get on with legislating a more ambitious policy. He said Labor would attempt to legislate its medium-term emissions target when parliament resumed, and if MPs or senators chose to vote against the legislation they would be “held accountable for it”. The prime minister said he was open to “sensible amendments” but not “game playing about figures plucked from the air”, and reiterated that Labor intended to stick with its target of a 43% emissions cut by 2030 compared with 2005 that it had modelled last year. The Greens and some independents have called for a higher target – ranging from 50% to 75% – based on advice from climate scientists."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-12T08:39:09Z","webTitle":"End of rapid Covid test and telehealth subsidies criticised – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jul/12/australia-news-live-covid-hospitalisations-anthony-albanese-sydney-energy-forum-pacific-islands-forum-fiji-kiribati-china-queensland-monkeypox","fields":{"headline":"End of rapid Covid test and telehealth subsidies criticised – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"With that, we will wrap up the blog for the evening. We’ll be back first thing tomorrow, with all the latest from Fiji and closer to shore. Here are today’s major developments: With the Pacific Islands Forum underway, Australia has resisted calls from neighbours for no new gas or coal projects, saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions. In other forum news, the Australian and US governments have signed a deal they say will help accelerate zero emissions technology, including long duration storage and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The announcement was made by the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, announced the federal program providing 10 free rapid antigen tests every three months for concession card holders will end in July. The opposition’s health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called for the health advice underpinning the decision to be released. The announcement has been criticised by health bodies including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia. Australia reported 58 Covid deaths on Tuesday, as both NSW and Victoria reduced the reinfection period from 12 down to four weeks. And Australia’s privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into retail giants Bunnings and Kmart over their use of facial recognition technology in stores. A gentle reminder we’re still in a pandemic: Man dies in Fitzroy in Melbourne A man has died in Fitzroy this afternoon after a fatal shooting occurred, Victoria Police say. Emergency services were called to Brunswick Street about 4.15pm this afternoon where the man was located with life threatening injuries. Police believe he was involved in an altercation with a number of people at a car parked on Brunswick Street before he was fatally shot. Witnesses called triple zero and ambulance crews tried to treat the man, who is yet to be formally identified, but he later died at the scene. Police have cordoned off the area and a crime scene has been established. Victoria police: Detectives are still working to determine the exact circumstances of the incident but at this stage it appears to be a targeted incident with the parties involved possibly known to each other. Police would like to speak anyone who witnessed anything or has CCTV or dashcam vision of the incident. Covid admissions up 53% in Victorian hospitals in past two weeks The Victorian government has released more information on today’s Covid update. Health authorities say there’s been a 53% increase in the numbers of Victorians in hospital with the virus in the past two weeks, as BA.4/BA.5 becomes the dominant strain circulating in the community. At the same time, the third wave of Omicron isn’t expected to peak until August. The Victorian government joined New South Wales in reducing the period of reinfection from 12 weeks to 28 days, and has pushed for Victorians to get their booster and wear masks in high risk settings. Case and hospitalisation trends are increasing in Victoria. This is in line with similar patterns globally and in other Australian jurisdictions, which have seen a significant rise in the number of people hospitalised with Covid-19 in recent weeks. What is GDP? Our latest News glossary video explains When a country’s economy is discussed in the news, you often hear a number called GDP, or gross domestic product, thrown around. But what does it actually mean, and is it gross? In this episode of News glossary, Matilda Boseley explains the meaning of GDP and how it reflects economies in Australia and abroad. PM defends the scrapping of pandemic leave payments Anthony Albanese has defended scrapping pandemic leave payments, laying the blame at the feet of the previous government, AAP reports. The payments for workers who needed to spend time away from work while they isolated ended on 30 June. But there have been calls for the payments to be reinstated as Covid case numbers and hospitalisations increase across the country, driven by new, infectious sub-variants. The prime minister, who today received his fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose, said he would not bring back the payments due to the need for the government to rein in spending. The new government had inherited the former’s decision to end the payments and $1tn of debt, he said: They are circumstances which my government faces … there are a range of things we would like to do, but we intend to be fiscally responsible in how we deal with issues. As case numbers rise across the country, the chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said hospitals could hold back some elective surgery due to the strain on the system. He said the emergence of influenza for the first time in three years in Australia was making the situation worse. The health minister, Mark Butler, said Covid cases were not likely to peak nationally for at least four weeks during the third wave of infections. While case numbers have increased and calls have grown for mask mandates to return, the prime minister said he would follow health advice on the issue. The epidemiologist Catherine Bennett told Sky News educating the public about the risks of exposure to Covid would be more helpful than reintroducing a mask mandate. Australia has resisted calls from the Pacific for no new gas or coal projects, saying it was not responsible for other countries’ emissions, in a move that could cause tensions as Pacific leaders meet in Suva this week. A key demand of Pacific nations – that Australia commit to no new coal or gas projects – will remain a point of difference between Australia and Pacific nations, as Anthony Albanese arrives in Fiji on Wednesday ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting. Labor late off the mark on foot-and-mouth disease, Littleproud says David Littleproud just appeared on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing to discuss the growing threat of foot-and-mouth disease. As if we didn’t need more things to worry about. Murray Watt, the federal minister for agriculture, has backed the expansion of electronic tagging to improve tracing of livestock to combat the risk of disease, but says it’s up to state governments to mandate it. Littleproud says he’s been too late off the mark. While I welcome the fact Murray’s going to Indonesia, we would have hoped probably last week he might have picked the phone up and tried to build on what we’d already put in place in Indonesia and Timor and Papua New Guinea. When this hit, we – not only with foot-and-mouth disease, but with lumpy skin disease – we put biosecurity officers and vets into those countries to try and ... help. What we’re concerned about is there’s no decisive action on some other measures that could be taken ... there are hundreds of people coming from Indonesia back into Australia every day. Anthony Albanese has the Australia-themed sportswear on but he’s missing the face mask flag. Throwback: Hydrogen project will need government support, energy forum hears In the closing panel of the Sydney Energy Forum, Yoshinori Kanehana of Kawasaki Heavy Industries says greater government support will be needed to progress the Japanese-Australian Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project (HESC) – an engineering milestone that makes liquefied hydrogen from coal. HESC was “so successful because of the big support from the Japanese and Australian government”, he says. Under the $500m HESC pilot project, hydrogen will be made in Victoria’s LaTrobe valley from brown coal and transported aboard a purpose-built ship to Japan, where it will be burned in coal-fired power plants. Kanehana says: At the beginning, the cost [of liquid hydrogen] may be more expensive compared to fossil fuels ... So we need operating expense help from the government. Large, vast quantity production of hydrogen will reduce the cost. This cannot be done by a single company or single country. Some researchers have raised concerns that the project could increase emissions and lock in a new fossil fuel industry. Fiji’s PM urges Pacific unity but respects Kiribati withdrawal from forum In Suva, Fiji’s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, says the Pacific is “most resilient as a family”, while respecting the wishes of Kiribati and its government to withdraw from the forum. The people and government of Kiribati have always been and will remain part of our Pacific family. Australia’s privacy watchdog has launched an investigation into retail giants Bunnings and Kmart over their use of facial recognition technology in stores. Consumer group Choice last month revealed Bunnings and Kmart were using the technology – which captures images of people’s faces from video cameras as a unique faceprint that is then stored and can be compared with other faceprints – in what the companies say is a move to protect customers and staff and reduce theft in selected stores. Choice reported the two companies along with the The Good Guys to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), raising questions over how people’s personal information was being handled through the technology. The OAIC announced on Tuesday it had decided to launch an investigation into the personal information handling practices of Bunnings and Kmart and how they use the facial recognition technology in store. The Good Guys paused its use of the technology following preliminary inquiries from the OAIC. The OAIC said: In line with the OAIC’s Privacy regulatory action policy, no further comment will be made while the investigations are ongoing. Comment has been sought from Bunnings and Kmart. Environment protection agency needed to help Australia ‘do better’, Plibersek says Finally, Plibersek is asked about the State of the Environment Report, to be released on 19 July and expected to be “grim reading”. The report was received by the previous government in December and not made public before the federal election. Question: What would a standalone environment protection agency, the likes of which you have promised, what would it do to improve any of the findings in that report and by when? Plibersek: This is a report that is months overdue ... the fact we’ve kept it secret before the last election tells you a lot about the contents of the report. I don’t want to disclose everything today. I will tell you that this report shows that there’s been a substantial decline in a number of key areas of our environment. We need to do better. We absolutely need to do better to protect our landscapes, our threatened species, to protect the environment for all Australians. We’ve spoken about an environmental protection agency because it’s a simple fact that the EPBC Act ... is not doing its job particularly well. It’s not protecting the environment in the best way and it’s also quite slow and cumbersome. Labor ‘determined’ to invest in shift to renewable despite global energy crisis Plibersek is asked whether a warning from the visiting International Energy Agency chief that the global energy crisis may get worse before it gets better could hinder the federal government’s 43% energy reduction commitment. She says Labor remains “determined” to invest in the transition to cleaner energy. I think it’s plain to everyone that the conflict in Ukraine and other uncertainties are having an impact on energy markets around the world but it doesn’t change the fact that particularly in the medium to longer term, the best way of bringing down power prices is to see more renewables entering the market. I think this is a reminder that this transition is a huge opportunity for Australia. Of course, it has short-term difficulties, and I’m not for a moment discounting the impact that higher energy prices right now are having. This is the result of 10 years of ... neglect by the previous government. Short term, then, is there a lot of “pressure placed on [her] shoulders” to approve new coal and gas projects? (Presumably as a sort of “band-aid fix” despite the fact coalmines take a reasonable amount of time to start up and shut down.) I don’t think any serious commentator is saying that we’ve got to stop exporting Australian coal and gas tomorrow. I don’t think anybody serious is saying that. It will be part of our energy mix for some time to come and part of the global energy mix for some time. What we need to do is make sure at the same time we develop the economic opportunities of renewable energy. Australia in talks with Pacific on 2029 UN climate conference, Plibersek says The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, follows Conroy on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing. Still on the Pacific Islands Forum, she’s asked how much thought the federal government has given to the 2029 UN climate conference and the involvement of smaller Pacific nations. Plibersek says: We’ve started to have conversations with our Pacific neighbours about the sort of involvement they’d like to see. I met with the Samoan environment minister today, and last week when I was in Lisbon I met with a number of Pacific leaders and ambassadors from Pacific nations, and there’s a fair degree of enthusiasm for this proposal. Obviously no region in the world is more impacted by climate change than the Pacific. So, there’s a very strong interest from Pacific nations to remind the world again of what an existential issue this is for them. Australia is supporting Vanuatu’s voice on climate, Conroy says Conroy is asked about the push from Vanuatu for the international court of justice (ICJ) to seek referrals on countries that don’t meet their climate change obligations. No Pacific island nation is a party to the ICJ, yet Conroy has indicated he’s in support of the proposal. Is Australia “backing the wrong horse”? We’re backing a process. We’re being very supportive of the Vanuatu government’s efforts to get a resolution passed by the UN general assembly, that would refer a number of questions to the international court of justice for their deliberations ... we make it clear that the UNFCCC negotiations is the primary focus for achieving climate action around the globe but are supportive of the process that Vanuatu has been pursuing ... we haven’t agreed on the resolution. We’re yet to see the questions that the government of Vanuatu intends to put to the UN general assembly and we will reserve our position until we see the questions, like every other nation. This is just an example of where under the new Australian government rather than stifling climate action, rather than trying to bully and intimidate Pacific countries to stop them talking about climate action, we’re supporting their voice in multilateral forums because is the number one security threat to the Pacific and we’re very committed to being part of the solution, rather than being part of the problem. Pacific Islands Forum focused on ‘rebuilding unity’, Conroy says Now to China, “looming large” over discussions at the forum. Conroy: We made a decision to not include dialogue partners in this PIF, but the focus was on concentrating on rebuilding PIF unity. So that’s why the vast majority of the program with limited exceptions ... focused on Pacific Island Forum leaders and foreign ministers talking to each other, working on how we can renew and energise the PIF architecture. Why, then, did the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, make a pitch to members? There are some limited and specific interventions that the chair has allowed. And obviously that was a decision that the prime minister of Fiji made. So you have to go to the Fiji government as to why they did that. There are limited exceptions to that focus. The overwhelming focus is on rebuilding unity. Australia’s aid to Kiribati has no strings attached, Conroy says Asked what more Australia could do to entice Kiribati back, Conroy acknowledged it was “important that the discussions are being led by Fiji” as the chair of the Pacific Islands Forum. Yesterday, Australia committed $2m in additional assistance to help the island nation through drought. It’s counter productive for Australia to be too forward leaning. That decision around the aid package is not conditional on Kiribati rejoining the Pacific Islands Forum. We don’t deliver aid like that. We don’t deliver aid with strings attached, unlike other countries interested in this region. Pacific minister Pat Conroy on Kiribati rejoining the Pacific Islands Forum Pacific minister Pat Conroy is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, wearing a lovely shirt. Asked whether Kiribati may rejoin the Pacific Islands Forum, he replied: The leaders’ dialogue had a lot of strong language around commitment to unity and the importance of a strong united Pacific voice. That is a positive. Importantly, several Micronesian leaders were strong in the need to implement the Suva agreement and rebuild the architecture of the Pacific Islands Forum as the central architecture for the region. I wouldn’t say that I’m more optimistic about Kiribati rejoining. I’m not more pessimistic, but I think it’s one where we have to let Kiribati go through their paces, acknowledging today is their national day ... Pacific unity is vital for our shared interests. That’s what Micronesian leaders said ... and something we’re working towards. Controversial Queensland New Acland coalmine should stay closed, activists say My thought has well and truly been provoked by this Fijian cloud. On the topic of climate change, the Queensland Resources Council is lobbying the state government to expand a controversial New Acland open-cut coalmine, which would extract some seven million tonnes of coal per year and extend its life for more than a decade. Paul King from Oakey Coal Action Alliance said the mine was currently closed and should stay that way. This controversial mine expansion will risk prime agricultural land and water resources and goes against the science that tells us emissions must rapidly decrease to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. During our current food crisis, it doesn’t make sense to destroy prime agricultural land and put up to 10m litres of milk production at risk by reopening this mine. The new mining project will also use up to 1.3m litres of water a day, draining local water bores. Farmers in this area are completely reliant on this groundwater source. Local farmers and landholders are calling on the government to reject this licence and put an end to this dangerous project once and for all. RACGP backs continuation of free RATs for concession card holders The RACGP is backing the continuation of free rapid antigen tests for concession card holders following the federal government’s announcement the funding would be cut. It comes amid the rollback of other Covid measures including 70 telehealth items introduced during the pandemic. Its president Karen Price says Covid “is not disappearing anytime soon” and we “must do more to reduce community transmission”. Government urged to consider shared infrastructure at Sydney Energy Forum Amanda Lacaze of Lynas has pleaded to the government to think about shared infrastructure between critical mineral and battery production at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Shared infrastructure is by definition going to be lower cost. My plead to the government is to think about shared infrastructure for these value-add activities. In Kalgoorlie, Western Australia – home to a Lyans mineral refining facility – it is “about water”, she explains. At the same time, it is “equally about minerals, sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid ... it is about building the ecosystem and the capability”. If we do that, we can win ... [it] allows us to be cross-competitive. Spike in solar panel prices puts pressure on increased demand Prof Martin Green of UNSW acknowledges a spike in solar panel prices at the Sydney Energy Forum. Solar panel prices “hit an all time low in 2020”, he explains. Following a shortage in pure silicon material used in production following disturbances at three major factories, prices have “gone up about 40% per watt per solar panel”. With the “important role of solar” for climate change mitigation being increasingly “publicised”, Green points to “increased demand right at the time supply is struggling”. Disgraced former Ipswich mayor’s name stripped from bridge and street signs Ipswich mayor Teresa Harding says “common sense” has “prevailed” after the council voted to strip the name of jailed sex offender and former mayor Paul Pisasale from a bridge and street west of Brisbane. Pisasale was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison in 2020 after pleading guilty to more than 30 offences. Seven of nine councillors voted to remove Pisasale’s name from the council assets on Tuesday after a decision to leave the names unchanged sparked community backlash earlier this month. Pisasale’s former deputy mayor, councillor Paul Tully, and another fellow member of the former council, councillor Sheila Ireland abstained from the vote. On Facebook, Harding thanked residents for relaying their concerns and said their voices had “been heard loud and clear”. The council has authorised its chief executive to work with the Yuggera Ugarapul people native title holders to come up with new names in line with community sentiment. A council spokesperson said in the meantime, the bridge will be unnamed and street signs with the existing name at Yamanto will remain in place. The opposition’s health spokeswoman, Anne Ruston, has called on the federal government to release the health advice underpinning its decision to end free Covid tests for concession card holders. She raised concern that this followed a government decision to end more than 70 different telehealth services, and the winding up of pandemic leave payments despite Australia entering into a devastating third wave of the virus. She told Guardian Australia: At a time when we are seeing a massive increase in the number of Covid cases and cost of living pressures impacting very seriously on Australians, Mr Butler must outline what expert advice has formed the basis of his decision. The pattern of behaviour in the Albanese government’s health response to Covid is worrying. There have already been cuts to 70 telehealth services, cuts to the pandemic leave disaster payments, and now cuts to the access of rapid antigen testing for concession card holders. You would have to question the timing of these cuts when it is so important that Australians are mindful of this new, dangerous wave of Covid going through our communities. Queensland monkeypox case poses ‘no general risk’ In better news, a monkeypox case reported in Queensland yesterday evening – the state’s first – poses “no general risk” and no sleep lost. Which is a relief, as there are already enough things to stay up fretting over. Number of Queensland health staff off work equal to state’s first Covid wave The number of health staff off work in Queensland is nearly equal to the state’s first wave earlier in the year. Nevertheless, there’s been no move on a tightening of restrictions, with the chief health officer acknowledging keeping Covid off cruise ships is “incredibly difficult” following a major outbreak. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia [PSA] national president Dr Fei Sim said the federal government’s announcement that the Covid-19 rapid test concessional access program will not be extended beyond July will put vulnerable Australians at risk. She said it also sends the wrong message to the public: The pandemic is not over, and the threat of serious illness is still there for many vulnerable people in our communities. Testing remains a vital part of our Covid-19 response. While recognising that our approach to test-trace-isolate has changed since the program was launched in January, testing with even mild symptoms remains an expectation of everyone in the community. She said with most states and territories adopting advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee [AHPPC] to move from a three-month to a 28-day immunity period, access to testing will be vital, especially for vulnerable groups who’ve relied on the concessional program. Earlier on Tuesday the Australian Medical Association [AMA] and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners [RACGP] said vulnerable people will be most impacted by the end of Medicare-subsidised extended telehealth consultations and a range of other telehealth items. Both organisations have written to health minister Mark Butler urging him to meet with them and discuss the changes. AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid has said: These changes undermine the ability of patients to access their doctors, and in particular for GPs to prescribe antivirals for Covid-positive patients and will lead to costs elsewhere in the health system, including in overstretched hospitals. This decision means telephone access to doctors will be significantly limited, hitting vulnerable patients hardest, including those who do not have access to high bandwidth internet and those who can’t operate the necessary IT systems. Many thanks to the lovely Natasha May for keeping us informed today. I’ll be with you for the rest of this fine Tuesday. Handing you over to the wonderful Caitlin Cassidy who’ll be helming the blog for the rest of the day! Sydney Energy Forum hears how Taiwan has no oil and gas Naiwen Marina Hsu of the Taiwanese branch of a fund management company specialising in energy infrastructure assets, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, told the panel at the Sydney Energy Forum today how Taiwan has “no oil and gas, at all”. In “looking to build out renewable energy”, the Chinese government has declared a net zero goal, she says. In response, “the buildout [of renewable energy manufacturing] has to be much more aggressive”. From zero to one [Taiwan] is building an offshore wind industry. 25km off the coast of Taiwan, commercialised offshore wind turbines are being constructed. [The Chinese government] just launched three rounds to build out to 15GW of offshore wind. A steady and a planned, staged policy department, together with capable private capital going in ... [and] experienced developers giving back to society by building up local industry. Emergency service volunteers being trained to fill Victoria’s ambulance staff shortage Fifty of Victoria’s fire and emergency service volunteers are being trained to provide first aid as the state’s ambulance staff are in extreme shortage. The training comes as Ambulance Victoria on Sunday issued its seventh code red emergency in as many months. Queensland energy minister calls for Australia to think about value rather than cost when it comes to renewables Mick de Brenni, the Queensland minister for energy, renewables and hydrogen, emphasises thinking about spending on renewable energy as “about value ... not about cost” on a panel at the Sydney Energy Forum. Value when looking at the cost of what we need to build includes consideration of reliability, quality, deliverability ... valuing the supply chains, the new business and job opportunities we create. Value means measuring the opportunity cost of not acting to develop your own capacity. It is a real threat ... if we are pushing for just low cost. De Brenni says this was the “shift” in the Queendsland government’s mindset when “thinking about investments” in renewables. NSW flood recovery and clean-up continues Agencies continue to help flood victims clean up their homes and streets. Fire and Rescue NSW said that fire crews have been cleaning up seaweed piled up in backyards at Chittaway Bay, on the Central Coast, in addition to the more usual activities of mopping up water, hosing out silt and moving ruined furniture from flood-damaged homes. At Sackville, on the Hawkesbury River, the agency has deployed its Hytrans Bulk Water Transfer unit to help pump large quantities of water out of affected areas. They’ve released a video showing some of these efforts. Agency running NDIS doesn’t understand First Nations cultural practices, inquiry hears The agency running the National Disability Insurance Scheme doesn’t understand the importance of Return to Country cultural practices to First Nations people, an inquiry has heard. The disability royal commission is this week exploring the experiences of First Nations people navigating the NDIS in remote communities over five days of hearings in Alice Springs. Beth Walker, the Northern Territory public guardian, told the inquiry the agency failed to understand the significance of Return to Country trips and did not include a specific line item for funding them in NDIS packages. She said: The NDIA doesn’t really get the importance of those Return to Country trips. They are viewed a little bit like a holiday rather than a cultural connection. That’s really important to First Nations people. And, again, there’s no specific line item in the NDIA pricing guide that covers Return to Country trips and so we are often trying to manoeuvre around people’s day to day services and pull out little bits or use other areas to fund the Return to Country trip. Walker said the logistics of planning such trips could be “extensive” because of a person’s disability needs, including mobility issues and the need for one or multiple support workers. So they are not necessarily easy things to plan, depending on the needs of the person. But the benefit and the joy that you see on someone’s face of returning and being with family is – there’s really no words to describe that. Walker also said she was concerned by cuts to the NDIS plans of some of the individuals for whom she acts as public guardian. Guardian Australia has previously reported cuts to funding packages in the NT, particularly for accomodation funding. She said: I think what I am seeing as public guardian is the winding back of people’s plans and it seems to have a financial driver rather than the needs of the person at the centre of what’s happening. And that really concerns me. Walker is the guardian for 337 First Nations people in the NT, 203 of whom living in remote communities. The inquiry continues. PM gets fourth Covid vaccine jab The prime minister Anthony Albanese rolled up his sleeve today for a fourth dose of the Covid-19 vaccine before he departs for Fiji to attend the Pacific Islands Forum. Albanese is part of the over 50 age bracket that Atagi recommended receive an additional dose of the vaccine last week, as hospitalisations surge across the country amid another Omicron wave. Since yesterday Australians over the age of 30 have been eligible for the extra jab. Climate action must be ‘fairly shared’ across Indo-Pacific, Bowen says Chris Bowen, minister for climate change and energy, urges the Indo-Pacific region could “lead the world in clean energy transformations” in his address to the Sydney Energy Forum. Pointing to battery, steal, hydrogen and solar manufacturing, Bowen says the region “can become the key global source of the raw materials, products and technologies that are vital to reducing emissions”. Australia is the biggest producer of lithium in the world, with 49% of global production in 2020. With battery demand expected to grow at an incredible rate over the next decade, Australia can seize the opportunity to become a critical mineral powerhouse ... Japan is setting the foundations for new clean energy supply chains in our region, investing significantly in hydrogen production, use and transport technologies. Japan and the Indo-Pacific are leading the world in hydrogen ... and ... India is on the path to becoming a solar giant, underpinned by the scale of their manufacturing sector, and spurred on by their ambitious target of reaching 100 GW of solar this year. Acknowledging the frequency and severity of both fires and floods sweeping Australia, Bowen says action on climate is both an “environmental obligation” and “in our region’s own economic interest”. It is also vital that no one is left behind. Bowen urges that the economic costs and benefits of “real action” on climate change must be “fairly shared” across the Indo-Pacific. We need to work with the leaders of emerging economies to understand and address their concerns. Bowen points to the Albanese government’s $15bn National Reconstruction Fund, aimed to “harness Australia’s renewable potential”. It will focus on production of green, low-cost materials for wind turbines and solar PV, as well as the broader economy ... [and] strengthen emerging sectors such as hydrogen and battery production, supported by hydrogen hubs and an Australian Made Battery Precinct. Bowen’s address comes as Australia signs a deal with the US to accelerate deployment of zero emissions technology, as covered by Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor Adam Morton in the blog. First Nations people lobby to change culturally insensitive name of Queensland creek In Queensland, the Iningai and Bidjara people have successfully lobbied to change the name of Longreach’s Black Gin creek, deemed culturally insensitive to traditional owners. Bidjara man Trevor Robinson is lobbying to change the name to Watyakan, an Iningai word meaning women’s creek. In my view, not only is the current name intolerable to First Nations people but also to the wider community, especially women. State resources minister Scott Stewart said there was strong support for the name change from local council. This creek is a site of cultural importance to the traditional owners and custodians of the land and the current name does not give the site the respect it deserves. The ... government will continue to work with First Nations peoples to formally rename insensitive sites. The existing name first appeared on maps from about 1887 and covers the watercourse as it journeys from south-east of Ilfracombe to the Thompson River. Consultation with community on the name change will run until September. Australia must ‘walk the talk’ on climate, Greens leader says The Greens are pushing for the federal government to can new coal and gas projects as the Pacific Forum gets underway. Greens leader Adam Bandt said Australia must “walk the talk” on climate to bolster its position in the region. If we don’t change course ... big talk will mean nothing to our regional neighbours. We’ve promised our partners in the region that we’ll act to keep warming under 1.5 degrees, but Labor’s current climate target will make that impossible. A weak emissions reduction of 43% is consistent with at least two degrees of warming. Even the weak target of 43% by 2030 will be impossible if Labor doesn’t urgently halt new gas projects at Scarborough and the Beetaloo Basin. Pacific Island leaders want 75% and no new coal and gas because that’s what it takes to keep warming under 1.5 degrees. They’re not alone: According to applications lodged under national environment laws, the federal government could face decisions on whether to approve up to 27 coal mining developments. The RBA has released a nifty little snapshot of Australia’s economy. Millennials, avert your eyes at the average price of residential dwellings. The Australian and US governments have signed a deal that they say will help accelerate the development and deployment of zero emissions technology, including long duration storage and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The announcement by Australia’s climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, and the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm, was made on the sidelines of the Sydney Energy Forum, covered elsewhere in the blog by Rafqa Touma. Few details of agreement were released, but Bowen said it would put dealing with climate change at the centre of the relationship between the countries. Both ministers suggested it should ultimately make the two countries less reliant on Chinese clean energy supply chains. The Chinese control about 80% of the global manufacturing supply chain for solar energy. Granholm said the two countries would “work together to unlock critical advances in long-duration storage, grid integration, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and critical minerals and materials.” Bowen said the partnership was “a huge milestone in ramping up the US and Australia’s shared commitment to ambitious climate action and energy security”. It prioritises not just development but deployment of the critical technologies that will underpin economic opportunity in the energy transformation of our two countries. The announcement of the Australia-US net zero technology acceleration partnership coincided with the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the CSIRO and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to work together developing clean energy tech. New canine member added to Queensland fire and rescue squad With the many recent natural disasters, Australia’s emergency services are more vital than ever. Fire and Rescue Queensland earlier today introduced the public to Bolt, their smallest qualified urban search and rescue canine. The South Australian police made an April fools’ joke last year claiming to be introducing sausage dogs into its ranks, but Bolt appears to be a legitimate member of the Queensland service. Here are the latest coronavirus numbers from around Australia today, as the country records at least 58 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 1,174 In hospital: 140 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 20 Cases: 10,806 In hospital: 2,049 (with 58 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 481 In hospital: 39 (with no people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 15 Cases: 6,768 In hospital: 860 (with 12 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 3,668 In hospital: 246 (with 6 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 1,812 In hospital: 29 (with 2 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 16 Cases: 10,627 In hospital: 737 (with 39 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 3 Cases: 6,000 In hospital: 297 (with 6 people in ICU) There were 6,000 new cases in the last reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. Calls for move to greater electricity use at Sydney Energy Forum Claudio Facchin of Hitachi Energy, urges the need to move “move 20% to 50-70% electricity” in the grid on a panel at today’s Sydney Energy Forum. He says there is comfort in “a lot of the technology needed to make that shift” being “available today” and there being “a lot of electrification across industries” on the “demand side”. Facchin says “we need do more to make everyone understand that the entire electricity system” will need to change. The scale that is needed and the pace at which we need to deliver that technology ... requires a lot of innovation. Facchin points to that innovation in “how we partner, look at business models, how we innovate across the entire supply chain, how we create policies and a regulatory environment to deploy this technology [across countries and regionally].” There were 3,668 new cases in the last reporting period, and six people are in intensive care. India’s energy supply chain discussed at Sydney Energy Forum Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power acknowledges the issues that come with India’s growth on a panel at today’s Sydney Energy Forum. As India grows, inevitably energy consumption will continue to grow. 70% of India’s total power comes from the coal sector, with 10% from renewables, Sinha explains. A lot of the power sector still sits in the hands of government controlled entities. How policy making evolves in a sector that moves very rapidly ... is a challenge. Following on from discussion earlier this morning on China’s monopoly over the solar panel manufacturing market, Sinha says “we cannot keep importing solar panels”, urging away from dependence on “another part of the world”. India has to create manufacturing domestically. There were 1,174 new cases in the last reporting period, and three people are in intensive care. First images from Nasa’s James Webb space telescope reveal ancient galaxies Nasa today released an image showing the deepest glimpse into the universe we’ve ever seen. It’s the first image from the James Webb telescope, the most powerful telescope ever put into space. The image shows a cluster of some of the earliest formed galaxies after the big bang 13.8bn years ago. On China’s monopoly of solar power manufacturing And an audience question brings us back to the topic of China’s monopoly on solar power manufacturing at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Sumant Sinha of ReNew Power explains China’s manufacturing advantage of companies’ access to cheaper land, and capitol cost being a bit lower. He says the “ecosystem you build” around manufacturing of solar panels – from glass panels to glue – is key to “bringing down logistic costs”. All of that gives you a significant competitive advantage. China crossed that quite some time ago. Any country that wants to start has to start from zero. That manufacturing ecosystem “needs to get to scale before you get to a comparative end product”. Sinha warns of a 25-35% cost disadvantage for a new country entering the market. Will people be willing to pay more to support a new country manufacturing [to diversify away from China]? This is difficult ... because people want access to the cheapest power. Hydrogen could step in to reduce reliance on gas, CSIRO boss says Malcolm Turnbull, former prime minister of Australia, puts forward a question about long duration energy storage at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Dr Larry Marshall of CSIRO says, to address that question, “we need to go beyond the grid”. We need fuel to transfer massive amounts of energy quickly. Marshall warns of an expectation that a reliance on gas will persist until 2040. But he is optimistic that hydrogen will emerge as the solution. Hydrogen will be able to step in and fill in the gap to reduce the amount of storage needed. Equivalent to Europe’s use of hydro electric and nuclear energy, “we think we can do ... with hydrogen in Australia”. There were 6,768 new cases in the last reporting period, and 12 people are in intensive care. Australia needs ‘innovation’ to make clean energy transition Dr Larry Marshall of CSIRO says “innovation is key” in the transition to clean energy technologies on a panel at the Sydney Energy Forum today. Our biggest problem [in Australia] is our innovation dilemma. We can’t make this massive transition, bigger than anything any of us have ever lived through, if we can’t fix that. ‘Huge opportunity’ for Australia to cooperate with US on defence, Marles says Earlier, at the Centre for Strategic International Studies the defence minister Richard Marles also spoke about the possibility of greater development cooperation with the United States. Marles said development was an aspect of the US-Australia alliance that is “underdone” because there “is not the same deep, organic interoperability as in other areas such as defence”. To be glass half full about it – there’s huge opportunity to develop this and do more. Marles then gave an extended analogy about how US naval patrols around its territories including Hawaii traversed the exclusive economic zones of other countries, and could alert them to illegal fishing from “grey” vessels “pillaging” their fish. He proposed an audit of existing activities in the Pacific to determine how these could help Pacific neighbours. Bridi Rice, the chief executive of Development Intelligence Lab, said: The Australia-US alliance is missing a critical dimension for security and stability in the Pacific – development. It’s about time we heard a defence leader talking about development challenges of our region and as a serious and valuable space for US-Australian cooperation. While the political commitment to US and Australian development cooperation in the Pacific has ramped up, we fall woefully short when it comes to practice. We don’t have shared assessments, joint cooperation on the ground is scarce. That has got to change if we are going to have an effective alliance in the Pacific. Update on the second day of hearings held by the disability royal commission in Alice Springs focused on NDIS for First Nations people A First Nations woman with disability living has told of a lack of support in Tennant Creek, saying her life has become more difficult since the national disability insurance scheme arrived in town. Emily, who grew up in Mount Isa, Queensland, but now lives in the Northern Territory, had a stroke in her twenties in 2003 that left her unable to speak. She told the disability royal commission she uses an electric scooter to get around, but that her front door was too small to bring it inside. This meant she needed to charge the scooter outside by running a cable through a window. She said she was concerned her scooter would be stolen, as had occurred to others in the town. Emily also said she had an NDIS plan but that no one had told her how to use her funds. There is no NDIS office in Tennant Creek, meaning she needs to go to a Centrelink office to discuss NDIS issues. That office is not wheelchair accessible, so she can only enter using a walking stick. When asked by counsel assisting the commission, Avelina Tarrago, whether things had gotten worse since the NDIS started, Emily agreed that they had. The commission was also played a clip of Emily crossing the Barkly Highway, the main road in Tennant Creek. Emily said she was often scared crossing the bumpy road on her scooter because there were many trucks which tended to speed along the highway. Her scooter’s tyres were easily damaged on the rough terrain. The inquiry is this week investigating the experiences of First Nations people in remote communities in accessing the NDIS. Minister defied advice on mask mandates Victoria’s health minister Mary-Anne Thomas has revealed the state government defied the acting chief health officer’s advice to introduce mask mandates in a range of settings including early childhood education and some retail environments. It comes after the Victorian government last week extended the state’s pandemic declaration for another three months, citing a serious Covid risk to the public. Speaking to reporters, Thomas said the government had consulted with industry groups and other stakeholders in making its decision: We want to empower Victorians to make the best decision. Victoria today joined NSW in reducing the state’s Covid reinfection period to four weeks, as the state government recommends people wear masks indoors and in crowded public places. Covid-carrying cruise ship under watchful eye of NSW Health When the Coral Princess cruise ship – carrying over 100 Covid positive cases – arrives in NSW the crew will not be allowed to disembark and passengers will have to return a negative RAT test, NSW Health authorities say: The vast majority of Covid-19 cases on the ship are currently in crew members. A small number of passengers have been diagnosed with Covid-19 since boarding the Coral Princess, their infections were most likely acquired prior to boarding and they subsequently tested positive. The ship is currently en route to the port of Eden on the South Coast of NSW and is also scheduled to be in Sydney for one day on Wednesday, 13 July, before travelling to Brisbane. NSW Health said it is liaising with the Coral Princess cruise ship to monitor the health of its passengers and crew members: NSW Health’s assessment is that the Covid-19 risk level for the Coral Princess during this cruise is amber, which indicates a moderate impact to the vessel. When the ship arrives at the port of Eden, NSW Health says that no crew members will disembark and all passengers disembarking will be requested to return a negative RAT result first: To further minimise the risk of transmission, passengers on shore tours will also be advised to wear masks when on transport or in other public indoor spaces, physically distance wherever possible and to regularly use hand sanitiser. ‘I want a frank, fair-dinkum review’: Perrottet on flooding Albanese and Perrottet are speaking about the future of flood-prone areas like Lismore and whether rebuilding should occur. Albanese said: I don’t think we’ve had a discussion about relocating the whole of Lismore. But what we have had on a pretty informal basis is discussion about planning. I think we’d have a common view that you can’t continue to commit the same issues and wonder why you get the same outcomes. And quite clearly planning and development in flood planes is something that is primarily the responsibility of state governments, but common sense has got to apply here as well and I’m confident that the premier will be doing just that. Perrottet said he agreed with the principle that you can’t keep doing the same things the same way and expect a different outcome: There’s no doubt these events are becoming more prevalent and I have commissioned that review. I expect to receive that review by the end of the month. I have said that I’ll make that review public. Now, a lot of that will focus on the immediate response to these disasters but there’s no doubt there will be a medium- to long-term focus and our government is already, independently of that review, working through how we plan for the long term. We need to make sure that we can stand here as leaders in a circumstance where an event like this happens in the future – which it inevitably will – that we have done everything we can to make sure we don’t make the mistakes of the past. And whether that’s development on flood plains in circumstances where not only does that cost and risk lives, but the impact on properties, homes, and businesses, which the Government, at a Commonwealth and state level will always be there to provide that financial support. That’s our job. I have said to both Mary O’Kane and Mick Fuller in relation to that review that I don’t want a political review. I want a frank, fair-dinkum review, that the government will take on board and respond. And I’ll make that report public as quickly as possible. I’ll await the legislation, says PM on assisted dying Albanese is asked how he would vote on the issue of assisted dying: We haven’t seen the bill yet. It will be a private member’s bill. I’ll look at the details of the bill. I’ve been on the record previously - I was an opponent of the Andrews bill when it occurred. The Labor Party has a conscience vote on these issues and so I’ll await the legislation that I read is being introduced by Luke Gosling from the Northern Territory and Alicia Payne from the ACT. Albanese says there are two issues at play: The issue of substance and also the issue of the right of territory governments to be able to determine their own legislation as well. That’s something that, in my view, people in Australia should not be treated any differently and with less rights if they happen to live in Canberra compared with living in Queanbeyan in the state of New South Wales, and similar issues apply to the Northern Territory. Throw out your thongs, say farmers AAP reports that farmers are urging travellers from Bali to throw out their thongs before arriving in Australia, to help stop the highly contagious foot and mouth disease. It’s been estimated the arrival of FMD in Australia could cost the agriculture industry $80b. National farmers federation president Fiona Simson said people throwing away their old footwear would be given a voucher towards a new pair of shoes. “Ringers Western will give them a 30% voucher on their return,” she said. “I never thought we’d be helping people buy new shoes to keep my cattle safe, but here we are.” Last week, biosecurity measures were strengthened at Australian airports. Detector dogs are operating at Darwin and Cairns airports and biosecurity officers are boarding flights from Indonesia to do checks of travellers arriving from Indonesia. – with AAP NSW flood relief payments being fast-tracked: PM The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is emphasising the payments are being fast-tracked to prioritise support for victims over auditing the process. However, both he and the premier are imploring people to only apply if they are eligible: The costs so far to the commonwealth has been $514m , so this joint funding is separate from that as well. I make this point – we’re making the payments. We’re not holding them up in order to audit in advance. But we will be auditing in retrospect as well. So only people who are eligible for these payments should apply for these payments, but we didn’t want to be in a circumstance whereby people were not able to receive support because some of these people have lost everything. So the idea that you can go through and check every application before payments are made would have had a severe impact on people and would have added to the trauma which people are experiencing. Perrottet has affirmed the audit will be performed in due course and any false claims will be identified: Whether it’s through Covid payments or disaster payments, there are always people who fraudulently put registrations and applications in who are not eligible and that is disgraceful. If you do that, we will catch you out ... But from a state and Commonwealth perspective, it is most important right now that we provide that assistance as quickly as possible to those who need it and, as the Prime Minister has said, significant audits will be in place following this period. Further flood support details NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, is providing more details on what the additional funding will go towards: Today, we’re announcing significant financial assistance for those impacted by these recent floods and it’s a joint initiative with the commonwealth government. This includes grants to councils that will help with things like urgent repairs to infrastructure and helping them employ additional people to help with the flood recovery. In addition to that, we’ve committed funding for the clean-up, primary producer and small business grants and boots on the ground to assess... the recovery process. We’re at the start of the recovery and our two governments will make the necessary financial commitments to get these communities back on their feet as soon as possible. Flood support extended to eight further LGAs Murray Watt, the federal minister for emergency management, has announced an additional eight local government areas will receive support. We’re also pleased to announce today that we’ve extended that support to a further eight local government areas in addition to the 29 that had been previously announced. So there’s now a total of 37. The extra eight LGAs are Cumberland, mid-Coast, Muswellbrook, Nambucca, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Randwick and Warren, a total of 37 LGAs around New South Wales that will be eligible for those payments and they will also be eligible for the payments that have been announced by the Prime Minister and the Premier today. Perrottet pledges grants, $1m of flood support per council NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says the additional supports will be available by the end of the week: The assistance that we’re announcing today ... will be available for registration by the end of the week through Service New South Wales for the business grant of up to $50,000. The primary producer grant, through the rural assistance authority of up to $75,000. With regards the council grants: This financial support today of $1m per council impacted is in addition to that financial support that we have provided in the past and we’ll continue to work with our local government areas right across the state to ensure they have the financial support they need to get their communities back on track as quickly as possible. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is announcing additional funding to support flood victims in NSW to help get people’s lives “back on track.” Clean-up immediate assistance and an initial estimated cost of $80m with an estimated commonwealth contribution of half that amount. Primary producer recovery grants of up to $75,000 at an additional estimated cost of $55m with an estimated commonwealth contribution of half that. Small businesses and nonprofit organisation recovery grants of up to $50,000 with half of the amount coming to a cost of $27m, shared between the commonwealth and New South Wales. At-flood property assessment program at an estimated initial cost of some $36m. We’ll also be providing $1m grants to each council in the 37 disaster-related declared LGAs to assist with their immediate social built economic and environmental needs. Push to replace gas with renewables amidst war in Ukraine at Sydney Energy Forum Answering a question from the audience on whether a need to reduce dependence on Russian gas amid war in Ukraine increases a need for greater investment in gas from other countries at the Sydney Energy Forum today, Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of International Energy Agency says: I put a big question mark on if those investments will be profitable. “We have to bring gas, oil demand down,” he said, pointing to a plethora of possible alternatives. We can replace gas with renewables, with nuclear power, with energy efficiency. There are already available gas reservoirs ... We can increase production from there. There is a huge amount of methane emissions today escaping many countries around the world exporting gas ... If we catch this methane, we can help to replace Russian gas. For the latest in Australian politics join Poll the Position webinar at 1pm Guardian’s Essential poll shows the prime minister Anthony Albanese’s approval is wavering as the honeymoon period fades. You can find out more about what the latest poll shows by joining Guardian’s political editor Katherine Murphy and Peter Lewis at the the live version at 1PM today following the below link. Asian Development Bank president addresses Sydney Energy Forum Masatsugu Asakawa, Asian Development Bank president, said “we all need to pick up the scale and pace of energy transition” at the Sydney Energy Forum today. My friends, we know transformation [to clean energy grid] is far from complete. The world needs to decarbonise. Asia and the Pacific are responsible for more than 50% of global greenhouse emissions. And it impacts small nations and the most vulnerable population. Asakawa points to a need for “collective action” on innovative solutions to “turn the tide”, urging leaders to “invest to get us on the path to a net zero future”. “In the role of new technologies ... access will be the key.” The transition to clean and efficient energy is fully compatible with robust economic growth. Minister defied advice on mask mandate Mary-Anne Thomas, the Victorian health minister, reveals she went against health advice not mandating masks indoors for several settings. The federal health minister, Mark Butler, has revealed the federal program providing 10 free rapid antigen tests every three months for concession card holders will end in July. Butler was speaking to 3AW Radio about the covid crisis in Australia, confirming that 300 Australians are “losing their life every single week”, with new data suggesting “Covid is the largest killer of Australians this year, overtaking coronary disease”. Asked if the free RATs could be extended beyond July, Butler said: No, I think that expiry is about the right time. [Early in 2022] we had a very ferocious debate at a time rapid tests were very hard to get ... The price has come down dramatically, the cost was averaging $24-$25 per test in January, they’re now down to about $8 a test. Pensioners and concession card holders can still get their allocation of up to 10 before the end of the month, and that can carry them through for a period of time. There are so many RATs out in the community, many state governments provide free access ... and they’re available if you live in an aged care facility. The problem we were facing is largely resolved. Butler said Australia is “going through a difficult period” and if employers feel they are able to continue their operations with employees working from home, they should heed the chief health officer’s advice to consider allowing staff to do so. Butler asked Australians “if you’re in indoor spaces, particularly crowded ones where you can’t socially distance, think about putting mask on,” signalling he may start wearing them to press conferences again. Asked why the government isn’t doing more, Butler said: We’re deep into the third year of the pandemic. There is a level of fatigue that governments and health authorities need to reflect when putting in measurers to deal with this third wave. We’ve tried to bring new energy about the importance of getting the third vaccine dose. Interest rate hikes dent consumer confidence Consumer confidence has fallen for the second week in a row, particularly for mortgage holders being hit by higher interest rates. The weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan Australian Consumer Confidence Rating saw a drop of 2.5% to 81.6, well under the last three decade’s monthly average of 112.4. Consumer confidence for those paying off a mortgage was down by a “sharp” 5.4%, the survey found. Since talk of rate hikes began in late April, consumer confidence among mortgage holders has fallen 25%, while confidence among renters is down 4%. CBA’s chief economist, Stephen Halmarick, says expected interest rate increases are likely “to see discretionary spending weaken further in coming months”. – with AAP Fog alert! Foggy conditions in Adelaide where a road weather alert has been issued by the SA state emergency service. More updates from the Sydney Energy Forum Ms Jennifer Granholm, US Secretary of Energy, says US President Joe Biden is “very enthused” about building out the clean energy transition at today’s Sydney Energy Forum: We want a modern grid with an expanded capacity. It is not just the flipping of a switch. It’s a period of time ... We want to plan responsible, with a sense of urgency. Granholm points to change being needed in the fossil fuel industry: “There is a moment for all of us to call upon diversification of fossil companies ... to become energy companies, and not just fossil energy companies,” she says, urging a move to clean energy sources, “whether it is hydrogen, or geothermal”. Clean energy development is: truly about energy security and energy independence as nations. We cannot be under the thumb of those who don’t share our values ... or under the thumb of those who [want to] control our supply chain. Climate is No 1 national security, economic challenge of region: Wong Conroy said development assistance doesn’t come “with strings attached” in reference to Pacific Island nations’ relationships with China: To demonstrate the conviction... only yesterday we announced an additional $2m of assistance to Kiribati to assist with their crippling drought, that is on top of the $600,000 we announced a couple of weeks ago. It is very important that aid is unconditional like that. Wong was asked if climate change has been overshadowed as the biggest threat facing the region and whether it will still be the centre of discussions at the forum this week. She has affirmed it remains the biggest threat the regions faces: I can only say this, that climate is central in the statements of many leaders passed, it is the number one national security, economic challenge that the region faces. Obviously, people have spoken about climate and spoken about strategic competition and have spoken about Covid and the path of recovery where there are real challenges for the Pacific. We know that there is a risk that we had a discussion today about a lower development path, what they call economic scarring as a result of Covid. This is not a region that can afford that we need to work with them to try to about that. Conroy, Wong defend Australia’s emissions target The media conference is asking Wong and Pat Conroy, the minister for international development, about the adequacy of Australia’s climate stance. Conroy says it’s credible for Australia to host a COP forum when its emissions target is one of the highest in the developed world. Wong says the 43% target is “quite a substantial target” and says coal mines “will be dealt with in accordance with Australian law”: I would make the point that the target that we are proposing would see Australia adding 2% renewable energy for our domestic market by 2030. Wong says she hasn’t been asked at the forum whether Australia would not allow any more coal reserves of gas most to be utilised. Penny Wong has emphasised the importance the forum remain united, in light of the withdrawal of Kiribati from the forum: I had a very good discussion today with the secretary of FSM and we spoke about the lived experience of the Micronesian states to climate change. And, as you know, that was one of the key aspects of Prime Minister Albanese’s election campaign. I’d like to make a comment about the unity of the forum, which has obviously been a big discussion over these last week. The region is stronger together. It’s a simple proposition. The region is stronger together. And in the bilateral they have had, in the discussions I have had in my previous visits in the dialogue today, leaders talked about the challenges the region faces, climate change, Covid, and recovery from Covid, both of which have fallen harder on this region and on many other parts of the world and, of course, strategic competition. And all the nations of this region are seeking to navigate those challenges. ...and we do it best when we do it together. That is the approach Australia has taken. That is the approach the Pacific Islands Forum has taken and that is why Pacific for immunity is so important. As you know, There have been a lot of discussions about Pacific Islands Forum unity and the position the Australian government has consistently taken is we were seeking to support whatever the consensus could deliver, because the most important thing was to ensure that at this time, in a contestable, in a world confronting climate, Covid, and economic recovery from Covid, that the forum remain united. ‘We are here to listen’: Penny Wong in Suva Penny Wong, the minister for foreign affairs, is giving a press conference from Suva where she is attending the Pacific Islands Forum. I said today at the leaders forum dialogue that we are here to listen and learn. It is obviously my first forum and it was a very important to listen to the contributions from the various perspectives of presidents and prime ministers around the table and they gained a lot from that. As they have said previously, the Australian government, the new Australian government is committed to bringing new energy and new resources to the Pacific and we recognise, in particular, the importance of climate change. China’s monopoly on solar under spotlight at forum Reporter Rafqa Touma here with some updates from today’s Sydney Energy Forum, where leaders in government and industry from around the world are gathering to discuss clean energy supply, sustainability and security in the Indo-Pacific region. Dr Fatih Birol, Executive Director of International Energy Agency, urges that leaders “need to think about” China’s monopoly on solar energy manufacturing “from an energy security perspective” at the Sydney Energy Forum today: Of all the manufacturing capacity around the world ... about 80% of the global supply chain manufacturing comes from one single country – China. China did excellently within the last 15 years to bring the cost of solar down, providing multiple benefits around the world. But at the same time, today, 80% ... is a big number. Every country “relying on technology from one single country ... is something we all need to think about from an energy security perspective”. Victoria has joined NSW in reducing the state’s Covid reinfection period to four weeks, as the state government recommends people wear masks indoors and in crowded public places. It follows similar moves by the WA and ACT governments yesterday in line with advice from the the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. The previous Covid reinfection period – when people are exempt from testing and isolating – was 12 weeks. The Victorian government has also requested employers consider working-from-home arrangements, noting there has been a 53% increase in the number of Victorians in hospital with Covid over the past two weeks. All smiles in Suva Guardian Australia’s Pacific editor, Kate Lyons, is currently in Suva covering the Pacific Islands Forum. This morning, she was there for a warm greeting between Jacinda Ardern, the prime minster of New Zealand, and Penny Wong, Australia’s minister for foreign affairs. Flood toll on NSW roads emerges NSW roads are significantly damaged by last week’s floods, as this image from Wiseman’s Ferry shows. The state’s Rural Fire Service has reminded Australians the unknown condition of the roads is another reason why it’s unsafe to cross flood waters. ‘I am very uncomfortable with this voice’: Abbott on Indigenous voice to parliament The former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, also shared his views on the Indigenous voice to parliament, which Labor wants to hold a referendum on as soon as 2023. Abbott told Radio National: Let me say I think the opposition is right in the first instance to demand all the detail from the government. Personally, I am very uncomfortable with this voice, with what Malcolm Turnbull called a third chamber of parliament. I’m uncomfortable electing a body determined by race. When Abbott was pulled up on the fact the voice is not a third chamber of parliament he said he was merely “citing what my successor said” – which isn’t a great way to engage in public discourse, happily repeating a misrepresentation as long as someone else said it first. Abbott continued: You can’t ask the people for a blank cheque on something as significant as this. If asked to vote on an unspecified voice, the natural response will be to say, ‘If you don’t know, vote no.’ The last thing we want is a referendum designed to forward reconciliation defeated and inevitably that puts reconciliation back. The most likely referendum proposal is to include an enabling provision in the constitution, specifying that parliament will legislate the design of the voice. Not necessarily a blank cheque, depending on how much detail is released about the design of the body to be legislated. There were 10,627 new cases in the last reporting period, and 39 people are in intensive care. ‘Finding common ground’: Albanese on nations working together Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has begun his opening address at the Sydney Energy Forum, emphasising the need for nations to work together towards a common good: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and laid bare challenges that we simply cannot ignore. There are many lessons that we will all take from this experience, but one of the most critical ones for me is that we are stronger when we work together. We are, for all of our differences, one common human family and we all call this one fragile planet our home. When we pause and reflect on this, we recognise our connection to one another. We recognise that we have a common stake in each other and that the best way to meet the challenges in front of us is by finding common ground. That is what this forum is about – finding common ground. And that’s the message I’m carrying with me today, a message underscored by your presence here today. The diversity and unity of purpose in this room makes it very clear – all of you coming together from across sectors and nations because you understand that our future is linked. All of us here know what needs to be done. The nature of the challenge and the science is not in question. Its urgency and scope is clear. The question is our ability, but importantly as well our appetite to seize the opportunities that it contains and to shape them in our common interests. As Prime Minister, I’m committed to renewing Australia’s standing in our region. Reporter Rafqa Touma will be bringing you more updates about Albanese’s address here on the blog but you can also read political editor Katherine Murphy’s preview. There were 10,806 new cases in the last reporting period, and 58 people are in intensive care. The Australian Medical Association (AMA) and Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) are calling on the health minister, Mark Butler, to reverse the decision to let the telehealth items lapse amidst the latest Covid-19 outbreak. The bodies want to meet with Butler to discuss the reinstatement of Covid-19 telehealth items cancelled on 1 July. Dr Omar Khorshid, the AMA president, said: These changes undermine the ability of patients to access their doctors, and in particular for GPs to prescribe antivirals for Covid-positive patients and will lead to costs elsewhere in the health system, including in overstretched hospitals. Khorshid said the item for telephone consults longer that 20 minutes with a GP – a key part of the government’s “Living with Covid” strategy – was critical and must be restored: Prescribing antivirals is time consuming, requiring a GP to consider complex eligibility requirements, contraindications and drug interactions and then arrange for patients to obtain the medication while isolating. Even simple cases take thirty minutes to an hour to properly complete. Professor Karen Price, the president of RACGP, said given the growing number of COVID-19 cases and the unknown impacts of long COVID going forward, enabling access to longer telephone consultations was vital: GPs have told the RACGP the removal of Medicare patient rebates for longer phone consultations has reduced access to care and increased health gaps for vulnerable patients. This includes rural communities, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, older people, people with disability and mental health concerns, many of whom already have poorer health outcomes than the general population,” Price said. The former Liberal prime minister, Tony Abbott, has praised the Albanese government’s handling of the Pacific step-up, even implicitly criticising the Morrison government for being focused on the election instead of China’s ambitions in the region. Abbott told Radio National: I think it would be very serious if China were to establish a string of military bases in the South Pacific. It’s obvious that’s China and the Beijing regime’s intention. It’s important Australia do everything it can to ensure the people of Pacific understand their peril, not just ours. Because the Beijing regime may come to these countries all smiles, but Beijing is out for Beijing’s interests, not anybody else’s. Asked if the new government had been more active than Morrison’s, Abbott replied: I certainly applaud the fact Penny Wong went to Solomon Islands almost immediately, and the prime minister is going to the Pacific Islands Forum. The new government is being absolutely active in the Pacific as it should be – good on them. I don’t have the slightest criticism [of them]. Asked if it was a mistake for former foreign minister, Marise Payne, not to immediately go to Solomon Islands after it announced a draft security pact with China, he said: That’s dirty water under the bridge. I suppose at the time we were on the verge of an election campaign, and people were a bit focused elsewhere. The new government got straight down to business, good on them for that. Government to outline plans on responsible lending laws Stephen Jones, the assistant treasurer and minister for financial services, will address the Responsible Lending Summit this morning and outline the government’s plans on responsible lending laws, including buy-now-pay-later and pay day lending. The Buy-Now-Pay-Later sector currently doesn’t have the same regulations as banks do when they provide loans. If you want to hear more about the issues in the sector ahead of Jones’ address, senior business reporter Ben Butler wrote this article when Jones first announced plans for regulation. New Omicron subvariants becoming dominant in Australia Paul Kelly, the country’s chief medical officer, is on ABC and says the latest Covid-19 subvariants BA4 and 5 are becoming the dominant variant in Australia: We have seen a rise in this new variant of Omicron, so it is still the COVID-19 virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it is just a different – slight differences in the way that that virus looks and how our immune system looks at it. We do know that this new variant has caused waves in other countries and is now becoming the dominant variant in Australia. We have no suggestion at the moment that it causes for severe disease but it escapes our immune system, whether that is due to previous infection or vaccination. We do expect that these new variants will cause a rise in cases and probably hospitalisations in the coming weeks. Kelly has reiterated the importance of third and fourth vaccine doses. Asked about the difference that reducing the reinfection period makes, Kelly says that the decisions are based on evidence as the new variants are more infectious: The new BA4 and BA5 are more infectious and there is strong evidence that you can get reinfected earlier than what was previously the case. It is important that anyone who develops symptoms again 28 or more days after they have had a previous COVID-19 infection, to get tested and to take the appropriate arrangements in terms of isolation. A new campaign has launched today to tackle racism by the Australian Human Rights Commission. Chin Tan, the race discrimination commissioner, was on ABC Radio this morning discussing the campaign he says calls on all Australians to reflect on the causes and impacts of racism, not only on its victims but Australia’s collective wellbeing as a society. Tan said the government hasn’t funded the campaign itself but its framework. Tan said the funding for the campaign had come from the corporate and private sector. Sarah Collard, Guardian Australia’s Indigenous affairs reporter, has more on how the campaign was partly funded by a disaffected former Collingwood football club sponsor. Cronulla beach washed away by rowdy surf The dangerous surf conditions along the NSW coast is causing massive erosion on Sydney’s Cronulla beach. The North Cronulla lifeguard tower even had to be lifted out of reach of the dangerous surf via crane last night. The St George and Sutherland Shire Leader is reporting that “the tower had been perilously close to falling into the ocean after being undermined by another big swell on the weekend.” The Leader said that the Sutherland Shire Council ordered its removal early on Monday with the main section lifted off after 8pm. Mayor of the Sutherland Shire Council, Carmelo Pesce, told the Leader a new seawall at North Cronulla beach was provided for in a draft plan of management, which had recently been finalised and the council was also seeking state government assistance to repair beaches.

We have seen a rise in the number of scam texts that are occurring. These are predominantly run by criminals who are sophisticated. Some of them in Australia, many overseas, but the technology needs to keep up with that in order to keep Australians safe. Rowland is asked about the scepticism Andy Penn, the CEO of Telstra, has expressed that the new rules can actually deliver for consumers because of the difficulty stopping scam messages. She said the technology has become more sophisticated to enable these scam texts to be identified: We know for a fact as the evidence shows, in just over a year since we have had obligations in place about scam calls, we have had some half a billion scam calls being blocked. Will this mean that every scam call, every scam text and every scam email will no longer reach innocent Australian consumers? The honest answer is no. But we can make it better and we can ensure that there is consistency across the industry so that consumers have confidence that no matter who their provider is. Abbott pays tribute to Abe Tony Abbott is on ABC Radio paying tribute to Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe – “the best friend Australia has ever had from Japan”. Abbott said Abe’s designing the Quad is “the reason India is there”, which might not have been the case had it been designed by the US. He said he didn’t believe the criticisms of Abe as a WW2 revisionist are valid. History shouldn’t be used a stick ... that’s what China has tended to do with Japan. Abbott is asked about the whether the new government should be given credit for the step-up in the Pacific. He said the new government was “being absolutely active in the Pacific as it should be. Good on them.” Asked whether it was a mistake not to send Marise Paine under the coalition government, Abbott said: “That’s dirty water under the bridge.” Asked whether the opposition should support a yes vote in referendum on Uluru Statement of the Heart, Abbott reinforced he did not support an Aboriginal voice in parliament and said the opposition was right to ask for more detail. ‘They need to get their story straight’ Jim Chalmers is asked about Sussan Ley’s calls to cancel the jobs and skills summit and Angus Taylor’s call for a seat at the table: They need to get their story straight. Asked about whether independents will be invited, Chalmers said the invitation list hasn’t been finalised: A hundred people sounds like a lot of people until you see who’s in the first list and who might not be. Even for the people who aren’t in the 100, we will find ways to consult with them in meaningful ways, including all parts of the parliament. When it comes to invitations for the opposition, Chalmers says: We will consider people who want to be there on their merits. Let’s see if the opposition is actually serious. I think what you just quoted from yesterday, where one person was saying it should be cancelled, another person was insisting on being invited. Let’s see if they’re serious first. I mean, they have had to bring people together in the way that we hope to bring people together. They didn’t do that. The big reason why we’ve had this waste a decade of missed opportunities in the economy, whether its energy policy chaos, or not enough Australians trained for key roles. We need to see if they’re serious, they haven’t shown so far that they are. Chalmers on a ‘wasted decade’ Treasurer Jim Chalmers is on ABC Radio discussing the jobs and skills summit he and the prime minister announced yesterday which will take place in September: There are a whole range of issues here which have combined to create what I think has been a wasted decade of missed opportunities in the economy. Too much division, too much looking for the things which divide us rather than a common ground. There’s more common ground in these areas than people realise. Asked about the calls from business to include a temporary two-year increase in skilled migration to increase it to 200,000 places a year, Chalmers says migration shouldn’t be considered the only solution when it comes to the challenges facing the workforce: We’ve had a quite unusual period when it comes to migration and as we emerge from it, we should work together to get the settings right but what I want to make sure we don’t see this as the one lever that you would pull to solve our issues and inflation and wages and labor shortages and skill shortages. We can get migration right without seeing it as a substitute for doing all of the other things in the economy, which will get that wages growth and fill these skills shortages and deliver the right kind of prosperity that we want to see into the future. ‘The Pacific is the part of the world where the US rightly looks to Australia to lead’ Australia’s defence minister, Richard Marles, has warned of the use of “force or coercion” in the South China Sea and “intensification of major power competition” – references to China’s rising power in the Indo-Pacific. Marles made the comments in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies on his visit to the US, committing Australia to closer cooperation with the US, higher defence spending and to address climate change in part as a national security issue: All of us here today understand the challenges we face: a military build-up occurring at a rate unseen since world war two; the development and deployment of new weapons that challenge our military capability edge; expanding cyber and grey zone capabilities which blur the line between peace and conflict; and the intensification of major power competition in ways that both concentrate and transcend geographic confines. These trends compel an even greater Australian focus on the Indo-Pacific. For the first time in decades we are thinking hard about the security of our strategic geography, the viability of our trade and supply routes, and above all the preservation of an inclusive regional order founded on rules agreed by all, not the coercive capabilities of a few. In particular we worry about use of force or coercion to advance territorial claims, as is occurring in the South China Sea, and its implications for the any number of places in the Indo-Pacific where borders or sovereignty is disputed. On Australia’s relationship with the Pacific, where Australia is racing to persuade nations not to follow Solomon Islands’ lead in signing a security pact with China, Marles said: The Pacific is where Australia must invest in effective regionalism by reinforcing the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional institutions that are so key to regional resilience and agency. We must do this not only because of our unique connections to the Pacific but because Pacific security so directly impacts on our own security. Given this reality, the Pacific is the part of the world where the United States rightly looks to Australia to lead. And we will. We will not take our status for granted. Pacific Island countries have choices about their partners. And we will work to earn their trust. The Pacific has been clear in saying that geopolitical competition is of lesser concern to them than the threat of rising sea levels, economic insecurity and transnational crime. Australia respects and understands this position. And we are listening. And while we will not ask our partners to pick a side, I am confident that an Australia which collaborates and invests in shared priorities with the Pacific is an Australia which will be the natural partner of choice for the Pacific. SMS scam protections Australians will be better protected from text message scams as new regulations for telecommunications companies come into effect today. The code, registered by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) today, will require the companies to trace, identify and block SMS scam messages, and publish information for customers on how to identify and report scams. Mobile phone companies could face up to $250,000 in fines for failing to comply with the new code. Reporter Josh Taylor has more: NSW Health today announced that – effective immediately – the Covid reinfection period is now four weeks, down from 12. It follows similar moves by the WA and ACT governments yesterday, in line with advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. Tasmania had already changed its reinfection period on Friday last week. Anyone in the state experiencing Covid symptoms from 28 days after their isolation ends is now required to test for the virus. In a statement, the chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said the new advice was due to the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants “circulating widely in NSW”: They are more able to evade immunity gained from previous infection and vaccination reinfection is more likely and possible just weeks after a prior infection. This post was amended on 12 July to add the date Tasmania changed the reinfection period. Prime minister Anthony Albanese is due to make the opening speech at the Sydney Energy Forum today. He will tell the forum Australia has rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partners” on climate action. He’ll be making the speech before travelling to the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, where leaders are set to meet later in the week. Covid-19 hospitalisations are surging in Australia from the winter Omicron wave, with pressures on hospitals leading to some elective surgeries being cancelled and paramedics overwhelmed. In NSW the Covid reinfection period has been reduced to four weeks down from 12 weeks previously, from today. The first monkeypox case has been detected in Queensland. The state’s authorities say the public health risk is “very low” but it comes after community transmission was found in NSW last week.

Marles made the comments in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies on his visit to the US, committing Australia to closer cooperation with the country, higher defence spending and to address the climate crisis in part as a national security issue. It coincided with a separate announcement that the Australian and US governments would work together to accelerate zero emissions technology, including long duration energy storage, integration of renewable energy into power grids and removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen – who announced the partnership in Sydney on Tuesday with the US secretary of energy, Jennifer Granholm – said it was a commitment “to make climate change a centrepiece” of the Australia-US alliance. Marles’s US visit comes as Australia is attempting to reset relations with China, after Labor’s election in May. After several years of diplomatic freeze, China has recommenced ministerial meetings with Australia. Marles met his Chinese counterpart in Singapore in June and the foreign minister, Penny Wong, met hers, Wang Yi, last week. That produced warnings from China to treat it as a partner, not a threat or opponent, to which the Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded he would act in the national interest not according to Chinese demands. In Washington DC, Marles said the Australia-US alliance faced “a military buildup occurring at a rate unseen since world war two; the development and deployment of new weapons … expanding cyber and grey zone capabilities … and the intensification of major power competition”. These “compel an even greater Australian focus on the Indo-Pacific” to preserve “an inclusive regional order founded on rules agreed by all, not the coercive capabilities of a few”, he said. “In particular we worry about use of force or coercion to advance territorial claims, as is occurring in the South China Sea, and its implications for the any number of places in the Indo-Pacific where borders or sovereignty is disputed.” Marles argued the US alliance “affords Australia capability, technology, and intelligence advantages we could not acquire or develop on our own”. He praised the US president, Joe Biden, for rejecting Russia’s “brutal attempt to subjugate a sovereign state” in Ukraine and seeking to prevent a world “where only great powers are truly sovereign and where the choice of smaller states is to be either a vassal or an enemy”. “Only by ensuring such tactics fail can we deter their future employment, in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, or elsewhere,” Marles said. Avoiding direct references to China, Marles said the US-Australia alliance will need “to operate in a much more challenging strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific” and “to contribute to a more effective balance of military power aimed at avoiding a catastrophic failure of deterrence”. Marles promised Australia “will take greater responsibility for its own security” including investing to “increase the range and lethality of the Australian defence force so that it is able to hold potential adversary forces [at bay]”. In particular, the Aukus pact to acquire nuclear submarines would make Australia safer and “a more potent and capable partner”, he said. Marles said that “no one and no country is immune” from the threat of climate change, promising to make it a pillar of the US alliance because it is a “national security issue”. He cited the “intense vulnerability” felt by Australia’s Pacific neighbours, which have labelled it an “existential threat”. Since Solomon Islands announced a security pact with China, Australia has intensified outreach to Pacific nations, urging them to look to regional partners such as Australia for security solutions first. Marles said Australia would “not take our status for granted” because Pacific countries “have choices about their partners”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The Pacific has been clear in saying that geopolitical competition is of lesser concern to them than the threat of rising sea levels, economic insecurity, and transnational crime,” he said. “Australia respects and understands this position. And we are listening. “And while we will not ask our partners to pick a side, I am confident that an Australia which collaborates and invests in shared priorities with the Pacific is an Australia which will be the natural partner of choice for the Pacific.” Albanese told an international energy forum in Sydney on Tuesday that Australia had rejoined the ranks of “trusted global partner” on climate action. He then left to attend the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, where the climate crisis is a major focus. Bowen and Granholm used the forum, hosted by the Australian government and the International Energy Agency, to announce a “net zero technology acceleration partnership” between the countries. Both suggested it should ultimately make the two countries less reliant on Chinese clean energy supply chains. The Chinese are responsible for about 80% of the global manufacturing supply chain for solar energy. Granholm said the two countries would “work together to unlock critical advances in long-duration storage, grid integration, clean hydrogen, direct air capture, and critical minerals and materials”. Bowen said the partnership was “a huge milestone in ramping up the US and Australia’s shared commitment to ambitious climate action and energy security”. “We will work to ensure critical minerals supply chains are secure and resilient– ramping up production, processing and manufacturing capacity,” he said. “These technologies and supply chains will be critical to the rollout of renewable energy in Australia and the United States.” The net zero partnership announcement included a memorandum of understanding between Australia’s CSIRO and the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory to work together develop clean energy technology."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/08/price-offshore-wind-power-falls-cheapest-ever-level-uk","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-08T09:54:53Z","webTitle":"Price of offshore wind power falls to cheapest ever level in UK","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/08/price-offshore-wind-power-falls-cheapest-ever-level-uk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/08/price-offshore-wind-power-falls-cheapest-ever-level-uk","fields":{"headline":"Price of offshore wind power falls to cheapest ever level in UK","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The price of offshore wind power in the UK has fallen to an all-time low, which could ease the pressure on future household energy bills. Following the biggest ever UK renewables auction, the government said on Thursday the contract price for windfarms was nearly 6% lower than the previous auction, despite the rising cost of materials to build windfarms. A string of new contracts should add about 7 gigawatts of clean power capacity to Britain’s turbine fleet by 2026. The government hopes to have 50GW by 2030 and has embarked on a push to expand Britain’s renewables industry in the face of rocketing fossil fuel prices. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated an already volatile oil and gas market and left countries scrambling to shore up their energy supplies. UK ministers have been forced to ask coal-fired power plants to continue their operations through the winter for fear of blackouts caused by energy shortages. However, renewable energy including wind power is seen as central to Britain’s goal of hitting net zero carbon by 2050. Offshore windfarm operators will sell power for as little as £37.35 per megawatt hour, 5.8% below the lowest bid in the most recent auction in 2019. The “contracts for difference” guarantee wind-power companies fixed prices to sell electricity for the following 15 years. If the market price falls below the contract price, the government subsidises the difference. If the market is higher, the companies pay money back to the government. Since wholesale energy prices began to rocket last year, windfarms have begun paying back money to the government. The easing of an effective moratorium on new onshore windfarms – which was imposed in 2015 – meant onshore wind and solar energy were both included in an auction for the first time in seven years. Onshore wind is now about 45% of the price secured in the auction in 2015. Among the winners from the auction were the Danish power company Ørsted, Scottish Power and Sweden’s Vattenfall. Ørsted landed the contract for the world’s biggest offshore wind project, at Hornsea Three, 100 miles (160km) off the east Yorkshire coast. It is hoped the project will produce enough renewable electricity to power 3.2m UK homes. Scottish Power secured a contract for the East Anglia Three offshore wind project, five onshore wind projects and 10 solar sites. Vattenfall agreed terms for the Norfolk Boreas offshore windfarm, which it said would meet the needs of about 1.5m homes. It is hoped the projects will help to eventually bring down bills for consumers, which are expected to top £2,800 from October. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said: “Eye-watering gas prices are hitting consumers across Europe. The more cheap, clean power we generate within our own borders, the better protected we will be from volatile gas prices that are pushing up bills.” Separately on Thursday, the National Grid laid out the biggest investment plan in the UK’s electricity network since the 1960s. In the £54bn upgrade connections to the grid for offshore windfarms will be coordinated for the first time. National Grid’s electricity arm proposed 15 connection points to bring 18 offshore windfarms to land. Most offshore wind projects have their own connection to the grid. National Grid hopes to reduce costs and cut down disruption for coastal residents by reducing the number of cables and pylons needed. The Scottish Power chief executive, Keith Anderson, urged the government to speed up the task of approving renewables projects and connecting them to the grid. “There is massive public support for the goal to hit net zero. There is a need for speed. The planning system itself is OK but it’s about getting the process more quickly,” he said. Gareth Miller, the chief executive of consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: “As consumer bills rise to unprecedented levels, these results show the value that renewables can play in driving down the cost of power generation, decoupling electricity bills from gas prices, and all in an environment currently where high gas prices are setting the electricity price in the market. This week, the Queen’s property manager, the crown estate, identified five areas off the coasts of Cornwall and Pembrokeshire that could host floating windfarms."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jul/02/australian-company-secures-700000-deal-for-carbon-capture-and-storage-machine","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-07-01T20:00:29Z","webTitle":"Australian company secures $700,000 deal for carbon capture and storage machine","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/02/australian-company-secures-700000-deal-for-carbon-capture-and-storage-machine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jul/02/australian-company-secures-700000-deal-for-carbon-capture-and-storage-machine","fields":{"headline":"Australian company secures $700,000 deal for carbon capture and storage machine","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"A solar-powered and tent-sized Australian prototype machine that can suck CO2 from the air has secured a $700,000 contract to capture and store carbon. The deal, part of a project backed by corporates including the owners of Google and Facebook, is thought to be the first time an Australian company has secured a deal to remove CO2 using direct air capture (DAC) technology. AspiraDAC will deploy about 180 of the machines, developed and made in Australia, to capture and store 500 tonnes of CO2 by 2027 at an agreed US$1,000 (AU$1,469) a tonne. In April several major corporates, including the owners of Facebook and Google, announced a new venture called Frontier that would commit US$925m (AU$1,359) to projects that pull CO2 from the air and then store it. In the first major purchase under the venture, technology company Stripe, one of the partners in Frontier, announced this week it was spending US$2.4m (AU$3.5m) on six direct air capture projects around the world, including AspiraDAC. The executive director of AspiraDAC, Julian Turecek, said up to 180 modules would be needed to fulfil the contract and these would cover an area of less than half a hectare. He said the company had not confirmed the location or the geological storage for the site, but confirmed depleted oil and gas reservoirs at Moomba, in South Australia, were being considered. “We really think this is a launch moment for direct air capture in Australia,” Turecek said. “This is the start of what could be a significant industry.” He said the carbon removal off-take agreement with Frontier was likely to be the first of several that AspiraDAC would deliver. Southern Green Gas has developed the machines in partnership with the University of Sydney, and will build and deliver them to AspiraDAC. The business development manager and co-founder at Southern Green Gas, Brett Cooper, believed the contract to deliver the emissions reductions using DAC was a first in Australia. Each module can capture two tonnes of CO2 a year. Cooper said: “This is a quintessential Australian solution because not everyone has the land area that also has the intensity of solar energy that we have.” The amount of CO2 reduction under the new contract is tiny, but Cooper said the deal is a major step for the industry which he believes has big growth potential in Australia. At the core of the Australian machine is a sponge-like material developed at the University of Sydney that holds on to CO2 molecules as air passes through it. Fans draw air into canisters containing the sponges, and then heat is used to extract the pure CO2 that can be pumped and stored underground. All power comes from the solar panels that cover the units like an A-frame tent. The Sydney team of scientists and student researchers won a $250,000 prize last year to support the development of the material from tech billionaire Elon Musk’s US$100m (AU$147m) X-Prize that is trying to establish large-scale carbon removal projects. Prof Deanna D’Alessandro, who supervises the Sydney team, said: “Carbon drawdown is going to be absolutely essential. This is directly addressing the problem and that is really powerful.” “The students are seeing the materials they’re making having a real-world impact on carbon drawdown.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Turecek said: “Nature has designed the perfect air capture machine and that’s a tree. But DAC is doing that mechanically and once we can do that at scale we can control that CO2 removal and make it permanent.” An International Energy Agency plan for the world’s economies to reach net zero emissions by 2050 says direct air capture technologies will need to deliver more than 85m tonnes of CO2 capture by 2030. Currently, the agency says the technology can deliver just 10,000 tonnes around the world. In May, the US government announced a US$3.5bn program to build four major hubs for direct air capture projects. The world’s biggest direct air capture plant is in Iceland and the company behind the plant, Climeworks, announced this week it was expanding capacity to 36,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. Dr Paul Feron, a scientist working on carbon capture technologies at CSIRO, said the agency was working on three different DAC technologies that he hoped would be commercialised within a decade. “We have got to the point in terms of the CO2 levels in the atmosphere that we need to have an ‘all of the above’ approach,” he said. “We need to be good at using as little energy as we can and we need to replace our fossil fuels with renewable energy as quickly as we can. But that most likely won’t be enough and we need to manage the carbon that is already delivering climate change. That’s why there is enormous interest in DAC. “We need to plant as many trees as we can, but it’s a reflection on the severity of the problem that we now have to look at [DAC] as well.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/jun/25/keeps-going-driving-first-production-ready-solar-car-lightyear-0","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-25T06:00:07Z","webTitle":"‘It keeps on going’: driving the world’s first production-ready solar car","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/25/keeps-going-driving-first-production-ready-solar-car-lightyear-0","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/jun/25/keeps-going-driving-first-production-ready-solar-car-lightyear-0","fields":{"headline":"‘It keeps on going’: driving the world’s first production-ready solar car","publication":"The Guardian","bodyText":"Winding past the ochre-coloured plateaux of the Bardenas Reales natural park in northern Spain, Roel Grooten nudged me to take my foot off the accelerator. The car continued to barrel down the open stretch of road, its speed dipping only slightly. “It keeps on going,” said Grooten, the lead engineer for the Dutch car company Lightyear, as we whizzed through the lunar-like landscape. “What you feel is nothing holding you back. You feel the aerodynamics, you feel the low-rolling resistance of the tyres, of the bearings and the motor.” It is this streamlined design that the company credits for allowing it to muscle its way into a space long overlooked by most car manufacturers. As early as November, the company will start delivery of what it describes as the “world’s first production-ready solar car” – the Lightyear 0, a €250,000 (£215,000) sedan draped in 5 sq metres of curved solar panels that top up the electric battery while the car is driving or parked outdoors. “If we would have the same amount of energy that we harvest on these panels on any other car that uses three times the amount of energy to drive, it becomes useless. It becomes a very expensive gimmick,” said Grooten. “You have to build this car from the ground up, to make it as efficient as possible, to make it this feasible.” In optimal conditions, the solar panels can add up to 44 miles a day to the 388-mile range the car gets between charges, according to the company. Tests carried out by Lightyear suggest people with a daily commute of less than 22 miles could drive for two months in the Netherlands without needing to plug in, while those in sunnier climes such as Portugal or Spain could go as long as seven months. But whether the company’s gamble on solar will pay off remains to be seen, said Jim Saker, professor emeritus at Loughborough University and president of the Institute of the Motor Industry. “You’re having to pay an awful lot of money and have solar panels stuck on the car for just 44 additional miles. The question mark at the moment is the fact that, in reality, is that actually worth it? The actual concept isn’t bad. It’s just whether the technology is actually viable to make it economically sustainable for anybody wanting to do this.” Sales of the Lightyear 0 would probably be limited to a handful of early adopters, he added. “But in reality, it’s not a commercial proposition at the moment.” Others questioned the idea of a car being touted as a salve to the ever deepening climate crisis. “The most sustainable way to approach car ownership is actually to avoid it entirely, if you can at all,” said Vera O’Riordan, a PhD student focusing on low-carbon pathways and policies for passenger transport at University College Cork in Ireland. While electric vehicles may have a limited role to play in rural areas that lack public transport, she cited research suggesting these vehicles are often sold to high-income households in urban areas. “So you have to ask yourself the question: are you serving this individualised, very inefficient, very harmful and traffic-inducing transport in urban areas where it could otherwise be perfectly met by public transport and walking and cycling?” The need to move away from cars to tackle the climate emergency is – perhaps surprisingly – echoed by Lex Hoefsloot, the 31-year-old chief executive of Lightyear, who has raised about €150m in investment to get it running. “It would be great, I fully agree,” he said. “But I think we’re not going to change our lives too much. Perhaps, when we’re really panicking in 20 years, we might. But in the meantime, we have to work around that.” Since 2016 the company has championed solar energy as a key part of this work-around, envisioning solar cars capable of running on clean energy and accelerating the transition away from polluting fossil fuels. “People were saying it wasn’t possible, mostly because of the limited amount of solar power you could get on a car,” said Hoefsloot. His own experience, however, suggested otherwise. The Lightyear 0 – a sleek four-wheel drive – traces its roots to a squat box-on-wheels that ferried four helmet-clad university students across the Australian outback to win in its class in the 2013 world solar challenge. “If it works in Australia, then it works everywhere. That was the thinking,” said Hoefsloot, who founded Lightyear with four other members of the solar challenge team. “Early days, I must admit there was a hesitation whether we should go full car manufacturing, because we all know it’s not the easiest thing. But there was nobody else out there that was really willing to or doing something similar.” In recent years there has been an upswell of interest in integrating solar panels into cars: Mercedes-Benz recently revealed plans to outfit an upcoming electric car with rooftop solar panels, while Toyota has at times offered limited-capacity solar panels as an add-on to its Prius hybrid. Next year, Munich-based Sono Motors plans to roll out a €28,500 solar-assisted family car, while the California-based startup Aptera Motors said in 2020 that preorders for its futuristic three-wheeled solar electric vehicle sold out in less than 24 hours. With months left before the Lightyear 0’s production run, there are still kinks to be worked out, from a stiff steering wheel to the buzz that at times fills the car when the air conditioning kicks in. Once you are in the car, there is little about the driving experience that feels different from other electric cars – “That’s a huge compliment, that’s what we’re aiming for,” one staff member tells me – save for a smattering of reminders about the constant drip feed of solar energy. One screen shows exactly what cells are feeding off the sun at any given moment, while another quantifies how much solar energy is being absorbed. In an effort to use as much of this solar energy as possible, the windswept design eschews side-view mirrors for cameras and runs off lightweight electric motors tucked into its wheels. The body panels are crafted from reclaimed carbon fibre and the interiors are fashioned from vegan, plant-based leather with fabrics made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate bottles. The 20-minute test run is probably the only time I will sit at the wheel of the Lightyear 0. With its hefty price tag – ideally paid by those who have an outdoor parking space to maximise the car’s gain from the sun – it is not a car for the masses. Instead, the company envisions the production run, which will offer up to 946 vehicles for delivery across Europe and the UK, as a beginning of sorts. “This is a small scale to validate to the world that we can produce a car,” said Telian Franken, the prototype team lead. From there, the company will shift its focus to a second solar-assisted electric car it is aiming to sell for about €30,000 as early as 2025. “We’re trying to make the difference, not for the millionaire who can afford a €250,000 car, but to get us to the point where the average person can get off grid – get a reliable sustainable vehicle that beats toe-for-toe any econo-box you can get at the time,” said Franken, citing the Toyota Corolla or Honda Accord as examples. “That’s what we’re trying to beat – and replace – because it’s not sustainable.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2022/jun/24/chinese-premier-calls-for-more-coal-production-as-electricity-demand-soars","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-24T09:56:05Z","webTitle":"Chinese premier calls for more coal production as electricity demand soars","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/chinese-premier-calls-for-more-coal-production-as-electricity-demand-soars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/jun/24/chinese-premier-calls-for-more-coal-production-as-electricity-demand-soars","fields":{"headline":"Chinese premier calls for more coal production as electricity demand soars","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"China’s premier has called for increased production of coal to stave off mass blackouts, as early summer heatwaves have prompted record electricity usage. On Friday, authorities again issued high temperature warnings for about a dozen provinces across the central and northern provinces, after consecutive days in the high 30s. As people sought to escape the heat this week, state media reported, citing the State Grid Corp of China, that electricity demand was up 8.8% in north-west China compared with last year, and by 3.2% in northern China. Records for maximum electricity loads were broken in Shandong, Henan and Jiangsu. The premier, Li Keqiang, “urged tapping into advanced coal capacity, securing power supply and resolutely preventing power outages amid the peak summer season”, according to state media. The reports said Li also called for greater “efforts to ramp up efficient and clean coal power production”. Authorities are hoping to avoid repeats of an energy crisis last year in which there were widespread power cuts, but there are concerns that increased coal production will hamper China’s ability to meet its promises on emissions reductions. In 2020 the government announced a goal of reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. Last month China posted its third consecutive quarter of emission reductions, a feat that analysts said was achieved because of Covid restrictions, curbs on the property development market, and efforts to boost clean energy. China is a major investor in wind and solar, but its electricity system still relies overwhelmingly on coal-fired power, using more than 50% of the total national supply, according to a research paper published in Nature this month. “Although China already features the world’s largest installed power generation capacity for renewable energy, a profound transformation of the power system will still be required over the next 30 years to achieve carbon emission goals,” the paper said. Observers say China’s government has, in practice, renewed its focus on coal-fired electricity to ensure stability, despite the massive investment in wind and solar energy. A confluence of factors contributed to the 2021 crisis, including strict energy rationing designed to meet efficiency targets coming up against energy-intensive infrastructure projects designed to kickstart the pandemic-afflicted economy. The trend towards coal production and energy self-reliance is also being exacerbated by the market volatility resulting from the Ukraine war. The Netherlands, Germany and Austria have made similar moves in response to the energy crisis sparked by Russia’s invasion. “It is fair to say that after the high note set by the carbon neutrality announcement in 2020, China’s climate momentum is waning,” said Li Shuo, a senior global policy adviser for Greenpeace. “It will certainly serve as a delaying factor for China to achieve deep decarbonisation over the long term … Stronger political will is needed to weather China through the current down season of climate action.” Jiang Yi, a Tsinghua University academic and member of the Chinese Communist party’s most recent national climate change expert committee, said the increase in coal production was not inconsistent with the government’s carbon pledges. “Before a perfect new power system has been built and the flexibility and storage capacity of the power system have been completely solved, it is also necessary to rely on coal-fired thermal power to ensure supply,” Yi said. “On the one hand we are grasping supply assurance, and on the other hand we are also vigorously developing zero-carbon energy systems to achieve the replacement of coal. The two are not contradictory.” Sophie Geoghegan, a climate campaigner for the Environmental Investigations Agency, said increasingly common and severe heatwaves around the world were increasing the demand for cooling such air conditioning. “The way that AC is used, as soon as it gets warm, everyone turns theirs on … putting huge strain on the grid, which means that either there are power cuts or peak power is switched on, and peak power is run by coal plants,” she said. “It’s a catch-22: it gets warm, so you turn on your AC, which increases global temps even further. So China has increased coal production to address a rising demand for cooling, but it’s a short-term fix which has long-term implications.” Additional reporting by Xianqian Zhu, Chi Hui Lin and agencies"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/24/morning-mail-albanese-to-meet-with-macron-in-relationship-reset-us-overturns-handgun-law","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-23T21:18:52Z","webTitle":"Morning mail: Albanese to meet with Macron in relationship ‘reset’, US overturns handgun law","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/24/morning-mail-albanese-to-meet-with-macron-in-relationship-reset-us-overturns-handgun-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/24/morning-mail-albanese-to-meet-with-macron-in-relationship-reset-us-overturns-handgun-law","fields":{"headline":"Morning mail: Albanese to meet with Macron in relationship ‘reset’, US overturns handgun law","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Good morning. Anthony Albanese will meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in a relationship “reset”. European leaders have opened the door to EU membership for Ukraine. And the US supreme court has overturned a strict New York handgun law. The US supreme court has made it easier for almost all law-abiding Americans to carry concealed and loaded handguns in public places after the conservative majority struck down a New York law that placed strict restrictions on firearms outside the home. The majority decision renders the New York law an unconstitutional violation of the second amendment right to bear arms. The law had required anyone wanting to carry a handgun in public to prove they had a “proper cause” to do so. Anthony Albanese has confirmed he will visit France to meet Emmanuel Macron and is considering travelling to Ukraine during next week’s trip to Europe for the Nato summit. Albanese said he was also looking forward to “having further dialogue” with the Chinese government, but admitted the relationship would remain “problematic” for some time.“I’ve been invited by president Macron to meet with him in France. I’ll be doing that in a week’s time. We do need to reset. We’ve already had very constructive discussions,” Albanese said. The National Farmers’ Federation has warned the Albanese government not to rush any plan to sign on to Joe Biden’s global methane pledge, declaring the consequences of such a decision taken on the fly “could be calamitous”. Australia’s resources minister, Madeleine King, revealed on Thursday the new government was considering signing the push to limit global methane emissions by 30% from 2020 levels by the end of the decade – an initiative Scott Morrison declined to join. Meanwhile, the Albanese government has extended funding for Australia’s world-leading solar energy scientists. European leaders have granted Ukraine candidate status, in a historic decision that opens the door to EU membership for the war-torn country and deals a blow to Vladimir Putin. EU leaders meeting in Brussels approved Ukraine’s candidate status on Thursday night, nearly four months after the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, launched his country’s bid to join the bloc in the early days of the Russian invasion.

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency will announce on Friday it will grant $45m over the next eight years to the University of NSW-based Australian Centre for Advanced Photovoltaics. Most of the money will be spent within the first five years. The money will ensure as many as 60 scientists will retain funding, although the annual funding is at about the rate of the previous 10-year grant. It will involve two additional partners, the University of Sydney and CSIRO’s Newcastle energy group, and will seek to foster further growth by drawing in commercial partners. “Australia has all the ingredients to become a renewable energy superpower with this Government working collaboratively to ensure secure, affordable and reliable energy that drives down emissions,” the energy minister, Chris Bowen, said. “It’s a global race [and] we’ve for a long time we’ve been at the front of that, and been able to attract people internationally … and that’s still the case,” said Prof Renate Egan, who is UNSW’s lead at the centre. Australian researchers have pioneered a range of solar technologies with as much as 90% of the world’s annual panel production drawing on that pedigree. The Australian National University, the University of Melbourne, Monash University, University of Queensland, and CSIRO’s Clayton unit in Melbourne are partners of the centre. Martin Green, the UNSW professor who has long led the centre’s research, developed cells with a 20% efficiency of converting sunlight to electricity in 1989 and doubled that rate for lab cells by 2014, among a long list of achievements. Centre graduates also pepper many of the world’s big solar firms. “The next decade promises to be the most exciting and important in solar photovoltaics, ever, with massively increased uptake and technological change,” Green said. Egan said solar energy now provides only 3-4% of global electricity and about 15% in Australia. “We need to take that to over 50% here and internationally,” to enable the transition of fossil fuels and limit the impacts of heating climate, she said. “We’re really only just beginning on the solar technology development.” The extended research would help Arena meet its goals of mass production of solar cells with a 30% efficiency at a cost of 30 cents a watt by 2030. Panels on the market now can operate with 23-24% efficiency, at the cost of about 70 cent/watt. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Achieving those goals will not be easy. The new funding will work on so-called tandem cells that stack two or more layers of materials to capture more energy of the spectrum of light, and operate more durably, particularly under higher temperatures. “We know it’s possible, but we’re going to end up with a completely different material set, and a different structure,” Egan said. The need to identify new minerals is driven in part because the present use of silver in particular will soon be challenging for the solar industry globally. With production doubling every three years for the past three decades, the solar PV industry consumes about 10% of the world’s silver in its 200 gigawatts of capacity added yearly. “So we can’t double and double it, otherwise we’re using 50% of the world’s silver, and that would clearly create a supply bottleneck and a price challenge,” Egan said, adding several alternative materials are being worked on but more research is needed. The centre will also look to collaborate more to develop manufacturing capacity in Australia. At 4GW of panels being installed annually, the local market is nearing the volumes necessary to justify onshore production, particularly if plans by Sun Cable and other firms for giant solar farms of 20GW each or larger proceed, she said. Australia’s best prospects might be in silicon refining, with wafer and cell processing done elsewhere and final module work done locally, she said. Richard Corkish, another UNSW professor and the centre’s chief operating officer, said the funding extension will be critical because there are only a few ways the world can reduce emissions from energy use at a pace fast enough to head off the climate crisis. “The big two are solar PV and wind” along with improved energy efficiency, Corkish said. “And in the long term, solar PV will be the one.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/20/heavy-industries-in-australias-regions-could-cut-emissions-by-80-and-create-a-jobs-bonanza-report-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-19T17:30:15Z","webTitle":"Heavy industries in Australia’s regions could cut emissions by 80% and create a jobs bonanza, report says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/heavy-industries-in-australias-regions-could-cut-emissions-by-80-and-create-a-jobs-bonanza-report-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/heavy-industries-in-australias-regions-could-cut-emissions-by-80-and-create-a-jobs-bonanza-report-says","fields":{"headline":"Heavy industries in Australia’s regions could cut emissions by 80% and create a jobs bonanza, report says","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"The regional powerhouses of Australia’s industrial economy could slash their greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% and become centres for multibillion-dollar investments in renewable energy, according to a report backed by some of the country’s biggest companies. Bringing down emissions from producing iron, steel, aluminium, chemicals and liquefied natural gas is seen as one of the most challenging parts of Australia’s efforts to reach net zero. But the report from the Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative (ETI), a partnership between heavy industry and experts working on decarbonisation, says the transition is possible using a range of known technologies, and would bring a jobs bonanza. By introducing a range of technologies along the supply chain, most of them proven and some already commercially available, the report says greenhouse gas emissions could be cut annually by 69.5m tonnes of CO2-equivalent – about 14% of Australia’s current total emissions. Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, an ETI partner, said the steps industries needed to take to get to net zero were “increasingly clear”. “While their costs and difficulties should not be underestimated, the current energy affordability crisis highlights the unsustainable cost of the status quo,” he said. Much of the effort to decarbonise would come from the supply of new renewable energy at a massive scale. Between 68.3 and 125.9 terawatt hours of additional renewable energy would be needed. In 2021, Australia generated 265 TWh of electricity, with a quarter of that coming from renewable sources. According to the report, building the renewable energy infrastructure, including energy storage, and creating a green hydrogen industry to serve the regions could generate between 178,000 and 372,000 jobs, with investment of between $50bn and $100bn. Industry leaders among the 18 partners in ETI said a high level of collaboration and coordination would be needed to achieve the emissions cuts in the Pilbara, Hunter, Illawarra and Gladstone regions. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Anna Skarbek, the chief executive of Climateworks, one of the conveners of ETI, said: “This will require an unprecedented transformation of the energy system.” Emissions in the regions accounted for 16% of Australia’s total carbon footprint, with the largest being the Pilbara in Western Australia – a centre of iron ore and LNG production. In the Pilbara, the report says much of the emissions come from the LNG industry. Managing methane leaks, recovering lost heat and electrifying the process of cooling gas down to liquid form could save about 13Mt of CO2e a year, but up to 7.6Mt would need to be captured and stored using carbon capture and storage technology – an approach which has struggled to be viable despite billions in investments. The second highest emitting region, Gladstone in Queensland, could also save emissions on its LNG export industry. Large emissions cuts could also be made by electrifying processes in the aluminium industry, where other technologies were also in development to save energy. This month, Rio Tinto put out a formal call for wind and solar energy projects before 2030 to power its aluminium operations in Queensland. In the New South Wales Hunter region, heavy industry includes ammonia production and aluminium smelting. Using renewable energy and hydrogen produced from renewables could save up to 9Mt a year there. Christopher Davis is chief financial officer at Orica, a major supplier of explosives, chemicals and services to the mining sector in the Hunter Valley, Gladstone and Pilbara. He said the company understood “the potential economic and environmental opportunities presented by regional decarbonisation”. The company had announced several decarbonisation projects, and he said “we must continue to work collectively to ensure our industry, and Australia, remains competitive in a low-carbon economy”. Other members of the ETI include Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals, BP Australia, BlueScope Steel and the government’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The government’s Australian Renewable Energy Agency part-funded the report. The ETI, run by Climateworks and the consultancy Climate-KIC, worked on the report for two years with its industry partners, CSIRO, BloombergNEF and the Rocky Mountain Institute. Simon McKeon, the chair of ETI and chancellor of Monash University, said Australia could stay competitive in a global economy that was decarbonising. “But this will require coordinated efforts across industry, governments and communities and also the finance and energy sectors,” he said. “It will also need the alignment of policy, regulations and programs to create clear goals and investment confidence.” The Guardian has approached the energy minister, Chris Bowen, for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/20/energy-wake-up-call-rural-power-hacks-keeping-the-farm-gates-open","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-19T17:30:13Z","webTitle":"Energy ‘wake-up call’: rural power hacks keeping the farm gates open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/energy-wake-up-call-rural-power-hacks-keeping-the-farm-gates-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/20/energy-wake-up-call-rural-power-hacks-keeping-the-farm-gates-open","fields":{"headline":"Energy ‘wake-up call’: rural power hacks keeping the farm gates open","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When dairy farmer Paul Mumford milks his herd outside Yarram in Victoria’s South Gippsland early in the morning and late in the afternoon, he’s keenly aware it coincides with peak energy use for the rest of the population. “That doesn’t sit extremely well with the natural flow of the energy use from the grid, because those times are when children are going to school, households are waking up and using energy before and after work,” he says. The president of United Dairyfarmers of Victoria, Mumford says energy is one of the biggest costs for dairy farmers. It’s just not an option to milk 200 cows by hand, and milking the cows twice a day is imperative for his animals’ welfare. A year ago the property lost power for six days in two separate wind storms. “I survived OK because my farm has onsite power generation which connects to my tractor,” he told Guardian Australia. The turning spline on Mumford’s diesel tractor creates a power take-off that turns a generator and creates energy for his dairy shed. However, he says the power outage caught his neighbours out, two of whom had to bring their herds to Mumford’s dairy operation to be milked. He says there’s been an expectation that the electricity would always be there, but for his area the storms were a “big wake-up call”. “Because it’s mandatory to milk cows regularly twice a day, [the storms] left a whole lot of farmers vulnerable.” Mumford says farmers are generally looking at reducing the risk of power outages and shortages to their business, and on-farm power generation is a big part of that. ‘An expensive endeavour’ While energy costs are hitting agricultural industries hard, their vulnerability to energy supply has seen farmers develop unique hacks – and rediscover old ones – to keep the power going without the grid. Ash Salardini, the chief economist at the National Farmers’ Federation, says that dairy, intensive horticulture and irrigation are the industries most exposed to wholesale market prices, which have gone up anywhere between 100% to 140%. Salardini says while irrigation is better placed to manage their electricity use as they can pump water at different times, horticulture and dairy are more vulnerable because they need to regulate their produce at certain temperatures. “Imagine how much electricity your fridge uses. Now imagine you have to cool down 300,000 litres of milk. That’s an expensive endeavour,” Salardini says. He says for intensive horticulture’s climate-controlled greenhouses, “that’s the equivalent of running a reverse-cycle conditioner in an area that might be the size of 50 football fields.” According to Salardini, before the current energy crisis, a typical dairy farmer would have been paying $150,000 in electricity costs a year, but the annual cost would now be up to $250,000. Whether farmers feel the effects of the price spikes immediately depends on when their contract is due to be renewed. ‘A confluence of factors’ Kevin Coady, a wheat farmer outside Dubbo in the New South Wales Orana region, still has a petrol-driven generator he says was more common for farmers to have 20 years ago when blackouts were more frequent. “Nearly everyone on a farm had a back-up generator back then,” he says. However, he says the blackouts don’t occur as often anymore and generators are not as common as they used to be. Yet Salardini says regional areas have often been more liable to energy shortages and farmers can lose an entire day or week’s worth of work if they don’t have refrigeration. According to him, more farmers are turning to on-farm sources of renewable energy including solar, batteries and even biodigesters, which turn waste to energy. Moxey dairy farm at Gooloogong, west of Cowra in the NSW central west, moved to address rising electricity costs back in 2018 by using the gas from cow manure to generate 100% of its power needs. Salardini says farmers are some of the biggest users of photovoltaic energy. Justin Jarrett, the co-owner of See Saw Wines in the central tablelands’ Orange region powers his winery during the day using solar energy. He doesn’t currently have storage capacity for the energy, but tells Guardian Australia that battery storage is the operation’s next step. Salardini says that energy efficiency measures also need to be considered alongside power generation. Stuart Crossthwaite, a dairy farmer in the Kiewa Valley in north-east Victoria, conducted an energy audit, finding that 40% of his dairy’s energy use is to heat hot water for cleaning, 40% to cool the milk and 20% to run equipment. Crossthwaite realised that a heat exchanger method would allow him to use the heat from the milk to warm the water that cleans his dairy. As much as farmers try to keep electricity costs at bay, Salardini says the rising cost of energy is just one factor that is pushing farm gate prices up. Other cost pressures include fuel and freight price hikes and the impact of workforce and workforce shortages. “That’s why we are seeing food price inflation in the supermarkets,” he says. “It’s a confluence of factors, but electricity price is definitely one of them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/live/2022/jun/15/ecb-meets-discuss-bond-rout-markets-tenterhooks-dollar-20-year-peak-fed-rate-decision-business-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-15T13:56:39Z","webTitle":"ECB to devise new tool to help indebted countries as markets await Fed rate rise – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/jun/15/ecb-meets-discuss-bond-rout-markets-tenterhooks-dollar-20-year-peak-fed-rate-decision-business-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/live/2022/jun/15/ecb-meets-discuss-bond-rout-markets-tenterhooks-dollar-20-year-peak-fed-rate-decision-business-live","fields":{"headline":"ECB to devise new tool to help indebted countries as markets await Fed rate rise – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"European stock markets are rallying and Italian, Spanish and Greek bond yields fell sharply, as the European Central Bank announced it would skew reinvestments of maturing debt to help more indebted countries.

America’s central bank is expected to raise rates from 1% by at least 0.50 percentage points, or even 0.75 percentage points (which would be the biggest rate hike since 1994), to tackle soaring inflation, although there are also fears that the economy could tip into recession.

The Japanese owner of the British chip designer Arm is reportedly planning to float some of the company’s shares in London, in a sign the government’s efforts to lobby for a UK listing of the Cambridge-based company may have succeeded.

The “bloodbath” in the cryptocurrency sector may claim another victim, with the co-founder of multibillion dollar hedge fund Three Arrows Capital using Twitter in an attempt to battle rumours that the company is insolvent following the market collapse. Customers of the collapsed fast fashion retailer Missguided will not receive refunds for returns, administrators of the business have confirmed. It comes after the Manchester-based company fell into insolvency last month after racking up millions of pounds in outstanding payments to creditors. Bloomsbury has reported a record year for sales, as the Harry Potter publisher said the increase in reading during the pandemic had become “permanent” after lockdowns eased. The company benefited substantially from Covid restrictions when homebound consumers turned to new hobbies, including reading, to pass the time. Moments after he was announced as the government’s new “cost of living business tsar”, David Buttress, the multimillionaire co-founder and former chief executive of takeaway app company Just Eat, went out into his garden and inspected one of his chickens’ bottom. “Long busy day with some great meetings,” Buttress tweeted on Monday night. “But always great to get home to the real world and ‘dad the chicken isn’t well can you go and check it’s [sic] bum’… keeping it real.” Australia’s main wholesale electricity market has been suspended by regulators in the latest sign that the crisis threatening the stability of energy supplies is deepening.

My colleague in the US, Dominic Rushe, will cover the US rate decision tonight. Thank you for reading. We’ll be back tomorrow. Bye! Here’s some reaction to the surprise 0.3% drop in US retail sales in May. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said: The 0.3% m/m fall in retail sales in May and downward revisions to previous months’ gains suggest that surging prices might finally be taking their toll on real consumption. But with the latter still on course for solid growth of 3% annualised in the second quarter, that won’t stop the Fed from accelerating the pace of policy tightening later today. Headline retail sales were dragged lower by a 3.5% m/m slump in auto sales last month, but that drop reflects the impact of China’s zero-covid lockdowns on Asian manufacturers rather than weakening demand. That decline was partly offset by the price-related 4% rise in nominal gasoline station sales. Factoring in the surge in prices last month, the data suggest that overall real consumption edged slightly lower in May and, with prices likely to see another strong rise in June, a rebound in real spending looks unlikely. That suggests second-quarter real consumption growth will be closer to 3% annualised, rather than the 4% we had previously pencilled in. But 3% real growth is still a respectable performance, and a long way from the collapse being predicted by the usual bearish suspects. The upshot is that there is little to stop the Fed taking more aggressive action to tackle rampant inflation over the next few months. Wall Street has opened higher ahead of the Federal Reserve’s rate decision. The Fed is expected to hike rates from 1% by at least 0.50 percentage points, possibly even by 0.75 percentage points. Dow Jones up 206 points, or 0.7%, to 30,570 S&amp;P 500 up 28 points, or 0.8%, at 3,746 Nasdaq up 140 points, or 1.3%, at 10,968 The European markets have rallied today, boosted by the European Central Bank’s surprise meeting to discuss ways of calming bond markets, and helping more indebted nations like Italy, Spain and Greece. UK’s FTSE 100 up 103 points, or 1.4%, at 7,291 Germany’s Dax up 216 points, or 1.6%, at 13,520 France’s CAC up 86 points, or 1.46%, at 6,036 Italy’s FTSE MiB up 650 points, or nearly 3%, at 22,496 In the US, retail sales fell unexpectedly last month, dragged down by a decline in car purchases. Sales were down 0.3% in May from April, disappointing economists who had expected a small rise of 0.1% or 0.2%, and following a downwardly revised gain of 0.7% in April. The European Central Bank said after a rare unscheduled meeting that it will tilt reinvestments of maturing debt to help more indebted countries, and will devise a new instrument to tackle “fragmentation” of the bond market. Government bond yields have soared across the 19-country currency bloc, especially in southern nations like Italy, Spain and Greece, raising government borrowing costs, since the ECB set out plans last Thursday to raise interest rates in July and September to tame soaring inflation. Here is the full statement: Today the Governing Council met to exchange views on the current market situation. Since the gradual process of policy normalisation was initiated in December 2021, the Governing Council has pledged to act against resurgent fragmentation risks. The pandemic has left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy which are indeed contributing to the uneven transmission of the normalisation of our monetary policy across jurisdictions. Based on this assessment, the Governing Council decided that it will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. In addition, the Governing Council decided to mandate the relevant Eurosystem Committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council. The pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) was launched in March 2020 and ended recently. Italian 10-year bond yields surged to 4.27% on Tuesday, the highest since early 2014, putting them 250 basis points above 10-year German government bonds, but fell back below 4% today ahead of the ECB meeting. The Italian 10-year bond yield has fallen back even more, and is now down 31 basis points on the day at 3.91%, as the ECB is holding an impromptu meeting to discuss possible action to calm bond markets. Time for a lunchtime summary. European stock markets are rallying as the European Central Bank’s governing council is holding an unscheduled two-hour meeting in Frankfurt to discuss the turmoil in bond markets. Government bonds sold off in recent days, driving yields higher, thereby making it more expensive for governments to borrow, especially in Italy and other southern, more indebted countries. The Italian stock market led the rally, up 2.6%, while the UK and German indices rose more than 1% and the French market was up 0.9%. There was relief in bond markets, with the yield on the Italian 10-year bond falling 26 basis points to 3.95%, down from eight-year highs. The question is what the ECB can do. Analysts think the ECB will use an existing tool, for example reinvesting maturing bonds, to stabilise bond markets, rather than announcing a new tool. Spanish and Portuguese bond yields fell by around 13 basis points while Greek yields declined by 25bps to 4.4% in their biggest daily fall since March 2020. The euro rose 0.67% to $1.0482 against the dollar, while the pound also recovered after falling below $1.20 yesterday for the first time since March 2020. Sterling is trading 0.85% higher at $1.2095 at the moment. Investors are also awaiting the US Federal Reserve interest rate decision, to be announced at 7pm BST. The Fed has signalled that it will raise rates again from their current level of 1%; the question is by how much -- 0.50 percentage points or 0.75 percentage points ? To tackle sky-high inflation. Global oil demand is set to rise by 2% to a record high of 101.6m barrels per day in 2023, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, the Paris-based International Energy Agency forecast today -- although it also warned that high oil prices (Brent crude is currently at $120 a barrel) and a weaker economic outlook would weigh on oil demand in coming months. Economic fears persist, as various international institutions have recently released downbeat outlooks. Similarly, tightening central bank policy, the impact of a soaring US dollar and rising interest rates on the purchasing power of emerging economies mean the risks to our outlook are concentrated on the downside. Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at ING, said: As we await the outcome of the European Central Bank’s unscheduled meeting to discuss ‘current market conditions’, we take in some of the latest data on the economy. The ECB has committed to hikes in July and September to stave off high inflation, but the eurozone economy itself remains weak at best at the moment. Industrial production data for April confirms this as the increase of 0.4% leaves production below the first quarter average. The small increase was driven by most of the larger countries with Germany, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands all seeing production grow faster than average. France saw a small decline of -0.1%. Across production categories, only capital goods production shrank a little while most of the others improved. Overall, the environment for industry remains lacklustre. It is still dealing with large amounts of backlogs that guarantee production for the months ahead, but supply chain problems continue to cause delays for certain product groups. At the same time, demand is weakening as new orders are falling according to the most recent surveys on eurozone industry. Input price inflation, which is barely abating, adds to the squeeze that manufacturing businesses find themselves in for now. In addition to industry data, trade data has also just been released. The trade in goods balance dropped much more than expected to -31.7 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis. The trade balance has deteriorated quickly thanks to high energy prices due to the war and this adds to euro weakness right now. Returning to the European Central Bank’s surprise meeting (which was due to start at 11am local time in Frankfurt and last two hours) to discuss the recent sell-off in bond markets... Analysts at Daiwa said: To give a flavour as to what to expect from the Governing Council today, yesterday evening the Executive Board’s key hawk Isabel Schnabel echoed recent comments by [president] Christine Lagarde that the ECB has “no limits” to tackle bond market fragmentation risks. She also insisted that the ECB “will not tolerate changes in financing conditions that go beyond fundamental factors”, and “monetary policy can and should respond to a disorderly repricing of risk premia that impairs the transmission of monetary policy”. But she added “How we ultimately react… will firmly depend on the situation we are facing”, suggesting no willingness to give any information about its reaction function in advance. So, expect a similar message to Schnabel’s to be endorsed by the whole Governing Council today. That might provide a modicum of reassurance to markets. But no new policy tool will be unveiled. Indeed, the Governing Council will reportedly focus discussions on the mechanics of how PEPP [pandemic emergency purchase programme] reinvestments – a relatively modest instrument – can be deployed to support strained markets, while leaving the door open to the possibility that new tools can be developed flexibly in future if necessary. So, the markets will be left in the dark as to whether, for example, any substantive conditionality would be attached to any new ECB support – additional to reinvestments – for strained sovereigns. And markets should also assume that any support forthcoming would be concentrated largely at the shorter end of the yield curve, which is most relevant for the monetary transmssion mechanism, rather than at the longer end. (Christine Lagarde is also currently scheduled to talk publicly this evening, but it remains to be seen whether that appointment will be fulfilled.) The ECB will certainly not adjust its commitment to raise rates by 25bps in July and probably more in September. However, it could try to push back somewhat against expectations that aggressive tightening is likely in Q4 and beyond, which a lower trajectory for rates seeming appropriate if the ECB now sees a greater risk that Fed tightening will push the US (and perhaps the world economy) into recession next year. The eurozone’s trade deficit with the rest of the world almost doubled in April from the previous month, after a record expansion in March, while industrial production expanded, official figures show. The 19 countries sharing the euro ran up a trade deficit of €32.4bn in April, up sharply from €16.4bn in March, according to the EU’s statistics office Eurostat. It compares with a surplus of €14.9bn in April 2021. Exports rose 12.6% from a year earlier but imports jumped 39.4%, driven by a surge in energy imports. Meanwhile, industrial production in the eurozone rose 0.4% in April from March, a modest rise. Whitbread is among the main risers on the FTSE 100, after the owner of Premier Inn and pub restaurants traded ahead of expectations in the UK and Germany. The shares rose 4.7%. Premier Inn is the UK’s biggest budget hotel chain and competes mainly with Travelodge. It is struggling to recruit more staff, and is investing up to £30m in pay rises, IT and hotel refurbishments this year. Chief executive Alison Brittain said: The strength of Premier Inn’s recovery in the UK continues to be ahead of expectations with a particularly strong first-quarter performance that is well ahead of pre-pandemic levels and we continue to significantly outperform the market. Labour supply remains tight across the hospitality sector and assuming that consumer demand and occupancy remain strong, we expect some additional costs due to targeted pay increases. We are also taking the opportunity to bring forward our investment in refurbishments and maintenance projects as well as accelerate some additional IT spend that will underpin our market leading position and drive future earnings. WH Smith is similarly upbeat, as its third-quarter revenues rose above pre-pandemic levels for the first time, with more people travelling to work and a surge in tourism. The UK retailer, which has stores on high streets, at airports and railway stations, and sells a wide range of items -- from stationery, books, magazines and sandwiches to Bluetooth headphones -- expects its full-year performance to hit the higher end of analysts’ forecasts. Revenues in the 15 weeks to 11 June were ahead of 2019 levels for the first time at 107%. Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group, said: This is a solid and promising trading update from WHSmith, with the retailer trading ahead of 2019 revenue with a particularly strong performance from its travel division, reflective of the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. As passenger numbers recover around the world, WHSmith will look to enhance its ranges in health and beauty and technology to capitalise on post-lockdown opportunities. In other news, Bloomsbury has reported a record year for sales, as the Harry Potter publisher said the pandemic rise in reading had become “permanent” after lockdown measures eased. The company benefited substantially from Covid restrictions when homebound consumers turned to new hobbies, including reading, to pass the time, reports my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff. Bloomsbury’s chief executive, Nigel Newton, said it was clear that people who picked up a reading habit during the pandemic were continuing to buy books, helping to push annual sales up 24% to record highs of £230m for the year to the end of February. The International Energy Agency has warned that higher oil prices and recession fears will hold back global demand for oil -- while predicting that demand will recover to pre-pandemic levels next year as China’s economy bounces back. The Paris-based agency said in its monthly report: Economic fears persist, as various international institutions have recently released downbeat outlooks. Similarly, tightening central bank policy, the impact of a soaring US dollar and rising interest rates on the purchasing power of emerging economies mean the risks to our outlook are concentrated on the downside. Higher oil prices and a weaker economic outlook continue to temper our oil demand growth expectations. But in 2023, a resurgent China will boost non-OECD demand growth, offsetting a slowdown in the OECD. World oil demand is forecast to reach 101.6m barrels per day in 2023, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Wilson added: The ECB is kind of stealing the thunder from the Fed today but the US central bank is still the major market event. A lot of banks have changed their forecasts to a 75bps hike and market pricing has move aggressively in that direction. However, I still prefer a 50bps move with the Fed maintaining optionality to do more 50bps hikes for the rest of the year – a strong signal for one in September. Ahead of the meeting the US 10-year yield rose to almost 3.5%, its highest in 11 years, whilst the 2-year yield climbed to 3.45%, a 15-year high. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said about the ECB’s surprise meeting to discuss the recent sell-off in government bond markets: Given there was a scheduled meeting last week, it smacks of panic and a lack of control, but the market is happy to see it happen. European bank shares rose and the euro also rallied, whilst Italian yields came back down. The ECB is clearly worried that ‘peripheral’ bond yields are rising too much...but this is all a bit of a mess coming so soon after the scheduled meeting last week. Here we get to the fragmentation risk and a possible new tool we thought they might signal last week, but didn’t. The spread between Italian and German 10-year yields has widened to more than 240 basis points, the widest since March 2020 as the Italian 10-year BTP climbed over 4%. Italian yields have fallen back sharply on the ECB update this morning, however. Italian stocks rallied handsomely, too. What could the ECB do? That is the big question. The ECB could probably first reassure the market that it will do ‘whatever it takes’ to prevent fragmentation, but given this meeting has been called abruptly then it might actually feel that it needs to intervene with a new tool – perhaps a yield spread cap of some sort. Or it could reinvest cash from maturing bonds into those sovereign bond markets that need it. This would undoubtedly introduce political risk and would be challenged in the German courts, as would any new tool. Or it could just QE forever... tricky when you are supposed to be tightening financial conditions. For today it might be enough to tell the market it is working on a new tool/plan in this regard – the lack of detail last week means the Governing Council has not discussed this much and so it might be too early for a specific tool/policy to be announced – plus it has the political and legal dimension to consider too. ECB policymaker Isabel Schnabel said: “Our commitment to the euro is our anti-fragmentation tool. This commitment has no limits.” For a second time, [ECB president Christine] Lagarde has to make sure the market knows the ECB is here to close ze spreads. The fact the ECB didn’t bother with this last week is mystery and shows it is still far too complacent and unwilling to get ahead of the curve. On the commodity markets, gas prices are rising while crude oil prices are little changed. British wholesale gas for day-ahead delivery has risen more than 8% to 180p per therm. Yesterday, Russia’s state monopoly Gazprom said it was cutting natural gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline by 40%, according to Interfax. It said its capacity to supply gas was constrained by the delayed return of equipment that had been sent for repair by Siemens Energy. Gazprom said: Due to the delayed return of gas pumping units by Siemens from repair, testing of the service life of the GPUs [gas pumping units] and identified technical malfunctions of the engines, only three GPUs can now be used at the ‘Portova’ compressor station. This has prompted Gazprom to reduce gas supplies to up to 100m cubic metres instead of the usual 167m cm. Gazprom no longer exports gas westwards through Poland via the Yamal-Europe pipeline following Russian sanctions against EuRoPol Gaz, which owns the Polish section. Flows via Yamal-Europe continue eastwards from Germany to Poland. There are also fears of liquefied natural gas shortages, after Freeport LNG, operator of one of the largest US export plants producing LNG, said it would shut for at least three weeks after an explosion at its Texas Gulf coast facility last week. Schmieding goes on to say: Mind the fundamentals: Some spread widening amid an overall rise in yields is normal. As long as it remains consistent with the inflation backdrop and the pace of nominal growth, it should not present an imminent risk even for fiscally challenged Italy. We expect inflation to settle around 2.5% eventually. Adjusting for such an inflation forecast, the real financing costs of Italy are still quite bearable. Inflation lifts tax receipts and reduces the real value of outstanding debt. Walking a tightrope to a soft landing: Engineering a soft landing for economies battered by external shocks and facing the highest inflation in decades will be as hard as it sounds for all major central banks. The extra challenge for the ECB is that its policies affect borrowing costs in 19 economies with different fundamentals. The ECB seems to believe that it can deter excessive “fragmentation” through “constructive ambiguity”, that is by simply warning markets that it may step in under unspecified circumstances. But markets hate uncertainty. They may want to test the ECB’s resolve. To contain the risk of further turmoil that may hurt confidence and economic performance across the Eurozone, the ECB needs to answer two key questions: 1) exactly what tool would it use to prevent excessive fragmentation; and 2) what is the threshold for using it? If the ECB pulls that off, it will have an easier time pursuing its ultimate goal of returning Eurozone inflation to a sustainable rate while running a lower risk of serious economic damage in doing so. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, explains: Periphery under pressure: Even before the European Central Bank (ECB) has hiked rates, Italian, Greek, Spanish and Portuguese spreads versus German bunds are widening amid a broad-based tightening of financial conditions across the Eurozone. With memories of the European debt crisis still fresh, investors are asking how and under what circumstances ECB president Christine Lagarde would deliver on the promise she made in her blog from 23 May to act against “excessive fragmentation” if required after the end of net asset purchases. Markets sold off after the ECB’s monetary policy statement last Thursday referred only vaguely to a “flexible” use of instruments to safeguard the transmission of monetary policy. In an emergency meeting today, the ECB may finally reveal its hand. Still far off euro crisis 2.0: The situation today is different from the euro crisis a little more than a decade ago. 1) The ECB has turned into a proper lender of last resort with a tool called “OMT” to intervene heavily for countries that are granted support from the ESM [European Stability Mechanism]. 2) Many economies have improved their trend growth through reforms. For example, Greece and Portugal are consistently outperforming the eurozone average with real GDP in Q1 2022 surpassing the pre-pandemic level Q4 2019 by 3.0% and 1.2% respectively, well ahead of the Eurozone as a whole (0.8%) and a still largely unreformed Italy (0.0%). 3) NextGenEU grants of between 5% (Italy) and 9% (Greece) of annual GDP will support public investment and growth over the next four years. 4) Italy’s spread remains well below previous crisis levels. Italian bond yields have fallen back on the news that the European Central Bank’s rate-setting governing council will hold an unscheduled meeting this morning to discuss the recent sell-off in government bonds, which had pushed yields sharply higher. Investors breathed a sigh of relief, after government borrowing costs across the eurozone jumped to multi-year highs this week -- amid growing expectations of an aggressive US interest rate hike later today, and concern about the lack of an ECB plan to tackle signs of strain in eurozone bond markets. The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond fell 20 basis points to 4%, down from eight-year highs hit this week. Spanish, Portuguese and Greek bond yields were also down sharply in early London trade. The euro rose on the news and is currently trading 0.6% higher at $1.0477 against the dollar. Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management, told Reuters: We should get a statement along the lines reflecting a willingness to act and then maybe they will also task committees to work on options, this is what was missing from last week [when the ECB had a scheduled meeting]. ECB board member Isabel Schnabel, the head of the central bank’s market operations, said yesterday that the ECB was “closely” monitoring the situation and was ready to deploy both existing and new tools if it found that the market moves were “disorderly”. And we’re off. European shares have notched up some decent gains at the open, following increases in several Asian markets (Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1% while Japan’s Nikkei edged down 0.1%). UK’s FTSE 100 up 58 points, or 0.8%, to 7,425 Germany’s Dax up 1.3% France’s CAC up 1.3% Spain’s Ibex up 1.5% Italy’s FTSE MiB up 650 points, or 2.9%, at 22,495 Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. Markets are on tenterhooks, and the dollar hit a 20-year peak ahead of the interest rate decision from the US Federal Reserve later today. Investors are waiting to see how aggressive America’s central bank will be in raising rates, with fears that a bigger hike could tip the economy into recession. The question is whether the Fed will raise its main interest rate, currently at 1%, by 0.50 or 0.75 percentage points to tackle soaring inflation. The latter would be the biggest increase since 1994. The dollar hit a 20-year high against a basket of currencies, and rose to 135.60 against the yen, the highest since 1998. The European Central Bank is to hold an unscheduled meeting this morning to discuss the recent sell-off in government bond markets. Bond yields have risen sharply since the ECB promised a series of rate rises last Thursday and the spread between the yields of German bonds and those of more indebted southern nations, particularly Italy, soared to the highest in more than two years. Stock markets have been plunging in recent days, and on Wall Street the benchmark S&amp;P 500 fell almost 4% into bear territory on Monday. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: Against a backdrop of sky-high inflation, rising rates and growing recession concerns, the S&amp;P 500 has had its worst start to the year since 1962. A likely coming peak in inflation is probably not sufficient to see the bottom, and in the past similar drawdowns have only ended when the Fed has shifted towards easier policy. The pound fell yesterday to its lowest level against the dollar since the onset of the Covid pandemic amid growing concern over the strength of the British economy. It traded below $1.20 for the first time since March 2020, as the dollar strengthened, but is back above $1.20 this morning. The Bank of England is expected to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points on Thursday, lifting its base rate to 1.25%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: A responsible Fed would look to wrestle back the narrative and do what it said it would do, which means we need to see 50 basis points today, with a hawkish pivot at the very least, especially if it wants to be taken seriously when it comes to future guidance. It’s also not apparent what a pivot to 75bps would achieve when the Fed could simply deliver a 50bps hike today and then throw the prospect of 75bps into the hat for July, as well as September. Given that market pricing had been for a possible pause in September that is still a hawkish pivot, and guidance tends to be half the battle when it comes to policy adjustments. As such it seems more likely we’ll see a 50bps move today, along with hawkish guidance for 75bps in July, as well as September, but very much dependant on the data. There was some good news out of China, where the economy showed signs of recovery, as industrial output grew 0.7% in May from a year earlier, after falling 2.9% in April, according to official figures released today. China’s exports grew in double digits last month, as factories cranked up again following the easing of Covid restrictions. However, consumer spending remains weak because of China’s zero-Covid policy, with full or partial lockdowns in dozens of cities in March and April. Retail sales fell 6.7% in May, an improvement from April’s 11.1% slump. Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING, said: Activity data paints an economic recovery picture in May, but only a slow one. The government is likely to respond to this economic weakness by delivering more fiscal stimulus. In Asia, stocks were mixed and European markets are expected to open slightly firmer after the better-than-expected Chinese data.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) took the drastic step of suspending the entire national electricity market for the first time in its history on Wednesday. “Aemo has determined that it is necessary to suspend the spot market in all regions [of the NEM] because it has become impossible to operate” the market within the rules, the regulator said. The NEM covers all of Australia except for the Northern Territory and Western Australia. In the hours prior to the suspension, Aemo had issued a flurry of lack of reserve alerts at the level 3 warning for all the mainland states within the market. “Prior to suspending the market today, Aemo had issued over 5,000MW of directions and that is roughly 20% of demand,” Aemo’s chief executive, Daniel Westerman, said in Adelaide. On Wednesday evening, the NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, told Sydney residents to reduce usage between 5.30pm and 8pm to reduce the risk of blackouts. The latest Aemo forecasts for potential shortfalls in supply cited 8.30pm as a period of concern and flagged a possible intervention to order more generation as late as an hour earlier. “If there is an opportunity to reduce their energy usage like not using their dishwasher until they go to bed, that would help,” Kean told NSW consumers. A number of coal-fired power stations that were expected to be working on Wednesday night had not come online, he said. The Vivid Sydney event, with light shows around the city’s harbour region, would still proceed. The market scheme to pay big energy users to cut their power use had also been activated in NSW on Wednesday, Aemo said. Significant shortfalls in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia were avoided on Wednesday but more were forecast for Thursday. Victoria’s energy minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, said the market suspension was “to protect energy users and put certainty back into the market”. “It is disappointing that energy generators were potentially gaming the system and not utilising the options available to them – this behaviour is unacceptable and will be investigated,” D’Ambrosio said. The market suspension came as Aemo and other members of the Energy Security Board – the energy market commission and the energy regulator – were scheduled to have an urgent meeting on Wednesday afternoon with generators to discuss supply. Aemo, as the meeting’s host, cancelled the gathering once it decided to suspend the spot market. Both the commission and the regulator had in the past day reiterated the importance of generators providing supply to the tight market, even with price caps of $300/MWh now imposed on all five states. Generators have denied gaming the market by withdrawing supply, saying the price caps had affected the profitability of some bids but they would follow orders if instructed to generate power to avoid blackouts. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, has previously warned power generators that anyone using the current crisis to engage in market manipulation will face action from regulators wielding the “full force of their powers”. Bowen has previously blamed former Coalition governments for a “decade of denial and delay” and almost 24 energy policies that they failed to implement. In the absence of a national scheme, the states have increasingly pursued their own policies, particularly to encourage the uptake of renewable energy to cut carbon emissions but also to replace ageing coal plants that were mostly nearing the end of their designed operational lives. In a statement, Westerman noted that about 3,000MW of coal-fired power plant capacity was offline through unplanned outages alone, while others were having scheduled maintenance breaks. The early onset of winter had also increased demand for electricity and gas, while wind and solar energy output had been down at times. “In the current situation suspending the market is the best way to ensure a reliable supply of electricity for Australian homes and businesses,” Westerman said. “The situation in recent days has posed challenges to the entire energy industry, and suspending the market would simplify operations during the significant outages across the energy supply chain.” The market suspension was temporary, but it is unclear when it will resume under normal rules. “We are seeing very challenging times … the market is not able to deal with all the factors thrown at it,” Westerman said. “Frankly those factors are quite extreme.” The imposition of price caps across the market starting from last Sunday in Queensland – as required under the rules once spot prices exceeded a set threshold – was a key reason the market broke down, said Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of Melbourne. “If not for those price caps, we wouldn’t be here now,” McConnell said. The cap set at $300MWh to protect consumers was less than the cost of generation for some plants. As a result, there was a “runaway” process of ever more suppliers pulling out of the market only to then be instructed to provide power by the regulators, he said. “That feedback loop really escalated in the past 48 hours.” Paul McArdle, an analyst with Global-Roam and author of the WattClarity website, said the market suspension was “certainly on the cards” the way it had been operating in the past few days. “The question is, does it make it work better given the underlying physical problems,” McArdle said. The spate of shortfalls warnings did not imply blackouts were close given the ability of regulators to demand supply. “You shouldn’t scare the troops,” he said. McArdle said the suspension was needed because under the existing rules the price threshold could have lasted weeks if not longer. The price limits are imposed when spot prices reach almost $1.4m over 2016 five-minute intervals over a rolling seven-day period. When the market was suspended, prices in Queensland had topped $9m, NSW about $8m, Victoria $4.5m and South Australia $3.9m, he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The managing director of consultancy Energy Edge, Joshua Stabler, said the way the Australian Energy Markets Commission compensated generators forced to supply electricity at a price lower than their costs had fed “distrust” among suppliers. “It’s that lack of trust in terms of how they are getting paid that causes the issue,” Stabler said prior to the market’s suspension. On the one hand, companies forced to use high-cost gas would be losing money by using it to generate electricity. At $40 a gigajoule, the cost of producing a MWh of power would be about $440 but the price cap was only $300. Stabler said the public messaging needed to be sorted out, not least because the market strains could last through winter. “The response to the threat makes it look like we’re in a blackout state when we’re not,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2022/jun/15/global-fossil-fuel-giant-bp-buys-40-of-us30bn-pilbara-renewable-energy-project","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-14T23:00:14Z","webTitle":"Global fossil fuel giant BP buys 40% of US$30bn Pilbara renewable energy project ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/15/global-fossil-fuel-giant-bp-buys-40-of-us30bn-pilbara-renewable-energy-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2022/jun/15/global-fossil-fuel-giant-bp-buys-40-of-us30bn-pilbara-renewable-energy-project","fields":{"headline":"Global fossil fuel giant BP buys 40% of US$30bn Pilbara renewable energy project ","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Global fossil fuel company BP has bought 40.5% of a renewable energy hub in the Pilbara, billed as having potential to become one of the biggest suppliers of green hydrogen in the world. The company will also operate the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, which has plans to generate up to 26GW of wind and solar energy – about a third of the electricity generated in Australia today. Areh is in its early stages, but once complete – a task that will require up to US$30bn in funding – its backers expect it to be capable of producing 1.6m of “green hydrogen” from renewable sources a year. No financial details of the deal were announced, with a BP spokesperson saying the amount invested was commercial in confidence. However, market sources said that because Areh was at an early stage it was currently worth less than $100m. BP and other investors in the project – InterContinental Energy, CWP Global and Macquarie Group – are betting on a rapid increase in demand for renewable energy. Iron ore mining in the Pilbara is energy intensive and generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions, which big miners including BHP and Rio Tinto are keen to reduce. However, Areh is also designed to export hydrogen to customers overseas. BP predicts that at full capacity the Areh would be able to abate 17m tonnes of carbon a year. The company’s executive vice-president of gas and low carbon energy, Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, said Areh could become a “cornerstone project”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Areh is set to be one of the largest renewable and green hydrogen energy hubs in the world and can make a significant contribution to Australia and the wider Asia Pacific region’s energy transition,” she said. “It truly reflects what integrated energy is – combining solar and onshore wind power with hydrogen production and using it to help transform sectors and regions. “It also reflects our belief that Australia has the potential to be a powerhouse in the global energy transition, benefiting from both its existing infrastructure and abundant renewable energy resources.” Areh’s existing backers will continue to own a stake in the project, with InterContinental Energy holding 26.4%, CWP Global 17.8% and Macquarie 15.3%. CWP Global’s chief executive, Alex Hewitt, said BP would bring “a new level of engineering knowhow and technical expertise” in developing complex projects in remote locations. “At full capacity, Areh will require upwards of US$30B in project finance,” he said. “The race to green energy is on. Recent months have demonstrated the uncertainty and disruption that comes with over-reliance on fossil fuels. “Green hydrogen is a critical pathway for enhancing energy security and decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, like mining, steel-making and long-range shipping.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/live/2022/jun/14/australia-news-live-updates-power-shortfall-blackouts-warning-energy-crisis-escalates-robert-hughes-release-anthony-albanese-socceroos-aemo","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-14T08:46:25Z","webTitle":"Australia news live updates: Queensland on brink of power outage as eastern states battle big chill; WA to shut state-owned coal plants","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2022/jun/14/australia-news-live-updates-power-shortfall-blackouts-warning-energy-crisis-escalates-robert-hughes-release-anthony-albanese-socceroos-aemo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/live/2022/jun/14/australia-news-live-updates-power-shortfall-blackouts-warning-energy-crisis-escalates-robert-hughes-release-anthony-albanese-socceroos-aemo","fields":{"headline":"Energy ministers trade barbs amid flurry of warning notices – as it happened","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"We are going to put this little blog to bed now.

Penny Wong headed to New Zealand on fifth international trip since taking office The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is about to embark on her fifth international trip since taking office last month. Her New Zealand counterpart, Nanaia Mahuta, announced that she would welcome Wong for an in-person meeting this Thursday, saying “deep cooperation and partnerships” would stand both countries in good stead. In a statement reported by New Zealand media, Mahuta said the formal bilateral talks with Wong would provide “an opportunity for new conversations on ways to advance our partnership”. Mahuta said climate change was the “number one security issue” for the Pacific: I look forward to talking to the new foreign minister in more detail on Australia’s climate change agenda, and further ways we can assist Pacific Island nations on mitigation and adaptation measures. On broader Pacific challenges, Aotearoa New Zealand seeks to elevate the Pacific Island voice, and support collaboration and partnership through established institutions, especially the Pacific Islands Forum. As Katharine Murphy observed in this dispatch from Indonesia last week, Wong has hit the ground running. The day she was sworn in as foreign affairs minister, Wong flew with the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to Tokyo for the long-scheduled Quad leaders’ summit. Her second trip, later in that same week, was to Fiji, where she made Australia’s case to be the region’s parter of choice amid growing competition with China for influence. Wong’s third trip was to both Samoa and Tonga. In her fourth trip, Wong travelled with Albanese to Indonesia last week. Wong’s forthcoming trip to New Zealand follows Albanese’s meetings with Jacinda Ardern in Sydney on Thursday and Friday. The new prime minister has promised to consider changing the way the section 501 visa cancellation policy is applied to address New Zealand’s concerns. Daniel Hurst’s file is here: NSW to set up fund for environmental offset credits, in part to compensate for state renewable energy projects A new $106.7m NSW government fund dedicated to buying and selling biodiversity credits in the state’s environmental offset market will be used to help the Perrottet government compensate for habitat clearing for its renewable energy zones. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, and the environment minister, James Griffin, announced the forthcoming state budget would include an investment to establish a biodiversity credits supply fund within the NSW planning and environment department. Currently, developers looking to offset the environmental impacts of projects can purchase offset credits from private landholders who protect their properties for conservation under an agreement with the state government. The new fund will see the state government purchase credits and sell them on to developers. The government says the fund will serve several purposes, including ensuring that there is an “efficient and trusted” source of credits and that there is a supply of credits available to offset projects when they are needed. Griffin said it was also intended to meet the offset requirements for large infrastructure projects the state government has in the pipeline, including its five planned renewable energy zones. He said the fund would create a significant increase in the supply of available credits that could be used for projects that were important to the community. Griffin said: This means the NSW government will be securing more habitat for threatened species and ecosystems sooner, effectively bringing forward environmental benefits. ASX200 ends trading down 3.6%, the biggest single-day drop in two years Meanwhile in those other, bigger markets, such as the ASX, it’s been a grim day. The ASX200 benchmark of (you guessed it) 200 top companies on the stock market lost 3.6%, which apparently is the biggest single-day drop in just over two years. It could have been worse, though, after the market opened a tad more than 5.2% lower. Asian markets were down too, but more in the 1-2% range. That’s partly because they were trading on Monday – while Australia was mostly on holiday – and took a chunk of their losses then. The big Australian banks all had another sour day. Despite some investors saying banks don’t mind higher interest rates, if they rise too fast, there’s more chance of bad debts and, of course, slower overall economic growth. It wasn’t much more than a week ago that CBA, Australia’s biggest bank, was worth $105 a share. Today it closed at $91.20, denting the values of many a superfund that holds it. Federal MPs and public officer holders to receive 2.75% pay rise Federal MPs and public office holders have been granted a 2.75% pay increase from 1 July, with a backbencher set to receive a base salary of $217,060. The remuneration tribunal, which independently sets the pay of statutory officers and other public officials, ordered the 2.75% pay increase. It’s an improvement on last year – when no increase was ordered – but still a distance short of inflation, which was already 5.1% in headline terms or 3.7% in underlying terms at the time of the last budget. It has only increased since then, and that means pollies (like many others) have suffered a real pay cut. In its decision on MPs’ pay, the tribunal said: While the work performed by the wide variety of offices in the tribunal’s jurisdiction, including members of parliament, is diverse and unique, the tribunal is conscious of ensuring that relativities within the group of offices for which it determines remuneration remain consistent. Consistent with previous decisions the tribunal maintains the view that the pay of parliamentarians should increase relative to that of other public office holders, and thus the decision to determine an adjustment for the office holders in the tribunal’s jurisdiction generally will also apply to parliamentarians. For the approximately 2.7 million Australians whose pay is set by the national minimum wage (currently $20.33 an hour) or related award minimums, the Fair Work Commission will announce its decision at 10am on Wednesday. This is pretty opaque if you’re not part of the energy cognoscenti, but Peter Hannam (who most assuredly is), tells me this is a “warning shot” ... Big energy users in Queensland and NSW to cut down use as Aemo warns of energy supply gaps The Australian Energy Market Operator has several tricks up its regulatory sleeves when it comes to ensuring we don’t get blackouts in a tight market. One is the daintily named Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (or Rert, NOT Rort), which is a pre-arranged list of big energy users that agree to reduce load in a power pinch – and collect some payment for helping out. Yesterday, the Rert was activated for Queensland and it’s been done again, for most of the rest of today. Interestingly, the same request is being made in NSW for about the same period. We learned yesterday that Rio Tinto’s Boyne Smelter was not part of the scheme, but we have to assume other big power users will be. Some, of course, can’t turn off the power for too long – such as aluminium* smelters, as their potlines turn solid after a couple of hours and are then useless. (*Not to be confused with aluminum, which is the Yanks’ accidental typo, when Alcoa lodged its company name and left out the ‘i’ by mistake.) That is a cracking headline ... There’s a national cabinet planned for Friday, and you can be certain that energy will feature highly, for reasons that may be more acute by week’s end. Aside from blaming the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison government, the Albanese government will need to come up with more of the “way forward”. Part of that may be the Transition Plan, or even gas storage options floated by the energy minister, Chris Bowen, after energy ministers had their first post-election gathering last week. (It wasn’t the “emergency” meeting as some described.) To make up for the lack of federal Labor v Coalition stoush at the cabinet meeting, the various states might bring a bit of their own banter to the table. On Tuesday, NSW energy minister, Matt Kean, seemed to be laying at least some of the blame for the current electricity squeeze on the neighbours to the north. “Obviously, there’s been some big challenges in Queensland,” Kean told reporters including Guardian Australia’s own Tamsin Rose. “They’ve had an unusually cold winter and a number of the big generators have gone out of the system. That’s putting increasing pressure on the NSW generators.” Not surprisingly, his Queensland counterpart, Mick de Brenni, was not overly impressed. “Queensland has been doing the heavy lifting for the entire east coast, whether it’s on supplying gas to NSW and Victoria, to opening up more gas fields for exploration,” de Brenni told journalists. (After that riposte, de Brenni wanted to “reassure all Queenslanders that the system is operating ... We don’t expect there to be widespread outages.”) Meanwhile, Victoria’s power pinch is forecast for tomorrow evening at this stage. In news to darken the soul of Queensland senator and wannabe coalminer Matt Canavan, Western Australia has joined the rush to dump the fossil fuel from its electricity sector. According to the ABC, the McGowan Labor government will exit coal in its grid before 2030 and pour billions of dollars into renewable energy. In a “landmark announcement” this afternoon, the premier, Mark McGowan, and energy minister, Bill Johnston, said state-owned power provider Synergy would shut its remaining coal-fired plants by 2029. Synergy currently owns and runs two coal-fired power stations, the 854Mw Muja plant and the 340Mw Collie plant, both near Collie some 200km south of Perth, ABC said. Something else to chew over at the national cabinet gathering this week. Tasmanian Greens leader tables petition calling on government to end subsidies for greyhound racing The Greens leader in Tasmania, Cassy O’Connor, has tabled a petition in that state’s parliament calling for an end to government subsidies for the greyhound industry. It was a great honour to table a record-breaking petition condemning the brutal greyhound racing industry in parliament today. This is an industry that wouldn’t survive without tens of millions in taxpayer money. More than 13,500 Tasmanians signed the e-petition to end the subsidies to greyhound racing – making it the biggest e-petition in Tasmanian parliamentary history. The public know this industry has cruelty at its core and want no part in paying for it. The momentum to end the cruelty of greyhound racing is gathering as the industry continues to lose its social license. Tasmanians have spoken, and the Rockliff government is on notice. This industry, that breeds dogs to die or cast aside when they don’t run fast enough, has had its time. The Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds – which is backing the petition – has detailed 64 deaths of greyhounds on Australian racing tracks this year, and 4573 injuries. There were 213 greyhound deaths from racing in 2021. Judge rebukes Pauline Hanson staffer James Ashby for being ‘evasive’ during defamation trial Senator Brian Burston was alleged to have been a “serial text pest” and worse (read on)... Guardian reporter Michael McGowan has filed from the federal court on Burston’s defamation case against his former boss, Pauline Hanson. Hanson’s staffer James Ashby was accused by a judge of being “evasive” in his evidence. The disgraced Hey Dad! actor and convicted child sexual offender Robert Hughes has been released from Sydney’s Long Bay jail and is expected to be deported immediately to the UK. There’s still a flurry of notices from the Australian Energy Market Operator this afternoon, as the electrons flow around the national electricity market. (Note SA is still paying users to take its power.) The market, though, remains tight, with a total of five “lack of reserve – level 3” notices issued for NSW for later today and into Wednesday. Each has a possible shortfall of supply. Tasmania, meanwhile, has joined its mainland counterparts in facing a supply gap within the next day or so. It’s the only one of the five states without a price cap imposed by Aemo (though at the $15,100/megawatt-hour maximum rate it was charging for its power earlier today, it might not be long before it joins the others with a forced $300/Mwh limit). Another long evening ahead for regulators (and bloggers). Far-right extremism less closely monitored amid focus on Islamist extremism, Victorian inquiry hears From Callum Godde in Melbourne for AAP: A “myopic” focus on Islamist extremism in Australia since 2001’s September 11 attacks in the United States has come at the expense of monitoring the far-right movement, a Victorian parliamentary inquiry has been told. Liberty Victoria president, Michael Stanton, has acknowledged the recent emergence of far-right extremism in the state, citing neo-Nazis gathering in the Grampians and gallows erected outside state parliament as pandemic legislation was debated last year. He told an inquiry on Tuesday that far-right extremism is real, but argued Victorian politicians need to be careful not to blindly expand executive powers, surveillance and censorship to combat its influence. “We need to make sure that in responding to those confronting scenes in the Grampians – whether it be Nazi salutes or display of the swastika – or the erection of gallows outside parliament, that we do not have a legislative response that throws the baby out with the bathwater,” Stanton said. “Sometimes that involves tolerating speech that we find offensive or humiliating.” The barrister said Australian law enforcement agencies’ focus has been drawn away from neo-Nazis and other far-right movements over the past 20 years by Islamist extremism. Both must be addressed, Stanton said, but Victoria’s parliament should not cast the net too wide with any reforms. “The focus should be on those people who are directly likely to be engaged in committing violent acts,” he said. “To cast their net more broadly risks increasing stigmatisation – the kind of stigmatisation faced by the Muslim community, or parts of the Muslim community, in Australia for almost two decades – and risks being counterproductive.” As well as investigating the rise of far-right extremism in Victoria, the inquiry is studying how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected its apparent growth. Col Blanch to be appointed WA police commissioner Current deputy police commissioner in the Western Australian police force, Col Blanch, will become the force’s new commissioner next month. Blanch, who has overseen key portfolios including gang crime, homicide, organised crime, and state intelligence, has been appointed for a five-year term. Blanch became, briefly, a household name last year as the public face of the WA police force’s search for missing girl Cleo Smith, who was found, safe and well, 18 days after she vanished from a remote camping site. “We have all had tears in our eyes this morning,” he said of the early morning rescue of the girl. Blanch is also a former executive director of intelligence for the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, and chair of the WA State Emergency Coordination Group. WA premier, Mark McGowan, said Blanch was an outstanding candidate. “Col Blanch has proven himself a leader of integrity who cares deeply about safety of the community and those serving under his command,” McGowan said. “Mr Blanch has been directly involved in shepherding the state through the pandemic and he is well-placed to lead the Western Australian Police Force as it confronts challenges of the post-pandemic world.” And now Victoria ... Experts urge ‘careful consideration’ in designing Australian centre for disease control after Labor’s election promise Before its election win, Labor had promised to set up an Australian Centre for Disease Control to help prepare for, and cope with, future pandemics and outbreaks. Experts are now urging the government to carefully consider the body’s design prior to its establishment, warning there is a risk that the establishment of an Australian CDC may be “seen as a ‘quick win’” by the new government. Three experts from the Sydney Institute for Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney, Prof Ben Marais, Prof Tania Sorrell and Prof Lyn Gilbert, say the Covid pandemic showed such a body was sorely needed to coordinate the national response, collate critical data, and conduct rapid research. In a statement published Tuesday, they said: Careful consideration and consultation are needed to establish this organisation as one that society can look to as a leader in preventing, preparing for and responding to disease outbreaks. It needs to be an entity that can bring together the collective expertise of researchers, epidemiologists, public health microbiologists and practitioners, communications, infection prevention and control experts, and policy makers. The three experts said questions remained about whether an Australian CDC should examine both infectious and non-communicable diseases, how it would be structured to avoid bias or perceptions of bias, and how it could create a national disease surveillance network across various jurisdictions. Here are the latest coronavirus case numbers from around Australia on Tuesday, as the country records at least 31 deaths from Covid-19: ACT Deaths: 0 Cases: 633 In hospital: 93 (with 3 people in ICU) NSW Deaths: 3 Cases: 5,157 In hospital: 1,341 (with 39 people in ICU) Northern Territory Deaths: 0 Cases: 169 In hospital: 22 (with 2 people in ICU) Queensland Deaths: 6 Cases: 4,190 In hospital: 373 (with 8 people in ICU) South Australia Deaths: 0 Cases: 2,429 In hospital: 226 (with 8 people in ICU) Tasmania Deaths: 1 Cases: 658 In hospital: 45 (with 2 people in ICU) Victoria Deaths: 15 Cases: 6,071 In hospital: 473 (with 28 people in ICU) Western Australia Deaths: 6 Cases: 6,315 In hospital: 278 (with 12 people in ICU) David Pocock thanks ‘a community I love’ after being elected to Senate for ACT Climate change activist, independent candidate and former Wallabies captain David Pocock has been elected to the Senate as one of two upper house seats for the Australian Capital Territory. He is the first independent candidate to win election as a territory senator. (The other ACT senator is the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, who was returned.) Pocock received 21.18% of the primary vote. With preferences he achieved quota at the distribution of preferences on Tuesday. Pocock thanked the ACT community for its support. “Today, the extraordinary movement of people we brought together across the ACT made history,” Pocock said. “For the first time, we have an independent voice representing our community in the federal parliament. “Thank you to everyone who put their trust in me to represent you. It is an incredible honour to be able to serve a community I love.” Pocock congratulated Gallagher on her re-election, and acknowledged the work of outgoing Liberal senator Zed Seselja, who had held the second ACT senate seat for nine years but lost out to Pocock in the final counting in this election. Pocock said his campaign “aimed to make politics about people”. “We built a policy platform off the back of thousands of conversations about the things that matter. “We kept it positive. We talked about the issues and the ideas for the future we want and It clearly resonated.” The AEC will officially declare the result tomorrow in Canberra. I told you he was inexhaustible ... (unlike east coast power supplies, it seems): Afternoon fellow travellers. Thanks to the indefatigable Mostafa for his stellar first innings. Speaking of inexhaustible: the latest dispatch (see what I did there ...) from our energetic energy correspondent Peter Hannam: ... So we have an updated view from the Australian energy market operator of the forecast electricity supply gap for Queensland. It’s 1,789 megawatts (which looks revolutionary) at 6.30pm AEST this evening, and larger than the biggest projected shortfall yesterday at 1,454Mw. No wonder Aemo is looking for a response from generators. At this size, you’d expect the Queensland government to again ask consumers to turn off unnecessary appliances, and big power users will probably be asked to do so too (and for some, they will be paid to do so). There are other “lack of reserve” notices for other states including NSW at level 1 or 2, which are not as serious. Some reputable commentators smell a rat, though, as there is ample capacity in the market even taking into account the increasingly unreliable coal-fired power plants in the national electricity market. The Australian Energy Regulator, which is supposed to keep an eye on price gouging, says it is “monitoring the market closely”, as is the competition watchdog, the ACCC. Whether anyone will get pinged for anti-competitive behaviour remains to be seen. And with that, I will leave the blog in the trusty hands of Ben Doherty. Thanks for reading. Albanese suggests bosses go easy on Socceroos fans today Earlier, prime minister Anthony Albanese was asked what is arguably the most important question of the day: will he give the nation a day off to celebrate the Socceroos? Unfortunately, the PM could only offer some encouragement for bosses to go easy on employees today (booooooo): If someone’s having a little kip in the corner, it’s understandable, because if they’ve been up since 4 o’clock watching … and then celebrating afterwards, it’s understandable that coffee can only go so far. The AEC is due to officially declare results in numerous House of Representatives seats today, but the result in the NSW seat of Gilmore has been delayed after Liberal candidate Andrew Constance called for a recount. The former NSW state minister ended up just 373 votes behind Labor MP Fiona Phillips, according to the AEC’s official numbers, and the seat was to be declared officially at 2pm today. But the AEC says that has been delayed after a formal request for a recount, which the electoral body says it will give “thorough consideration”. Constance told Guardian Australia that his vote scrutineers had “raised concerns in relation to certain aspects of the process, particularly the scrutiny of informal votes”. Constance said he believed the close result meant there were “strong grounds for a recount”. The AEC said its staff need time to assess the request, stressing that the delay of the declaration was not any indication of what decision it would make. A spokesman noted the AEC’s validation processes for counting votes, including that ballots are counted more than once in a process called “fresh scrutiny”. Albanese says ‘all things are on the table’ for energy policy review Earlier, Anthony Albanese was asked about the fact the energy minister, Chris Bowen, did not rule out price controls on gas in a morning interview. Albanese said: He didn’t speak about that at all, I’ve read the transcript, he was asked about that. It’s a different thing. With what Mr Bowen said in the interview ... is that all things are on the table. We’ve said we will have a review of the so-called trigger, which is in place. The so-called trigger isn’t really a trigger at all because you pull the trigger and nothing happens until January 1. So what we will do and are doing as a matter of urgency is a review and all things are on the table. Albanese also sounded off about the failures of the Morrison government on energy. He said: It’s not acceptable that we have had a government previously, which was in office for three terms, announced 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one – that is not acceptable. You’ve had a decade of neglect ... you’ve had a decade where we have an energy grid that isn’t fit for purpose for the 21st century. You’ve had too many arguments taking place rather than the investment certainty which comes from having an energy policy ... And what we find is the consequences of the former government’s failure to put in place an energy policy is being felt right now, with problems in the market. The Australian Electoral Commission has announced the count for senators in the Northern Territory has concluded, with Labor’s Malarndirri McCarthy and the Country Liberals’ Jacinta Nampijinpa Price successfully voted into the Senate. Anthony Albanese has been asked about China’s sanctions, after defence minister Richard Marles met his Chinese counterpart, ending several years of Australia being frozen out by Chinese ministers. Albanese said: Well it’s China that has imposed sanctions on Australia, they need to remove those sanctions in order to improve relations between Australia and China. It’s a good thing that Richard Marles [was able to meet] with his counterpart on the sides of the conference in Singapore. We do need to engage with each other and that’s a positive step. But it’s China that has imposed sanctions, it’s China that has changed and it’s China that needs to remove those sanctions. China needs to remove the sanctions they have put in place, there is no reason for them to be there. We are a trading nation, we have fulfilled all of our obligations as part of contracts and arrangements put in place, and we make good products as well. And those sanctions hurt Australia but they also hurt China, because of the quality of our products. Albanese said dialogue had been “missing” in the last few years, but there need to be “concrete steps” from China. My colleague Daniel Hurst has reported similar demands from foreign minister, Penny Wong, to end trade sanctions. Albanese also confirmed he has written back to China after premier, Li Keqiang, sent him a “congratulatory message”, but would not comment beyond saying he “responded appropriately”. “There have been prime ministers who reveal text messages and correspondence - I’m not one of them,” he said. Albanese questioned on reducing deportations of New Zealanders convicted of crimes The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is holding a press conference in Brisbane with the aged care minister Anika Wells. Albanese was asked about his talks with New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, about reducing deportations of New Zealanders convicted of crimes in Australia. He said: I’ve said that section 501 will stay in place. What we’ll have discussions over though is how that framework operates in a sensible way, in the context as well [that] New Zealand has agreed, of course, to take some people who are currently on Nauru, and we’ll have those discussions in the context as well and of how we smooth out the path to citizenship for people from New Zealand, which is a substantial number right here in Australia. Fascinating that he made a link between reducing deportations and New Zealand agreeing to take asylum seekers and refugees from offshore detention. Tasmania records 658 new Covid cases And Tasmania has also reported their Covid numbers, with 658 new cases overnight. There are currently two patients in ICU and 3,645 total active cases. NT records 169 new Covid cases The Northern Territory has recorded 169 new Covid cases overnight, with 22 patients currently in hospital, three of whom require oxygen. ACT records 633 new Covid cases Western Australia is reporting 6,315 new Covid cases and six deaths overnight. There are 278 people with Covid in hospital in the state, with 12 of them in intensive care. Business confidence retreats as Australian stocks plunge Australian stocks seem to have plateaued for now, down just a tad less than 5%, pretty much how far they plunged at the open. There are more details here on that fall, which wiped off more than $110bn in share value: Eventually the effects of financial markets do affect the “real economy” but the daily gyrations can sometimes be misleading (and are bad for blood pressure, and so on). So what’s the real world look like? NAB’s monthly survey of business confidence and conditions finds some retreat but forward orders are keeping both relatively buoyant. Overall conditions remain “well above average”at +16 points, NAB says. That sentiment is patchy, though, with confidence dipping in South Australia and Victoria, but improving in Queensland. Some industries, though, such as construction are not doing very well, profit-wise, even if their order books are generally full. “No other industry is facing such margin pressure,” NAB said. The signs are mixed too for inflation. On the one hand, labour costs were up 2.5% in May, easing from the record 3.0% rise in April, while the cost of finished goods rose 1.8% and retail price growth came in at 3.1% on a quarterly basis, NAB said. By that score, real wages are looking like they might still be going backwards. Queensland has recorded 4,190 new Covid cases and six deaths. There are currently 373 with the virus in hospital in the state, with eight of them in ICU. Public hearings begin into far-right extremism in Victoria A Victorian parliamentary inquiry investigating the rising threat of far-right extremism has begun holding public hearings today. Liberty Victoria president, Michael Stanton, tells the inquiry it is vital a legislative response does not “throw the baby out with the bath water” to ensure free speech is balanced with people’s right to live without discrimination and violence: Sometimes that involves tolerating things that we find offensive or humiliating, and I’m reminded of John Howard, who famously of course introduced gun control but also strongly opposed flag burning becoming a criminal offence, despite pressure from his own backbench. The inquiry, announced in February after a push from the Greens, comes amid a recent emergence of extremist and neo-Nazi groups into public view. Last month, Victoria introduced landmark legislation that would see the state become the first jurisdictions in Australia to ban the Nazi swastika. Aemo says it might need to intervene in SA amid energy shortage but solar helping Eastern Australia’s energy market continues to be busy, with the Australian Energy Market Operator signalling it may have to intervene in South Australia if more supply isn’t forthcoming. At the moment, wind and solar are supplying almost 90% of that’s state’s needs, and SA is busily exporting to Victoria (SA’s spot wholesale price is negative-$1 per megawatt hour, compared with $200-$300 in other parts of the national electricity market). So the intervention will likely be for system security with more “synchronous generating units” needed. Meanwhile, there have been a couple of actual lack of reserve notices in NSW and Queensland where the available extra capacity has been lower than desired but without supply gaps looming. The sunny days across most of eastern Australia (long may they last after the rains) mean there’s a decent amount of solar energy being generated even though we’re in winter. At the moment, about a quarter of supplies are coming from solar farms and rooftops. Short of some surprises, then, the main focus of regulators (and nervous energy ministers) will be what happens as the sun sets. Blackouts, though, remain unlikely but can’t be ruled out. Police in the the town of Taupiri on New Zealand’s north island are responding to reports of an active shooter. AAP reports that a person was injured about 9.30am while a nearby school was in lockdown as a precaution. Police were responding to a “serious incident” in Taupiri, south of Auckland, on Tuesday morning. Local media are reporting that an active shooter was in the Taupiri area. A large number of police remain at the scene. Earlier today, Australia’s energy regulator, the Australian Electricity Market Operator (Aemo), warned that blackouts could still be possible in NSW and Queensland, between 5pm and 9pm tonight. Aemo said in a statement that it has issued notices to encourage more power generation, and that if those measures aren’t sufficient some areas may face blackouts. The market operators also said price caps were in place in Queensland, NSW, Victoria and South Australia because wholesale prices have breached a threshold. As a consequence, some generators revised their market availability in New South Wales and Queensland for today. This has contributed to forecast supply shortfalls, along with generation units being offline for planned maintenance and repairs. Supply reserve shortfalls (lack of reserve 2 and 3) are currently forecast in Queensland and New South Wales this evening (approximately 5pm to 9pm). AustralianSuper cuts weekly admin fee but raises annual fee for contributors The nation’s biggest superannuation fund has cut administration fees that it charges most members – but some will see their fees rise. AustralianSuper, which manages about $261bn of retirement savings on behalf of 2.7 million members, will cut its weekly account-keeping fee from $2.25 to $1. However, it is also increasing the annual fee it charges people who are still contributing to their super, which is based on the size of your retirement account, from 0.04% to 0.1%. Total fees for people accumulating savings will be capped at $350 a year. For people who are retired and drawing down on their fund, the variable fee will go down from the current 0.11% to 0.1%, and the total fee will be capped at $600 a year – down from the current cap of $750 a year. Aussie says that the result will benefit people with less in their super – those with a balance below $50,000 will pay almost 60% less in administration fees. The average fee decrease for people who are retired and drawing down on their super will be 25%, the fund says. In all, about 2.3 million members will either enjoy a decrease or see fees remain the same; it’s estimated about 300,000 to 400,000 members with larger balances will see fees increase. The fund says insurance costs for about 1.13 million members will decrease this year. It has also spent considerable effort bringing investment managers in-house, rather than employing expensive external advisors – something it says has saved members $1bn over eight years and slashed investment fees for members in its main balanced option from a high of 0.84% in 2009 to 0.63% last year. We are expecting to hear from Anthony Albanese in Brisbane shortly. ACT Liberal leader congratulates new senators but doesn’t mention outgoing colleague The Liberal leader in the ACT, Elizabeth Lee, has taken to Twitter to congratulate new Canberran senators Katy Gallagher and David Pocock. Of note here is the complete lack of mention of former Liberal senator Zed Seselja. Make of that what you will: The New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet has just stepped up to discuss his government’s new childcare plan, saying the $775m commitment over the next four years is an “investment in our family, in our children”. Perrottet says the cash injection will “drive women’s participation, provide great opportunities for families who are struggling with bouncing their work and family life struggle”. This is a once-in-a-generation reform. We know this is an area that has been put in the too hard basket for way too long. This investment today will increase places right across our state, over time and over the next decade ensure prices also come down – a saving of around $4,000 for those families with one child and close to $8,000 for those families who use child care and have two children. It is nation-leading reform that we would expect other states to follow suit. This is something from a commonwealth level hasn’t had the traction that it needs. It has put many women in a position where they are not able to make that choice, they are not able to stay in the work place and this is something that will drive economic activity of around $17bn a year. Pocock on being a senator: ‘I am committed to being accountable and accessible’ And here is David Pocock’s statement on his election win, thanking everyone who put their trust in him, and reiterating his campaign’s focus on making politics about people: Our campaign aimed to make politics about people. We built a policy platform off the back of thousands of conversations about the things that matter. I am committed to being accessible and accountable to Canberrans. I’d love you to come to my first quarterly town hall in July to continue the conversation. The big falls on overseas financial markets have been echoed in Australia, where the stock market was already playing catch-up after Monday’s holiday close. Within a few minutes of opening, the ASX 200 benchmark index was more than 5% down, with all major sub-indices lower. The drop was not a surprise given the steep falls in the US, including 4.7% for the tech-concentrated Nasdaq index overnight. The main concern for investors is that the spike in inflation continues to be worse than feared, which will prompt central banks to send interest rates higher, faster. The US Federal Reserve, for instance, is now expected to lift its key rate by 0.75 percentage points later this week. The S&amp;P 500, a broad measure of US stocks, is down 9% in just three days, Bloomberg notes. The Aussie dollar has also lost ground lately, trading at about 69.5 US cents in recent trade, down from 72 cents last week. No doubt more to come. It’s now official – former rugby union star David Pocock is a senator. The independent candidate has been officially elected to the federal Senate in the Australian Capital Territory, the Australian Electoral Commission announced on Tuesday. He will join Labor’s finance minister, Katy Gallagher, as the ACT’s two upper-house representatives, while former Liberal senator Zed Seselja will miss out. It’s now been more than three weeks since the May 21 election date, but the complicated process of distributing Senate preferences – about 115m preferences nationally, the AEC said – means it takes far longer to officially name upper-house results than those in the House of Representatives. On Tuesday, the AEC named Gallagher and Pocock as the two senators for the ACT, after preferences were distributed. “As with all aspects of the count, the automated distribution of preferences undertaken today was open to scrutineers appointed by the candidates,” said Australian Electoral Officer for the Australian Capital Territory, David Molnar. The Northern Territory’s Senate spots will be revealed later today. The rest of Australia’s Senate composition will be notified “soon”, the AEC said. The electoral commission said on Twitter that the Senate result was “one of the most complex upper house counts in the world – it’s so complex that we needed to write a program to distribute your preferences, as doing it by hand would mean we couldn’t provide elected Senators in time to take their seat.” The ASX is following Wall Street into a tumble: You can read more on the story at the link below: Bowen says export and price control needs to go through parliament I wanted to return to Chris Bowen, who also made the media rounds this morning. He told RN Breakfast that there is a chance the government will seek to implement a 90-day temporary export and price control, to deal with the energy crisis. But he also warned the government does not have a “legislative basis” to introduce short term reforms. But we would need to take that through parliament, there’s no legislative basis at the moment. One thing this government will not do is … respond with an ad hoc reaction … we’ve had enough knee-jerk reactions. There are real challenges, when we have a reform process we will explain it, we’ll take it through parliament and we will seek it. Deputy PM Richard Marles made the rounds this morning, speaking from Tokyo and saying that he intends to build stronger relationships with Japan, while being open to further meetings with China. It comes after Beijing ended its diplomatic freeze of Australia, and a breakthrough meeting in Singapore, where “full and frank” discussions were had on tensions in the Pacific and South China Sea. Speaking to the ABC, Marles said he had wanted to ensure the “relationship was put in a better place”: There was a desire in the meeting that we had, on both sides, to have the relationship put in a better place. The door is open to having further meetings, but I think we do need to understand that the relationship has not been in a good place at all, and this is only the first step and there’s still a long way to go. We want to assert our rights in places like the South China Sea; we see the importance of a global, rules-based order in the Pacific. We’re going to go about our relations with China, but our relations with the whole world in a way which is professional, where we understand the importance of dialogue where we believe in the power of diplomacy. Marles also appeared on the Today Show, emphasising his intention to build stronger military ties between Australia and Japan: We’re not going to be looking to other countries in terms of influencing the relationships that we build with friends like Japan. So we’re building this relationship with Japan on its own terms and it’s never been more important. China is seeking to shape the world around it in a way that it has not done before. That makes our strategic circumstances complex. Both Japan and Australia are allies of the United States. We both have an interest in keeping the United States as engaged as possible within East Asia. Dan Tehan wants parliament to return Dan Tehan, opposition immigration spokesman, says the government should bring forward its first sitting date to deal with the energy crisis, and accusing Labor of trying to avoid scrutiny. This, of course, comes only months after the Coalition had laid out a schedule with only 10 (that’s right, 10) sitting days before August 2022. Tehan was on Sky News this morning, and said he wanted to hold the government accountable early (obviously there’s much more energy when in opposition): The parliament is the place where we are able to hold the government to account, we’ve got an energy crisis and a skills crisis and we’re not sitting until the end of July, why? I’m incredibly surprised, this was a government that said accountability and transparency will be at the forefront of everything they do. It’s right to say the government should think about pulling this trigger, if we can’t get the gas at the right price to our manufacturing industries in particular, we’re going to see dire consequences as a result. These are the types of questions we should be able to put to the parliament when the parliament sits. A spike in deaths in Victoria today, with 15 reported in addition to 6,071 new cases: NSW is reporting 5,157 new cases and three deaths overnight: Childcare in New South Wales will be bolstered with a $5bn package over the next decade as part of a state government plan to boost female participation in the workforce. It was hoped the policy would create an extra 47,000 places across the state, enable private childcare operators to expand or build new centres and increase the workforce, including through university scholarships for early childhood teachers. Announcing the policy at a Committee for Sydney event on Tuesday morning, the treasurer, Matt Kean, said the investment was good economic policy for everyone, not just women. He said: Childcare should not be a postcode lottery. This reform will transform childcare in NSW. Good women’s policy is also good economic policy for everyone. Kean said the loss of female voters for the federal Liberals at the May election was devastating and that he would work to support women in NSW. He said: I was devastated by that because my party should be the standard-bearer for individual liberty that makes our country great. The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, has said Australia is facing a “bumpy” winter as energy shortfalls bite across the east coast. Bowen was on Sunrise this morning, and said that while there was increased strain on the energy system, he remained confident the situation could be managed. There is a big chunk of coal-fired power out of action in Queensland. That has led to higher prices, and … with the situation in Ukraine, flooding and it being a bit colder earlier than normal, that has increased the load on the system. It’s all being actively managed. We can have confidence in our operators, regulators who are working together with the states. I believe that will result in a better situation for energy consumers and avoid blackouts and certainly minimise the risk of any load shedding activities. The operator tells me there is no need to be concerned about blackouts in the immediate future. I’m not here to give a magical guarantee, but I am here to say that everything that could be done is being done very actively. Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has asked the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, to declare a public holiday in celebration of Australia’s qualification for the Fifa World Cup – and he’s already got one high-profile political supporter in federal energy and climate minister Chris Bowen. “A four-day weekend to celebrate the Socceroos win, is something I think we can all get behind,” Bowen told Radio National this morning. “There’s a prime ministerial tradition isn’t there – any boss who sacks their worker for turning up late today is a bum, that’s what the prime minister should say on a day like this, we can all agree.” Bowen was of course referencing former PM Bob Hawke’s immortal declaration after Australia’s 1983 America’s Cup win. We’re not sure if we’ll see Albanese in front of the cameras in a special white jacket adorned with AUSTRALIA, though. The current PM has only tweeted a simple congratulations (so far) to mark the Socceroos win. “We’re very proud of them, a great day for Australia,” Bowen continued on RN. Other politicians got on the Socceroos bandwagon, with a bunch of Labor MPs getting up early to live-tweet much of the game. Labor senator Nita Green joked Australia was “going to be late for work” after the early morning start. Minister for Sport, Anika Wells, was getting behind new national hero, Andrew Redmayne, who made the ultimate penalty save to seal the Socceroos win. New MP for Bennelong, Jerome Laxale, asked Albanese for “permission to do the Redmayne dance in question time”. Lack of reserve notice from energy regulator It’s going to be a long day by the looks of it when it comes to “lack of reserve” notices and intervention by the Australian Energy Market Operator, such as this early one in NSW: As mentioned in this article, the price caps result in a lot of generators dropping out, and then the regulators are going to have to ask them to jump back in. Seems like an odd way to run things, but Chris Bowen, the federal energy minister, says that’s the market we have to work with. (Cue: perhaps we need to review how the market operates.) As for the mix of what’s in the market overnight, and at the start of the day across the National Electricity Market (NEM), here’s the scene: The NEM, of course, is really only the eastern states and most of South Australia. Western Australia operates its own grids. Still that’s about 80% of the population, and hence, I suppose, the “national” tag still works. Theft on a large scale In a very interesting story this morning, Western Australia Police are appealing to the public for information on a burglary from December, where three people stole a sea container with approximately $100,000 worth of mining equipment inside it. Police say two men and a woman gained entry to into a commercial yard on Wellard Street in Bibra Lake on 28 December, and used a sea container handler to load a 6-metre (!!) sea container onto a truck (that they also stole in August 2021). It is believed the truck used to transport the sea container was stolen from a commercial yard in Naval Base in August 2021. The truck was later found burnt out on a rural property in Oldbury on Wednesday 8 June 2022. Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report online at crimestopperswa.com.au Convicted paedophile and former star of Hey Dad! Robert Hughes, is set to be deported to the UK today. Hughes was granted parole earlier this month by the NSW State Parole Authority, which determined he be released from Long Bay correctional facility no later than Tuesday. The 73-year-old renounced his Australian citizenship in 2020, becoming a non-lawful citizen requiring deportation upon release. Australian Border Force, who usually handles the deportation of convicted criminals who are not Australian citizens, told AAP it does not comment on operational matters. World Cup joy Between politicians discussing energy and childcare, we still had the joy of the Socceroos winning their World Cup qualifier this morning, and I felt the ABC’s Tony Armstrong captured the mood pretty perfectly: Next off the bench is government services and NDIS minister (and former Labor leader) Bill Shorten, who is blaming the cold for the energy shortfall in NSW and Queensland. Speaking to the Today Show, Shorten also added that “dispatchable power” was essential to combating the energy crisis. He also urged the opposition to join Laor in ending the “energy market operator wars.” The very cold weather, combined with let’s face it, 10 years of delay and denial about investing in our energy market operator grid, and the chickens have come to roost. You need what’s called dispatchable power. That’s power that you don’t need to be paying for seven days, 24 hours a week but when it’s really cold, that’s when you need it. (Australians) want to hear that the government and opposition are working together. The truth is we need more dispatchable power (and) renewable energy is cheaper. Let’s move forward. Less of the argy-bargy and more of the action. Matt Kean on NSW’s $5bn childcare package Kean has gone on to spruik the state government’s new $5bn childcare policy, which he says will grow the state’s economy by $17.4bn. What it will do is see up to 95,000 women be able to enter the workforce or take on more hours. I mean, childcare costs are attacks on the dreams of women and families right across New South Wales, indeed right across the country. We believe that families should have access to quality affordable childcare no matter where they live ... And these reforms will deliver a middle-income family in New South Wales who have one child full-time care savings of up to $3,900 per annum. When asked if the state was stepping in to fill a role usually reserved for the federal government, Kean avoided the question: This is one of the biggest productivity reforms that we can have that will grow our economy. And obviously lift living standards in this state. Our policy is focused on providing additional childcare – accessible and affordable childcare across New South Wales – will grow the overall size of the economy by $17.4 billion. NSW treasurer Matt Kean says he has confidence in the “reliability of the system,” indicating he is not expecting any blackouts in the coming days. Speaking to Patricia Karvelas on RN Breakfast, Kean said the government was monitoring the situation, but asked people to be conscious of their power usage. We’re obviously monitoring the situation very closely. But this situation has arisen because the wholesale prices of electricity have gone above a point which triggers the market cap. That cap is in place to protect consumers. And because the price of electricity that the generators can get for supplying electricity into the market is too low to cover their costs, they’re not bidding into the system. So this is a market failure issue. We’re not telling people to turn off the heaters, we’re not telling people to turn down their air conditioners or anything like that. But people should just be conscious that where they can reduce their use of electricity, that’s a good thing for them. It’s going to lower their power bills, and it’s also going to take a bit of pressure off the system. Socceroos qualify for the World Cup Before we jump into the inevitable flow of politicians making the media rounds this morning, I wanted to point to Emma Kemp’s ongoing live blog of Australia’s World Cup qualifier. Earlier this morning, Australia beat Peru on penalties to make their fifth consecutive World Cup: You can also read the match report, linked here. Good morning, and happy World Cup qualification day! Mostafa Rachwani with you this morning, to take you through the day’s news. We begin in New South Wales, where energy authorities are on high alert for possible power shortfalls hitting homes and businesses tonight. It comes after Queensland only narrowly avoided blackouts last night, after the Australian Energy Market Operator worked to head off a gap projected at one stage to be 1,454 megawatts. In federal politics, deputy prime minister Richard Marles will be in Tokyo today, maintaining the jet-setting ways of this new government. Marles will be calling for stronger military ties between Japan and Australia, emphasising the need to strengthen the relationship between the two countries. Back in NSW, the state government there has unveiled its signature budget policy, which will allow private childcare operators to expand or build new centres, in the hopes of creating an extra 47,000 places across the state. Finally, prime minister Anthony Albanese is considering whether to attend a NATO summit in Madrid at the end of the month, and to support the alliance toughening its stance against Russia. There is still much going on, so let’s dive in."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2022/jun/11/new-york-has-a-chance-to-generate-all-its-electricity-from-clean-energy-by-2030","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-11T10:25:16Z","webTitle":"New York has a chance to generate all its electricity from clean energy by 2030 | Ross Barkan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/11/new-york-has-a-chance-to-generate-all-its-electricity-from-clean-energy-by-2030","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2022/jun/11/new-york-has-a-chance-to-generate-all-its-electricity-from-clean-energy-by-2030","fields":{"headline":"New York has a chance to generate all its electricity from clean energy by 2030","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"It has been, for progressives in New York, a trying year. Major pieces of legislation that were supposed to reshape the state to safeguard the working class have stalled out. A bill to create a statewide single-payer healthcare system is no closer to passage than it was several years ago. A push to guarantee new protections for tenants as rents soar in New York City could not find the votes. And ambitious legislation to combat climate that did have the votes to go through the state legislature was halted by the speaker of the state assembly. Unlike in Washington, Democrats in New York have no one to blame but themselves. The party holds supermajorities in both chambers, the state senate and state assembly. Progressives have grown their clout in each. A handful of socialists occupy seats as well. The trouble is that institutional forces – those aligned with the real estate and fossil fuel industries in particular – have plenty of clout, too. The left is stronger, in numbers, than it’s ever been, but the state’s power brokers are centrists or those most hesitant to challenge entrenched power structures. This is true in other Democrat-run states too, but it’s been sobering in New York where progressives have nurtured such high hopes for change. The left, of course, has gotten much further in New York in the last few years than it had in the previous decades. In 2019, Democrats took control of the state senate and immediately passed a large number of bills that had been bottled up for years. Legislation to help tenants, reduce the use of cash bail, and protect voting rights and women’s health all easily passed the body and were signed into law. In 2020, the pandemic hit and ambitious legislating was put on hold. The 2021 session was more of the same. This year offered hope. The Build Public Renewables Act, or BPRA, would mandate that the state’s public power provider, the New York Power Authority (NYPA), generate all of its electricity from clean energy by 2030 and establish a process through which it can build and own renewables while closing down polluting infrastructure. The state itself could build out wind and solar energy. With its high bond rating, the NYPA could easily finance projects. Passage of the bill would have profound national implications. New York would be a leader in the fight against the climate crisis and inspire other states with Democratic governors to follow their lead. With Republicans poised to retake Congress, state-level action is crucial. Independent power producers, who fiercely oppose the BPRA, currently build out new power generation infrastructure beyond NYPA. Solar industry trade associations fought the bill bitterly. They have made inroads in the legislature. In turn, a strange thing happened: the BPRA amassed the votes to pass the state assembly – it had already passed the senate – but was never brought up for a vote before the end of the legislative session in early June. The speaker, Carl Heastie, claimed the votes were not there because, apparently, the more than 80 lawmakers who backed the bill did not inform him personally they would vote that way. Advocates and supporters, however, were certain they had the votes. At first glance, it would appear Heastie had a point, since it is theoretically true the speaker cannot know who will vote for what if he has not been told about the intentions of each lawmaker. But that’s not how lawmaking really works in Albany, the state capital. There are hundreds of bills and the speaker cannot personally hear from all legislators before one is put on the floor for a vote. Rather, most Democrats vote reflexively with the speaker unless the bill has an organized constituency in their districts that opposed it. There is no popular, grassroots outcry against the BPRA. Most New Yorkers don’t know what it is. Why did Heastie claim the votes were not there? Some moderate Democrats are wary of passing any far-reaching bills in an election year. Organized labor had opposed earlier versions of the bill, but the New York AFL-CIO had agreed to stay neutral this time. Governor Kathy Hochul may not support the BPRA either, but she would be hard-pressed to not sign the bill if it reached her desk, especially if New York’s large environmental movement and progressive infrastructure mobilized for it. The good news is that the legislation may not be dead for 2022. Though lawmakers depart Albany in June and typically don’t reconvene until the new year to pass bills, Heastie requested the chairs of the assembly’s committees on energy, corporations and environmental conservation convene a hearing on 28 July. A hearing may mean a special session – a chance to get the BPRA to Hochul’s desk before 2023. If the Democrats in Albany act as they should, New Yorkers will begin to get the government they deserve. With climate cataclysms here, the political system can’t afford any more delays. Ross Barkan is a journalist based in New York City.

Biden has triggered the Defense Production Act, a cold war-era law used to compel businesses to ramp up production of certain materials to aid national security, to boost the output of solar panels, building insulation, transformers for power grids and heat pumps, which are used to efficiently heat and cool homes. The US president has also provided a two-year exemption to solar panel companies from tariffs on imported parts, easing the flow of technology from China and other countries for use in the US, a country where only 2.8% of electricity comes from solar power. The moves have been applauded by climate activists who have pressed for Biden to use the breadth of his presidential powers to act on the climate crisis. Activists have sharply criticized the president in recent months over the continuing failure to pass major climate legislation through an evenly divided Senate, as well as Biden’s calls for bolstered oil production to offset gasoline prices that have risen amid the war in Ukraine. “We are in a climate emergency, an emergency we can only confront when our government steps up and launches a second-world-war scale mobilization to justly transition to renewable energy,” said Varshini Prakash, executive director at the youth-led Sunrise Movement. “This is a great step by the administration, and we urgently hope to see even more significant executive actions follow.” Biden has declined to declare a climate emergency, as has been done in countries such as the UK, or to set a phase-out of fossil fuels. But his administration said use of national security powers to create a “stronger clean energy arsenal” was evidence of “bold action to build an American-made clean energy future”. The use of the Defense Production Act will allow the US Department of Energy to invest in companies that can build renewable energy facilities and manufacture parts for technology such as solar panels. The administration expects domestic solar manufacturing will now triple by 2024, allowing more than 3.3m homes each year to switch to solar energy. A shift to cleaner sources of electricity would also help protect against energy bill volatility and provide efficiency to households, say proponents – heat pumps, for example, can save homes $1,000 each year from space heating alone. The administration has also sought to stress the benefits of weaning the US off the supply of fossil fuels from countries such as Russia. “Reducing America’s dependence on gas and oil is critical to US national security,” said Kathleen Hicks, deputy secretary of defense. Jean Su, director of energy justice at the Center for Biological Diversity, said Biden’s latest actions represented a “tremendous sea change” in his approach to tackling the climate crisis. “Biden’s executive moves give critical momentum to the needed transition to solar energy,” said Su. “We hope this use of the Defense Production Act is a turning point for the president, who must use all his executive powers to confront the climate emergency head on.” Scientists have said the world must cut planet-heating emissions in half this decade, and zero them out by 2050, to avoid even more disastrous heatwaves, floods, drought and other damaging climate impacts. Biden, who shares this target, won’t be able to achieve it, however, though executive action alone. The US has never passed major climate change legislation and the president’s attempts to do so have been stymied by Joe Manchin, the pro-coal Democrat who has been a crucial swing vote in the Senate. It’s unclear whether any climate bill will be able to succeed ahead of November’s midterm elections, which are expected to deprive Democrats of control in Congress."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"toyota-australia-journey-to-electric/2022/jun/03/toyota-is-pioneering-an-evolution-in-how-societies-of-the-future-will-live-work-play-and-move","type":"article","sectionId":"toyota-australia-journey-to-electric","sectionName":"Toyota Australia: Journey to electric","webPublicationDate":"2022-06-03T05:09:41Z","webTitle":"Toyota is pioneering an evolution in how societies of the future will live, work, play and move","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/toyota-australia-journey-to-electric/2022/jun/03/toyota-is-pioneering-an-evolution-in-how-societies-of-the-future-will-live-work-play-and-move","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/toyota-australia-journey-to-electric/2022/jun/03/toyota-is-pioneering-an-evolution-in-how-societies-of-the-future-will-live-work-play-and-move","fields":{"headline":"Toyota is pioneering an evolution in how societies of the future will live, work, play and move","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"When the world’s biggest car company envisages a technological utopia and plans to build its own city, this reality may be closer than we think. It was shortly after lunchtime on 6 January 2020, when the president of Toyota, Akio Toyoda, took to the Las Vegas stage of the world’s most influential tech event. “Virtually every industry is trying to predict the future,” said the energetic leader of the Japanese car giant. Arms open, he wore a wide, diagonally striped tie and a precisely tailored, single-button, charcoal suit. “From my perspective, no one wants a crystal ball as much as the automobile industry. Everyone wants to know … when will cars truly drive themselves? When will they know what I’m thinking? When will they fly?” Toyota’s free-roaming e-Palette is a fully automated, battery electric vehicle. Toyoda wasn’t actually striding the CES 2020 stage to unveil a flying car. In some ways, however, his announcement was far more profound. The world’s biggest car company, Toyoda said, would build its own prototype city of the future – creating an entire community from the ground up, and building an infrastructure that would be connected, digital and sustainable. Toyota’s dream is to create a place where people can live, work, play and participate in a real-world living laboratory. Up to 2,000 people will reside there, including Toyota employees and their families. It will enable researchers, engineers and scientists from around the world to come together to test and develop new technologies, such as mobility as a service, robotics, connected smart homes and artificial intelligence. Dubbed Woven City, Toyota’s project has been designed by famed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels and is being constructed on a 71-hectare site (a former car factory) at the foot of Mount Fuji. Toyoda referred to Woven City as “a test track for a mobility company”, ensuring safety for the vehicles, the roads on which they’re being driven, and the people. “We didn’t think that safe autonomous driving is achievable unless you make a human-centered city and test it there,” he said. “That was the number one motivation behind deciding to build this Woven City.” Now well on the way to becoming a reality, Woven City is also a key part of Toyota’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. In December 2021, Toyoda said the global company would expand options for carbon-neutral vehicles by offering a full line-up of battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs). “Our goal is not only to reduce CO2 emissions and other negative impacts to zero,” he said. “Our goal goes beyond those.” Building on Toyota’s expertise with hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology, plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and fuel-cell vehicles, Woven City will show how this might work day-to-day. It will be sustainably powered – largely by rooftop solar and the company’s groundbreaking hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) technology – and function as a sort of living lab. It will be a place where Toyota – in collaboration with other business partners – will test how a greener future will work for the people who live there. “With people, buildings and vehicles all connected and communicating with each other through data and sensors, we will be able to test connected AI technology in both the virtual and the physical realms,” Toyoda said. The city’s development will be intriguing. But its fundamentals are already a working blueprint for tomorrow, showing how everyday life will evolve. Toyota is merging battery power with autonomous vehicles, serving Woven City citizens with swarms of Toyota’s self-driving e-Palette BEVs. Revealed by Toyoda at CES 2018, Toyota’s free-roaming e-Palette is a “fully automated, next-generation battery-electric vehicle designed to be scalable and customisable”, the company says. Think of a transparent cube on wheels, of various sizes according to purpose, that zooms about, performing multiple “mobile retail” services: as a taxi; as mobile, come-to-you, dermatologist’s rooms; as a literal Thai chef-in-a-box who whips up your gaeng keow gai on the move; as a try-it-on shoe store on wheels. “Just think how good e-Palette would be at Burning Man,” Toyoda quipped at the time. That combination of electric and autonomous tech is well advanced – and has widespread buy-in. Even in 2018, Toyota had agreements to collaborate on its e-Palettes with delivery giants from Amazon to Uber to Pizza Hut. In the future, car ownership for personal transport will be unnecessary for some people, a change Toyota is staying ahead of. And one that will mean many public roadways can be repurposed – with fewer, high-speed, dedicated commuter autobahns, and more green and pedestrian space. Like the cars, our cities will have to embrace green power, probably in a more decentralised way. So vehicle-to-grid, or V2G, technology will be commonplace, supplanting any need to buy an independent battery for your home to stockpile solar energy for evening use. Instead, you’ll use the battery in your BEV to store power, charged throughout the day by rooftop panels. Even current BEVs will typically contain enough capacity to power an average home for a couple of days. (V2G capability has been mandated in Japan for years for BEVs and PHEVs; the technology is expected in Australia this year.) Woven City has been designed by famed Danish architect Bjarke Ingels and features wooden buildings and photovoltaic solar panels. Those houses will change, too, in composition, function and connectivity. To minimise their carbon footprint, Ingles – the architect behind 2 World Trade Centre, Denmark’s Lego House, and Google’s 97,000 sq metre campus in Sunnydale, California – sees future buildings, like those in Woven City, championing wooden construction. Rooftops will obviously be festooned in photovoltaic solar panels, but new materials mean that even transparent glass could transform the way buildings generate solar power. The inside of buildings at Woven City will be “equipped with the latest in human support technologies, such as in-home robotics to assist with daily living”, Toyota says. “Homes will use sensor-based AI to check occupants’ health, take care of basic needs and enhance daily life, creating an opportunity to deploy connected technology with integrity and trust, securely and positively.” To help that overall goal, and to give its pioneering work in sustainable propulsion the best chance to cut through, Toyota has also engaged in a royalty-free arrangement to share 24,000 electrification patents. It’s a remarkable piece of transparency that embodies Toyota’s ambitious attitude to change. Toyoda’s CES 2018 address wasn’t just about the e-Palette. Two years before his Woven City announcement, the company president and CEO, and great-grandson of its founder, also announced Toyota’s “once-in-a-century” plans to evolve from the world’s biggest automaker to something more progressive. One with a detailed global zero-emissions 2050 target, and a six-point outline to embrace overall sustainability in line with what will be required of all of us to reach climate targets. “It’s my goal to transition Toyota from an automobile company to a mobility company,” Toyoda said. “And the possibilities of what we can build, in my mind, are endless.” Decarbonised living, intuitive mobility, and houses that alert the hospital when you’re ill. If the machines must rise, that’s a transformation we may be grateful for.

Elon Musk says bring it on. “This is actually a good thing,” Musk said in response to a question from a Twitter user. “It has been raining money on fools for too long. Some bankruptcies need to happen. “Also,” he continued, “all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don’t actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!” It’s tough talk from a man said to be worth north of $218bn, more than anyone in the world. And it conveniently overlooks the considerable handouts Musk himself took in the process of growing his net worth after plunking down $6.5m for a majority stake in Tesla in 2004. How did Musk weather the economic storms and rude awakenings thereafter? In 2008, the company rolled out its only product – a Lotus Elise knockoff called the Roadster. At a starting price of around $80,000, the coupe wasn’t exactly priced to move; 2,450 global sales made Musk’s vision of mass-producing electric cars look like a pipe dream. But a year later, Tesla received a $465m loan as part of a federal stimulus package – money that essentially paid for the development and manufacture of the groundbreaking Model S. Musk, who’s quick to note that Tesla paid that loan back early, moves those cars with help from considerable tax breaks for electric vehicles. And he further takes advantage of his cars’ absence of tailpipe emissions by reselling his cache of carbon credits to high-carbon emitting rivals under pressure to clean up – at least $517m since 2015. There’s a reason why Bill Ackman and other short-sellers bet big on Tesla to fail. The company would probably be as dead as Nikola Tesla himself if it hadn’t been for the government “raining money on fools”. Musk also claimed on Twitter that a recession would be good because “companies that are inherently negative cash flow (ie value destroyers) need to die, so that they stop consuming resources”. From 2010 to 2018, Tesla raised $20bn in capital while producing a negative cash flow of $9bn; 2021 was the company’s first full year of profitability. It isn’t just Washington that has been generous. Tesla also benefits from state tax income tax breaks for green vehicles and routinely helps itself to corporate subsidies. Since last August the company has received roughly $64m in incentives to move to Austin, Texas, and build Giga Texas – the spanking new factory that’s expected to produce another gonzo Musk idea, the Tesla Cybertruck. Musk’s other companies have benefited from corporate welfare schemes too. In 2015, the LA Times reckoned Musk’s companies had benefited from almost $5bn in government support. That includes SpaceX, which just landed a $2.89bn contract with Nasa and a $653m air force contract, both in 2021; and SolarCity, which capitalised on $1.5bn in government aid and haemorrhaged cash too before the solar energy company was absorbed into Tesla –which itself accepted payroll benefits from Donald Trump’s $600bn pandemic stimulus package. Musk can scold work-from-homers all he wants. But when it comes to benefiting from handouts and loans, few have been rained on more than him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2022/may/24/limits-on-renewables-will-keep-uk-energy-bills-higher-this-winter","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2022-05-24T15:54:06Z","webTitle":"Limits on renewables ‘will keep UK energy bills higher this winter’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/24/limits-on-renewables-will-keep-uk-energy-bills-higher-this-winter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2022/may/24/limits-on-renewables-will-keep-uk-energy-bills-higher-this-winter","fields":{"headline":"Limits on renewables ‘will keep UK energy bills higher this winter’","publication":"theguardian.com","bodyText":"Consumers will face higher energy bills than necessary next winter because of a decision by the government to limit new renewable energy generation, described as a “missed opportunity” by the renewables industry, and “outdated thinking” by a green campaign group. Ministers have decided to authorise contracts for about 12GW of new renewable energy generation, to start construction this year, with much of it likely to come on stream before next autumn. However, the renewable energy industry estimates that about 17.4GW of projects have cleared planning permission and are “shovel-ready”. The shortfall in what the government is prepared to allow, through an auctioning system, means many of these potential projects are likely not to be built this year, and consumers will be deprived of the energy savings on bills that come from renewable energy. Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels, which have soared in price during the Ukraine war. Onshore and offshore wind and solar power all command about £40 per megawatt hour on the market today, but gas-fired power generation costs about £140 per megawatt hour. Under the system of “contracts for difference”, renewable energy generators bid for contracts to produce power, but the government can set an overall limit on how much capacity it wants in the auctions, and can set limits on how much cash it is prepared to provide as incentives. On Friday, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy laid out plans for an auction, to take place on 5-6 July, allowing for 5GW of capacity to be competed for by onshore wind and solar, neither of which can take more than 3.5GW in total. The government was also expected to set a cap on offshore wind, of about 7GW of new capacity. Instead it set no cap but limited the incentive “pot” to £200m. Industry sources said that pot would amount to a de facto cap of about 7GW on new offshore wind capacity. At about 12GW, this is the biggest auction so far, but still falls far below what the industry says is possible: according to industry estimates, there are about 8.5GW of offshore windfarms that could come on stream, along with about 3.9GW of onshore wind and about 5GW of solar farms. Many groups, including unions, the CBI employers’ organisation, the National Farmers’ Union, and green and consumer groups, had called for the government to increase the amount of renewable energy generation. Research shows that renewable energy brings down energy bills for consumers: if the 12GW the government is planning had been available last winter, energy bills would have been about £100 lower for the average household. Labour said energy billpayers would suffer. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “Once again, families are paying higher energy bills as a direct result of Conservative failure. The government is intentionally blocking access to the quickest, cheapest, cleanest forms of new power, stopping enough onshore wind and solar energy to power 3m homes. These are shovel-ready projects, with planning permission, that could be generating energy for our country at a quarter of the price of gas by the end of next year.” He added: “This terrible decision, bowing to the concerns of a few Tory backbenchers, damages investment, forfeits good jobs across the country, keeps bills high, and continues our exposure to Putin’s gas.” Doug Parr, a policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: “We have a global climate emergency which requires low carbon power, we have a cost of living crisis which requires cheap power, and we have a war in Ukraine that requires domestic power. By an amazing stroke of luck, renewables are low-carbon, cheap, domestic and can be deployed faster than the alternatives. Capacity limits on cheap renewables are outdated thinking.” The new contracts for difference auction follows a pattern of slowing growth in renewable energy in the UK, according to analysis conducted by the Liberal Democrats on government data. Total renewable capacity grew by 3.4% to 49.44GW in the year to December 2021, compared with an average annual rise of about 18% over the previous 11 years. Wera Hobhouse, the climate and energy spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “Under the Conservatives, the UK renewables industry has been neglected again and again. The country has been left overly reliant on gas, worsening the cost of living crisis which is hitting households hard. These projects would reduce energy bills but it needs the right political leadership from the Conservatives.” She added: “There is no question that the Conservative government must drastically increase renewable energy capacity and this starts with a much more ambitious round of auctions for clean energy projects. Recently [in the local elections], British people sent a message that the Conservatives have let them down. The lack of ambition in renewables is just another example that will leave millions vulnerable to ever-soaring energy bills.” A government spokesperson said: “The Covid pandemic and its aftermath understandably slowed infrastructure deployment across the country. That said, nearly 40% of our electricity now comes from renewable sources, and since 2010 we have delivered a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid. The contracts for difference scheme has been hugely successful in boosting UK energy supply and reducing our dependence on volatile fossil fuels, with competitive auctions reducing the price of offshore wind by around 65% since 2015.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
