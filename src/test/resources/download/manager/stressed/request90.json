The letter says the investigation is necessary after concerns “raised in the media in regards to the potential conflicts of interests between former Asic chairman Greg Medcraft and the, currently stood aside, senior counsel for AMP, Brian Salter.” The banking royal commission heard last week that Salter had helped to draft an “independent” report on AMP – written by his former firm Clayton Utz – about AMP’s practice of charging customers fees without providing any service, before the report was handed to the regulator. The commission heard the report had gone through 25 drafts, after more than 700 emails were exchanged between AMP and Clayton Utz, and that Salter had revised the wording of the report to remove the name of AMP’s chief executive, Craig Meller. Salter was stood aside last week as AMP’s general counsel, a position he has held since 2008. He was also stood aside as a member of Asic’s external Financial Services and Credit Panel whose members advise Asic on whether to make banning orders against financial planners. Salter – who was best man at Medcraft’s wedding – had interactions with Asic commissioners as a member of that advisory panel. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon In a letter seen by Guardian Australia, Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson has written to the auditor general, Grant Hehir, requesting an investigation of Asic’s declaration-of-interest and conflict-of-interest policies across the entire organisation, “particularly for commissioners and senior staff”. He asks that attention be drawn to how Asic manages and declares such potential conflicts of interest when commissioners are personal friends with individuals under scrutiny. “It is plain that the public might view the role of Medcraft having regulatory interactions with Salter, and the appointment of Salter to an Asic panel, as a potential conflict that needs to be declared and managed,” the letter says. “I am not in a position to determine whether this conflict was declared and how it was managed if declared because there appears to be no public documentation or comments on this matter. “I am not suggesting there was any wrongdoing involved from either person mentioned but I am suggesting that work needs to draw attention to how such potential conflicts are declared and managed. “I would like you to examine how conflicts are managed in Asic when dealing with them as regulator, where Asic staff or commissioners provide oversight where friends or former colleagues may be in senior positions, and also how conflicts are managed when such people are appointed to government panels.” In 2015 the commonwealth ombudsman recommended Asic review its conflict of interest policies after a former employee alleged it had been unduly influenced by the Investment and Financial Services Association (IFSA) when granting regulatory relief for superannuation calculators in 2005. The ombudsman found “no evidence” to suggest that Asic’s decision to grant relief was contaminated by conflict of interest or other undue influence, but it criticised Asic for failing to “comply with its own internal policies for dealing with conflicts of interest”. Whish-Wilson has also called on the Coalition and Labor to stop taking donations from banks and financial advisers under scrutiny at the banking royal commission. According to Australian Electoral Commission donations data, cross-matched with the Greens’ Democracy for Sale database, groups falling within the remit of the royal commission’s terms of reference have donated at least $15m to the Coalition and Labor, at the federal level, over the last decade. They include commercial banks, insurance agencies, financial advisers, wealth managers and lobby groups for the financial services industry. Since 2008-09, the big four banks and AMP alone have donated $3.8m to the federal Liberal and National parties and Labor. The Greens say they do not accept donations from major banks or financial services entities. National Australia Bank stopped making political donations to the Coalition and Labor in May 2016, saying it wanted to be “respected as a bank”. That didn’t stop it coming under fire last month after the royal commission heard evidence of NAB staff being involved in an alleged bribery ring between 2013 and 2016, which covered multiple branches. Whish-Wilson said the major parties should place political donations from major banks and financial planners into a compensation fund for victims. “On the one hand Labor and Liberals are now happy to criticise financial service companies for their conduct. On the other hand they have been just as happy to accept their donations. What does this say to the public about their parties’ ethical standards?” he said. “I am calling on all political parties to stop taking political donations from big finance immediately and for the parties to place any donations they have received into a victims compensation fund. “Political parties shouldn’t be profiting from the banks and the likes of AMP while victims are currently left uncompensated.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/26/pollutionwatch-spring-is-often-the-worst-time-in-uk-for-air-pollution","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-26T20:30:26Z","webTitle":"Pollutionwatch: spring is often the worst time in UK for air pollution","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/26/pollutionwatch-spring-is-often-the-worst-time-in-uk-for-air-pollution","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/26/pollutionwatch-spring-is-often-the-worst-time-in-uk-for-air-pollution","fields":{"headline":"Pollutionwatch: spring is often the worst time in UK for air pollution","bodyText":"Runners in this year’s London Marathon escaped breathing badly polluted air as westerly winds cleared springtime smog just before the race start. Images of spring include blossom and fresh green growth, but it is often our most polluted time of year, and air pollution frequently reaches the top level on the UK government’s 10-point scale. In spring 2014 Paris instigated odd/even number plate bans and David Cameron memorably tweeted that he was cancelling his run due to air pollution. That year, spring particle pollution caused an estimated 600 early deaths across England and Wales. Springtime particle pollution happens when factory emissions and traffic exhaust mix in the air with ammonia from farms. Fertiliser for seedlings, slurry spread on fields and animals let out from their winter housing together cause more ammonia in spring than at any other time of year. This April, particle pollution has mainly been less than level 7 on the government’s scale. The cold March weather has delayed farm schedules. In mid-April potatoes were not yet in the ground and wheat and barley sowing was weeks later than normal. This may delay the seasonal ammonia release and extend our spring particle pollution into May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/25/blue-palace-blenheim-to-celebrate-colour-visionary-yves-klein","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T23:01:32Z","webTitle":"Blue palace: Blenheim to celebrate colour visionary Yves Klein","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/25/blue-palace-blenheim-to-celebrate-colour-visionary-yves-klein","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/25/blue-palace-blenheim-to-celebrate-colour-visionary-yves-klein","fields":{"headline":"Blue palace: Blenheim to celebrate colour visionary Yves Klein","bodyText":"There will be no naked women rolling in searingly blue paint at Blenheim Palace this summer, but the stupendously grand rooms will hold some of the most famous paintings by the French artist Yves Klein – the Anthropometry series created at live events for which he used volunteers as human paint brushes. More than half a century after his death in 1962, aged just 34, his trademark intense ultramarine blue – a pigment he saw as bridging the gap between the real world and the sublime through pure colour – is still officially known as International Klein Blue. This summer the palace will house the most comprehensive UK exhibition of Klein’s work, in what would have been his 90th year. It will include paintings and installation pieces, and classically inspired sculptures such as a version of the Venus de Milo, challenging the antique marbles filling many of the state rooms. “His attitude to life was that everything was possible as long as you set your mind to it – a very positive outlook on the world which is perhaps something we need more than ever now,” said the curator Michael Frahm. “He died too young, but he was hugely hard working, and his work remains highly influential, one of the most original and influential artists of the 20th century.” Frahm is the director of the Blenheim Art Foundation, founded in 2014 by Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill to bring annual exhibitions of contemporary art into the bewilderingly grand formal rooms of his family home. The series has formerly featured living artists and launched with a major exhibition from Ai Weiwei. The Chinese artist was then under house arrest in Beijing but toured the the space to plan the installation through a specially created 3D computer model. The exhibition proved so popular its run had to be extended twice. The 18th-century Oxfordshire palace, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh and set in a landscape designed by the famed gardener Capability Brown, has been a Unesco World Heritage site since 1987. Blenheim was conceived as a gift from the grateful nation to the first Duke of Marlborough for his victories in war, but as the costs escalated dizzyingly funds stopped with £220,000 spent and the 28,330-sq-metre (seven-acre) house only half completed. It was finished years later when his widow, the formidable Sarah Churchill, sacked the architect and insisted on lower wages and cheaper materials.

Having dragged this 1972 Invacar from a boggy field in Sussex, Ian Seabrook has decided to prepare the ungainly ice-blue three-wheeler for probably the biggest adventure of its life. He’s going to drive it 170 miles from his home in Wales to the brilliantly eccentric Festival of the Unexceptional in Buckinghamshire. Fans of mint-condition Austin Allegros and cherished Datsun Sunnys will do well to make their way to Stowe House for the jamboree on 14 July. Ian’s Invacar was effectively banned from the road in 2003, but somehow his was part of a group of 15 that escaped the scrapman’s grab and now the former invalid carriage is insured, taxed and undergoing testing – so far this has revealed a huge oil leak and a serious carburettor fault. Ian hasn’t managed 17 miles in yet, let alone 170! Originally, there were many different invalid carriages, but the government wanted a standard design. AC of Cobra fame did the job, coming up with the Model 70, and It was designed to use Fiat running gear, but Fiat were reluctant to provide powerplants. So the engine from the Austrian-built Fiat 500 was used, a Steyr-Puch air-cooled flat twin of 493cc and 20bhp. Around 18,000 were built between 1972 and 1977, with AC and Invacar Ltd building half of that total each. Invacar Ltd was run by the same people who built the Greeves motorcycles, and this company built the very first Invacar in 1948. Invacar was based in Thundersley, which is perhaps why these blue (they were all ice blue) three-wheelers are often known as Thundersley Invacars. After pressure from Graham Hill and others, the scheme was ended in 1977 on safety grounds. It’s easy to see why. There’s very little crash protection, they’re quite unstable and wheelchair users did not need to take a proper driving test in order to drive them. It was decided that people who already had an Invacar could keep it, but the scheme finally came to a complete end in 2003 and within the space of a week or so, all remaining Invacars (several hundred) were collected from their ‘owners.’ The cars were leased to the end user. When Ian took his TWC 725K for its first drive, he found it terrifying but exhilarating, and bedecked by running problems. It’ll be a minor miracle if he makes it all the way to the festival, but we wish him the best of luck. Follow his exploits at youtube. com/HubNut.

Afzal Shah, a Labour councillor in Bristol, has questioned whether white colleagues on the police and crime panel he sits on would have been arrested in the same circumstances and suggested there was “institutional bias” in the force. Avon &amp; Somerset police have apologised, but said officers were acting in good faith when they arrested Shah, who describes himself as British Asian or British Pakistani. But Shah told the Guardian on Tuesday: “When I was being de-arrested, I said, ‘I want to know why I was arrested.’ I told them this is illogical. I’m finding this deeply distressing and troubling. The police said: ‘We thought you were someone else.’ “I’m a councillor, being a member of the police and crime panel. Imagine one of my colleagues in Taunton, Weston-super-Mare or Yeovil walking into a police station to report a very serious offence. Other things being equal, would they have been arrested in similar circumstances? I don’t think so. I honestly don’t believe they would have been arrested. There’s bias there. As far as I’m concerned, there’s bias in the police logic as to why I was arrested. “I’m not satisfied. There are lot of good police officers. We are fortunate to have a good chief constable. But is there institutional bias within the police force? Absolutely.” Shah went to the Trinity Road police station in Bristol to report a crime on behalf of someone else. Instead of taking his statement, officers told him they believed he was a person suspected of making threats of violence and read him his rights. He explained that he was a local councillor and had been in a council meeting when the alleged crime he was being arrested for took place. This was ignored, he says. There are no custody cells at Trinity Road, but Shah was placed in the back of a secure police car in the public car park outside the police station. Police then realised they had the wrong person and de-arrested him. Shah said: “I was told it was a misunderstanding, and that the person who they were looking for looked like me. They said: ‘We had a description similar to yourself.’ During my time as a local Labour councillor – including as a member of the region’s police and crime panel – I have worked hard to build bridges between communities in Easton and our local constabulary.” In a statement, Avon &amp; Somerset police said: “Police have apologised for the inconvenience and distress caused when he was arrested and detained in a police car after being wrongly identified by a victim as one of the perpetrators of a crime.” Supt Andy Bennett said: “Officers acted in good faith in arresting Cllr Shah at Trinity Road police station after another man who was in the station reporting an offence visually identified him as one of the people involved. This identification was later found to be incorrect and Cllr Shah was released without having been taken to a custody unit. “We are extremely grateful for Cllr Shah’s contribution to community policing, both as a councillor and as a member of the police and crime panel. We have apologised to him for the distress and embarrassment this incident has clearly caused him and welcome this opportunity to clarify this publicly.” A constable from the same force will be tried next month for allegedly shooting one of its race relations advisers with a Taser electronic weapon. Judah Adunbi, a former member of an independent advisory group to Avon &amp; Somerset police, was allegedly shot by an officer with a Taser stun gun in Easton, the ward that Shah represents. A video of the incident was widely shared on social media and made headlines around the world. PC Claire Boddie, of Avon &amp; Somerset police, has denied common assault and her trial is due to be heard by deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram next month. At the end of last year, a review of the investigation into the murder of Iranian refugee Bijan Ibrahimi in Bristol concluded there was institutional racism within Avon &amp; Somerset police."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/apr/24/winter-is-coming-how-weather-became-tv-coldest-villain-game-of-thrones-fortitude-the-terror","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T10:18:08Z","webTitle":"Winter is coming: how the weather became TV's coldest villain","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/24/winter-is-coming-how-weather-became-tv-coldest-villain-game-of-thrones-fortitude-the-terror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/24/winter-is-coming-how-weather-became-tv-coldest-villain-game-of-thrones-fortitude-the-terror","fields":{"headline":"Winter is coming: how the weather became TV's coldest villain","bodyText":"As you navigate the TV listing straits, you might think that The Terror is one to swerve. It has the title of a B movie, the premise of a 50s creature feature and, frankly, looks colossally depressing. Curb your pessimism, though: the show has been one of the finds of 2018. An adaptation of Dan Simmons’ novel, it is based on the real-life expedition of HMS Erebus and its bomb vessel HMS Terror as they set out to find the northwest passage through the Arctic Ocean and into the Pacific in the 1840s. With an imposing cast including Jared Harris, Tobias Menzies and Ciarán Hinds, it garnered gushing reviews when it premiered in the US earlier this year. All we know for sure of the historical expedition is that the ships were locked in ice and that the 129 men who set out were never seen again. On the show, weeks turn into months as the stranded men await a thaw; they are menaced by a giant – possibly monstrous – polar bear and are beset by the kind of unravelling of the mind inevitable when stranded in one of the planet’s most hostile environments. As the ice exerts a vice-like grip on the ships, the predicament likewise seizes the psyches of the men. Alongside an intense camaraderie, fear, resentment and paranoia flourish. It often calls to mind that other great tale of naval misadventure, Das Boot. The biggest boogieman on board, though, is the winter itself. It is far from the first time storytellers have employed winter’s elemental heft to good effect. Game of Thrones may have its dragons, sadists, warlocks and shape-shifting assassins, but the people of the north knows that nothing puts the fear of god(s) into their children more than the phrase “winter is coming”. In a land where winters last for decades and sometimes harbour an army of death-dealing ice zombies, this is understandable. Nor is The Terror the first time that TV has used a historical event as a springboard for frozen horror. NBC’s Siberia took the Tunguska meteor event of 1908 and ran with it, producing a fictional reality TV show where 16 wannabes were dropped in a Siberian forest and left to fend for themselves. Scheming co-contestants wound up being the least of their worries as natives, monsters and reality TV convention conspired to march them towards a fate worse than eviction. Just like The Terror, Sky Atlantic’s genre-straddling Fortitude leaned heavily on its Arctic setting for its thrills. There are not many places on Earth where ichneumon wasps can incubate inside the carcass of a frozen mammoth for thousands of years to unleash a psychosis-inducing plague on an unwitting human community, but the glacier-bound Fortitude is one of them. With the melting of the ice caps causing the thawing that releases the wasps, the glacier became a powerful metaphor for the dangers of global warming (among all the carnage and killing). Sometimes it can be more subtle than that. When Tomas Alfredson redefined the vampire movie with Let the Right One In, he did so in the depths of a Stockholm winter. It is the perfect backdrop for 12-year-old Oskar’s isolation and despair – and for his beautiful friendship with the vamp next door, Eli. As cruel as the dark months are, they are also gorgeous. The Terror knows the power of its location well. The physical dangers of frostbite, polar bears and malnutrition are bad enough. Worse still are the psychological horrors born from their predicament: nights that last for weeks; cold that cuts to the core; an isolation from the world as pure as the ice that imprisons them. If anything, it is surprising that fear of the cold is not exploited more often in TV and film. If you are from a country where two inches of snow causes calamity, there are few things scarier than a wasteland with naught but ice for miles in every direction. For students of horror, it is no surprise that the ninth circle of hell is frozen.

Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, branded the DNC action a “last-ditch effort to revive the witch-hunt with a lawsuit”. Trump tweeted that it was “so funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning”. Even some Democrats have expressed reservations. “I think this sidebar lawsuit is not in the interest of the American people,” the US congresswoman Jackie Speier of San Francisco, who has a law degree, told CNN. But the lawsuit is distinct in significant ways from parallel legal actions and – if it is not dismissed outright at an early stage – it could add significantly to public knowledge, at least, about Trump campaign activities and Russian election tampering, legal experts said. “[It] might end up becoming a really, really powerful tool for the DNC to actually unearth new information,” Susan Hennessey, executive editor of the Lawfare blog and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told PBS Newshour on Friday. The DNC suit alleges that the Trump campaign was a racketeering enterprise engaged in an illegal conspiracy to influence the outcome of the election. Unlike parallel legal actions, the lawsuit names as defendants Donald Trump Jr and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and adviser. While both men have been subject to grand jury subpoenas issued by the special counsel Robert Mueller, and Kushner sat for a private meeting with Mueller in November 2017, neither has been charged by Mueller, as far as is publicly known. The brothers-in-law have separately denied any wrongdoing. The DNC lawsuit could be seen as an outrider to Mueller’s investigation of alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and related matters, Hennessey told PBS. “I think that they are fundamentally unrelated,” she said. “We don’t know much about the Mueller investigation. The DNC suit both relies on the Mueller investigation, because it uses some evidence that actually comes from those court filings, and it also gets quite a bit ahead – it is alleging this actual conspiracy [and] we haven’t seen Mueller make that showing. “I think the best way to think about it is sort of parallel tracks, the same subject matter but not necessarily related.” In a separate lawsuit filed in July 2017, three plaintiffs whose emails were hacked and disseminated in the cyber-attacks on the DNC accused the Trump campaign and Trump’s former adviser Roger Stone of an invasion of privacy. Stone had boasted of communications with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks, which published the emails. A hearing on a motion to dismiss the suit, filed in US district court for the District of Columbia by the DNC donors Roy Cockrum and Eric Schoenberg, and the former DNC staffer Scott Comer, is scheduled for 17 May. Writing last year on that lawsuit, Andrew Wright, a former White House associate counsel and a professor at Savannah Law School, concluded: “This is an extraordinary case in which discovery orders on the path to that proof could be as important to the public discourse as the outcome of the case itself.” The same dynamic could hold in the DNC suit, Wright said in an email to the Guardian, with important information coming to light through judicial proceedings. Hennessey, meanwhile, said: “This is an amazingly complex legal landscape.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/29/why-west-ham-fans-are-in-revolt","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T08:30:38Z","webTitle":"‘It’s soulless here’: why West Ham fans are in revolt","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/29/why-west-ham-fans-are-in-revolt","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/29/why-west-ham-fans-are-in-revolt","fields":{"headline":"‘It’s soulless here’: why West Ham fans are in revolt","bodyText":"It’s a mild Monday evening in April and 56,795 people, officially at least, have come along to London Stadium at the Olympic Park in Stratford to watch West Ham United play Stoke City in a bottom-of-the-table Premier League match. That’s a large crowd, by any standards, but judging by the fans milling around the huge concourse outside the ground, it’s not a happy one. Of course, football fans are not renowned for their cheery optimism. By and large, it’s a grim business being a supporter, a forlorn struggle between daydreams and despair. As Nick Hornby wrote in Fever Pitch: “The natural state of the football fan is bitter disappointment, no matter what the score.” In March, during a match against Burnley, some West Ham fans were sufficiently disappointed to invade the pitch in an act of protest. A much larger number gathered beneath the directors’ box to hurl insults and objects at the joint chairmen of the club, David Sullivan and David Gold, who were ushered away by security as the protesters – in a show of magical thinking of which diehard supporters are reliably capable – demanded that the board sack itself. It’s highly unlikely that this scene would have taken place had West Ham been at the top end of the table, yet the animosity was about more than a poor performance (they went on to lose 3-0 to Burnley). West Ham are no strangers to setbacks. They’ve twice been relegated in this century, and endured several spells in the second tier in the last century. Such reversals are understood to be part of the twists in fortune that inevitably attend competitive sport. What has upset the fans this season is not the loss of a football match so much as the loss of an identity. As far as the West Ham faithful are concerned, the move in 2016 from the old Boleyn Ground in Upton Park, three miles to the east, to the London Stadium in Stratford feels like a painful exile from their spiritual home. A typical complaint I heard before the Stoke game came from Tom Girling, a 52-year-old who has been following West Ham since he was 13. “This place is soulless,” he said, gesturing at the stadium and the empty expanse in which it’s located. “It’s got nothing. I used to go to Upton Park, grab a programme, nip in the pie and mash, have a bet, into the boozer, meet my pals, all good, have a laugh, then out afterwards. I’ve got nish here. I’m out in the elements drinking beer out of a plastic glass.” I told him that I’d seen a pie and mash kiosk outside nearby Hackney Wick station, and there is one on the perimeter of the stadium. He looked at me as if I’d suggested becoming a Spurs fan. “You mean the fashionista place?” he asked scathingly. “No, no, no. I’m not being funny… you’ve got all these trendy bearded people and they’ve got all these 13-hop ales I don’t understand. I’m old school. I like a pint of Carling. I’m a working-class boy. Football’s a working-class man’s game.” As we know, there are few tribes who feel more endangered than the white working-class male. And while many will mock, the plight of disgruntled West Ham fans is in many ways a symbol of a culture that is rapidly vanishing from London life. Among the capital’s big football clubs, West Ham long enjoyed the reputation as being the most grounded in its community – the working-class East End. It was the home of heroes such as former players Billy Bonds and the late, legendary Bobby Moore. But east London is in the midst of a huge transformation, and nowhere is that process more evident than from the vantage point of the Olympic Park, a concrete wilderness sitting between the advance forces of gentrification: consumerism and hipsterism. On the east side of the park looms the giant glass edifice of the Westfield shopping centre, a glittering cathedral dedicated to the disposal of excess income. On the west is an old industrial quarter now inhabited by artists and canal-side bars with their craft beers and moodily hirsute clientele. Neither place feels like home to people like Girling, and nor does the “sterile wasteland” – as another fan, Mark Reynolds, describes it – that lies between them. “I don’t smell any burgers and onions,” Girling complains. Reynolds, a 56-year-old supporter of 43 years’ standing, agrees: “You go down to Upton Park and there’s boozers right by the ground. It was all locals and the market, and you had the Asian community. There was Nathan’s, the pie and eel shop, people used to queue up round the corner. It was just part of the match-day experience.” But pie and eels don’t transform a football team’s fortunes, and football, as we’re constantly reminded, is a business. If you’re going to be successful you need to generate enough money to buy the best players. To do that it helps if you can attract a large attendance. The capacity at Upton Park, a tight little ground, was 35,000. It’s 57,000 at the London Stadium. As the saying goes, do the maths. Sullivan and Gold did, and they argued that the new ground was the first step towards a bold, bright future. West Ham fans understand that logic; they just believe that that future is a cruel illusion. “The move to Stratford was made on the promise of a world-class team in a world-class stadium,” says Brian Williams, another long-term fan and author of Home from Home: A West Ham Supporter’s Struggle to Reach the Next Level. “After two seasons at the new place we know that that’s not true, and that we have given up our history, our heritage, our legacy, all of which was focused on Upton Park. So we have a very poor team playing at a stadium that is not fit for football.” History, heritage, legacy? Aren’t those rather inflated concepts. After all, it’s only a football pitch surrounded by some seats. What’s the big issue? Back in the summer of 2009 I was taken around a vast building site at Stratford by members of Sebastian Coe’s London Organising Committee for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. At its centre was a giant stadium in the mid-stages of construction, though its design – a rather bland modern bowl – was even then clear. It was built to hold 80,000 spectators and then to be disassembled to leave a capacity of around 25,000. Its legacy, which was the buzzword of Olympic planning, was to provide an athletics stadium to replace the decrepit National Sports Centre at Crystal Palace. Coe told me that there was a “complicated stakeholder landscape” that included the government, the mayor’s office, five London boroughs, UK Sport and Sport England, but everyone agreed that there should be no “white elephants” left behind by the Games. He explained that what distinguished the Olympic Stadium from previous ambitious public projects, like the Dome (now the O2 Centre), was “clarity of purpose”. Shortly afterwards it was decided that the idea of a national athletics stadium should be shelved. Suddenly the stadium’s longterm purpose was looking distinctly murky. The talk turned to a multi-purpose venue, which in fact was the concept originally discussed when London was bidding for the Games. At that time West Ham had expressed an interest in an occupancy, but were discouraged when a decision was made to design the stadium specifically for athletics. Once the Olympics were over, the stadium, having been built as an athletics arena, became the subject of complex tenancy competition between two football clubs – West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur – for what seemed like a cheap way of using a large stadium with great transport links. E20, the public company set up to run the stadium, offered a deal to the potential occupants in which taxpayers would pay many of the running costs, like policing, stewarding and turnstile operators. Tottenham’s bid involved knocking down the Olympic Stadium and building a football-specific arena in its place, which they estimated would cost a total of £320m. After much legal wrangling, and accusations of behind-the-scenes deals, it was West Ham who emerged victorious. And rather than knock down the stadium, the agreement was made to adapt it for football, at an estimated cost of £190m. Last year an independent review commissioned by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, found that costs had escalated to £323m – more than it would have cost to build a new stadium. Inside the London Stadium, the first thing you notice is the low rake of the terraces and the wide space between the pitch and the stands, where the athletics track is placed. The space is filled by a green cover which, according to West Ham’s previous manager, Slaven Bilic, left his players confused about the dimensions of the pitch. There was talk of changing the colour to claret – West Ham’s main kit colour – but that was blocked by the stadium’s owners. Green or claret, from where I’m sitting in the 35th row watching the Hammers take on Stoke, that gap makes the action looks oddly remote, as if disconnected from those watching it. From the 73rd row, at the back of the stadium, it’s more like looking through the wrong end of a telescope. The atmosphere is a mixture of anxious and surly, with very little singing by the home team. The exception is a couple of hearty renditions of West Ham’s club anthem, I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles. The lyrics, written by three Americans in 1918, are filled with a telling pathos. I’m forever blowing bubbles Pretty bubbles in the air They fly so high Nearly reach the sky Then like my dreams They fade and die Fortune’s always hiding I’ve looked everywhere I’m forever blowing bubbles Pretty bubbles in the air Who could sing with such conviction about fading and dying dreams but football fans? “We can make a din here,” Girling had told me, but he felt that it was a rare occurrence rather than the regular experience at Upton Park, where opposing teams were “intimidated” by the noise. Perhaps the only people who have been intimidated at the London Stadium this season are the owners, Sullivan and Gold. In the club programme for the Stoke match Sullivan wrote a defensive column, calling on the fans to “produce the goods in front of the cameras” (the match was live on Sky). The pair acquired a controlling stake in the club in 2010, buying out the previous owners – the rump of an Icelandic consortium that was bankrupted by the 2008 financial crisis. They had previously owned Birmingham City FC, where they proved to be less than popular. Having made their money in the porn business, then Ann Summers (Gold) and the Daily Sport (Sullivan), it’s fair to say they have seldom enjoyed a glowing public profile. But it could be argued that they are well suited to West Ham. They’re both working-class blokes made good. Gold, the son of an East End criminal, actually grew up a few yards from the Boleyn Ground and even played for the West Ham youth team. As the protests showed, however, that counts for little with the fans. There is a belief that Sullivan and Gold are prone to grand statements on which they can’t or won’t deliver. Williams suggests they’re “too hands-on in football matters”, in which they are not expert. This criticism, perhaps unsurprisingly in the still largely unreconstructed world of football, has been particularly addressed to West Ham’s vice-chairman, and sometime sidekick of Alan Sugar on The Apprentice, Karren Brady. One fan, who insisted on anonymity, told me: “I think she is probably the most malevolent influence there is at West Ham.” She did not endear herself to the fans when she tweeted 15 minutes before the Stoke match that her new TV show was starting at 8pm – the same time as kick-off. “Give It a Year starts on ITV,” she wrote, “hope you watch it and I hope you enjoy it!” “She seems more worried about her own ego than what’s going on at the clubs,” says Reynolds. “I’m not her biggest fan,” says Williams, with ironic understatement. Still, when all is said and done, at the time Sullivan and Gold bought the club it was in financial crisis. Following relegation, they guided it out of the Championship (the second tier league) and into mid-table Premiership security, and moved it into a brand-new stadium with good transport links in a part of London that is set to thrive. The old Boleyn Ground was not suited to expansion. It has since been demolished and new Barratt Homes are going up in a development called Upton Gardens – more East End gentrification. Nor is the area around the ground quite the pie and mash heaven of old cockney folklore; in fact it’s largely populated by Londoners of subcontinental origin, with Halal butchers and sari shops. Reynolds says that this was another element of life that made match days so appealing by contrast with the “soulless” experience of the new location. But perhaps it’s significant that many of the West Ham fans lament the loss of community to which they did not in any geographical sense belong. Williams, for example, lives in Brighton, though his wife hails originally from the East End, and Girling is a west Londoner with family roots in the east London meat trade. Reynolds lives in St Albans, “out in the shires”, as he put it. Of half a dozen fans I spoke to at the Stoke game, none lived near the old ground. From that admittedly small sample, Upton Park represented a link to a disappeared past for the East End’s white working-class diaspora. Not that West Ham followers are exclusively white or working class. You do see different ethnicities, but nowhere like the make-up of either the West Ham team itself or Newham, the borough that contains Upton Park and some of the Olympic Park, which – at 16.7% – has the lowest percentage of white British residents in London. None of that is to suggest West Ham is unwelcoming of other ethnicities; it’s to note that football, like east London, is in the midst of social transformation, and as with all change, some will find the new environment more alienating. “Detached” was how Girling characterised his fellow West Ham fans’ feelings about their new home. But it’s possible that to the next generation of fans, which is likely to come from a more diverse base and for whom the names of Billy Bonds and Bobby Moore may not possess the same totemic power, the new setting could well appear more open. One such candidate might have been 18-year-old Sami Sidhom from Forest Gate, a West Ham season ticket holder who was at the Stoke game. After the match he was stabbed to death outside his home in an apparently unprovoked attack, the latest victim of London’s epidemic of teen knife murders. As they often say in football, such tragic events lend a sense of perspective. Or as Williams acknowledges in his book, “relocating from one football stadium to another is not the most serious crisis facing humankind in these worrying times”. In truth, the London Stadium is not a ground best suited to watching football or generating an atmosphere of intense – or intimidating – togetherness. A restless, resentful feeling swirled around the bowl until Stoke, against the run of play, scored a goal. Then something more urgent and angry kicked in. The crowd bayed and cursed and in the last minute, the substitute Andy Carroll hit a superb volley to equalise. There was a sudden release of pent-up tension and the fans went home, if not happy, then mollified. West Ham will probably survive in the Premier League, but the culture and community with which it has for so long been associated may be destined, like those pretty bubbles, to fade and die."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/23/sunderland-what-next-debts-absent-owner","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T17:12:14Z","webTitle":"Large debts, absent owner, no identity – what next for Sunderland? | Louise Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/23/sunderland-what-next-debts-absent-owner","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/23/sunderland-what-next-debts-absent-owner","fields":{"headline":"Large debts, absent owner, no identity – what next for Sunderland?","bodyText":"Will Chris Coleman remain the manager and is he the right fit? Last November the man who led Wales to the Euro 2016 semi‑finals became Sunderland’s ninth manager in six years. Since then Coleman, whose record in club management is mixed, has won only five games. The consensus among fans is that he should be allowed to rebuild in League One and the 47‑year‑old keeps reiterating he wants to stay. Matters are complicated by Coleman having never spoken to Ellis Short, the club’s Florida-domiciled American billionaire owner who is desperate to sell. Coleman will demand the financial resources needed to mastermind a promotion challenge. If that does not happen a manager who was merely half joking when he said “I’ve thought about door-stepping Ellis”, could resign. He admits to feeling engulfed by a sense of “helplessness”. How bad is Sunderland’s financial situation? Very bad. Having been relegated from the top flight in 2017, Sunderland have the advantage of a £35m Premier League parachute payment next season but the latest financial figures, released a year ago, revealed £69m was owed to Short and £68m to Security Bank Capital, with the latter arrangement costing £8m a year in interest payments. The austerity measures implemented by Martin Bain, the chief executive, have reduced those arrears appreciably and Short is prepared to walk away in exchange for a buyer repaying a significant portion of his personal loan in addition to shouldering the wider debt but the finances remain forbidding. Progress on potential takeovers has foundered at the preliminary due diligence stage. Why is Short playing truant? Only he really knows but it appears Sunderland are a toy with which he has become bored. Perhaps this star of the private equity world is simply ashamed of the series of calamitous decisions made on his watch. Appointing several inexperienced executives to boardroom positions – most notably the former chief executive Margaret Byrne and the former director of football Roberto De Fanti – helped explain a disastrous recruitment policy that resulted in more than 80 non-loan signings made during the owner’s decade at the helm but only six players sold for a profit. In mitigation Short has invested the best part of £200m of his fortune in keeping the club afloat, writing off more than £100m. What will next season’s wage bill be? This season’s was £35m, high by Championship standards. Some players – Lamine Koné among them – will be sold but the majority do not have clauses triggering pay cuts in the event of relegation to League One. This is because they accepted 40% wage reductions on exiting the Premier League. The exceptions are players signed from last summer onwards whose incomes will be almost halved, and the £70,000-a-week former England midfielder Jack Rodwell. A £10m buy from Manchester City in 2014, Rodwell is unwanted by Coleman but, despite making only three appearances this season, declines to leave. A contractual oversight ensured he escaped a pay cut last summer but his weekly income will drop to £44,000. That remains jaw‑dropping in League One, where the average player commands around £2,000 a week. Rodwell’s years of expensive underachievement are emblematic of Sunderland’s malaise. What needs to change? A lot. Damningly no player spoke to the media – or club sponsors – following relegation last Saturday. This reflects not only a wider arrogance long evident within the club but a lack of leadership in the squad. “They’re not really bad lads and there are a few good guys in there but, collectively, it’s not a great dressing room, the culture’s not good,” confided one recent manager. There needs to be less reliance on loans – there have been seven this season – and sensible investment in restocking the squad with better characters. “It won’t take billions,” Coleman says, “but some investment is necessary.” The recruitment department could do with spending more time on their homework and less listening to agents. Tellingly, Sunderland signed three goalkeepers this season – Robbin Ruiter, Jason Steele and Lee Camp – but it remained the team’s weakest position with a series of mistakes from the trio hastening relegation. Coleman “hates that word philosophy” in a football context but is adamant the club desperately need an “identity” in which players, staff and supporters can believe. “We haven’t got an identity but I want to create one. It’s about signing the right people. You get players who are mercenaries and it’s all about money. There’s no pride in their jobs. They’re pretenders. I want to keep them away from Sunderland.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/26/alternative-medicine-photos-show-british-healthcare-before-nhs","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-25T23:01:00Z","webTitle":"Alternative medicine: photos show British healthcare before NHS","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/26/alternative-medicine-photos-show-british-healthcare-before-nhs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/26/alternative-medicine-photos-show-british-healthcare-before-nhs","fields":{"headline":"Alternative medicine: photos show British healthcare before NHS","bodyText":"In one image, a patient relaxes with a specially designed cigarette holder after being treated in a saline bath for burns. Another shows student nurses learning how to bandage the torso of a mannequin sporting an Errol Flynn-like moustache. They are just two from a vast photographic collection illustrating the human face of healthcare in Britain before the dawn of the NHS, which is being made available for public viewing online. Scenes of improvised wartime hospital wards, treatment of burns and early plastic surgery are among more than 4,000 images dating from 1938 to 1943, which were recently discovered by staff at Historic England’s archive in Swindon Nurses in training and relaxing during their time off are among others in the collection of photos taken by Topical press agency, which operated until the 1950s. More than 2,100 images have been digitised to mark this year’s 70th anniversary of the founding of the NHS. The project has been made possible with funding from the Wellcome Trust. Each photograph is accompanied by a typed description from the time. One, showing a group of women taking part in an exercise class at the Pioneer Health Centre in St Mary’s Road, south-east London, in October 1938, has an original caption reading: “Peckham mothers can keep that schoolgirl figure. The cares of housekeeping and raising a family can play havoc with a mother’s looks and bodily shapeliness.” Abigail Coats, the archive cataloguing officer at Historic England, said the photographs revealed health and welfare provision at a time of social upheaval and change. “But they also show staff having fun and unwinding after a long working day,” she said. “You can see just how far some medical developments have come, but also what has stayed largely unchanged.” The collection can be viewed on the Historic England wesbsite, along with video interviews conducted with former nurses who were shown the photos. Audrey Phillips, who was born in 1927 and began nursing in 1946, recalled the strict conditions imposed on her and other nurses who lived together in staff housing: “You were locked in at 10 o’clock. I did learn to climb up drainpipes but not till after I qualified.” Jean Woods, who began nursing two years later, spoke of the challenges of coping with significant workloads: “You had big wards of 32 beds, don’t forget, and there were only two nurses on duty at night-time on those wards. “If you were on a single, small ward of 20 beds there was only one of you. That was a bit hair-raising to be honest.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/apr/28/hilltop-village-holiday-homes-belmonte-calabro-calabria-italy","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-28T09:00:10Z","webTitle":"On Calabria's coast a fairytale village awakes from its slumber","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/28/hilltop-village-holiday-homes-belmonte-calabro-calabria-italy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/apr/28/hilltop-village-holiday-homes-belmonte-calabro-calabria-italy","fields":{"headline":"On Calabria's coast a fairytale village awakes from its slumber","bodyText":"The hills were on fire. It was August and the view from our car window of smoke rising from forest fires was as dramatic as the road taking us south. The “motorway of the sun”, more prosaically known as the A2, negotiates the mountains of Calabria through a series of tunnels and high bridges right down to the toe of Italy. Long before it reaches the tip, the autostrada veers south-west towards the coast, as if it’s had enough of the rugged interior. This was where we left it, in search of EcoBelmonte, one of just two alberghi diffusi in Calabria, in the historic centre of a village called Belmonte Calabro, where tufo stone houses are being converted into tourist accommodation. Calabria is a land of secrets, a stronghold of the Ndrangheta mafia, with sleepy, isolated villages hidden in its wildernesses – the region boasts three national parks. It’s also something of a mystery to foreign tourists, its charms less accessible and obvious than almost any other Italian region. EcoBelmonte, overlooking the Tyrrhenian coast, is no exception. For 500 years the residents of Belmonte Calabro fished and farmed, their lives changing little until the 1940s, when droves of villagers joined a countrywide wave of emigration. A lack of jobs in the rural south has seen the exodus continue, the younger generation always leaving. Belmonte Calabro’s medieval core is all but abandoned; its population, once 3,000, has dwindled to just 30, its houses have fallen into disrepair. One of the few young people to stay is Gianfranco Suriano, who has such happy memories of growing up in a village that felt like “one big family” that he wants to bring it back to life. With the help of a few friends, he set up a not-for-profit association and began the painstaking process of asking owners who had long abandoned their dwellings if he could convert them into holiday homes. It took four years to restore 14 houses – reusing found materials such as roof tiles to create a hearth, and non-toxic paints and cement. The result is one of the most magical places I’ve ever stayed. In this car-free enclave, houses are stacked tightly and linked by alleys barely a metre wide. Stone archways suddenly reveal tiny courtyards filled with flowers; painted steps lead around shadowy corners. Old Calabrian sayings are painted on walls and doors …“Clear sky is not afraid of some small thunder.” Our house, A Parta, was small and simple but had everything we needed. On arrival we were greeted by Gabriella, Gianfranco’s wife and manager of the project, who organised dinner for us in their restaurant, U Pimmiduoru e Bellimunti. (It means tomato of Belmonte in the local dialect. Tomatoes are big here, literally: they can grow up to 2kg.) On a vine-covered terrace we ate antipasti, then a giant pasta dish of capers, aubergine and of course tomatoes, followed by prickly pears plucked from around the village. The next day we continued exploring the village, walking up past crumbling Palazzo del Giudice, where plants had overtaken the wrought-iron balconies, past the Madre Maria Assunta church to the upper part of the village, where there were a few signs of modern life: a cafe, cars, a supermarket. At 9am it was already hot and, in what became a daily ritual, we headed for the relative cool of the cafe for an icy granita. Afterwards, an old lady tried to engage us in conversation, before realising our grasp of Italian barely extended beyond granita and cappuccino. She spotted the local doctor across the road and before we knew it he was giving me, my partner and our seven-year-old son a lift to the supermarket and insisting we meet him later for a tour. From the village, the sea, just over a mile away down a hairpin road, looked dazzling and inviting. We joined the Italians on the beach but with no umbrella or chairs were woefully ill-prepared for the heat. The only option was to wallow in the famously clear water. On the coast south of Belmonte, the resorts of Pizzo, Tropea and Scilla tick all the tourist boxes: ludicrously picturesque buildings above coves of turquoise water. By contrast, the long, straight pebbly beaches to the north are separated from modern seaside towns by the railway that runs the length of Italy’s west coast, and the SS18 main road. Here there are no big hotels, no serried rows of sun loungers, no preening or posing – just multi-generational Italian families who made playing and picnicking in 40C heat look effortless. On an outing to Pizzo we were amazed to find ourselves in the midst of a tourist throng, dodging slow-moving souvenir shoppers, and relieved to return to the tranquillity of EcoBelmonte. That night we discovered another restaurant, down an alley where tables overlooked the hillside and ordered penne with ’nduja, the spicy Calabrian sausage, and wine from Cantine Benvenuto, a vineyard further south. Called Taverna Intru U Vica, it is also a B&amp;B, independent of EcoBelmonte. Belmonte Calabro is one of six historic hilltop villages a mile or so inland and barely visible from the coast. Another, Fiumefreddo Bruzio, was named one of the 20 most beautiful villages in Italy last year. In most countries such an accolade would bring a steady stream of visitors to eat gelato while looking out to sea, and posing by artist Salvatore Fiume’s bronze Surf Girl sculpture. We arrived at siesta time, when the streets were deserted except for a group of men locked in heated debate. They shouted, gesticulated and stormed off … only to reappear moments later with a comeback more passionate than the last. Ten minutes passed, 15, then 20, and still they raged. We watched from the cafe opposite, trying to guess the cause of their upset – politics, an affair? In the end, I asked the cafe owner. Road signs, he said. We headed back to EcoBelmonte, or ‘our village’ as we’d started to call it in the absence of other tourists, where the peace was disturbed only by church bells and snatches of a TV soap opera. With no pool and no other families, I worried that our son would be bored but he loved running freely about the village, saying it felt like “being in a fairytale”. One afternoon Gabriella invited him to decorate some tiles with her daughter, nephew and niece, and while the children painted she told of plans to restore another 14 houses over the next two years. As we were talking, an elderly neighbour appeared for her afternoon constitutional. Elvira remembers when the village was home to hundreds of children, constantly running in and out of each other’s homes. Now, at 85 years old, she is happy to see doors open, flowers blooming, and children playing once again. Where to stay Accommodation was provided by EcoBelmonte. Houses from €30 a night per adult (€40 in July-August), plus €5 per child up to 12, under-fives free. Car hire was provided by Sicily by Car. A week’s rental from Lamezia Terme airport costs from €120, including insurance. Getting there The nearest airport is Lamezia Terme (Ryanair flies from Stansted), a 45-minute drive away. Naples and Bari airports are about four hours away. Best time to visit Shoulder season (spring and autumn). July and August are sweltering and the houses often have no air conditioning."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/24/toys-r-us-fashion-chain-east-job-losses-house-of-fraser-sale-stake","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-24T16:43:27Z","webTitle":"Demise of Toys R Us and fashion chain East bring more job losses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/24/toys-r-us-fashion-chain-east-job-losses-house-of-fraser-sale-stake","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/24/toys-r-us-fashion-chain-east-job-losses-house-of-fraser-sale-stake","fields":{"headline":"Demise of Toys R Us and fashion chain East bring more job losses","bodyText":"The high street is braced for another wave of job losses as a result of the final demise of Toys R Us and the fashion chain East, and fresh speculation about the future of House of Fraser. The handful of Toys R Us stores that were still trading closed their doors for the final time on Tuesday, ending the US retailer’s three-decade presence in the UK. The toy chain, which had 3,200 staff and 100 stores, went into administration in February. The restructuring company Moorfields failed to find a buyer. Tough trading conditions have also scuppered East, which had 50 stores and collapsed in January. Its restructuring company, FRP Advisory, was also unable to find a buyer. The retailer’s 314 staff are likely to lose their jobs. An FRP Advisory spokesperson said: “After exploring opportunities to agree a sale of all or parts of the business, we have been unable to secure a buyer to date. “Currently, East Lifestyle Limited is due to cease trading on 4 May, with all employees being made redundant.” On Tuesday, House of Fraser’s parent company, Sanpower, confirmed it was in talks to sell a controlling stake to another Chinese group, C.banner International Holdings, which owns the toy chain Hamleys. Last month, the Sanpower subsidiary that owns House of Fraser said it was in talks to sell a 51% stake to Wuji Wenhua, a Chinese leisure group. Sanpower, controlled by Yuan Yafei, one of China’s richest men, acquired 89% of House of Fraser via its department store arm, Nanjing Cenbest, in 2014. The group had promised to invest in the British chain, but the financial backing it has provided has not been enough to prevent House of Fraser from struggling. In a statement released via the Hong Kong stock exchange, the two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding. C.banner said investing in House of Fraser would help it expand overseas and there would be collaborations with its existing footwear and toy retail companies. The department store chain said the proposed share sale would have no impact on day-to-day operations, declaring: “It is business as usual.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/29/win-butler-arcade-fire-cultural-highlights-caribbean-marlon-james-get-out-march-for-our-lives","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-29T09:00:39Z","webTitle":"On my radar: Win Butler’s cultural highlights","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/29/win-butler-arcade-fire-cultural-highlights-caribbean-marlon-james-get-out-march-for-our-lives","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/29/win-butler-arcade-fire-cultural-highlights-caribbean-marlon-james-get-out-march-for-our-lives","fields":{"headline":"On my radar: Win Butler’s cultural highlights","bodyText":"Born in California and raised in Texas, Win Butler is the frontman of Canadian rock band Arcade Fire. Their debut album, Funeral (2004), was a critical and commercial success, ranking 151st on Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. Their third, The Suburbs (2010), won two Brit awards and a Grammy. Butler has been married to bandmate Régine Chassagne since 2003. Last year the band released their fifth studio album Everything Now and are currently touring Europe. 1. Music Bomba Estéreo We just did a big tour of Latin America and it’s really gotten me on a kick of how incredible Colombian music is. There’s so many different genres: on the Caribbean coast of Colombia you get a really interesting mix between salsa and Latin rhythm and African rhythm, and also sound system culture reminiscent of things I’ve seen in Jamaica. Bomba Estéreo sound really modern, but drawing on these deep rhythms and folk music idioms and instrumentation. It’s almost like the way LCD Soundsystem draws on New York disco – but for champeta and cumbia [folk music]. 2. Book A Brief History of Seven Killings, by Marlon James This totally blew my mind. The language and the history of Jamaica were just really truthful and hard – it’s a kind of Caribbean writing that’s post-Gabriel García Márquez. The background to it is the politics in Jamaica around the assassination attempt on Bob Marley [in 1976], and you get a sense of the CIA’s involvement in Jamaica, and the games that were going on in the 70s. We spend a lot of time in Haiti [the late mother of Butler’s wife and bandmate, Régine Chassagne, was Haitian] and you become really aware of foreign power and how it navigates in the shadows of these Caribbean and Latin countries. 3. Event Krewe du Kanaval, New Orleans New Orleans is a very Caribbean city: after the Haitian revolution at the turn of the 19th century the city’s population doubled with Haitians. A lot of the city’s lifeblood – the beats, the jazz, the brass culture – comes from Creole roots and free slaves. So we started a Mardi Gras crew there and threw a giant street party. We had Congolese artists, Haitian drummers, and a priest who said a prayer about Louis Armstrong and Africa. Our colour scheme is pink and green, with jackets for members. I can’t wait till next year – I’m counting the days. 4. Film Get Out (Director Jordan Peele, 2017) I went to Sarah Lawrence college in New York and I’m pretty sure Jordan Peele was there at the same time. We both dropped out, but maybe if I’d met him I wouldn’t have. I thought this should have won the best picture Oscar – it was so fresh and scary and funny. A lot of my favourite films walk this balance between horror and comedy. I think when people who come from comedy make the transition into drama it can be a lot more interesting: Terry Gilliam, the Coen brothers. 5. Movement March for Our Lives Last year there was a mass shooting at a country music festival in Las Vegas, and we played the same site a couple of weeks later. It’s horrific that it hasn’t moved the needle at all on gun control, but to have all these kids leading the charge, it’s one of the more hopeful political moments in a while, because it’s been kind of a slog. I think everyone who was working on the first Obama campaign was like: “Hey, I remember this feeling of actual grassroots movement.” We’re going to get this clown out, and then we’ll try to change some things. 6. Dance Moonshine, Montreal This is a rave that happens once a month in different venues, started by these Congolese-Canadian kids. I randomly went several years ago, and there were all these people breakdancing – really dancing. It was such a beautiful vibe. In Montreal it’s rare to have a scene that’s anglophone and French and black and white and really mixed. The music is incredible. It’s not really a drug thing – it’s just really awesome, and kind of rare, because a lot of the time these sort of things just end up becoming kind of depressing.

Trump made public the letter from Dr Harold Bornstein on the eve of the presidential primary contests to allay concerns about his fitness. Two days before the letter was released, Trump tweeted: “As a presidential candidate, I have instructed my long-time doctor to issue, within two weeks, a full medical report – it will show perfection.” The letter said Trump had shed 15lbs in the previous 12 months, said “his cardiovascular status is excellent” and concluded: “If elected, Mr Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Bornstein, described in the note as Trump’s physician “since 1980”, told CNN on Tuesday that he did not write the letter. “He dictated that whole letter. I didn’t write that letter,” Bornstein said. The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Earlier on Tuesday, Bornstein said the longtime Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller and two other men had conducted a “raid” on his offices for Trump’s medical records in February 2017, two days after Bornstein told a newspaper that he had for years prescribed Propecia, a hair growth medicine, for Trump. Bornstein told NBC News that he was not given a form authorising him to release Trump’s records, and that Schiller, along with Trump Organisation lawyer Alan Garten, took the originals and copies of Trump’s charts and lab reports, including records filed under pseudonyms. The raid left him “raped, frightened and sad”, Bornstein said. Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, defended the move. Asked about Bornstein’s characterisation of it as a “raid”, she replied: “No, that is not my understanding.” Sanders added: “It would be standard procedure for a newly elected president’s records to be in possession by the White House medical unit. And that was what was taking place, is those records were being transferred over to the White House medical unit as requested.” Bornstein said he was speaking out now after seeing reports that Ronny Jackson, allegedly known as “the candy man” for loosely prescribing pain medications as White House doctor, will not return to his post as Trump’s personal physician after his nomination to run veterans affairs became mired in scandal and collapsed. Trump in the past has pretended to be his own spokesman and was said by people who were there to have dictated onboard Air Force One a statement issued by Donald Trump Jr to explain why he met with Russian operatives at Trump Tower in June 2016. They “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children”, Trump Jr’s statement said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/02/newstart-embarrassingly-inadequate-and-history-will-judge-us-economist-says","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T05:01:00Z","webTitle":"Labor promises 'root and branch' review of inadequate Newstart payment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/newstart-embarrassingly-inadequate-and-history-will-judge-us-economist-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/02/newstart-embarrassingly-inadequate-and-history-will-judge-us-economist-says","fields":{"headline":"Labor promises 'root and branch' review of inadequate Newstart payment","bodyText":"Bill Shorten says a Labor government would pursue a “root and branch” review of Australia’s welfare payments after a leading economist called for Newstart to be increased by $50 a week. A senior partner at Deloitte Access Economics and renowned budget conservative, Chris Richardson, has called on the Turnbull government to boost the Newstart unemployment payment in next week’s budget, saying it had become “embarrassingly inadequate” and warned history would judge Australians harshly if it wasn’t fixed. He said the Newstart payment – which equates to $38.98 a day for a single person – hadn’t kept up with national living standards for more than a quarter of a century, and Australia shouldn’t be proud of setting aside so little to support its most vulnerable. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “If we had to nominate the single standout fairness failure in Australia in 2018, it is undoubtedly our embarrassingly inadequate unemployment benefits,” Richardson wrote this week. “Newstart hasn’t kept up with national living standards for more than a quarter of a century, shrinking sharply as a share of average and minimum wages, and relative to the age pension. And it’s set to shrink even further, as it is indexed to prices rather than wages. “We should add $50 a week to these payments, and immediately index them to wages. That would be $3bn well spent. “As you know, we are huge fans of budget repair. And we remain so. But budgets aren’t just about debts and deficits: how well we tax is vital to our prosperity, while the quality of the spending we make is vital to fairness.” With less than a week to go before the federal budget, Shorten has promised a future Labor government would review the welfare system, saying no one could live on $40 a day. The maximum Newstart payment is currently $272.90 a week for a single unemployed person, but the cost of essentials such as housing, groceries, energy, transport and clothing is a minimum of $433 per week, according to the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss). “I do think there’s a real problem for the government payments for the people at the very bottom of our society,” Shorten said on Wednesday. “That is why Labor has proposed having a root and branch review of Newstart and like-minded allowances and payments. “Who on earth amongst the government or anyone in the parliament could live on the Newstart allowance?” Acoss says there are roughly 647,000 receiving the single rate of Newstart and Youth Allowance, and 55% of people who receive Newstart live below the poverty line. Newstart has failed to keep pace with the national minimum wage, which is currently $694.90 a week for 38 ordinary hours work. The chief executive of Acoss, Cassandra Goldie, said she was “delighted” with Richardson’s contribution to the debate because Coalition and Labor governments had let the problem fester for too long. “We have persistently been calling for an increase in Newstart,” she said. “Since the global financial crisis, successive treasurers have introduced policies to move more and more people on to Newstart and off the higher pension arrangements … so they’re denying more people access to the disability support pension and the single parenting payment. “The gap is about $170 a week, a huge difference between the disability support pension and being on Newstart.” Goldie said Richardson’s proposal to boost the payment by $50 was still less than was required and called for a $75 rise. She said a single person on Newstart (plus rent assistance) actually received $96 per week less than the minimum budget needed to afford basics such as housing, meals, and bills, so while Newstart should increase by $75 per week, Rent Assistance should also be increased by $20 per week for a single person. She said a single unemployed person renting privately should really receive a $95 per week rise so they’re not in poverty. Independent South Australian senator Tim Storer has backed Richardson’s call for a $50 increase, saying it’s a good place to start. Australia should establish an independent mechanism to regularly review and adjust Newstart, he said, in a similar way to the Fair Work Commission setting the minimum wage, which would take away responsibility from the government. Greens senator Rachel Siewert agrees with Acoss that the “woefully low” Newstart payment should be increased by $75 a week. “The government has spent years vilifying people on income support – this needs to stop and this budget the government needs to recognise that payments need to increase,” Siewert said. “Keeping those without a job living below the poverty is unconscionable.” The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, was asked if Newstart’s $40 a day was “cruel” to people on unemployment benefits. “We focus very much on getting people off welfare and into work. The best form of welfare is a job,” she told reporters.

Releasing its latest quarterly report, Apple announced it had sold 52.2m iPhones in the quarter ending 31 March, at an average price of $728.54. Sales were up 3% compared to last year and slightly lower than analysts had expected, but numbers beat the gloomiest forecasts and were enough to deliver Apple its best second quarter ever, with revenues of over $61bn. That beat the record of $58bn set in 2015. “We’re thrilled to report our best March quarter ever, with strong revenue growth in iPhone, services and wearables,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer. “We are very bullish on Apple’s future,” Cook told analysts after the news broke. Apple sold 9.11m iPads and 4.08m Macs over the quarter. Analysts had worried that the high-priced iPhone X would dent sales. The results came after Apple suppliers including AMS and Taiwan Semiconductors have reported slowing revenues in a sign seen by analysts as proof of shaky demand for iPhone X. The company announced it would be adding $100bn to its stock buyback programme, plus a 16% increase in its quarterly dividend. Taking advantage of the Trump administration’s new tax laws, Apple is in the process of repatriating the majority of the $252bn in profits it currently holds overseas. The buyback helped Apple’s shares rise over 5% in after-hours trading. The company’s stock has risen by about 80% in the past two years, setting it on course to battle Amazon to become the first company to be valued at $1tn. But Apple’s share price has stumbled recently as fears about slowing iPhone sales took their toll. The iPhone remains Apple’s biggest product, even as sales of services and other items, including the Apple Watch, have grown. Services – from the Apple Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and others – generated $9bn over the quarter. But the 11-year-old mobile device accounts for the majority Apple’s revenues and contributed $100bn over the quarter. Despite the better-than-expected results, however, sales are slowing. Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, said the results did not mean innovation in the high-end smartphone is dead. Husson said: “However, it indicates Apple will have to smartly manage its iPhone product portfolio and pricing, especially in Asia, where some countries still witness smartphone growth Apple has proven over the past few years that it masters the art and science of managing its product portfolio.”Yet Husson believes 2018 represents a tipping point for Apple. “It has no choice but to demonstrate it can reduce its dependency on iPhone sales and enter new adjacent markets and territories,” he said. “Because it’s a human-centered and ideas-driven marketing company, Apple is still the most valuable brand worldwide and it would be a mistake to make too early a call based on this quarterly financial earnings.” On a call with analysts Cook was once again critical of tech rivals, including Facebook, that have been rocked by privacy scandals. “We believe privacy is a fundamental human right,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/08/colombia-false-positives-scandal-casualties-higher-thought-study","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T05:00:10Z","webTitle":"Colombian army killed thousands more civilians than reported, study claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/colombia-false-positives-scandal-casualties-higher-thought-study","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/08/colombia-false-positives-scandal-casualties-higher-thought-study","fields":{"headline":"Colombian army killed thousands more civilians than reported, study claims","bodyText":"Gloria Astrid Martínez last saw her son on the morning of 8 February 2008. After breakfast, Daniel, 21, left their home in Soacha, a downtrodden suburb of Colombia’s capital, to start a new job working on wealthy countryside estates. “He told me he found a job that would pay so much I wouldn’t have to work any more,” recalled Martínez. “It sounded too good to be true, but he insisted, so he left.” Eight months later, Daniel’s body was found clothed in jungle fatigues in a mass grave near the Venezuelan border. Soldiers from the Colombian army had lured Daniel with the promise of work to the city of Ocaña, 414 miles from Bogotá, where they murdered him and declared him a rebel fighter in order to boost their statistics in the war against leftist insurgents. The inflated figures, dubbed “false positives”, were used to justify US aid military packages while the officers who carried out the executions were rewarded with promotions and time off. When news of the killings first broke 2008, the scandal engulfed the Colombian military: dozens of senior officers were fired, and many rank-and-file soldiers went to prison. But a new study co-authored by a former police colonel alleges that the practice was far more widespread than previously reported: according to authors Omar Rojas Bolaños and Fabian Leonardo Benavides, approximately 10,000 civilians were executed by the army between 2002 and 2010 – more than three times the number tallied by human rights groups. In their book Extrajudicial Executions in Colombia, 2002-2010 – Blind Obedience in Fictitious Battlefields, the authors describe how Colombia’s army systematically killed civilians to boost their body counts. “We can call them ‘false positives’ or ‘extrajudicial executions’, but really these were cold-blooded murders,” said Rojas, who previously served 31 years as a police officer. “They were meticulously planned and carried by all ranks.” Rojas said disabled boys were specifically targeted because of their vulnerability as well as a handful of military men who were suspected of whistleblowing. “This isn’t just something that happened in the past: we are still finding ‘false positive’ cases today,” Rojas said. “It’s not with the same intensity as before, and now they call them ‘military errors’.” Colombia’s largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), signed a peace deal with the government in November 2016, formally ending 52 years of civil war that left 220,000 dead and over seven million displaced, mostly civilians. State-aligned paramilitaries and other leftwing groups contributed to the bloodshed, with atrocities committed by all sides. President Juan Manuel Santos – who was awarded the Nobel peace prize for shepherding through the deal – served as defense minister from 2006 until 2009, at the the height of the “false positive” killings. Activists say neither Santos nor his predecessor Álvaro Uribe have been called to account over the scandal, though Uribe faces several separate investigations over alleged war crimes. A key witness in one case was murdered in Medellín last month. Colombia’s government has often brushed off the scandal as the actions of a few rogue individuals. “‘False positives’ were not just a problem of a few bad apples,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “These apparently widespread and systematic extrajudicial killings were committed by troops attached to virtually all brigades in every single army division across Colombia.” The soldier who recruited Daniel is currently serving a 39-year sentence, along with many other middle and low ranking officers. But not a single general has been convicted. For Martínez, who has received death threats over her fight for justice, the impunity is galling. “They say the pain of loss gets easier everyday but that’s a lie, it gets worse,” she said, her voice cracking. “The state should protect its people, not kill them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/01/sugar-fat-junk-obsesity-uk-hugh-jamie-parliament-health-committee","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T19:37:15Z","webTitle":"Sugar, fat and junk nibbles on the Hugh and Jamie show | John Crace","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/01/sugar-fat-junk-obsesity-uk-hugh-jamie-parliament-health-committee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/01/sugar-fat-junk-obsesity-uk-hugh-jamie-parliament-health-committee","fields":{"headline":"Sugar, fat and junk nibbles on the Hugh and Jamie show","bodyText":"The proceedings are normally rather dour affairs but, for one afternoon only, the health and social care select committee was sprinkled with a little stardust as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall came to give evidence on the UK’s obesity crisis. The two chefs strolled into the room, took off their jackets and sat down. Lights, camera, action. The Jamie and Hugh Show could now begin. “Hello Jamie, hello Hugh,” gasped the star-struck committee chair, Sarah Wollaston. It’s more usual for witnesses to be called by their surnames on these occasions, but no one was in the mood to stand on ceremony. The two chefs put on their best professional smiles: they’re used to the brains of ordinarily rational people being turned to pulp by celebrity. Jamie began with a bombshell. Words that haven’t been heard around Westminster for several years. He loved David Cameron and George Osborne. More than that, he adored them. He dabbed an eye, overcome with emotion. Several members of the committee shuffled uncomfortably in their seats but Jamie’s passions were not to be denied. Dave and George had been political colossi for embracing his vision and implementing a sugar tax. Here’s one they had prepared earlier. Jamie held up a bottle of pre-sugar tax Ribena he had brought with him and 12 white bits of paper taped together hung down. One for every teaspoon of sugar in the drink. He then passed a bottle of post-sugar tax Ribena to Hugh. This only had a trail of five pieces of white paper. “Change can be a beautiful thing,” he said. The soft drinks levy was a tax for love – a maternal kind of tax – not a tax on the poor. “What do you think, Hugh?” asked Wollaston, aware that Hugh had barely been allowed to get a word in edgeways. “He’s absolutely right,” replied Hugh. Jamie nodded approvingly. Echoes of “I agree with Nick”. On this particular show, Hugh was most definitely the sous-chef. Jamie moved into the first ad break. Food advertisements were the worst. Pure evil, designed to tempt children into tipping bucketfuls of sugar, fat and processed foods down their throats. But it didn’t have to be this way. Take Tony the Tiger, the Frosties icon, whom Theresa May had boasted of saving when she had pulled the plug on Dave and George’s obesity initiative in her psychopathic desire to kill as many children as possible. Jamie had news for Satan Theresa. Tony the Tiger was sick to his rotten back teeth of trying to turn kiddies into chubsters. He was deeply ashamed and desperate to make amends. Tony the Tiger had seen the light and wanted nothing more than to bound through the jungle promoting the benefits of chia seeds and celery. At this point, Hugh started to get in on the act. Forget Tony the Tiger. What he wanted was a real live Batman with carrots for ears. A superhero who could inspire people to go foraging for turnips. “I’ve got a programme on the TV about this tomorrow night,” he added helpfully. Not all ads are bad ads. After Jamie had followed this up with an all-out assault on “buy one get one free” offers, Labour’s Diana Johnson wondered what he would have to say to someone who was hard up and was tempted into buying four sausage rolls for £1. There was a hush in the room. Then Jamie spoke, a beatific look on his face. “A sausage roll is a thing of beauty,” he said. “It should be cherished.” There was nothing wrong with treats, but far too many sausage rolls were mere imposters. Rubbish meat just wrapped in fat. Out, out, damned Gloucester old spot. Hugh chipped in once more. “Perhaps,” he said, “instead of selling four sausage rolls, the butcher could sell two sausage rolls and a couple of carrots.” You never know, it might catch on."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/may/01/exeter-university-expels-students-over-racism-row","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T21:27:05Z","webTitle":"Exeter University expels students over racism row","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/01/exeter-university-expels-students-over-racism-row","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/01/exeter-university-expels-students-over-racism-row","fields":{"headline":"Exeter University expels students over racism row","bodyText":"Several students at the University of Exeter have been expelled following allegations of racism, sexism and homophobia, amid growing anger over discrimination on higher education campuses. The students were sanctioned over a series of comments made on a WhatsApp group, including racial epithets and messages such as: “If you ain’t English, go home,” “bomb the mosques” and “we need a race war”, according to screengrabs posted online by a fellow student, Arsalan Motavali. There have been increasingly vociferous calls for racism to be tackled in UK universities and Motavali said he had been moved to act after reading about allegations at another institution. He said he created the “Dodgy Blokes Soc” WhatsApp group last summer for use by a small group of students attached to the Bracton Law Society – the largest student society at Exeter. But its content became “increasingly racist and deplorable” over time and he began to document the worst examples. Among them, he said, were cases in which students backed a policy of racial discrimination and joked about buying slaves from African countries, as well as about gang rape. Besides the university’s investigation, the revelations prompted an anti-racism rally, at which students expressed their concerns about the “recent vile racist and misogynistic comments” and the “systemic issues” behind them. Motavali and two fellow anti-racist activists at the University of Exeter, Chris Omanyondo and Roman Ibra, told the Guardian: “These incidents are happening all the time but they are not all visible. There will be other group chats and other incidents of intimidation but we will not always see the prejudice.” There have been past incidents at that institution and students have highlighted others on campuses across the country, including a slave auction that was advertised at Loughborough University and racial abuse written on bananas belonging to a black student at the University of Warwick. Last week, a University of Oxford student, Benedict Aldous, was selected for the boat race even though he was banned from social events at his college for wearing a Ku Klux Klan costume to a party. Aldous said he had meant no offence by wearing the costume. He said: “It was meant as a comment to Donald Trump’s possible connections to KKK members. I did not intend to offend anyone and removed the costume within two minutes of arriving.” On Tuesday, a University of Exeter spokesman said: “Following reports of allegations involving a small group of students, the university launched a major investigation, in conjunction with the students’ guild. This investigation has now concluded and the outcomes have included expulsions, suspensions and other significant sanctions. These outcomes are subject to appeal.” He said the institution was not willing to tolerate “any form of racist, sexist or bigoted behaviour and is committed to eradicating any instances of discrimination and harassment that may arise”. It was reported that five students were initially suspended from the university over the incident but Exeter refused to say how many had been expelled, suspended or subject to another form of sanction. Nor would it say whether any had escaped sanction altogether. Its statement added: “The university has established a new provost commission, which has a broad remit to recommend and implement new approaches, initiatives, programmes and policies which will ensure we work continually towards an open, diverse and safe university community for all our students, staff and visitors, under the banner of “We are all Exeter”. It will seek to eradicate racism and all forms of harassment and discrimination from our campuses.” When news of the incident first broke, the university said the police had been informed. Devon and Cornwall police said at the time that officers were aware of the allegations and were liaising with the university. The force was unable to say on Tuesday evening what action, if any, it had taken since."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/12/abu-bakr-al-rabeeah-syrian-teen-refugee-book","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-12T08:00:25Z","webTitle":"The Syrian boy who wrote his life story – with the help of his Canadian teacher","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/abu-bakr-al-rabeeah-syrian-teen-refugee-book","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/12/abu-bakr-al-rabeeah-syrian-teen-refugee-book","fields":{"headline":"The Syrian boy who wrote his life story – with the help of his Canadian teacher","bodyText":"When Abu Bakr al-Rabeeah and his family arrived from Syria to the Canadian city of Edmonton, his to-do list was dauntingly long: English lessons, learning how to cope with the long, bitterly cold winters and how to best get around his strange new home. But the teenager had a secret dream, which he confided to a teacher. One day he would tell his story, challenging those who saw his family only as refugees, defined by the war they had survived. Eight months later, he became a published author. His book, Homes: A Refugee Story, is set to be officially released on Saturday 12 May by a Calgary book publisher, after being self-published last year. “It’s unbelievable, to be honest,” says Abu Bakr, 17. “I can’t believe it.” The book captures his experience of growing up in the Middle East. He was nine when his family moved from Iraq to Syria to escape escalating tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims. A year later civil war broke out in Syria, punctuating memories of being surrounded by family and playing video games with the horror of car bombings, attacks on schools and late-night explosions. “I really want people to know about what’s happening back home,” says Abu Bakr. “Not just about the war, we also had some good times with family and friends. Even in the hard times we had some good memories.” He wrote the book with Winnie Yeung, the schoolteacher with whom he first shared his dream. Initially they planned a short presentation for his peers. “I could tell he was feeling quite alienated,” says Yeung. “He was saying that his fellow classmates really had no idea where Syria is, or what’s going on in the Middle East. They were asking him: ‘Do you have chairs in classrooms there?’” With permission from his parents, the pair got to work. Using the few English words he knew at the time, he began sharing all he could remember of his childhood. Yeung soon realised that their project was bigger than a class presentation. “I wanted to write it out as a story, so that I could put it in his hands and say: ‘This is your life, you can move on from this,’” she says. “This is part of a really important past and you should be proud for living this life and living it so well.” During lunch hours and after lessons, Yeung would frantically scribble notes as Abu Bakr recounted his childhood. Struggling to navigate the language barrier between them, they got creative. “There was a lot of charades and pantomiming,” says Yeung. “I got a lot of things wrong, we misunderstood each other quite a bit. It took so long to get the stories right.” Google Translate became their go-to app. They looked up events on YouTube and news websites, transporting Abu Bakr back to the streets of Homs through Google Earth’s street view. The two spent hours browsing through mobile phone photos, selfies and online images, trying to identify key details. “Especially with the weaponry, Abu Bakr didn’t know the English words, or even the Arabic,” she says. “So we would look at a bunch of different images online and then he would go: ‘This one.’ And I would learn what it’s called.” Yeung, who learned “the most basic” Arabic, also spent hours interviewing his family in order to contextualise his experience. Born and raised in Edmonton, the project became a crash course for her in conflict. “I barely even watch war movies,” she said. “Part of my late-night internet research would be: OK, how do soldiers carry the AK-47? What are the parts of that weapon? I found myself reading army field manuals.” At times the stories pouring out of Abu Bakr, a young man with an easy smile and warm laugh, left her in shock. The horrors of war were woven into the fabric of his childhood memories: flying homemade kites amid the rubble of destroyed buildings, playing with bullet casings he found on the street. “It was so matter of fact for him, so normal.” His story, she realised, was not just one of living through a war, but also of the deep bonds that sustained his family through their turbulent journey. For Abu Bakr, the book became an anchor as he worked to find his place in his new home, helping him improve his English and meet residents from across the city. He hopes the book will help keep attention on the crisis unfolding in the Middle East, offering a glimpse into the personal experience of one refugee at a time when the number of people fleeing war and persecution around the globe has reached record highs. “I really hope people will read my story and enjoy it,” he said. “And I hope they will get the main idea of it – how hard it is leaving home and how hard it is to live in a civil war.” This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Despite being levied only on the largest 4% of estates, and raising just 77p of every £100 of taxation, it is widely regarded by the public as unfair. Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation and the report’s author, said: “Inheritances are already worth over £100bn a year, and their doubling over the next 20 years means they are going to play an even larger role in shaping British society. “But the current system of inheritance tax is not fit to deal with this societal shift. It currently manages the uniquely bad twin feat of being both wildly unpopular and raising very little revenue.” Instead, Resolution proposes a “lifetime receipts tax”, that could allow beneficiaries to inherit a lump sum before they paid any tax on it – and potentially raise extra revenue for the Treasury. Its analysis suggests by setting such a lifetime limit at £125,000, and then levying inheritance tax at a lower rate of 20% up to £500,000 and 30% after that, the government could still raise an extra £5bn by 2020-21. Taxing individual recipients of bequests rather than the estate as a whole, could also give parents an incentive to spread their largesse more widely. The thinktank warns that inheritance tax is too easy to avoid, in part because of reliefs, including those for capital held in agricultural land and shares on the hi-tech AIM market. These exemptions, which cost the Treasury £1bn a year, were intended to protect farmers from having to break up their estates and encourage entrepreneurial investment. But Resolution claims they are widely abused as a way of avoiding inheritance tax. Wealth taxes have risen up the political agenda, with the government facing mounting pressure to find ways of increasing spending on public services including the NHS. But the Conservatives’ ill-fated proposals for funding social care in last year’s general election manifesto underlined the political risks involved. Labour has said it will examine the case for a land value tax, charged each year at a small percentage of a property’s price – but the Conservatives have attacked the idea as a “garden tax”. The Treasury-backed Office of Tax Simplification is currently seeking the views of the public on how best to reform the inheritance tax system. Next week Resolution will publish the final report of its Intergenerational Commission, a two-year project whose contributors include TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady, and CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn. It has previously found that millennials, classed as those born between 1981 and 2000, are half as likely to own a home at age 30 as baby boomers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/may/01/how-labour-and-tory-duo-teamed-up-to-win-tax-haven-u-turn-margaret-hodge-andrew-mitchell","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T17:59:34Z","webTitle":"How Labour and Tory duo teamed up to win tax haven U-turn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/01/how-labour-and-tory-duo-teamed-up-to-win-tax-haven-u-turn-margaret-hodge-andrew-mitchell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/01/how-labour-and-tory-duo-teamed-up-to-win-tax-haven-u-turn-margaret-hodge-andrew-mitchell","fields":{"headline":"How Labour and Tory duo teamed up to win tax haven U-turn","bodyText":"Margaret Hodge and Andrew Mitchell were quick to recognise they could succeed in forcing the government to act on financial secrecy in the overseas territories if they joined forces. The veteran backbenchers have known each other since the 1980s and their more recent political interests overlap. Mitchell is a former international development secretary and the Conservative MP has frequently worked on cross-party lines after quitting the cabinet in 2012, advocating with the late Jo Cox humanitarian intervention in Syria. Hodge’s interest in financial transparency stems from her five-year chairmanship of the watchdog public accounts committee in the first part of the decade. A hung parliament makes defeating the government easier, but it was not certain. Hodge and Mitchell worked together in persuading backbenchers from both sides to support their cause, arguing that forcing the overseas territories into public disclosure was both ethical and effective, before signing up the frontbenches of Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems. Signing up Tories was particularly important but not difficult, partly because a pragmatic Hodge was careful to emphasise that this was a policy proposed by David Cameron in 2013 before it was allowed to wither away under Theresa May. As the MP for Barking reminded the Commons: “‘If we want to break the business model of stealing money and hiding it places it can’t be seen, transparency is the answer.’ Those are not my words, those are the words of a former prime minister, David Cameron in 2015.” Mitchell, a former chief whip, dealt with some parliamentary tactics. He refused to allow newly elected Tories to support the amendment publicly, because they could be vulnerable to reprisals or persuasion from the party whips, but the party’s ranks include a growing number of former ministers considered immune. Ken Clarke, Nicky Morgan, Anna Soubry and Grant Shapps appeared on the supporters list last week and rebel numbers were immediately sufficient to make it clear to No 10 that a defeat on the issue was a realistic prospect. As Mitchell put it during the Commons debate: “This is evidence that, in a hung parliament, power passes from the cabinet room to the floor of the House of Commons.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/01/rod-rosenstein-trump-russia-event-washington","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T22:43:35Z","webTitle":"Rod Rosenstein defiant against critics: 'The justice department will not be extorted'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/01/rod-rosenstein-trump-russia-event-washington","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/01/rod-rosenstein-trump-russia-event-washington","fields":{"headline":"Rod Rosenstein defiant against critics: 'The justice department will not be extorted'","bodyText":"A “survivor” is how the former FBI director James Comey described his justice department superior Rod Rosenstein. The political survival skills of the deputy attorney general were on full display Tuesday as he praised Donald Trump’s hiring decisions, denied that the rule of law was under threat and sniped at his antagonists in Congress. “There have been people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time, and I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,” Rosenstein said in an event at the Newseum in Washington DC to mark Law Day, an annual US holiday to recognize the importance of law in society. For months Rosenstein, who oversees Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, has been the target of political attacks from Trump allies in Congress. In February, the House intelligence committee chairman, Devin Nunes, released a memo meant to discredit him. On Monday, it emerged that House conservatives had drafted articles of impeachment against him. Earlier this month, Trump himself slammed Rosenstein on Twitter as “conflicted”. But if the idea is to find a pretext to fire him, Rosenstein did not make himself an easy target in remarks on Tuesday. The former US attorney for the district of Maryland used the rare public appearance to emphasize that he spent most of his career outside Washington, approvingly quoted the conservative icon Antonin Scalia and generally paraded his right-of-center credentials. He also assured anyone concerned about the erosion of the rule of law under Trump that there is nothing to see here. “I don’t think there’s any threat to the rule of law today,” Rosenstein said in response to a question. Pressed on whether there were continuing conflicts between the rule of law and the president, Rosenstein insisted: “There are no such conflicts ... The way this administration operates is not necessarily the way you see caricatured in the media.” Last Thursday, Trump, who has frequently criticized various justice department decisions and figures on Twitter, called into the morning TV program Fox &amp; Friends and said he might get “involved” at the justice department, whose leadership he appoints and whose priorities he defines. “I’ve taken this position that I will not be involved with the justice department,” Trump said. “I’m very disappointed in my justice department. I may change my mind at some point because what’s going on is a disgrace; it’s an absolute disgrace.” But Rosenstein would admit no criticism of the president on the point. “He has appointed a leadership team for the Department of Justice that respects the rule of law,” Rosenstein said of Trump. Rosenstein deflected a pointed question about whether a sitting president may be indicted, giving a noncommittal answer that nevertheless might be well received in the White House. “I’m not going to answer this in the context of any current matters so you shouldn’t draw any inference from it,” Rosenstein said. “But the Department of Justice has in the past, when the issue arose, has opined that a sitting president cannot be indicted. There’s been a lot of speculation in the media about it, and I’m not gonna – when the issue arose, somebody in the department reached a legal conclusion and that’s what it is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/01/francesco-totti-fans-roma-liverpool-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T20:03:05Z","webTitle":"Roma’s Francesco Totti urges calm: ‘We want to dress Rome in its best suit’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/01/francesco-totti-fans-roma-liverpool-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/01/francesco-totti-fans-roma-liverpool-violence","fields":{"headline":"Roma’s Francesco Totti urges calm: ‘We want to dress Rome in its best suit’","bodyText":"Francesco Totti, the revered former captain and symbol of Roma, warned fans to behave and urged calm before Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final with Liverpool, as the city braced itself for possible outbreaks of violence. From a ban on alcohol around Stadio Olimpico that took effect on Tuesday night to plans to open the stadium early on Wednesday for Liverpool fans, Roman officials have sought to put measures in place to prevent the kind of violence that erupted in Liverpool last week for the first leg of the semi-final. Sean Cox, a Liverpool fan from Ireland, remains in critical condition with serious head injuries after allegedly being attacked last Tuesday night by two Italians outside Anfield. The attack put the spotlight on Roma’s violent ultras, who were seen attacking Liverpool fans while wearing balaclavas and face scarves, swinging ropes and bats as they sang songs insulting their opponents. The ultra fans have been called “fucking idiots and assholes” by James Pallotta, the Roma president, but the violence last week has highlighted the militant fans are not just troublemakers. They pose a serious risk. About 5,000 British fans were expected to arrive in the Eternal City from Tuesday, and Italian police have been holding meetings with Uefa, their British counterparts, and officials from both teams to discuss security measures. While most Liverpool fans will be arriving at Rome’s Fiumicino and Ciampino airports, authorities across Italy have been told to be on alert for possible skirmishes with fans coming in from other surrounding airports. Liverpool fans have been instructed to meet at Piazza delle Canestre on Wednesday, inside the Villa Borghese park, from where they will be bussed to the stadium. Liverpool fans who are travelling on their own have been urged to use the stadium’s Ponte Milvio entrance, while Roma fans will be ushered into the stadium’s southern entrance. Uefa’s Kenny Scott, the director of safety, has urged authorities to ensure that British fans are not left too long in either the stadium or the Piazza delle Canestre meeting point, according to Corriere dello Sport. Liverpool fans will also be urged to confine their tourism to two spots in the city where there will be a heightened police presence: Campo di Fiori, and Largo Corrado Ricci, near the Roman forum. About 2,000 police officers will be on patrol in connection with the match. The Italian authorities have also been warned about 30-40 “risky” Liverpool fans who were considered to pose a security threat but had not been barred from attending the match, according to La Repubblica. Totti, who retired last year, said in a statement to fans on Monday all eyes were now on Rome. “The world looks at us and we want to dress Rome with its best suit: we are its ambassadors, we have a great responsibility, inside and outside the Olimpico Stadium,” he said. The question now is whether Totti will influence the Roman ultras. Pallotta, an American, called last weekend for Italians to come together to denounce extreme fans that have damaged the reputations of all major Italian teams. “It’s not just an issue for Rome. It’s an issue for Italy and it’s an issue for the authorities and it’s an issue for all of us to band together and to finally wake up so that we don’t have a reputation - that’s not deserved around the rest of the world - that our fans are not good fans,” he said. There has been one incident of deadly football-related violence in Rome in the last few years. In 2014, a Napoli fan was shot dead during a clash with a Roma fans before the Italian Cup final. Ciro Esposito, 29, was killed before the match at Stadio Olimpico. Police said the shooting occurred after the Roma fan insulted the Napoli fans. When they responded to the jeers, he shot them, killing Esposito. The Rome police chief, Giampietro Lionetti, said this week: “There is a lot of history between the two sets of fans and it will be our job to keep them all safe.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/03/thursdays-best-tv-syria-the-worlds-war-britains-best-home-cook-true-horror","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-03T05:00:34Z","webTitle":"Thursday’s best TV: Syria: The World’s War; Britain’s Best Home Cook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/03/thursdays-best-tv-syria-the-worlds-war-britains-best-home-cook-true-horror","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/03/thursdays-best-tv-syria-the-worlds-war-britains-best-home-cook-true-horror","fields":{"headline":"Thursday’s best TV: Syria: The World’s War; Britain’s Best Home Cook","bodyText":"Syria: The World’s War 9pm, BBC Two In March 2011, Syrian security forces opened fire on a demonstration in Daraa.

Are they collapsing as investors prepare for keener price competition? Are executives also trembling in fear of their bonuses as Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe vows to unleash 10% price cuts? Hardly. While Sainsbury’s market value has improved by 16% since Monday morning, investors in Tesco and Morrisons have not recoiled in horror. Share prices in both firms have barely budged. Let’s hope the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is watching. Its job is to protect the interest of consumers and, to judge by the stock market’s reaction, it’s hard to spot any clear gain for shoppers via this proposed £15bn mega-merger. Almost nobody in the City is talking about supermarkets having to compete harder for custom, thereby putting their profit margins under renewed pressure. In Coupe’s view, the reward for consumers will be 10% lower prices of “many of the products customers buy most regularly”, but since he hasn’t bothered to state what these products are, or even be precise about how many are on the list, his promise is too vague to be trusted. He has confidently predicted the annual boost to profits for shareholders will be £500m but has offered no equivalent round-number saving for shoppers. Bruno Monteyne from Bernstein, viewing affairs through the lens of a stock analyst, calls it “a great deal, at a great time, at a great price”. It probably is – for Sainsbury’s. But shoppers and the CMA should note two of his observations. First, Asda-owner Walmart, which will end up with a 42% stake in Sainsbury’s, is “not in the UK to invest material amounts of capital” and is instead in the game of “harvesting cash”. Second, the merger partners have signalled they want to be “rational”, which means the deal “is not a new phase in a price war cycle”. Sainsbury’s has been convinced by its lawyers that the CMA will approve the deal with few restrictions because the boffins, on the evidence of recent Tesco/Booker and Ladbrokes/Coral rulings, take a broader view of what counts as a competitor these days and will be impressed that Aldi and Lidl exist. That analysis may prove correct, but the CMA, if it’s doing its job properly, should look beyond standard spreadsheets detailing local catchment areas. This merger would radically alter the structure of a supermarket industry where competition is demonstrably working well. Two companies would have a combined share of about 60%, a concentration that is surely only tolerable if there are easy-to-identify and permanent benefits for the customers. On evidence seen so far, shareholders have reasons to cheer but shoppers don’t. Barclays stuck in the tunnel Edward Bramson, the activist investor on Barclays’ tail, didn’t copy the climate change protesters by storming the stage at Barclays’ annual meeting. As far as we know, he didn’t even attend. Had he done so, he could have made a reasonable request to John McFarlane: please find a new cliche. At his first annual meeting as chair, in April 2016, McFarlane declared there was “light at the end of the tunnel”. In May last year, there was an upgrade: “Despite a few remaining dark patches, the light at the end of the tunnel gets brighter with each step”. On Wednesday, McFarlane removed the reference to dark spots and said the light is still improving. Up to a point, this talk of Barclays moving into a “new phase” is legitimate. Chief executive Jes Staley – when he isn’t being criticised by the Financial Conduct Authority for failing to exercise due skill, care and diligence in the whistleblower episode – has stuck to the intended script. Barclays Africa was sold, a reasonable deal was done with the US Department of Justice on mortgage-backed securities and it is more possible to believe (but by no means guaranteed) that the investment bank isn’t a money-pit. Yet the self-congratuatory tone from the boardroom jars. Shouldn’t Barclays have exited the tunnel by now? Remember McFarlane’s earlier ambition in July 2015, as told to top managers: the aim was to double the bank’s share price in three years. With two months left on the clock, it’s not happening. The shares were 260p at the time; now they’re 206p. Bramson’s improvement plan for Barclays, whatever it is, may be wrong-headed and risk a return to a murkier part of the tunnel. But, if one complaint is that McFarlane promised faster returns for shareholders than Barclays has delivered, his point would be fair. One assumes the chair knows as much, which would explain why he plans to stay for another year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/01/immigration-minister-apologises-to-windrush-victims-in-meeting","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T19:53:43Z","webTitle":"Immigration minister apologises to Windrush victims at meeting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/01/immigration-minister-apologises-to-windrush-victims-in-meeting","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/01/immigration-minister-apologises-to-windrush-victims-in-meeting","fields":{"headline":"Immigration minister apologises to Windrush victims at meeting","bodyText":"The immigration minister Caroline Nokes has apologised in person to a series of people affected by the Windrush crisis, telling a meeting in parliament devoted to the issue that she would sort people’s plight as rapidly as possible. Underlining the government’s eagerness to get a grip on a situation that has already seen Amber Rudd resign as home secretary, Nokes offered no new policies but said she would pledge to put right what had happened. The packed meeting at parliament also heard from around half a dozen Windrush citizens wrongly targeted for immigration enforcement, who described how shocked and desperate they had become at the treatment they received. Sarah O’Connor, one of many such cases highlighted by the Guardian, who was refused benefits despite having lived in the UK since she was six, told the assembled MPs and supporters that her plight had left her close to suicide. “I’ve lived 51 years over here, I’ve worked 30-odd years, and got told I’m an immigrant, I’m not entitled to anything,” she said. “When all this happened to me and I was told I was an immigrant, I wouldn’t cry in front of the job centre. I’d go home and I break down.” The event, officially a gathering of the parliamentary all-party group on race and community, was organised by David Lammy, the Labour MP who chairs the group and has been a prominent voice on the Windrush issue. Nokes was among the first speakers, saying she did not expect the audience “to make me welcome this afternoon”. She gave a personal apology to Paulette Wilson, a former cook in the House of Commons who was almost deported despite living in the UK for half a century, and was also at the meeting. “Particularly Mrs Wilson, I wanted to say that I was personally sorry to you, and I mean that most sincerely,” Nokes said. “I recognise that we as a government have a huge job to do to regain trust. I do not underestimate that by one tiny jot.” Nokes added: “I just wish to put, absolutely, formally on record, how sorry I am that this has happened on my watch, and how determined I am on my watch to get it right.” Wilson was invited to speak later by Lammy, and spoke only to express her gratitude to those who assisted her. “Thanks to everyone for being human, and not racist,” she said, prompting loud applause. Another person who spoke was Sylvester Marshall, who was wrongly refused NHS treatment for cancer, a case highlighted repeatedly in the Guardian. Marshall – referred to in stories as Albert Thompson before his status was settled – said he had that same day finally received his first dose of the radiotherapy treatment he had been seeking. “I’ve been trying a long time to table paperwork, and each time I’ve tried they tell me I’m illegal,” he said. “I keep telling them that I’m not, I’m British, and they didn’t believe me.” Elwaldo Romeo, who moved from Antigua to the UK when he was four, 59 years ago, and has lived and worked here continuously ever since, recounted the shock of being told he was not allowed to remain in the UK. “Not a lot of people know this but my youngest brother has an OBE,” he said. “But what can I say? We, as black people, had that life, and we always had that life, and for that to be taken away by anybody is outrageous.” The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, told the event that the settling of many such cases was “a victory for decency around the country”, but warned that it was the “wholly avoidable” consequence of the government’s “hostile environment” immigration policy. The treatment of the Windrush generation showed “a corrosion on our lives and a corrosion on our society”, he said. Corbyn added: “If one thing has come out of this Windrush scandal, it’s been that a lot of people have woken up and begun to understand what kind of country we live in and what kind of country we want to live in.” Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the scandal had been “a moment of truth” for the Windrish generation, who she called “one of the most patriotic groups of British citizen you could find”. Abbott said: “To be so loyal to this country, to be so patriotic, and to have such a work ethic, and be treated in the way they’ve been treated in recent years is a shame and a disgrace. It felt to a lot of them like the loyalty they had given this country was not being reciprocated.” She added: “Let me say to you: our commitment is to hold the government to its word. This is not just a story for a week or two weeks.” Abbott said similar cases were still taking place, as she saw from visiting the Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre. “I have been to Yarl’s Wood, I have met women from that generation who are there, who have British children, who have lived in this country 30 odd years, and they are interned in Yarl’s Wood as if they were criminals,” she said. The meeting also heard from Amelia Gentleman, the Guardian journalist who first reported on many of the cases. Lammy thanked her, saying to loud applause that “she has a place in all our hearts”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/01/the-guardian-view-on-uk-tax-havens-mps-are-right-to-get-tough","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T17:32:42Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on UK tax havens: MPs are right to get tough | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/01/the-guardian-view-on-uk-tax-havens-mps-are-right-to-get-tough","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/01/the-guardian-view-on-uk-tax-havens-mps-are-right-to-get-tough","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on UK tax havens: MPs are right to get tough","bodyText":"It is fully five years since David Cameron put the crackdown on tax avoidance at the top of his agenda for the 2013 G8 summit. That same year, he and George Osborne promised a register of beneficial ownership of UK-registered companies. That register came into force in 2016. But it did not apply to Britain’s archipelago of colonial and other possessions which have become rich and disruptive through their tax-haven status. Pressure therefore mounted for them to open up too; there was talk of a blacklist of the uncooperative. Revelations from the Panama and Paradise papers drew attention to the scale of the untaxed money involved. Mr Cameron promised to pull away the “shroud of secrecy”. At the same time, the European Union has produced even tougher anti-money-laundering directives, the latest of which will come into force next year. During these five years, many of the tax havens have dug in against change. British ministers have gone along with their objections and delays – proposing voluntary systems and limiting access to the data. This week, however, parliament finally pushed back. The sanctions and anti-money-laundering bill has been steadily working its way through the Commons since February. On Tuesday it reached a crunch, when the government was forced to back down and accept backbench amendments that turn the screw more tightly on the UK’s overseas tax havens. An all-party effort, led by the Conservative Andrew Mitchell and Labour’s Margaret Hodge, demanded that there must be transparent beneficial ownership registers in British overseas territories such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. On Tuesday, the government caved in. This is a welcome outcome. It is a tribute to the effectiveness of targeted backbench alliances in a hung parliament. It ought to encourage similar Commons alliances when the EU withdrawal bill returns to MPs after its current mauling in the Lords. It is also more proof of the effectiveness of high-quality investigative journalism, which provided so much of the information around which the backbenchers were able to unite and to which, in the end, the Foreign Office minister in charge of the bill, Alan Duncan, was forced to concede so gracefully. The bill is now much improved. In addition to the concession on registers, it has been strengthened in two other ways. The first, confirmed this week, is a UK “Magnitsky clause”, giving powers to freeze the assets of corruption suspects and human rights abusers. The second tightens the rules on hundreds of shady Scottish limited partnerships, which have been exploited for money laundering by Russian oligarchs. But the bill is still far from perfect. It does not cover Britain’s crown dependencies, such as the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which are major tax havens over which Britain has less legal authority. It has also given the British overseas territories another 30 months to comply with a register that was first proposed five years ago. Nevertheless, and not before time, this bill brings Britain and its network of overseas enclaves closer to the heart of a global effort – in which the European Union is already a pace-setter – to bring large global companies, stolen money and money laundering into the grip, still too weak, of international regulation and sanctions. It has been a long time coming, and it will need strengthening. But Britain, with its offshore havens, has a special responsibility to the rest of the world to be on the side of the law-keepers not the law-breakers. This bill is a move in the right direction and a tribute to the MPs of all parties who did so much to strengthen it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/05/can-i-cook-like-casanova","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T07:00:45Z","webTitle":"Can I cook like ...

Casanova?","bodyText":"Giacomo Casanova’s favourite food was macaroni cheese. This came as something of a relief to me, because I’ve been on something of a losing streak in the kitchen recently and, no matter what, I know I can cook macaroni cheese. The anglicised version involves brief grilling, but in honour of Casanova I forego the grilling and allow the cheese to melt in the pasta. I use Grana Padano because, like Casanova, it hails from Venice. It is also on offer at my local supermarket. But although macaroni cheese was Casanova’s favourite meal, and he loved food – by my count, mealtimes feature more frequently than women in his memoirs – it didn’t feature in his favourite mealtime: breakfast. I suppose this is par for the course: breakfast is the most important meal of the day, even more so when you are shagging your way through 18th-century Europe. He generally started the day with freshly baked bread. This is a hell of a lot is easier if you have domestic servants, but I settle for baking mine the night before. Less easy are his preferred accompaniment: oysters. Casanova ate oysters like they were going out of fashion, slurping them down with every single meal. He is essentially responsible for the urban myth that they are an aphrodisiac. I know very little about oysters, but I do know two things: that you aren’t supposed to eat them some of the time, and that this relates to whether or not there is an “r” in the month. What I cannot remember is whether to eat them when there is an “r” in the month, or when there isn’t. Readers with working calendars and modern dictionaries will know there is no “r” in May, and I reason that, as I have to eat the damned things anyway, I shouldn’t worry too much about whether this is a good or a bad thing. I have never eaten oysters before – somehow, whenever they have appeared on a menu, it has always been alongside other things I would rather eat – and once I put aside my anxiety about whether or not this is a safe month to eat them, I find them slimy, salty, but curiously moreish. I can’t say they offset the macaroni cheese particularly well, though."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"society/2018/may/01/belfast-hospital-trust-recalls-2500-patients-over-treatment-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T16:59:52Z","webTitle":"Belfast hospital trust recalls 2,500 patients over treatment fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/01/belfast-hospital-trust-recalls-2500-patients-over-treatment-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/01/belfast-hospital-trust-recalls-2500-patients-over-treatment-fears","fields":{"headline":"Belfast hospital trust recalls 2,500 patients over treatment fears","bodyText":"A major NHS hospital trust has recalled more than 2,500 patients with brain disorders amid fears they have been misdiagnosed by a doctor who is no longer on frontline duties. The Belfast health and social care trust has set up special clinics so that the patients concerned – some as young as 14 – can have their condition assessed as soon as possible. It has apologised for the “significant anxiety” the affected patients will feel at being recalled but said the move was necessary to ascertain if they were receiving the right treatment. The patients were being treated for conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease by consultant neurologist Dr Michael Watt. But a GP and fellow doctors at the trust raised concerns about the accuracy of the diagnoses some of his patients received. The trust’s decision to recall all of Watt’s patients follows separate reviews into the notes detailing the care he provided to some people, which were undertaken by the trust and the Royal College of Physicians. Explaining the request to patients to come to have their health assessed, Dr Mark Michelson, the trust’s lead doctor for neurology, said: “I fully understand this will cause significant anxiety to many patients and their families and for that we are truly sorry. “Other doctors raised concerns with the trust regarding the care and treatment provided by Dr Michael Watt to a small number of patients.” Michelson did not reveal what the two reviews had found. However, patients are being invited to come to clinics starting this Saturday, 5 May, where nine neurology consultants will assess their condition and treatment. In all there will be 200 additional clinics so that all of the 2,500 patients can be seen within 12 weeks. The review appointments are “to assure them, their families and ourselves that they are receiving the best treatment. The recall of such a large number of patients is so that we can be confident and thorough in ensuring that patients are having the best possible care,” Michelson added. The father of of a woman whom Watt was treating for brain stem epilepsy told the BBC Radio Ulster Talkback programme: “She hasn’t had an appointment with neurology for at least five years and now this has come like a bombshell – it’s frightening. We feel we are left in limbo.” Watt has not seen any patient either through the trust or privately since June 2017, six months after concerns were first raised in december 2016. He is still an employee of the trust, which runs Belfast’s four main hospitals. Some of the care Watt provided was sub-standard, Michelson admitted. “These are patients with a wide range of neurologial conditions, some of which are debilitating, complex and significantly serious. But standards did dip around one consultant and patient safety should always be paramount – hence the recall,” he told the BBC."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/02/labour-clarify-position-brexit-vote-share-leave-remain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Why would Labour clarify its stance on Brexit?

Ambiguity is working","bodyText":"Pressure is building on Labour to shift its Brexit stance. Owen Smith’s demand that the party should back a second referendum led to him losing his job. But there are growing calls for the party to adopt a less ambivalent position, either in favour of single market membership or of a second referendum. These arguments are framed as a statement both of principle and electoral common sense – the influential mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, has argued that insisting on a further Brexit vote would place Labour “on the right side of public opinion”. And there is apparently some polling evidence to back this up. A December 2017 survey for YouGov, commissioned by Best for Britain, found that 24% of voters currently planning to support Labour might change their minds before the next election. A few months later, another such survey suggested the Liberal Democrats would surge (in relative terms) to 18% if Labour and the Conservatives remain committed to leaving the EU. Clearly such figures should be treated with some caution. It is quite hard to foresee an election between now and 29 March 2019, when the UK is due to leave the EU. Not least, the mechanics of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act make it a difficult outcome to engineer. Moreover, there is clearly a question as to whether the Labour leadership actually believes in the value of questioning Brexit. Yet let’s leave aside whether a party recently characterised as made up of “remainers outside of Westminster led by Brexiteers within it” would favour a policy shift away from leaving the single market, or even the EU itself. Does Labour have anything to gain electorally by shifting in this direction? Labour policy on Brexit has been driven as much – indeed more – by short-term politics as by concerns about the nature or depth of the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU. Consequently, the positions the party has adopted have generally consisted of soundbites designed to give the impression of distance from the government’s stance. Jeremy Corbyn’s oft-repeated line that Labour wants “tariff-free access to the single market” sounds good to many of those with better things to do than study single markets, while being utterly devoid of meaning. Labour’s “six tests for Brexit” set out by Keir Starmer, not least his call for the maintenance of the “exact same benefits” of the single market, is as politically savvy as it is divorced from reality. Nowhere is it specified how Labour would pull off this trick. Recent policy shifts over potential membership of a customs union should be interpreted in the same political light. The Labour leadership saw the prospect of inflicting a humiliating defeat on the government. And this defeat on a customs union is now likely, sooner or later, on an amendment to the trade bill after the local elections. Yet it is interesting to note the trouble Corbyn went to to triangulate his position. He refrained from committing entirely to “a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union”. Rather he insisted that, in order to accept such a deal, the UK would need to have a say over future trade deals, something on which the EU has blown hot and cold in the last few days. Moreover, he emphasised that Britain would no longer accept freedom of movement, and hence would be leaving the single market. So ambiguity has been the chosen approach for Labour. And it has worked. What colleagues have labelled Brexit Blairism has proved electorally highly effective. As this table shows, Labour picked up vote share across the board in both leave and remain constituencies. Now, however, as the moment of Brexit truth approaches, many are claiming that Labour must make a clearer choice and come out more unequivocally for a far softer Brexit than the government seems to want. Implicit here is the assumption not only that this would be the “right” thing to do, but that it would be electorally advantageous. This, however, is far from self-evident. Consider the figure below. It maps every constituency in England and Wales. To the left are those seats that swung disproportionately towards the Tories in 2017 and to the right are their Labour equivalents. In the top half are seats that went majority remain, while under the line are majority leave seats. Highlighted – in red and blue respectively – are seats where Labour or the Tories have a majority of less than 5% to overturn. These are, in other words, the target seats that really matter to party strategists. What is apparent is the relative lack of Kensingtons or Canterburys waiting to fall to a Labour party expressing clearer opposition to Brexit. Justine Greening’s seat of Putney – which voted 72% remain and swung 10.23% to Labour last time – is one of the few red dots in the upper righthand quadrant. Of the 15 seats where Labour has the smallest margin to close, only two – Pudsey and Chipping Barnet – voted remain. In total, there are just 12 constituencies that voted remain where Labour require less than a 5% swing to win next time. Moreover, it is in the bottom right quadrant – places where Labour gained more than average on the Conservatives last time, and that voted leave in the referendum – where the highest number of potential Labour gains are clustered. These are places, in effect, where their Brexit strategy in 2017 hit the electoral sweet spot. Labour needs to gain 34 seats for a majority of one at the next election. Of the 34 seats in England and Wales where they are running closest behind the Conservatives, there are more seats that are estimated to have voted over 60% to leave than to have voted remain. Equally, there are places – principally in the bottom left of the graph – where Labour are vulnerable if the relatively small, but crucial, number of ex-Ukip supporters break off from their electoral coalition. The 10 Labour seats where the Tories have to do least to win next time round voted, on average, 63% leave. These are places where we might expect the Tories to pour a lot of resources, places such as Bolsover and Wakefield. Brexit created a shift in our electoral geography. Most voters didn’t shift their allegiances due to Brexit. But enough, in some key places, did. Labour capitalised on this in 2017 via a position of strategic ambiguity. Whether this success was the result of deliberate policy or of blind luck is something for future historians to argue about. What matters here is the future. And here the choice is relatively stark. Labour can either continue as it has to date, with continued incremental policy shifts keeping its position slightly softer than that of the government while still “respecting the referendum outcome”. Flexible ambiguity, in other words. Or, the party can break with its ambivalence and support either a Norway-type deal or – more ambitiously – a second referendum. For all the obvious hope out there that the party will choose the latter, the electoral maths seems to militate in favour of the former. • Anand Menon is director of the UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/05/tv-chef-lorraine-pascale-how-i-eat","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T11:00:50Z","webTitle":"TV chef Lorraine Pascale: how I eat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/05/tv-chef-lorraine-pascale-how-i-eat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/05/tv-chef-lorraine-pascale-how-i-eat","fields":{"headline":"TV chef Lorraine Pascale: how I eat","bodyText":"Breakfast I make a protein shake and drink half when I get up at 5.30am and the rest of it after the gym at 8.30am.

A licensing panel announced on Monday that Uber was not a fit and proper company to continue operating in Brighton. Uber will appeal against the ruling. The panel cited concerns over a data breach in which Uber customers’ personal details were leaked, and the number of Uber drivers who were not licensed in Brighton but were operating in the city. The decision, made unanimously at a hearing on 23 April, echoes that of Transport for London, which turned down Uber’s application to renew its licence in the capital last September. York also rejected Uber’s licence application last December. The chair of the licensing panel, Jackie O’Quinn, said: “Our priority is the safety of residents and visitors and, due to the data breach and the lack of commitment to using drivers licensed here, we were not satisfied that Uber Britannia Ltd are a fit and proper person to hold an operator’s licence in the city.” An Uber spokesperson said: “This is a disappointing decision for the thousands of passengers and drivers who rely on our app in Brighton and Hove. We intend to appeal so we can continue serving the city.” As in London, Uber will be able to continue to operate in Brighton until the outcome of its appeal. The firm says it complies with all national private hire legislation, which allows drivers to work across England and Wales if they, their vehicle and operator are all licensed by the same authority. However, such “cross-border” working has become a growing issue with ride-hailing services such as Uber. Brighton said out-of-town drivers posed a risk to public safety, with regulations elsewhere failing to meet its own standards, including safety aspects such as CCTV in cabs. The council also pointed to a rush of licence applications in nearby Lewes, after a comparison page was publicised on Uber’s website. It said it expected that the majority of those applying – 130 in a month – would attempt to work in Brighton, and it accused Uber of “breaching the spirit” of its commitment to use local drivers, as well as misleading the authority. Uber is licensed to operate in 80 areas across the UK, having succeeded with 35 applications in the last year. The firm has complied with various initiatives in London to improve safety, and its appeal is due to be heard in the high court in June. Fresh concerns over Uber have emerged since TfL’s decison, including the disclosure of an attempted cover-up of a data breach in 2016 in which 57 million users’ details were leaked. Uber’s chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has said he “will not make excuses for it [or] erase the past” and would change the way the firm operated, “putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/memo-to-jamie-oliver-british-food-is-all-about-the-price","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T17:22:01Z","webTitle":"Memo to Jamie Oliver: British food is all about the price | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/memo-to-jamie-oliver-british-food-is-all-about-the-price","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/01/memo-to-jamie-oliver-british-food-is-all-about-the-price","fields":{"headline":"Memo to Jamie Oliver: British food is all about the price","bodyText":"Re your interview with Jamie Oliver (G2, 30 April): the UK has decided that the only shop is a supermarket and all purchase decisions are based on price.

Her partner and well-known climber Hayden Kennedy, 27, survived the accident, but couldn’t locate Perkins, whose avalanche transceiver was turned off. He took his own life the following day. Kennedy’s father wrote in a public statement: “Hayden survived the avalanche, but not the unbearable loss of his partner in life.” While avalanches are a well-known hazard among winter mountain recreationalists, they are far more common than most people suspect. Historically there has been little public talk of their psychological impact, despite the fact that those swept up in avalanches, even non-fatal ones, reportedly deal with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a unique loop of shame and guilt. But the tragedy of Kennedy and Perkins laid bare the magnitude of trauma left in an avalanche’s wake, and since then there’s been a kind of awakening among a reeling backcountry winter community. The US is a paradise for backcountry skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling, mostly taking place on tens of millions of wild acres of national and state forests in mountain ranges across the west and pockets in the north-east. A staggering 4.1 million people reported accessing the backcountry in 2016/17, up from 3.2 million only a couple years earlier. For many backcountry enthusiasts, the allure of the backcountry is the promise of deep powder. For others it is the solitude, or fulfilling a deep-rooted need for exploration and adventure that’s increasingly hard to find in an era of Google Maps. A few might not be able to articulate it at all, except to say that spending time in the backcountry makes them feel more alive. “When you’re out there and you’re tickling the dragon, you have an appreciation for the fragility of life,” explains Christian Beckwith, founder of Alpinist magazine. “And you don’t get that without having the dragon wake up sometimes.” Backcountry snowsports require mastery of an enormous amount of information, including knowledge of snow science and how weather and terrain can affect the snow pack, and practitioners should have an eye for weaknesses that can cause slabs of snow to release naturally or as a result of human triggers. Setting off an avalanche might indicate a gap in that knowledge – a mistake of sometimes fatal proportions. An average of 27 people die in US avalanches each winter. “Embarrassment is one of the main reasons people don’t talk about their avalanche accidents,” said professional skier Elyse Saugstad, who was part of the 2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche outside Stevens Pass in central Washington state that received national attention, mostly because it involved a group of more than a dozen highly knowledgable people in the ski and snowboard industry. The avalanche swept up Saugstad, who pulled her airbag, and three other skiers – Jim Jack, Chris Rudolph and John Brenan – who were killed in the slide. “Especially among the pros, you don’t want people thinking you made a mistake, because you’re afraid of the judgment that inevitably comes when you do. But even highly professional people in the industry make mistakes.” To channel her trauma after the accident, Saugstad threw herself into education around avalanche airbags, which were a new device at the time designed to float skiers to the top of moving slide debris. She didn’t want her friends’ deaths to be in vain and hoped people could learn from her nightmarish experience. But she said others didn’t see it that way, and leveled accusations that she was using her accident to promote a product. On top of that, she felt judgment in people sifting through the mistakes the group made that day. “I understood that people would judge what happened, so I did my best to shut out the negative criticisms. I had already lost my friends and that was bad enough. Just as long as I was honest with myself about the mistakes we made and objectively go over what I personally did wrong alongside the group, that was enough.” Along with PTSD, anxiety and depression, shame is a common response among those caught up in avalanches, said Jennifer Feibig, a therapist practicing in Bozeman, Montana, who regularly treats people who have been involved in avalanche accidents. “There’s a culture of analyzing all the data after an accident that takes all the humanity out of the survivors, who are already thinking ‘I killed my friend’ or going through other grief, and then descending into a shame spiral on top of that,” she said. “We need to know what happened, but we also need to make that space for the survivor to feel cared for, to feel validated that they did the best they could do, and recognize the pain that they just went through.” These emotions described by Feibig are familiar to the Helena, Montana-based couple Melissa Hornbein, a lawyer, and Aaron Gams, a nurse. On Memorial Day weekend in 2011, they took a break from busy lives to take advantage of the prime time for steep spring skiing in the mountains. The last thing Hornbein recalls is stopping at a grocery store on the way up Wyoming’s Togwotee Pass. The rest she has had to reconstruct: she and Gams climbed the final pitch of the snowy chute, the skis strapped to their packs swaying with each step kicked into the steep face. There was a split second when the top layer of snow cracked, a sight straight out of every backcountry skier’s worst nightmare. Hornbein was swept over cliffs by the avalanche and woke up in the hospital with a fractured pelvis, fractured skull and a dozen broken teeth. “Were we in an avalanche?” was the first thing she asked. That day haunted them both. The sudden sensation of falling would engulf Hornbein out of nowhere for years after the accident. Even in the safest of skiing conditions, she experienced overwhelming physical responses – heart pounding, sweating, panic – and sometimes called off the mission. “I didn’t know if the fear was completely visceral or if it was rooted in actual danger,” she said. “What that avalanche took away from me was knowing how to trust myself.” In her everyday life, she becomes anxious when she doesn’t have control, which manifested particularly vividly after the birth of her daughter, now aged one and a half. “For the first six months or so, I worried so much about this little baby and having no control over what’s going on with her health and development … I was hypervigilant, worried that if I wasn’t constantly on alert, something would happen to her.” Gams remembers everything of the accident. As the slide came to rest, he realized he was only partially buried and he scanned the debris for Melissa. He spotted her immediately, only partially buried as well – but she was unconscious, with blood trickling from her ear. With all three major ligaments torn in his knee and a separated shoulder, he pulled Melissa out of the debris and wrestled them both through the snow out to the road, where he flagged down a passing car. Despite this heroic effort, he said, “I felt like I had massively screwed up – I was the one who was pushing for going higher. I was so worried I had really messed up Melissa. I was feeling guilty right away”. Saugstad believes that bringing avalanche trauma into the open – and taking judgment out of the equation – starts with professionals telling their own stories publicly. Beckwith, the founder of Alpinist, agrees. His own accident occurred in 2013, when he was skiing Prospectors Mountain in Wyoming’s Grand Teton national park with good friend and fellow Jackson Hole resident Jared Spackman. An avalanche broke above them as they were ascending the Apocalypse Couloir, and the slide carried Spackman 1,000 vertical feet down the narrow chute, claiming his life. Beckwith was unscathed. “The bomb goes off, shattering all equilibrium,” he said, speaking quietly of the aftermath. “Eventually, the ringing in your ears begins to subside, the dust begins to settle. You realize you’re in the bottom of the crater, and you do your best to crawl out of the bomb hole, stagger to your feet and begin walking in the direction you think is right.” Beckwith sees the backcountry winter community itself as uniquely positioned to support its members. “We’ve chosen a lifestyle in which loss is inherent, so a support structure is organically part of the community. It’s a tribe, and its members understand the deal, and one another.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/01/christopher-chandler-founder-of-pro-brexit-thinktank-has-link-with-russian-intelligence-mp-says","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T17:57:19Z","webTitle":"Founder of pro-Brexit think​tank has link with Russian intelligence, says MP","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/01/christopher-chandler-founder-of-pro-brexit-thinktank-has-link-with-russian-intelligence-mp-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/01/christopher-chandler-founder-of-pro-brexit-thinktank-has-link-with-russian-intelligence-mp-says","fields":{"headline":"Founder of pro-Brexit think​tank has link with Russian intelligence, says MP","bodyText":"A Conservative MP has claimed that a billionaire who founded an influential pro-Brexit thinktank has “a link with Russian intelligence”. In a speech made in the Commons under parliamentary privilege, Bob Seely alleged that Christopher Chandler had been an “object of interest” to French intelligence. Chandler, who founded the Legatum thinktank, rejected the claim as “complete nonsense”. Seely said that he and four other MPs had seen documents from Monaco’s security department. These “brief, terse, factual files” related to “national security and money laundering” and included information supplied by the DST intelligence agency, France’s equivalent of MI5. The MP said senior French intelligence sources plus their British and American counterparts had “authenticated” their content. He added: “The documents indicated a link – a noted individual in this country – with Russian intelligence.” The files dated from 2005 and covered a period from the mid-1990s, he said. They concerned “Christopher Chandler and his brother”, the MP said, adding that he was convinced the files were genuine. He told the Commons: “According to the French intelligence services, as recorded by their colleagues in Monaco ... Mr Chandler is described as having been ‘an object of interest’ to the DST since 2002 on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence services.” Monaco intelligence division had marked Chandler’s file with an S, to indicate “counter-espionage”, he added. The Legatum Institute has advocated hard Brexit and has had significant influence on ministerial thinking, especially over trade policy. Chandler and his brother Richard were born in New Zealand and made their fortunes from a series of investments in Russia in the 1990s. Legatum robustly denied the MP’s allegations on Tuesday. In a statement, the institute said that Chandler “has never been associated directly or indirectly with Russian intelligence or the Russian state”. It added: “Neither Christopher Chandler nor anyone at Legatum is aware of any such alleged “investigation” by the French authorities, not 16 years ago or at any time since. “To be clear Christopher Chandler has never been approached at any time by the French or any other authorities regarding Russia and maintains a sterling record of ethical business practices earned over many decades.” It called the accusations “complete nonsense” and said Legatum had “previously rebutted them”. Speaking in the Commons, the MP Ben Bradshaw who has previously raised questions about the Kremlin’s possible role in Brexit said he called for an investigation into Legatum last November. Bradshaw said he was concerned by Seely’s new “information” and by the “growing corruption, money laundering and sale of passports by Malta, where Chandler has just acquired citizenship”. The MP called on the UK authorities to “urgently investigate”. Last year the Mail on Sunday published a detailed story on Chandler’s alleged ties to Moscow. It claimed that Legatum’s economics director, Shanker Singham, had met Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, and had coordinated a letter written by them to Theresa May demanding a hard Brexit. Singham held discussions with leading cabinet Brexiters on multiple occasions, and saw representatives of David Davis’s department six times in the year up to August 2017, it has been reported. Singham recently left to work for a rightwing thinktank. Legatum said at the time in a statement that Singham had been sought out for his “unparalleled knowledge and expertise”. Legatum has said it will do less Brexit work and instead concentrate on the benefits of international trade. Chandler and Legatum’s chief executive, Mark Stoleson, became Maltese citizens in 2015. They say their applications were unrelated to Brexit, and were made the previous year. The Legatum institute responded to the Mail on Sunday with a lengthy statement. Among other things, it said that Chandler was “a much-loved friend of the institute” but that he had no role within it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/08/rachel-roddy-recipe-baked-pasta-gratin","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-08T11:00:16Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for baked pasta gratin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/08/rachel-roddy-recipe-baked-pasta-gratin","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/08/rachel-roddy-recipe-baked-pasta-gratin","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for baked pasta gratin","bodyText":"‘Don’t put it in the fridge” is something you are told when you buy mozzarella in Italy. Leave it in its plastic bag surrounded by the cloudy siero (whey), at room temperature, until you are ready to eat it. Placed on a chilly shelf, mozzarella is like an inadequately dressed person on a cold day: it braces and seizes up, losing its soft, velvety texture and, like a cold tomato, doesn’t taste of much. Do put mozzarella in the fridge, however, if you are going to cook with it. The seizing-up and drying-out is exactly what you want for an aubergine parmigiana or baked pasta, the slightly drier slices or cubes not weeping liquid the way they would if the mozzarella was spankingly fresh. Once upon a time, all mozzarella was di bufala, made from the milk of the buffalos that have grazed on the pastures of Campania – the southern region of which Naples is capital – since the ninth century. Buffalo milk has a higher fat content than cow’s, so produces creamier, more fragrant mozzarella, managing to be both sweet and decidedly savoury. Growing popularity and demand for mozzarella throughout Italy in the 19th century, and then the world, meant people began making it with cow’s milk, or with a mixture of milks, but there was little differentiation – every stretched cheese simply became “mozzarella”. Classification has helped, the protecting DOP means it must state origin and whether it is di bufala, a mix, or cow’s milk (which is rightly known as fior di latte and can be extremely good). If you live in Campania and have an abundance of mozzarella di bufala, you might well cook with it, but even in nearby Rome, I rarely do: mozzarella di bufala is a prize and to be eaten just so – possibly with tomato and basil; an anchovy maybe. For cooking, mixed milk or fior di latte is fine: it, too, is best left in the fridge for a day or two to dry out a little. Today’s recipe is another from Oretta Zanini de Vita, a weekday dinner dish she calls gratin alla Sorrentina, coming from the Sorrento region of Campania. It is the simplest of the baked pasta family; the butter and cheese sauce is created on the surface of al dente pasta in the pan, then tipped into a dish and baked. It is neither creamy nor gloopy, rather gently flavoured and crisp on top. Plainly good. Oretta is quite bossy – which I like – and says you shouldn’t add anything. Sometimes I listen, sometimes I don’t, adding more cheese, peas, hard-boiled egg (my Sicilian partner Vincenzo would add them to every baked pasta if he could), and a big spoonful of mascarpone. Boil 500g pasta in salted water – fusilli is ideal – until al dente, then drain. Put the pasta back in the hot, empty pan with 75g room-temperature butter, 400g small-diced mozzarella, 75g grated pecorino or parmesan, (or a mix of the two) and a few good grinds of black pepper, then stir over a low flame until the mozzarella is melting and pulling into strings. Now tip everything into a buttered ovenproof dish, sprinkle the top with another handful of grated pecorino and some breadcrumbs, then dot generously with butter. To finish, bake the pasta at 180C/350F/gas 4 for 20 minutes, turning on the grill for the last five minutes so the top browns. This is a gentle dish, so it needs contrast: serve alongside a crisp, green salad with a sharp vinegar dressing, maybe, and a cold bottle of wine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/may/01/iran-nuclear-deal-documents-questions-benjamin-netanyahu","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T19:19:44Z","webTitle":"Netanyahu's theatrics help push Trump towards Iran deal withdrawal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/01/iran-nuclear-deal-documents-questions-benjamin-netanyahu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/01/iran-nuclear-deal-documents-questions-benjamin-netanyahu","fields":{"headline":"Netanyahu's theatrics help push Trump towards Iran deal withdrawal","bodyText":"If the reports are true, it was the heist of the century. Israeli spies are said to have broken into a secret Tehran warehouse in January, stolen a half-tonne of documents and somehow spirited them back to Israel the same night. That version of events, recounted in the New York Times, raises important questions about the documents presented by Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday as proof of Iranian dishonesty about its nuclear weapons programme. For example, why were the presumed crown jewels of Iranian national security not better guarded? Was there a struggle to get into the warehouse, an “inside man”, or was there just a padlock? And why – amid all those documents – were the Israelis not able to find substantive new information that had not been presented by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 2011? “There was nothing there. There was nothing that the IAEA did not know, and all the theatrics and circa-2004 PowerPoint were a bit silly,” said Alexandra Bell, a former state department expert, now senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. At least some of the unanswered questions may yet be resolved when Israel shares the trove with other governments and the IAEA, but by then Netanyahu’s multimedia show-and-tell is likely to have had its intended effect: to provide political cover for US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Donald Trump is threatening to stop issuing presidential waivers on nuclear-related sanctions when the next tranche is due on 12 May, which would mark an abrogation of the agreement, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), even if Trump does not formally announce withdrawal. That would open a rift with Washington’s European allies France, the UK and Germany, who are also party to the JCPOA and remain its strong supporters. London and Paris issued statements on Tuesday stressing that they have been aware of Iranians’ past weapons design work for many years, and it was precisely that awareness that drove their negotiating positions in the two years of talks leading up the deal. Despite such adamant opposition from key allies to Trump’s threatened violation of the deal, the White House seized on Netanyahu’s documents. In its eagerness to embrace the message the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, put out a statement that claimed: “Iran has a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons programme.” A few hours later, the claim was quietly put in the past tense, stating instead that Iran had such a programme. That assumption underpinned the JCPOA. So far, nothing from the Israeli document trove represents a direct violation of the deal, or contradicts the IAEA’s judgment in December 2015 that there had been no evidence of Iranian work on nuclear weapons design after 2009. In its only response to the Netanyahu’s presentation so far, the IAEA simply restated the formal findings of its director general, Yukiya Amano, in 2015, that there appeared to have been a “coordinated effort” in Iran on weapons development up to 2003. After that, there were more dispersed “feasibility and scientific studies” until 2009, and that were “no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009”. The Israeli documents do, however, highlight one of the compromises underlying the JCPOA. The IAEA had been pursuing evidence of nuclear weapons design since 2005, after a laptop containing files on nuclear weapons design had been smuggled out of Iran and handed to the CIA. By February 2008, the head of the safeguards department, Olli Heinonen, believed there was enough evidence to brief the IAEA board, and his inspectors continued to press for access to the places and people linked to the “Amad” nuclear weapons project, in particular, its chief scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. The Iranians stonewalled, however, and the IAEA never got to interview Fakhrizadeh or his colleagues. The JCPOA did not resolve the impasse, but shelved it. The parties agreed the deal could not go into force until the IAEA had closed its file on past weaponisation issues. Amano did so in December 2015 with a “final assessment”, summarising what the IAEA knew, without the benefit of the interviews and inspections the safeguards department wanted. Those were mostly under the control of the Revolutionary Guard and therefore quite possibly not in the gift of Hassan Rouhani, the president of Iran. It was a political fix that made some uneasy, like Heinonen who argued that the IAEA was debasing its own currency as the gold standard of nuclear verification. The new documents could well re-open this dilemma, possibly identifying sites of past weaponisation work that IAEA inspectors could ask to visit, maybe triggering stand-offs with the Iranian military. Or they could prevent the IAEA reaching a formal “broader conclusion” that Iran’s nuclear programme is for exclusively peaceful means – a milestone which was envisioned in the first decade of the JCPOA’s implementation. “The IAEA’s final assessment was a bit of a fudge. They didn’t quite close it as put it on a back burner. This makes it difficult to do that,” said Ian Stewart, a former UK counter-proliferation official now at King’s College London. Under the JCPOA certain restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities lift after eight years or when the IAEA reaches its “broader conclusion”. “It would leave us in a politically untenable situation, with the restrictions on the programme lifted de facto by the clock, rather than the IAEA satisfying itself that Iran activities are of a purely peaceful nature,” Stewart said. Such dilemmas may not arise however, if Trump – emboldened by Netanyahu’s documents – succeeds in killing off the JCPOA in the coming weeks or months."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/01/are-women-responsible-for-extreme-sexual-violence-on-screen-germaine-greer","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T17:01:10Z","webTitle":"Are women responsible for all the extreme sexual violence on screen?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/01/are-women-responsible-for-extreme-sexual-violence-on-screen-germaine-greer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/01/are-women-responsible-for-extreme-sexual-violence-on-screen-germaine-greer","fields":{"headline":"Are women responsible for all the extreme sexual violence on screen?","bodyText":"You can say what you like about Germaine Greer, but she’s not afraid of anything – not controversy, swimming against the tide or sounding like the feminist who doesn’t like women very much. In a Radio Times article this week, she lays the proliferation of sexual violence in TV drama – almost all of it against women, of course – squarely at the feet of the female viewer. Women consume 60% to 80% of crime fiction (that is quite a large tolerance band, but let’s not nitpick), and are the main viewers of true crime drama. Why? Because fear of being raped occupies our consciousness, posits Greer, and imaginary rapes bedeck our fantasies. She cites a study by the University of Texas, which found that nearly a third of women regularly fantasise about being violated: “In my view, the fantasy is commoner than these figures suggest,” writes Greer. What it means for a woman to fantasise about violence is quite an interesting fissure in feminist thinking. It is surprising to see it raised, by Greer, in relation to the Scandi crime noir The Bridge – the latest series opens with a woman who has been buried up to her neck and stoned to death (as fantasies go, I doubt that is in anyone’s top 10). But it does come up a lot in discussions about feminist porn. People assume that “ethical” porn will just be more softly lit and with better storylines, but that’s not the case: some of it is, sure, but there is an evolved BDSM (bondage, domination, sadism, masochism) strand that is, if you take it literally, more violent to women than gonzo porn, which is just sex, only faster. The existence of female rape fantasies isn’t proof that, contrary to #MeToo, we all (or a third of us) want to be literally raped. Denise Mina, author of the compelling Alex Morrow series and, most recently, the true crime story The Long Drop, says that rape fantasies are “about women wanting to be forgiven for their compliance. It’s not about women wanting to have their heads stoved in with a brick and left at a railway siding”. Nobody watches a drama such as The Fall – one of the subjects of Doon Mackichan’s brilliant radio documentary about screen violence against women – in order to identify with the victims. The locus of the drama is all either in the killer or the detective; it’s all in the puzzle. The sudden popularity of Scandi noir was not because of the jumpers or any revolution in storytelling; the radical bit was that the detectives, and therefore the emotional wellspring of the genre, weren’t (or weren’t all) grey-haired men. “This is a complicated and nuanced issue,” says bestselling crime writer Val McDermid, “and there are a lot of factors involved. But I do think women are drawn to watching crime dramas because we have been conditioned into thinking of ourselves as potential victims, and we want to understand how that prediction comes true. There’s also a sense in which it feels almost talismanic, like watching lightning striking someone else’s house – ‘Thank God it’s not me.’” That would locate a fascination with violence against women firmly in the realm of fear – the way you sometimes visualise yourself jumping off a footbridge, or new mothers get hyper-real visions of stabbing their baby with a nappy pin (that’s actually an example from a 50s psychiatry manual, if it sounds a little dated). The mind neutralises, or at least copes with, fear by creating it as a mental hologram. Joan Smith, crime author and critic, has a different take: “I suspect viewers are watching these series in spite of the sexual violence and the victimisation, not because of it. It’s a cheap thrill, a way of grabbing attention – the more subtle ways, that depend on the creation of tension, are much harder to do. Presenting a really shocking image is much quicker.” But you don’t linger on it; you’re driven immediately to the question of who did this, and why, “and then what viewers do is identify with the detectives, these anguished figures”. That doesn’t mean the violence is purely incidental, but it is essential to the character arc of DC Pointyhead, whose humanity is established by the fact that he cares for the vulnerable dead girl – he can then get right on with being smart. Yet just because the viewers aren’t watching for the blood doesn’t mean this trope is without consequence. “The victims become incidental,” Smith says. “That does worry me about the nastiness of some crime narratives, that the victims get completely overlooked, and we become desensitised.” “One of the problems with crime fiction at the moment,” Mina points out, “is people talking about it who know nothing about crime fiction. It’s like having a conversation about television, in which you could be talking about This Morning or The Wire.” There is difference of opinion here – Mackichan’s view is that TV should attempt to go a year without any violence against women, because all of it has a brutalising effect on the viewer, not to mention the young actors who get their first break spending 17 hours filming a rape scene. Yet, as a viewer, I would still parse the difference between watching two hours of Hannibal (the TV show, not the film) – elegant lighting and loving cameras lingering interminably on the exquisite rotting flesh of an 18-year-old college student – and two hours of The Bridge, in which the torture seems less pornographic (though, granted, I haven’t seen the new series). The idea raised by Greer – that women are aroused by the idea of violent sex – is one that defines the pro-sex and anti-sex schools of feminism, explored by thinkers including the French feminist philosopher and film-maker Virginie Despentes, who made the film Baise-Moi (Rape Me) in 2000. In the 70s, the feminist lawyer Catherine MacKinnon made the case that all sexual encounters occurred under the patriarchy, therefore “hostility and contempt, or arousal of master to slave, together with awe and vulnerability, or arousal of slave to master” are its building blocks. In those conditions, the true feminist eschews sex. The pro-sex rebuttal was that this view relied on women being void of sexual desire themselves. Twenty years later, Despentes made a triangulated argument (how 90s!). As she defined it, fantasising about rape and being raped were completely discrete (she had experienced both). It’s not like dreaming of winning the lottery, and then winning the lottery: the dream is an idiosyncratic interplay between social shame and sexual desire, while the reality is being disempowered and afraid, and those are different things. In other words, you can accept that living under the patriarchy has informed your sexuality and not just still enjoy sex but incorporate, even own, that power dynamic. To police or close off the alleyways of your own arousal would simply be submitting to the patriarchy in a different, less diverting way. The contemporary philosopher Amia Srinivasan resolved whether or not a rape fantasy was unfeminist, to my satisfaction at least: “If a woman says she enjoys … engaging in rape fantasies – and even that she doesn’t just enjoy these things but finds them emancipatory, part of her feminist praxis – then we are required, as feminists, to trust her. This is not merely an epistemic claim … It is also, or perhaps primarily, an ethical claim: a feminism that trades too freely in notions of self-deception is a feminism that risks dominating the subjects it wants to liberate.” One thing is unarguable: women do seem to consume more crime fiction than men (though men are the main consumers of true-crime books), and women watch more crime drama. It is also true that women read more than men generally, and also watch more telly. So the question of why women are interested in this dark subject matter does seem to be freighted with the unspoken expectation that we should prefer nice things. “It’s really – why aren’t they at home stroking kittens and making scones?” Mina says, and describes to me the trial of a serial killer in the 50s, at which there were 60 seats in the public gallery, all taken by women. “And at that time, newspapers were saying: ‘It’s because women are attracted to powerful men.’” There is a constant here: grisly crimes are compelling to women. But the explanation of this interest changes according to what society thinks women are like at any given time – or, more specifically, what’s wrong with us."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/01/traditional-programme-demise-memories-threatened","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T15:50:15Z","webTitle":"Demise of the match-day programme threatens treasured memories","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/01/traditional-programme-demise-memories-threatened","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/01/traditional-programme-demise-memories-threatened","fields":{"headline":"Demise of the match-day programme threatens treasured memories","bodyText":"The revelation that producing a match-day programme may no longer be an absolute requirement for clubs in the Football League from next season was, for some, another nail in the coffin for the traditional ways of the sport in this country. The matter will be discussed at the league’s annual general meeting next month, when a vote could see a move to a more modern approach, with the “proliferation of digital and social media” being one of the main factors the EFL outlined as to why this point has been reached. As a lifelong Swindon Town supporter, I sincerely hope programmes survive the vote. For me, they are as much part of the match-day routine as purchasing an overpriced pie before kick-off. For fans they are also a collectible source of club history, which is especially important for teams who ply their trade below the Premier League as, by and large, their collective history takes more digging into than a quick Google search, as is the case for Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea. I became a Swindon season-ticket holder during the summer of 2011, when I turned 16, and instantly went from someone who went to the odd game at the County Ground to a regular attendee. Being a matchgoer was now a ritual and that meant taking part in rituals, like buying a programme from the programme seller who always stood – and still does – by the Magic Roundabout. The programme became the mental distraction I needed at half-time during freezing Tuesday night games against Gillingham, Burton Albion, and from there a source of fascination, particularly for someone keen on becoming a sports journalist. The “Face 2 Face” feature that allowed supporters to ask players questions, serious or otherwise, became a route into the industry and I look back on asking the Namibia midfielder Oliver Risser about the nation’s chances of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup as an important first step in my reporting career. Following Monday’s news, I decided to flick through the programmes from that season, 2011-12. Doing so proved to be a heartwarming trip down memory lane. I was reminded of the free trading cards of Swindon legends, as well as those dedicated to the then-current crop, which somewhat embarrassingly, I stuck on my bedroom wall. These days I cover Swindon in a professional capacity, meaning I get given a programme for free on entering the ground. This has changed my relationship with them but never have I forgotten the key part they play in how fans engage with, and consume, the club they support. Whether that be as a memento from their first game, an outlet to find out more about the players and staff, or simply something to pass the time, before kick-off and at half-time. Whether or not the 72 Football League clubs vote in favour of scrapping programmes next month, there is little doubt their future is under threat in this age of free online content and the subsequent, slow death of print. One solution could be a digital, downloadable programme – something free to obtain and easy to access via a laptop, tablet or smart phone. For many fans, though, there is, and never will be, anything quite like a programme in its most traditional form – on paper and on sale outside of the ground.

Thames 21, a London environmental organisation that cleans up rivers and canals, retrieved 5,453 wet wipes during an operation last month in 116 sq m of the Thames embankment near Hammersmith. The haul was an increase of nearly a thousand over last year’s total (which took place on a larger riverbank area). “You need to go at low tide to see the mounds forming,” said Thames 21’s Kirsten Downer. “The Thames riverbed is changing. Wet wipes are accumulating on the riverbed and affecting the shape of the riverbed. It looks natural but when you get close you can see that these clumps are composed of wet wipes mixed with twigs and mud.” Wet wipes are now a booming industry with their own conference and even a “moist towelette” online museum. The sector is busily innovating, and alongside baby wipes you can now buy personal care wipes, household wipes, industrial wipes, pet wipes and speciality anti-malarial wipes. The sector is expected to grow about 6-7% a year, and to expand from a $3bn international market to $4bn by 2021. But there is growing concern about the environmental impact. The wipes are usually made of a fabric like cotton woven together with plastic resins such as polyester or polypropylene, which are are not biodegradable. “People get confused and don’t realise that you are not supposed to flush wet wipes down the toilet,” said Downer. A study last year by Water UK, the body representing the UK’s water and sewerage companies, found that wet wipes made up 93% of the material causing blockages. Thames 21 is working with City to Sea to raise awareness of the scale of the problem and hope to meet with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to discuss improving labelling to make people more aware when they are using non-flushable wipes. “We want people to realise that this is not just happening on the Thames, but on rivers and canals all round the country,” said Downer. “All the time we were working, people kept coming to ask what we were doing. People are far more upset and concerned about the plastics problem than they ever have been.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/14/rome-city-guide-top-tips-testaccio-garbatella-neighbourhoods-restaurants-bars","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-14T05:30:20Z","webTitle":"A local’s guide to Rome: 10 top tips","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/14/rome-city-guide-top-tips-testaccio-garbatella-neighbourhoods-restaurants-bars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/14/rome-city-guide-top-tips-testaccio-garbatella-neighbourhoods-restaurants-bars","fields":{"headline":"A local’s guide to Rome: 10 top tips","bodyText":"‘How do you cope with the tourists?” is a question that you get used to when living in Rome. But the truth is, for most of my time there, I hardly saw them. My first apartment was a stone’s throw from the Vatican, which meant that the local shops all sold rosary beads and holy water rather than bread and milk. But after learning that lesson, I quickly abandoned the centre in favour of the city’s more lively, and liveable, neighbourhoods. In that sense, I’ve always seen Rome as two places. One is a spectacle that millions visit every year, with its monuments and crowds and cobbled streets, and the other is a city where the paint is peeling and the bins overflow, but also where you’ll find the best restaurants, the only bars worth drinking in and crucially, all but the richest of Romans. The Colosseum is a wonder; and, even after walking past a Bernini fountain a thousand times, it still leaves me speechless. But they’re only a small part of this incredible city’s identity. Contemporary romanità, to borrow a word from Italian, is to be found in the messy, modern sprawl to the fringes of the famous sites, and the contrast to be found there is the perfect antidote to downtown’s mire of guided groups, selfie sticks, and gladiators clad in plastic armour. L’Oasi della Birra This bar has one of the best beer selections in the city but, as it’s part of a wine shop, there are also plenty of options for those who prefer the grape to the grain. The bar has seating outside facing a lively piazza but most regulars sit indoors because they mainly come for the aperitivo buffet, which is enormous. All too often in Italy, these consist of limp pasta in lifeless sauces or various forms of flavourless bread, with a focus on quantity rather than quality, but at L’Oasi della Birra there’s a plethora of tasty snacks on offer, from fresh buffalo mozzarella and other cheeses to cured meats and baked dishes. • Piazza Testaccio 38-41, Mon–Sat 8am-1am, Sun 6pm-1am, on Facebook Mattatoio di Roma Formerly an annex of Rome’s museum of contemporary art, Macro Testaccio, the Mattatoio di Roma is a large complex of refurbished buildings that was once Testaccio’s slaughterhouse. It offers a refreshingly contemporary alternative to the more obvious and ancient attractions that most people associate with the city. In keeping with the neighbourhood’s reputation for nightlife, it’s occasionally open until midnight when there’s a show on, so it’s a good way to squeeze in a little bit more culture. Exhibitions change regularly but the building alone is worth a visit and still boasts many of its original features, including animal pens and a system of meat hooks on overhead rails. Next door, La Città dell’Altra Economia regularly runs cultural events of its own, usually focused on sustainability and ecology, and is a good spot to grab a bite to eat or a drink. • Piazza Orazio Giustiniani 4, opening hours vary, mattatoioroma.it Al Ristoro degli Angeli Garbatella is a leafy residential area just south of Ostiense, one of the city’s main stations. It’s popular with Romans for its distinctive architectural style, and for the abundant selection of places to eat among its warren of narrow streets (often made narrower by the local penchant for laissez-faire parking). Under an archway, just off a hectic piazza and across the road from the Teatro Palladium, Al Ristoro degli Angeli is, for me, the perfect neighbourhood restaurant. It’s in an old Ente Comunale di Consumo (Municipal Consumer Body), a kind of state-run shop created in the 1940s and 50s to serve working-class areas and limit inflation, and the decor is a mix of mid-20th century furniture and curiosities, ranging from an antique pizza transporter to theatre memorabilia and a collection of Star Wars toys. The ever-present owners are a treat and the staff are always friendly, it has a lively atmosphere and is cosy and informal, but the quality of the food and the small but excellent selection of wine lends the experience a sense of occasion. The menu is a celebration of Roman classics, sometimes with the proprietor’s personal twist. That’s not something that’s done lightly in these parts, where recipes for regional staples are treated more as canon than guidelines, and changes usually result in heated debate. But here, the touch is light and in the case of the cacio e pepe, a rich pasta dish made with pecorino cheese and black pepper, the addition of a wafer made from melted cheese is a welcome flourish rather than a violation of tradition. • Via Luigi Orlando 2, open for dinner only, closed Sunday, ristorodegliangeli.it Casetta Rossa Casetta Rossa is part social centre, part restaurant, run by a group of activists from a small, single-storey red building – from which it gets its name – in a spacious garden covered by thick canopy of trees beside the Parco Cavallo Pazzo. It runs a wide range of cultural events, and is a popular destination for locals on summer evenings, when dining outside is as much a necessity as a pleasure. Expect an uncomplicated menu that changes seasonally and is based on local, fresh produce. Booking is strongly advised. • Via Giovanni Battista Magnaghi 14, closed Monday, Sunday lunch only, casettarossa.org Ecosolidale market Held at weekends in old industrial sheds just off the hectic via Ostiense, this vintage market is a treasure trove of Italian fashion. Unlike with a lot of secondhand shops, there’s very little tat on display, and while the old ball gowns may not be to everyone’s taste, you’re likely to trip over a pre-loved Fendi bag or two as you dash to that rack of uber-cool 1970s coats. And best of all, proceeds go to charity. • Via del Porto Fluviale 2, Saturday 5pm–7pm, Sun 4.30pm–8pm, on Facebook Cimitero Acattolico Rome’s non-Catholic cemetery has some illustrious residents, from Antonio Gramsci, one of the founding fathers of European communism, to Belinda Lee, a now almost forgotten English actress who was a huge film star in the 1950s. Most visitors come to see the poets John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley but there’s a wide selection of fascinating lives to ponder, including an African-American anti-slavery activist and an atomic physicist. The most impressive of all the cemetery’s memorials is known as the Angel of Grief and is the work of William Wetmore Story, an American sculptor who made the statue for his wife. • Via Caio Cestio 6, Monday-Saturday 9am-5pm, Sunday and public holidays 9am-1pm, cemeteryrome.it Trattoria Zampagna A visit to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls is a good way to take in some papal splendour without the crowds or the queues of the Vatican. Constructed on the site where Saint Paul is said to have been buried following his decapitation, it’s the second-largest church in the city after Saint Peter’s. Parts of it were built by the emperor Constantine in the fourth century, though most of the current building dates from the mid-1800s, after a fire destroyed much of the building. Many of the internal treasures were saved and the result is a rich mix of contrasting styles that conveys the basilica’s long history. Across the road, the kitchen at Trattoria Zampagna does much the same for the city’s culinary history. It’s the ideal place for a lazy lunch, with a reasonably priced menu full of old Roman reliables, served in large portions with a minimum of fuss. The carbonara and the bucatini all’amatriciana never fail to impress, and when in season the artichokes are a must. If a second course is in order, the coda alla vaccinara, slow-cooked oxtail with tomatoes and a large amount of celery, is about as Roman as it gets. According to local tradition, certain days bring special dishes, so expect handmade gnocchi on Thursdays, baccalà (salt cod) on Fridays and Roman-style tripe on Saturdays. • Via Ostiense 179, on Facebook, closed Sundays Flavio al Velavevodetto The Quinto Quarto (Fifth Quarter) refers to offal, with which butchers were traditionally part paid for the animals they slaughtered. As a result, the cheap cuts play a huge role in Roman cooking. And Testaccio, just south across the Tiber from touristy Trastevere, is the spiritual home for such dishes: it used to be the city’s main meat processing district. The area has been at the heart of trade in Rome since ancient times, and the main hill around which it grew up, Monte Testaccio, is actually a spoil heap of broken amphorae – ceramic containers used to transport goods – from the time of Emperor Augustus onwards. Flavio al Velavevodetto, one of Testaccio’s best restaurants, sits at the foot of that hill, just across the road from the crumbling ruins of AS Roma’s first stadium, and the Non-Catholic Cemetery. Back at the restaurant, some of the interior walls have been replaced with glass, allowing diners to ponder the age and origins of those neatly stacked clay pots, buried so many centuries ago. The main draw, however, is the food. Along with the classics, you’ll find sweetbreads, tongue, fettuccine with chicken giblets and a plate of rigatoni with pajata, the intestines of unweaned calves that still contain mother’s milk and produce a creamy sauce when cooked in a tomato base. The roasted rabbit cacciatora is also exceptional. • Via di Monte Testaccio, 97, lunch 12.30pm-3.00pm, dinner 7.45pm-11.00pm, ristorantevelavevodetto.it Felice a Testaccio This is another favourite in Testaccio. Many swear that Da Felice’s cacio e pepe with tonnarelli (square spaghetti) is the best in the city, but if such a cheesy sauce isn’t your thing, don’t worry because there’s not a bad dish on the menu. For the more adventurous, pajata is also available, or rigatoni with an oxtail or slow-cooked lamb sauce. This restaurant has been around since 1936 and has a dedicated clientele, so book a day or two in advance. • Via Mastro Giorgio 29, lunch 12.30pm-3pm, dinner 7pm-11.30pm, feliceatestaccio.it Latteria Garbatella This stylish cocktail bar run by two friends in the ground floor of a residential building has a great outdoor space for evening drinks in warmer months. The interior decor is full-on hipster, and as such could really be in any big city these days, but the courtyard space, surrounded by old apartment blocks with faded paint and crumbling plasterwork, is typical Rome, making it a perfect option for anyone looking for an aperitivo with a local vibe, or late-night drinks. The cocktails are superb and there’s a small but excellent selection of food. • Piazza Geremia Bonomelli, 9, Tues-Sat 6pm–2am, Sunday 10am–midnight, latteriagarbatella.com Getting there BA, easyJet, Ryanair, Jet2, Alitalia, Jet2, Flybe and Vueling all fly to Rome from several UK airports from £38 one way.

In fact, it was like circuits, only with ropes. No, wait, it was like climbing, then doing circuits, then doing more climbing, then doing more circuits. I also booked us in to see jazz afterwards (there’s a club around the corner from the gym). It was like the 12 Labours of Hercules. Top rope climbing is where you have a belay, a friend-come-counterweight at the base of the wall. Automated top-roping is where you have an intensely strong elastic (or whatever; I don’t want to talk about physics) that simply guides you down once you’ve got to the top. It’s extremely fun, which is why, if you’ve been to a Clip ’n Climb centre, it’s likely to have been for a children’s party, because it’s like bungee jumping without fear. As a fitness pursuit, it’s still worthwhile, since all the effort is in getting to the top, whatever kind of climbing you do (potential energy, obviously; oh, it appears that I do want to talk about physics). The first half-hour was a free climb, which I took very easy, having an inkling of what might be down the line, and which Mr took very energetically. With an hour to go, we were divided into three groups, one doing cardio (running, bear crawling, running, jumping); one still climbing; and one doing resistance – squats, bench hops, a sit-on-the-bench-then-jump manoeuvre. “It looks like a fringe mime production about commuters,” I said. “I’m just another number. Wait, I feel alive! No, I’m just another number.” The instructor had done a marathon the day before and was in no mood for shirkers. “Are you two meant to be bear crawling?” The cardio was fine. The bench hops were extraordinarily difficult, and I claimed to need the loo, which takes a long time when you’re pretending to remove a climbing harness. The climbing, which in regular life is quite strenuous, was a huge relief after the rest of it. This, I guess, is the USP of the class, or it would just be 90 minutes of pain and nobody would go. When I pointed this out, Mr was having none of it: “Argh, you’re doing that thing where you say ‘nobody’ and you just mean you. Zobody likes yoghurt. Zobody washes their sheets every week.” “Nobody does that.” “Zobody does what?” “Nobody picks three simultaneous fights in the middle of an exercise class.” The instructor came out of nowhere. “Are you two meant to be duck-walking?” “We’re actually quite fit,” he said, “these people are all much younger than us.” It was sort of true, though the woman who climbed the speed-wall just before me did it 32 seconds faster (to be more precise: it took me 39 seconds and her seven). But we’d striven, for the most part, honestly, and were virtuously exhausted. Didn’t go to the jazz, though; nobody likes jazz.

Nevertheless, 13 people have chosen a brutal thriller over an extra few hours in the sun. Pitbull: Last Dog, which opened the previous weekend on 279 screens, will have escaped the attention of most cinemagoers. It’s certainly more stomach-churning than the average multiplex fare. One woman has her throat slashed in the first five minutes; another is placed under a carpet and then beaten violently with belts by a gang of thugs. A dead man is shot in the mouth at point-blank range, while a gangster pouring acid on a corpse tells his cohort charmingly: “If you make it without puking, I’ll buy you a whore.” Pitbull: Ostatni pies (Pitbull: Last Dog) is the latest in a run of films to have dented the UK box office top 10 despite being marketed exclusively at the Polish community. (At the time of writing it has taken around £340,000.) This year has already brought one hit, Kobiety mafii (Mafia Women), which took almost £900,000 in the UK and Ireland. Last year, the grisly 18-rated medical drama Botoks amassed £1.06m, making it not only the third highest-grossing foreign-language release of 2017 (after Park Chan-wook’s The Handmaiden and the Bollywood hit Raees) but the most successful Polish film ever in the UK. Like Bollywood, Polish cinema has flourished in UK multiplexes rather than arthouses, without any help from the British media. It is only partly true to say that the mainstream press has ignored these releases; what’s more significant is that its attention and approval were never sought in the first place. With Polish now the second most commonly spoken language in England, English-speaking viewers are not part of this particular success story. The audience members I talk to after Pitbull: Last Dog are both Polish, though neither is especially impressed by what they have just seen. “It’s not as good as the other ones,” says Tomasz, a 40-year-old draughtsman and fan of the two previous Pitbull instalments. “This one is softer, more American. In Polish, we would say grubymi nićmi szyte – ‘stitched with a thick thread’. It hangs together, but only just.” Maciej, a 41-year-old veterinary surgeon, hasn’t seen a Polish film in a cinema since coming to live in the UK 12 years ago. “It was like it was on steroids,” he laughs. “It just showed all the different ways you could kill someone. I couldn’t follow what was going on.” Did it reflect anything about Polish life or culture? “I hope not. If it’s like that, I don’t want to go back.” Awareness of these movies is raised largely through social media and websites, and by the hoopla surrounding the initial premieres back in Poland (Pitbull: Last Dog was released there a month ago and enjoyed the second-biggest opening weekend of any native film this year). But what are Polish viewers here getting from these movies that they can’t get from the mainstream US equivalents? “There’s a certain mix of humour and toughness and a real eastern European vibe which Polish audiences like,” says Joanna Michalec, director of Phoenix Productions, the leading international distributor of Polish films. “I think they also like seeing Poland in a movie, and what’s important is they can go to a normal multiplex and see these films in Polish. That means a lot.” Phoenix, which is based in Chicago, started distributing Polish films in Britain in April 2016 after noticing interest on its Facebook page from the UK and Ireland. Its inaugural release was Pitbull. Nowe porządki (Pitbull: New Orders), the first of the trilogy spun off from a Polish TV series. “Polish distributors in the past released on 20 or 30 screens, but we decided to give it all we’d got,” she says. A typical Phoenix release will now play on upwards of 250 screens, although the company has its sights set even higher. “There are a million Polish people in the UK,” says Paul Sweeney, Phoenix’s director of UK and Ireland strategy. “Only 10% of them come to the cinema, so part of what I’m doing is finding the ones we’re not targeting. The potential to grow is huge.” The mainstay of Polish cinema is director Patryk Vega, a Guy Ritchie-style figure responsible for every gory, high-octane success to date with the exception of the latest Pitbull. But not all of Phoenix’s films are violent. It also does a roaring trade in romantic comedies: Narzeczony na Niby (Pretend Fiance) is about to open, while the company had a hit two years ago with Planeta Singli (Planet Single), a lively Richard Curtis-style romcom centred on a dating app. Its Slovenian director, Mitja Okorn, currently lives in Los Angeles and recently finished making Life in a Year with Cara Delevingne and Jaden Smith for Will Smith’s Overbrook Entertainment. In June 2016, I attended a press screening of Planet Single introduced by Okorn, although it is unusual for non-arthouse Polish films to be shown to the press. “I was happy with the UK release, but I always want more,” he says now. “What I wanted was a bigger screening, a premiere where we could get even more UK opinion-makers and journalists to see the film. And that’s how we could slowly build a non-Polish UK audience that would become fans of good Polish cinema. For that to work, the distributors of Polish films would also need to be careful which movies they are distributing. The way it is now, they distribute everything – good, bad and extremely bad. Polish people confuse successful with good.” Can Polish cinema draw English-speaking audiences – and does that even matter? “Absolutely it matters,” says Sweeney. “It’s an untapped market that we’re trying to get into. We want to reach those viewers who are perfectly happy to watch foreign films.” The problem is that the sort of Polish movies put out by Phoenix are very different from the arthouse kind. No one is going to mistake Botoks for Ida, Paweł Pawlikowski’s haunting 2014 Oscar-winner, and Vega is no Krzysztof Kieślowski. With that in mind, Phoenix is planning to widen its slate to feature highbrow releases as well as, say, the forthcoming Kobiety mafii sequels. “We’re looking at projects geared toward lovers of foreign films in Britain,” says Michalec. “We have one in the pipeline that’s a Polish-British production aimed at arty audiences who tend to avoid the multiplexes.” If Brexit is causing the company any jitters, Michalec is hiding it well. “I don’t think many Polish people will move out. I can’t see it. The community is very settled.” Asked about his goals for the future, Sweeney doesn’t miss a beat. “My aim is simple,” he says. “A Bafta for best foreign language film.” Pitbull: Last Dog is on release. Narzeczony na Niby (Pretend Fiance) is released on 4 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"society/2018/may/02/abusive-men-using-uk-immigration-fears-to-control-women","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T23:01:06Z","webTitle":"Abusive men 'using immigration fears to control women'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/02/abusive-men-using-uk-immigration-fears-to-control-women","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/02/abusive-men-using-uk-immigration-fears-to-control-women","fields":{"headline":"Abusive men 'using immigration fears to control women'","bodyText":"Theresa May’s “hostile environment” immigration policy, which lay at the heart of the Windrush scandal, is being used by abusive and violent men to threaten and control their partners, a coalition of women’s groups says. Women with insecure immigration status or reliant on a spousal visa are becoming so fearful of deportation they are not reporting crimes of domestic or sexual violence to the police, or seeking backing for an escape, the groups say. The groups, including Latin American Women’s Rights Service (LAWRS), Southall Black Sisters, and others supporting black and ethnic minority women at risk of violence, cite cases where rape victims have been arrested and domestic violence survivors denied refuge and forced to return to their abusers or deported. Last year, a case emerged of a woman who reported being kidnapped and raped and who was arrested by police as she sought care in a care centre in London. Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition (Evaw), said: “The public are rightly outraged by the devastating impact the hostile environment immigration policy has had on the lives of the Windrush generation. The same policy is also leaving many women at risk of violence and exploitation, scaring them away from seeking help and making it harder for them to access life-saving services. “Abusers are weaponising the policy, using that fear, saying, ‘if you leave me, if you go for help, if you draw attention to yourself, you will be deported’.”. Migrant women were disproportionately at risk from gender-based violence, including of a domestic and sexual nature, as well as “honour-based” violence, forced marriage, trafficking and female genital mutilation, she said. “It is both a real and perceived fear,” said Krys. “They can see it happening around them.” The Istanbul Convention On Ending Violence Against Women, which the government has committed to ratify, states that all women should be protected from violence, regardless of their immigration status. In a briefing paper to be launched on Wednesday at a meeting in parliament hosted by the Labour MP Rupa Huq, the group Evaw said the immigration policy had reduced the safe spaces where women could get help from public bodies, and led to an erosion of access to justice, because immigration control took precedence over reporting crimes. “In one case a woman had gone to the police to report a rape and the first people they called were immigration officers,” said Krys. “We’ve had another case, reported by LAWRS and Women for Refugee Women, where a woman at risk of violence was deported. And we’ve had women being told by local authorities and the police if they are abused but have insecure immigration status they can’t get help.” Many migrant women, including victims of trafficking, as well as asylum seekers and those with work visas, student visas or visas connected to their spouse, also have no recourse to public funds so are prevented from using refuges, she said. According to Women’s Aid, 7% of women with no recourse to public funds were accommodated in shelters in 2017 due to their immigration status. In 2013, May, as home secretary, launched plans to create a “hostile environment” for illegal migrants to Britain, requiring the NHS, banks and private landlords to carry out immigration checks. In parliament, women’s groups will ask MPs to support new measures to protect migrant women at risk of abuse, to be placed in the proposed domestic abuse bill. The bill is aimed at enhancing protection and support for victims of domestic abuse. Evaw’s recommendations call for protection and support of victims to be prioritised over immigration enforcement, a “firewall” between public services and immigration control, and an extension of the “destitution domestic violence concession” (a temporary measure to help women with no public funds) to all survivors of domestic violence for at least six months. They also want all immigration legislation to be reviewed for the possible impact on women experiencing gender violence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/may/02/steven-gerrard-foolish-manager-dysfunctional-rangers","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-02T10:30:00Z","webTitle":"Steven Gerrard and Rangers: a needless punt for such a dysfunctional club | Ewan Murray","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/may/02/steven-gerrard-foolish-manager-dysfunctional-rangers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/may/02/steven-gerrard-foolish-manager-dysfunctional-rangers","fields":{"headline":"Steven Gerrard and Rangers: a needless punt for such a dysfunctional club","bodyText":"Perhaps Rangers and Steven Gerrard are operating on the basis of shared risk being a minimised one. There is precious little by way of alternative reasoning for this management alliance being recognised as mutually beneficial. At a time when Rangers desperately need experience, they are in danger of being blinded by a big name and the kind of desperate urge to reannounce themselves as a grand club that is undermined by a string of core details relating to behaviour and performance. Joey Barton was once part of a similar, short-lived, Rangers initiative. That Gerrard would be due credit rather than ridicule if finally accepting Rangers’ advances is obvious. He would be stepping into a club which could barely be more dysfunctional if it tried. Gerrard was cute enough to see impending trouble at MK Dons. What, it must be asked, attracts him to Glasgow – where he has no chance of overhauling his former manager, Brendan Rodgers at Celtic – other than a perception of Rangers in completely embellished form? It is safe to assume Rodgers will take great delight in slapping down one of his former charges. Barring delusion or huge ego, Gerrard must realise he would be pitching up at the OK Corral with a utensil from the Early Learning Centre. Yes, Graeme Souness made a similar move 32 years ago, when backed by the funds – and an English ban – where he could compete with Europe’s top clubs. In no particular order Rangers have an absentee chairman in constant dispute with the takeover panel; two senior players suspended after a dressing room rammy; accounts which illustrate a business kept afloat by director loans and a recently jettisoned interim manager who had been in position since October. The man now overseeing first-team affairs at Ibrox, Jimmy Nicholl, last managed Cowdenbeath towards relegation from Scotland’s second tier. Rangers were bundled out of Europe last summer by a team from Luxembourg, after which their manager ranted at supporters while standing in a bush. No wonder this is the stuff of comedy for opposition fans. There is a live chance of Rangers finishing this season fourth in the Scottish top flight, with the financial impacts associated with that not to be underestimated. January’s transfer window, presided over by the Rangers director of football, Mark Allen, demonstrated once more that Ibrox has become a soft option for soft players. Rangers meekly surrendered to an embarrassing degree against Celtic, twice in as many weeks, with the aggregate score 9-0. That Rangers have failed to appoint a full-time manager following the inevitable sacking of Pedro Caixinha, early in this campaign, points to a huge club with deep-rooted problems. Derek McInnes, a lifelong supporter, could not be coaxed to Ibrox from Aberdeen amid an inability to extract basic information. Gerrard would be correct to point out modern-day football is not full of stable environments but Rangers, in this state, is an extreme case. Smokescreens and a blame culture demonstrate shortcomings if you take time to look closely enough; Rangers’ erudite supporters have long since cottoned on, with their impressive loyalty being consistently abused. The club’s board has made such a catalogue of blunders that it finds itself in the incredible position of replacing a caretaker manager, Graeme Murty, a fortnight before the season ends. Those directors did not even have the capacity to handle that properly, with Murty needlessly in attendance at a club function on Sunday evening – hours after a 5-0 mauling at Celtic Park – and youth game 24 hours later. As pundits in England have insisted Gerrard is entering no-brainer territory in terms of taking an Ibrox role, those north of the border have been accused of undue negativity – or fear – if taking the opposite stance. In truth, it is the latter group which has paid closer to attention to Rangers’ turbulent circumstances. The establishing of Rangers as a clear second force in Scotland, thereby overhauling Aberdeen, is the first and achievable step for any new manager. Defeating Celtic on the odd occasion – Rangers have not won any of their past 11 Old Firm matches – and lifting a trophy – such as Inverness, St Mirren, St Johnstone and Hibernian have done recently – should not be beyond a manager of basic competence. The novelty ends there; Gerrard would be starting his managerial career in an environment where he could only ever be second best, such is the extent of Celtic’s resource pool. It is also a far more ferocious and intense scene than even he has encountered at Anfield. Back to back draws for either half of the Old Firm are the stuff of public relations disaster. There is no breathing space, a situation which even decorated football men or managers – John Barnes, Kenny Dalglish, Paul Le Guen – have proven unable to handle and in spectacular style. This is not to suggest young coaches should never be afforded an opportunity. Rather, big clubs in need of personnel overhaul and emerging from a state of turmoil must surely look towards coaches who have a CV featuring the same. Several senior figures inside Ibrox know precisely this. Neil Warnock has made sufficient overtures regarding management in Scotland to be viewed as a credible candidate when stability is required. In Gerrard, Rangers would be taking a needlessly monumental punt. The notion that players – regardless of wage packets and trophy chances – will be queuing up to play for a Rangers team on Gerrard’s watch is hilariously overplayed. Rangers would be banking on the iconic playing career of a 37-year-old triggering something remotely similar – and instantly – in the dugout. If youth coaches are the flavour of the month, Rangers would be better served looking at the work of Jody Morris at Chelsea. That such a possibility is not quoted again points to an obsession with star name rather than track record. Rangers’ most successful managers of recent times were Dick Advocaat, Walter Smith and Alex McLeish. Following the disastrous tenure of Frank de Boer, Crystal Palace turned to Roy Hodgson. Closer to Ibrox, Kilmarnock’s decision to appoint Steve Clarke has completely revitalised a stagnant team and rudderless club. When Celtic realised Ronny Deila was not a manager of sufficient calibre, Rodgers saw off Neil Lennon and David Moyes to answer the call. Rangers will cite fresh thinking if pulling off their alternative strategy. Nothing whatsoever in the club’s recent past gives cause to take that seriously."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/01/labour-aims-to-force-government-to-reveal-windrush-correspondence","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T15:55:38Z","webTitle":"Labour aims to force government to reveal Windrush correspondence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/01/labour-aims-to-force-government-to-reveal-windrush-correspondence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/01/labour-aims-to-force-government-to-reveal-windrush-correspondence","fields":{"headline":"Labour aims to force government to reveal Windrush correspondence","bodyText":"Labour is seeking to use the same arcane parliamentary procedure it deployed to force the government to hand over its Brexit impact assessments to allow MPs to scrutinise the decision-making process over how the Windrush generation was treated. In a move that could cause extreme discomfort for ministers, Labour will use a so-called humble address motion on Wednesday to ask for all papers, correspondence and advice on Windrush between ministers, senior officials and advisors from May 2010 until now. This would be handed to the Commons home affairs committee and would include information about any detentions or deportations, the setting of deportation targets, and how the policies were seen as affecting people’s lives. If successful, the tactic could undermine the government’s attempts to insulate Theresa May from the crisis over how some citizens of Caribbean origin who arrived in the UK from the 1950s onwards were wrongly targeted amid the “hostile environment” immigration policy, which placed the onus on individuals to actively prove their status. While May has apologised for the treatment of Windrush citizens, the government has sought to portray the resignation on Sunday of Amber Rudd as home secretary as a separate matter, prompted only by her lack of knowledge about removals targets. Late last year Labour used a humble address to force a vote that obliged the government to allow MPs to see what had been described as 58 papers detailing the impact of Brexit on sections of the economy – even those these turned ou`t to be less thorough than billed. On Wednesday, Labour will submit an opposition day motion in the Commons to ask that a “humble address be presented to Her Majesty” seeking the Windrush documents be passed to the home affairs committee. This is a tactic that is difficult for the government to counter. Ministers have opted in recent months to try to take no part in votes on opposition day debates, rather than participate and risk defeat. If the government does lose the vote, precedent from the Brexit example is that the Speaker, John Bercow, has ruled that humble address motions are binding. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary – who will lead the debate, said: “With the resignation of Amber Rudd, Theresa May has lost her human shield and must now fully account for the policies she created and drove through from the Home Office into Downing Street. “The Windrush scandal has exposed something rotten at the heart of government. We need to know what has led to this situation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/head-quarters/2018/may/01/sajid-javid-and-the-strange-science-behind-power-poses","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-01T15:18:25Z","webTitle":"Sajid Javid and the strange science behind power poses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2018/may/01/sajid-javid-and-the-strange-science-behind-power-poses","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/head-quarters/2018/may/01/sajid-javid-and-the-strange-science-behind-power-poses","fields":{"headline":"Sajid Javid and the strange science behind power poses","bodyText":"Standing like Wonder Woman doesn’t get you any actual superpowers, but various members of the British government are doing it anyway. The latest politician to join the ranks of the power stance team is Sajid Javid, whose promotion to home secretary was accompanied by a photo call in which he stood with his legs so far apart he practically reinvented manspreading. His colleagues have also been pictured doing this stance, which is known in lifestyle and management coaching circles as the “power pose”. It’s known to me, however, as “a bit of nonsense”. The power pose was popularised by a 2012 TED talk (which to date has 46m views, making it one of the most popular on the site) in which social psychologist Amy Cuddy claims standing like you’re showing off a golden codpiece (my words, not hers) could “significantly change the way your life unfolds”. She is talking about body language: those silent signals we send accidentally, and which others claim to be able to read whether we want them to or not. It would be pretty great if there was a universality to nonverbal signals (or pretty creepy, depending on your position), because we would be able to tell if someone’s verbal signals – their words – matched with their nonverbal signals – their body language – and therefore whether they’re being honest. It’s certainly the case that many people make judgments about body language (for example, people perceive those who don’t make eye contact as shifty, while those with arms folded are seen as powerless or defensive), but it doesn’t follow that they’re right. The lack of eye contact may be the result of an eye condition like amblyopia, while the folded arms could simply be that I’m cold. (Cuddy suggests women are more likely to close our bodies up to make ourselves smaller; I would counter that differing metabolic rates in men and women might mean women are often simply colder.) I understand the argument in Cuddy’s TED talk as broadly this: becoming aware of how others perceive your body language is the key to making yourself feel more powerful, and therefore manipulating others into believing you are powerful. So if you don’t want to come across as defensive or powerless, don’t fold your arms (regardless of how cold you are). If you want to feel and be seen as powerful, stand like you’re wearing a cape in a really flattering gale. Cuddy’s intentions came from a really good place; she observed that female students came across as less powerful, with potential real-world repercussions. But rather than challenge the gender biases and stereotypes that result in men seeing women’s body language as powerless, she chose to suggest we change our body language to mimic those with actual power (who of course are mostly men). Further, she claimed that her advice was backed up by science. Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case. Cuddy’s own research, a 2010 paper co-authored with Dana Carney and Andy Yap, eventually fell afoul of a replication problem. That is, other researchers trying to get the same result through their own studies failed. In 2017, 11 new studies on power posing failed to replicate the original findings that formed the basis of Cuddy’s TED talk. Her paper had itself been subject to heavy scrutiny, with criticisms of it including too small a sample size (the study had 42 participants), the lack of “blinding” (wherein the researchers could allow their own biases to creep into the study), and the subjective nature of the participants’ feedback (also known as “self-reporting”, or “sometimes people lie or are mistaken”). There was also a lot of controversy about the paper’s “p-curve”, which I won’t go into here as it’s explained thoroughly in this 2017 New York Times piece. Cuddy recently came back with her own new p-curve analysis, but that doesn’t fix the other issues with the original study and certainly doesn’t prove Cuddy’s TED talk claim that power poses could “significantly change the way your life unfolds”. The original paper’s co-author Dana Carney even went as far as retracting her support for the concept of power poses and publicly discouraged others from studying them. And yet the myth of power poses remains, as we saw this week from Sajid Javid. I attribute this partly to TED not removing the talk from their website, and partly to the general principle that you can’t put the lid back on the can once the worms are everywhere. I don’t know why government advisers don’t know that social media roundly mocks this particular stance (unless they are deliberately trolling their employers, which seems unlikely), but you don’t actually need to debunk Cuddy’s power pose research to know politicians don’t get perceived as confident, powerful entities simply by standing with their legs splayed. This article was amended on 2 May to remove the phrase ‘legs akimbo’."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/05/book-clinic-what-to-read-on-train-journey-round-europe","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-05T17:00:04Z","webTitle":"Book clinic: what to read on a train journey round Europe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/05/book-clinic-what-to-read-on-train-journey-round-europe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/05/book-clinic-what-to-read-on-train-journey-round-europe","fields":{"headline":"Book clinic: what to read on a train journey round Europe","bodyText":"Q: My wife and I are retired and plan to spend June travelling by rail around central Europe and Italy. Can you recommend a few books, not too heavy for our luggage, that we can take with us? Mike Young, York A: Andrew Martin, novelist, nonfiction writer and train enthusiast, whose new novel, The Martian Girl, will be published in July Since the inquirers will be spending a lot of time on trains, I will focus on that (well-chosen) transport mode and on their destination, central Europe and Italy. Central Europe was traversed by the various incarnations of the Orient Express, and we trainspotters like to mention that Murder on the Orient Express (1934) by Agatha Christie is actually set on the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express. The plot is outrageously high concept and the railway detail accurate, Christie being a regular on the OE. In The 8.55 to Baghdad (2004), Andrew Eames traces every possible connection between Christie and the OE route. He gives insights into the queen of crime while encountering heavy scenes in the Balkans and elsewhere. Here is Sofia: “The station was ringed with people in kiosks, peering out through glass grilles patched with cracked Sellotape, like railway priests waiting to hear fare dodgers’ confessions.” Stamboul Train (1932) by Graham Greene is a torrid, cinematic thriller, and the best OE novel. Here is its arrival at Budapest: “He had a flashing glimpse of water between tall grey houses, of lights burning in upper rooms, cut off abruptly by the arch of the station…” Three of the six stories in Open All Night (1922) by Paul Morand have central European railway action. Morand is a problematic figure, being a Nazi sympathiser with a terrific prose style: “The scarlet fruit of the signal fell from its latticed trunk in obedience to the timetable.” Italian Ways (2013) by Tim Parks is about Italian railways and therefore Italian people. Parks has a bathetic eye: “A tiny vineyard, just three rows of a dozen vines each, is choked between two cathedral-sized warehouses of prefabricated concrete panels.” But in the south, the beauty of landscape and weather asserts itself, and is beautifully evoked.

Hare’s The Moderate Soprano is on at the Duke of York’s theatre, St Martin’s Lane, and Graham’s Quiz is just a few doors along at the Noël Coward. Graham is, in his mid-30s, a theatrical dynamo, while Hare, at 70, could now qualify as a grand old man of theatre, continuing on his own extraordinary marathon. Each of them has written more about British politics – and in particular the Labour party – than any other playwright alive. Hare’s The Absence of War (1993) was about an opposition leader, based on Neil Kinnock. In the ensuing decades, he has been an interpreter of political and private lives, writing contentiously about everything from education (Skylight, 1995) and the railways (The Permanent Way, 2003) to the West Bank (Via Dolorosa, 1998) and the Iraq war (Stuff Happens, 2004). His new play, I’m Not Running, opening at the National Theatre, London, in the autumn, will return to the subject of Labour. James Graham’s This House (2012), set in the whips’ office, was a virtuoso piece about the hung parliament battles of the 70s. The Vote, at the Donmar, was broadcast live on television during the 2015 election, and Labour of Love (2017) at the Noël Coward, a look at the party over 25 years – for which he has just won an Olivier for “best new comedy” – sealed his reputation. Hare is tall, dashing and potentially ready for friendly fire. To be combative comes naturally but today he is amused and receptive – though never pointlessly compliant. Graham shows up late, with the look of a bright, flustered student. He is empathetic and modest in the way people with no need to boast sometimes are. And there is no mistaking that Hare is a hero to him – the admiration unfeigned. Our conversation kicks off with an argument about the relationship between politics and theatre. In The Absence of War, George Jones implies there is an affinity, saying to another politician: “You don’t go to the theatre, you’re missing out there, everyone in politics should.” In Quiz, Paul, a TV producer, comments: “Some people say that politics is just performance.” But Hare declares that the list of theatregoing politicians is short: “Neil Kinnock was exceptional in being a theatregoer. George Osborne, in a way that was incomprehensible to me, was a theatregoer. Tony Blair was a theatregoer.” He adds: “There is a strongly philistine tradition in British politics, isn’t there?” James joins in cautiously, suggesting theatre and politics are places to “ask questions” – before getting into his stride. James Graham: Theatre is one of the last long forms – there is something about institutions that is intrinsically theatrical. When I described politics as a performance, I was exploring the symbolic shift when the chief whips were kicked out of Downing Street and replaced by a PR machine – government becoming an exercise in public relations rather than a search for truths and solutions. It could be argued that politics involves relentless auditioning. Which of today’s politicians would you cast as actors? David Hare: Colin Powell at the UN, in 2003 – claiming there was irrefutable proof of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We now know he was not altogether in good faith but he did appear sincere – it was a barnstorming performance. JG: I’m fascinated by the idea that Margaret Thatcher was a fictional character invented by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi – the voice, the outfit – even the philosophy. Theresa May is, we assume, acting – we are told she has to sell something she does not believe in with Brexit. What does that do to you when you have to keep compartmentalising? DH: People tend to ask: do politicians know they’re lying? Are they sincere or insincere? Politicians don’t think in those terms. They think: this is the case I have to put – almost like a QC – whatever I privately feel. I’m interested in the idea of the official script. The complaint in The Absence of War is that Labour politicians “all have to say the same thing”. Is political theatre about departing from the script? DH: Yes – I never joined a party because, as a writer, you have to be free to investigate the thing itself. When you write about the Labour party, you are neither pro nor against, you’re just trying to describe the phenomenon. Your freedom is your power. JG: I’m not a member of a party, although I’ve started to question whether this is right. The state of the national conversation is depressingly poor and the stakes so high. You’ve only to look at the burning tower at Grenfell or what happened in the European referendum. I find myself sympathising when I watch squirming politicians on Andrew Marr’s Sunday show. They don’t have the freedom we have to interrogate properly, be curious, listen, respond. Our talking-point culture is so vacuous. The campaign Theresa May led was a flight from conversation. “Brexit means Brexit” was saying: “We cannot talk about this.” I was glad to see that kind of politicking fail. The British public rejected it. DH: It has become difficult for politicians. I went on the Today programme recently and the interviewer was terribly nice and assumed what I was going to say was interesting. They didn’t take up a hostile attitude because I’m a writer and it’s assumed I’m speaking the truth. But the minute they go to a political interview, they’re all over it, saying: why are you lying to me? That’s the assumption the politician has to endure. So there’s a conspiracy of distrust between the public and politicians – it’s not all one-sided. You each wrote five-minute films about Brexit. Is there more to be written about Brexit or are we suffering Brexit fatigue? JG: Brexit is going to be in the DNA of everything, including writing that is not about that vote. The Moderate Soprano, for example, is a metaphor for Englishness… You have interesting takes on Englishness – in your case, DH, a love/hate relationship. In your BBC drama Collateral, the military singing Jerusalem evokes green and unpleasant lands… DH: The army was not desperately keen to collaborate with us on Collateral, but I discovered that, incredibly, there is not a single regiment that does not sing Jerusalem. I have found myself writing about Sussex lately, partly at [the producer] Matt Byam Shaw’s insistence because, after South Downs [based on Hare’s memories of the public school Lancing], he said: “You have to write about Glyndebourne.” Sussex is a county I particularly disliked because I was born there and associate it with the Englishness of the 1950s – the all-white society, the repression, disapproval, misery and the suicidal, closeted unhappiness in which I grew up. I loathed that definition of Englishness. But Englishness that is welcoming to foreigners, interested, curious and outward-looking – I’m in love with that side of Englishness. JG: I think more of Britishness. The narrative of this country in the past 70-80 years seems emblematic, Shakespearean in its… I don’t want to say decline. But Britain has gone from being the most powerful empire to what we are today. I don’t pretend to have an insight into it, but I keep going back to the recent past to try and find a moment within the narrative to make sense of the whole. If Britain were a character, it would be someone strong and confident who had lost a sense of themselves – there is a pathos in this that you can generate in a play. And isn’t satire also essential to a dramatist’s armoury? DH: You have to have a joke. Jokes are clarifying. A good joke is what makes you realise what you think and feel. Yet I cannot explain why certain subjects attract me. It’s like understanding what is photogenic. The “dramagenic” is mysterious. What seems less mysterious is your preference for subjects about which people do not already know… DH: That’s why the current laundry list is of no interest to me. Everyone says: “Will you write about Trump? Will you write about Brexit?” And you just go: “Why would I?” Why would I be behind the dustcart instead of in front of it? You, DH, have been writing about Labour for more than 30 years. What has changed in Labour and what will your new play I’m Not Running reveal? DH: Like James’s Labour of Love, I’m Not Running is about a relationship between a man and a woman that has lasted 20 years, but, unlike James’s play, one of them is in the Labour party and the other isn’t and is trying to do good through a single issue. We’re licensed in society to admire people who fight on single issues, identity politics, people who stand for their own group, be they women, black, Jewish, Arab. If you stand for your group, you are an unalloyed hero. In joined-up party politics, it is harder to be a hero. I wanted to write about why positive feelings about politics are now principally focused on single issues. This seems to me the most interesting phenomenon of our time. And if any movement has had vitality in my lifetime, it has been feminism. In the western world, feminism has been the most transformative political movement. Let me ask a straight question: can Labour win the next election? JG: Oh God – I don’t see why statistically they couldn’t. I grew up in north Nottinghamshire, near Mansfield. It’s a strange identity – it feels quite Yorkshire but is technically Nottinghamshire. Historically, there was a split during the miners’ strike when south Nottinghamshire went back to work and north Nottinghamshire, generally speaking, didn’t. There was violent, physical debate between the left and right of the Labour movement. So can Labour win? Labour used not to be able to win without those seats. In the last election, those seats went to the Conservatives. My view has always been that you couldn’t get into power unless you could appeal to that base. Yet it now seems statistically possible that, with the university towns and the cities, Labour might get in without having to appeal to a working-class base. How do you marry working-class heartlands with university towns? In theory, if you could marry those different constituent parts, you should be able to create an unstoppable alliance, but there is, I feel, a lack of desire to do that in some parts of the Labour party. DH: Are you talking about the leadership, James? [laughs] Rereading The Absence of War, I thought the description of George Jones could be applied to Jeremy Corbyn: “the man who made victory possible. But unless we do something quickly, he’s the only thing standing in victory’s way.” DH: They’re very different characters. Neil Kinnock, to make Labour electable, had to jettison a great deal of what he believed. Jeremy Corbyn’s views have not significantly changed about anything in the last 50 years and are not changing now under pressure. Trident is the exception – for party political, working-class vote reasons. Union reasons. Is tenacity a good quality in a leader? JG: It depends on motivation. If you are not going to bend for cynical political reasons, then that’s admirable. But inflexibility, fundamentalism and dogma aren’t. DH: [Nods agreement.] JG: There’s an obsession with U-turns being bad. I think U-turns are brilliant. If you get faced with a new argument and say – “That’s fascinating, I’m going to change my mind” – that should be a wonderful quality in a politician. In This House, politics itself, not policy, becomes the subject – something separate from what anyone believes… DH: This House is one of the best definitions of the process of politics I have ever seen. JG: It was surprising to realise what has to go on behind the scenes for the business of government to take place. What is the tone when what is openly unsaid is: “You are going to try and pass that law and I am going to try and stop you.” What makes you both angriest about the state of the nation? DH: The detention system. I was, in Collateral, trying to throw light on this unbelievable thing whereby, when you’re waiting for an appeal, you are held in a place of detention. The 300-400 women who are at Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre say: “We’re here and we don’t know when we’re going to get out.” At least in prison you know when you are going to get out. What also really gets me is camp – when people like Boris Johnson or Amber Rudd pretend not to understand what the problem is; Rudd knew perfectly well there is no legal justification for these people to be held behind bars. And yet it is somehow meant to be the game that you camp it up. I remember Willie Whitelaw walking through Brixton after the riots, saying: “The police have done marvellously.” Right? And it was a catastrophic failure of police-community relations. There is this camping your way through everything. If you are totally incompetent, like Boris Johnson, or immoral like Amber Rudd… I am not amused by that joking in English behaviour – it makes me angry. JG: I’m not angry, I’m worried. I’ve mentioned the quality of national discourse and that extends to the way we speak to each other on social media, share ideas or don’t. I’m worried about the way we block each other. I wonder how solutions are going to materialise if the tribalism that seems to exist isn’t bridged. We’re all responsible. What role does social media play in political theatre? JG: Tech and technology are changing us emotionally and politically. We’re in a wild west period. We forget that the internet is really young, it is the equivalent of no lanes on roads, no seatbelts. We don’t know how to use it well enough. I’m sure our grandchildren will look back shocked and baffled that we didn’t wear the equivalent of seatbelts. I try not to get distracted by social media but it’s hard – because you want to be tuned in. DH: Do you? JG: I want to be tuned in to the current anxieties and obsessions. DH: But do you think you can read them on the internet? JG: No. DH: Do you feel social media presents an accurate reflection of the current state of things – I mean, the people you are talking about in Mansfield are not tweeting are they? JG: And they’re not on Instagram – that’s a good point. Yet Twitter must reveal something – especially given it now guides all political conversation in all media. What can political theatre do that political journalism can’t? JG: Journalism’s responsibility is to respond – quickly and urgently. The joy of writing a play is that you can take a bit longer, you can take a step back and ask a bigger question about what this means and why it matters and what it says about us that this is happening? DH: For people of my age, the plays Athol Fugard did with John Kani and Winston Ntshona were the best political theatre we ever saw. It was the sense that they had lived through what they were describing, so you felt, however erroneously, that you had some feeling of what it would have been like to be black and live under apartheid. I have never read a book or an article that has got anywhere near what those actors brought to their work. You were left shattered. Have either of you ever had your minds changed by a play? DH: I saw a David Mamet play that made me realise I’d been swindled in the street. I went: “Oh I see, it wasn’t out of the generosity of my heart that I gave that person $10, they swindled it out of me” – and now I understand the trick. This is what theatre does. It makes you open up and say: “I see because the model of what was happening has now been explained.” JG: Every play accesses a world of thought or opinion I wouldn’t have otherwise had access to, and I’m sure that changes me on a microscopic level… How much do you set out to change the way people think? JG: I’m not trying to bring people round to my way of thinking because I often won’t know what I think myself. With Quiz [a play that explores our nation’s obsession with gameshows] I don’t necessarily want anyone to leave the theatre thinking something different. It is an exercise, an explanation about who we are on a multi-tiered level. DH: My agent or ex-agent – he is 90 – Tom Erhardt always told me that when he was growing up, in the American midwest, he thought that, as a gay boy, he was mad until he saw a play of Tennessee Williams’s and then he went: “OK, I am not mad, there are people in the world who have the same feelings I do.” That is what theatre does – it moves people in that they go: “I thought I was alone in thinking that, then suddenly I see it represented on stage.” What have audiences taught you over the years? JG: You sit there as a writer and I think you can feel the moment when you just slightly lose an audience. The collective experience is hard to understand or define and hard to control. But you become very aware – as if the temperature had changed in the room and you just know… you might not know what the problem is, or how to fix it, but you know when it is there. Do you agree with that? DH: Yes, I’m hysterically aware and, in theory, committed to believing in the wisdom of the audience. It’s like democracy – they must make the right decisions. Yet sometimes you see some great masterpiece and the audience is bored stiff. And so audiences – whether they are wise or not – confuse me. Would either of you describe yourself as cynical or is it essential, as writers, to keep an open mind? JG: What I worry about for myself is that I can already feel myself being exhausted by the world. DH: The difference between what you’re describing and what I feel (I read your article about courtesy and the public discourse ) is that I was brought up to be adversarial. If you were brought up in the 60s, then you thought that the charade of British life was so ridiculous and you were against the Vietnam war, and it was such an outrage that you had to be adversarial in your thinking. When my generation of playwrights first went into the theatre, the critics tried to destroy us. They hated us. I had Bernard Levin on my case for 20 years. He ended one review saying: “I just wish David Hare would go away.” There was this feeling of these horrible young men are coming to take the theatre over and destroy it, whereas now when a young person writes a play, they’re welcomed – there is a feeling of: “It may not be very good, but I’ll give it three stars.” The new play culture is broadly approving. You have grumbled about “quietism” in our society now. What should replace it? DH: Things have changed a great deal. I share James’s fear of a predictable culture war in which everyone takes up adversarial positions that are crass. That I tend to attribute to social media I am afraid. JG: I absolutely agree. I perhaps overemphasise the desire to return to politeness and courtesy, but what I really feel is the fear of a retreat into simplicity and fake fundamentalism in political debate. Have you found politicians are willing to talk to you? DH: People will happily talk to playwrights because they know their views will not be attributed and so they can be honest and not just politicians – I am talking about people in all walks of life. Do politicians ever respond badly to your plays? DH: Oh yes. JG: All the time. Not about stuff that would excite me. People have complained about ties, shoes and wigs – I don’t think Michael Heseltine liked his wig in This House. But they’ve never come to me to say that I misrepresented their worldview. Have you had that? DH: Oh yes. I don’t think Jack Straw was a natural fan of Stuff Happens. In fact, there were a lot of politicians who were not fans of Stuff Happens. What is coming next, James? DH: Yes – what are the next three plays, James?! JG: The truth is, I actually don’t know – for the first time – and it is glorious. I’m going to try and do more TV and film because I find the process interesting, although nothing can compete with the collective joy of making a play.

The billionaire owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge said he was “sad” he had not received recognition for paying £363m into the BHS pension scheme last year, in a move that headed off the threat of him losing his knighthood. Asked in an interview with the Mail on Sunday if any of the BHS furore was his fault, he said: “No. Zero. Nothing.” Green owned BHS for 15 years before selling it to serial bankrupt Dominic Chappell for £1 in 2015 – a year before the retailer collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs. Green and other investors were paid £586m in dividends, rent and interest during their ownership of the retailer. Referring to BHS, Green added: “We didn’t go as a vulture and bankrupt it, try to keep it all to ourselves. That was the stupidity. Trying to do it the correct way turned out to be a disaster.” Claiming that he spent £35m on the legal bill alone for dealing with the BHS collapse, he said: “My family lost millions on BHS.” He added: “I and our board were wholly misled by everyone involved with [Chappell]. Was it the worst mistake of my life? Yes, it was. Horrible. Ugly.” Following a parliamentary investigation into the BHS collapse, the businessman was labelled by MPs the “unacceptable face of capitalism” and accused of the “systematic plunder” of the company, along with Chappell and their “hangers-on”. Under pressure from the Pensions Regulator, Green agreed to pay £363m into the BHS pension scheme in February 2017 to help plug its £571m black hole. He feels he deserves more credit for this. “I wrote a cheque for £363m,” he told the Mail on Sunday. “But nobody has ever said, this man behaved like a gentleman, his family behaved properly. I’m not doing this as an act for you because you know it’s not my style – but I’m sad that there’s no acceptance of that.” He added: “Fortunately, we were able to pay and rectify it. I was pleased we were able to resolve it.” Green questioned whether antisemitism played a role in the accusations. “Do I think the viciousness has anything to do with the fact that I am a Jewish businessman? Well, I’m not going to say. The answer is I don’t want to get into it.” He came under fire for cruising the Mediterranean in his wife Tina’s £100m yacht Lionheart in the summer after the BHS collapse while BHS pensioners worried about their future. His wife is also the legal owner of Green’s business empire (since 2004). The couple’s lavish lifestyle has frequently drawn criticism. Green defended his lifestyle, saying it was the result of his business successes. “I feel like I’ve got to justify I had the ability to pay, that my family has got a yacht, that I’m living a nice lifestyle. Thank goodness, along my journey, I was very successful and therefore I was able to pay.” He did not accept the yacht was extravagant. “I don’t think it’s grand living [on the yacht], I’m sorry. You’re saying I have been successful and I should have to apologise for that?” Green also accused Frank Field, the chair of the work and pensions committee that led the investigation into BHS, of a personal vendetta. The Pensions Regulator’s report showed he had made a number of earlier offers before a final deal was reached, but Green’s view is that Field “harassed the Pension Regulator” and that this delayed the payment, according to the Mail on Sunday. The collapse of BHS in April 2016 was one of Britain’s biggest business scandals and led to calls from MPs that Green should be stripped of his knighthood. Unlike Chappell, Green escaped a ban from serving as a company director by the Insolvency Service last month."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/15/newcastle-united-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T14:28:01Z","webTitle":"Newcastle United v Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/15/newcastle-united-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/15/newcastle-united-v-arsenal-premier-league-live","fields":{"headline":"Newcastle United v Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened","bodyText":"There we go then. Newcastle have won four in a row – a brilliant run for them and one that currently looks like nailing them a top-half place. Relegation is no longer a concern. Arsenal may have other priorities but Burnley, in seventh, are only two points behind them and they won’t want to take their eye off the ball too any more times. They might consider a draw would have been fair here but didn’t really turn up creatively in the second half and were punished. Newcastle, high in tempo and thrust, punished them. That’s all from me – join Rob Smyth for Manchester United v West Brom! A roar goes up! That’s a huge win for Newcastle – they are definitely, incontrovertibly safe! 90+2 min: Slimani gets a booking, I think for timewasting. Nobody really minds. Kenedy bashes a Monreal cross away and a Welbeck blast is blocked. Then Joselu wins a free-kick on halfway and that may more or less be that ... 90+1 min: We have three minutes of added time to play ... 90 min: Newcastle are close now and their stadium is thumping with nervous energy. Arsenal are undercooking a few of their passes and don’t really look crisp enough for a breakthrough. That getting-the-ball-to-the-strikers issue has actually been a thing in this half. 88 min: It’s all Arsenal probing now, trying to pick a way through, but Newcastle look solid on the whole. 86 min: Murphy replaces Ritchie for Newcastle, while young striker Nketiah is on for Iwobi. 85 min: That’s a half-sight for Arsenal, Iwobi denied very well by a sliding defender ... before Dubravka flaps at a high ball and Lacazette, recovering quickly, smacks wide when Welbeck is screaming for it. 83 min: They do win a corner though, which Xhaka outswings from the left. It’s low, miscued and deeply disappointing – just like Elneny’s subsequent 35-yard pot shot, which was never on at all. 82 min: Maitland-Niles wins a fun chase down the left with Slimani. Arsenal are, in general, pushing Newcastle back a bit now though – without really threatening. 79 min: Maitland-Niles replaces Chambers for Arsenal, while Newcastle bring Joselu on for Perez. 77 min: Another Newcastle chance! Slimani, brilliant since he came on, powers down the left, beats Mustafi and lays off to Perez, who doesn’t quite get control of the ball at an angle and eventually slides to put it wide of the near post. 77 min: Dubravka is out confidently to claim a Xhaka corner. No real response from Arsenal yet. 75 min: ... Kenedy hits the bar! He’s sprung clear again by a neat interplay with Slimani and his effort, deflected by a lunging defender, loops up onto the frame and away. That could have been that! 74 min: Kenedy breaks down the left and for a moment looks as if he might tee up Perez in the middle, but he shows too much of the ball to Holding, and then ... 72 min: What have Arsenal got now, I wonder. Their away form has been so insipid for most of the season. Not that they’ve been bad today, especially given the changes – I must admit the goal from Ritchie came out of the blue. But they don’t really want to give Burnley, in seventh, too much encouragement by losing here. If they lost to Atletico *and* lost sixth ... That came from nowhere! Slimani leaps to win one header, then launches himself to power into another, and Perez leaves the ball astutely to give Ritchie space inside the area. He finishes confidently with his weaker right foot and Newcastle are ahead! 68 min: Willock, tidy on his top-flight bow, is replaced by that guy Welbeck. 67 min: Decent dig from Iwobi, who can’t find Lacazette with his first attempt but gets the ball straight back and smashes low from 20 yards. It doesn’t go far wide of Dubravka’s near post. 65 min: Good early touches from Slimani, the second seeing him blocked by Mustafi. He’s had injury issues since joining from Leicester but is now fit and should give them some interesting presence in the last 25. Ritchie blasts over from range during these musings. 63 min: A change for Newcastle now, with Gayle – who has worked very hard and did well for the goal – replaced by Slimani. 61 min: “One of the ways that Benítez has out-tacticked Wenger is to shove people up against Elneny, who’s been hemmed in and has had nothing like the influence he’s had over his last couple of games,” notes Charles Antaki. “It’s true that Willock has been no help, but as the commentators keep telling us, he’s only 13.” A late Ritchie challenge on Monreal temporarily raises the volume, meanwhile. 58 min: Maybe this game needs Welbz. Excellent goal from him on Thursday, in fairness. I was sitting yards from it and he looked so strong in the move leading up to it. The finish, too, was superb. 56 min: Those Perez spurts aside there really isn’t a lot going on, though Aubameyang heads a deep Chambers delivery across goal only for a black &amp; white shirt to stop it reaching Lacazette. 53 min: Perez spurns another decent position after another fine Shelvey pass from range, allowing Mustafi to beat him in a winnable one-on-one. 51 min: An excellent Diame interception sends Perez scurrying away into some gaping space in the Arsenal half, but he never really gets his head up despite men dashing up to support and Xhaka gets back to dispossess him before any trouble can unfold. 50 min: Scrappy stuff at the moment, Arsenal snatching at a few things in their own half but Newcastle not putting a lot together when they get the ball. 47 min: It’s mainly Arsenal possession early on, a Monreal cross eventually being defended before Iwobi is penalised for handball. Another goal or two in this one, I reckon. “If Jonjo Shelvey can cause this many problems with through balls to Dwight Gayle, imagine what he could do playing with Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford. Are we really going to pass up that option for the sake of Henderson, Dier and Livermore?” asks Shaun Wilkinson. It’s an interesting question. Is there sometimes too much focus on what Shelvey *doesn’t* do? That is indeed the half and it’s been enjoyable. We’ve seen very nice goals from Lacazette and Perez, both the results of excellent passes from 60 yards or so back, and a flurry of other activity on top. Arsenal should probably have put away one of the chances they created in the five minutes before half-time, but it’s a good scrap and we’ll see much more of it in 15 minutes. Back shortly! 45 min: Nearing half-time now. It’s been a fun half, better than I’d expected to be honest. 42 min: And that should definitely be 2-1! Elneny forces an error from Diame and now Lacazette has a run towards the area with men either side. He could even have a crack at goal himself but instead passes left to Willock, who misses his shot completely. Elneny, coming up on the other side, was in an even better position to score. 41 min: Now Chambers gets a free header from a Xhaka corner, and might do better than head over once he meets it. 39 min: ... which should lead to a second goal. Aubameyang puts the free-kick into the wall but Xhaka picks the ball back up and chips it to the far post where ... I think ... Mustafi is stationed to head across. He does so and Chambers, running in from an almost identical position to Lacazette earlier, slices well wide! 38 min: Lejeune steams out to nip in ahead of Iwobi but instead bundles him over and Arsenal have a dangerous, central 25-yard free-kick ... 37 min: Seeing the goal again, such a sharp finish by Perez but Mustafi was motionless at the near post there and let his opponent get a run on him. That’s happened before. 34 min: Shelvey’s radar finds Gayle yet *again* and, although nothing comes of it, he looks bang on point today – in open play anyway. 33 min: Perez tricks right to the line, and almost up to goal, but his drilled centre is hacked away. Chambers didn’t like being run at there. That is a lovely goal! Shelvey puts the ball on a sixpence for Gayle again, spraying it 50 yards right onto his foot, and this time the striker brings it down superbly. He has the presence of mind to spread right to Yedlin, whose low first-time cross is cracked home at the near post by Perez. It was sharp and slick all round, that – we’ve now seen two goals that show back-to-front football can be just as pleasing as anything. 28 min: Now a Newcastle corner as Mustafi stops Gayle, set away by an early Shelvey pass, from causing too much trouble. It’s a good delivery by Kenedy but well defended by, I think, Holding. 27 min: A smart Arsenal move and whipped ball in from Chambers, who has been good at right-back so far, demand an urgent intervention from Lascelles. Corner. It’s put in by Xhaka but somebody at the near post glances it beyond everyone. 25 min: Aubameyang gets far too much space to turn and shoot, but slips, to some mild jeers. 24 min: Newcastle really haven’t threatened since the goal. Arsenal are enjoying the possession now and look broadly in control. Chambers does well to defend a Diame cross ahead of Gayle as a type, mind you. 21 min: Iwobi, found in space after a throw-in by a sharp flick from the excellent Aubameyang, cleverly finds himself enough space to stab a shot at goal but Dubravka is onto it. 19 min: That Aubameyang shot deflected over off Lascelles’ outstretched arm, by the way, replays show. It may well have snicked the ball off target. Seen penalties given for those. 18 min: ... which comes to nothing. Lively stuff here at the moment though. 17 min: Chambers fells Kenedy and Newcastle have a free-kick just beyond the left corner of the Arsenal box. It’s a decent chance to have a stab at equalising ... but Shelvey’s set-piece is neither fish nor fowl and straight at Cech. Straight down the other end and Aubameyang jinks inside, firing over via a deflection. Corner ... They got them the ball then! Mustafi plays a Lejeune-esque 60-yard pass to Aubameyang, who controls brilliantly as he runs through on the inside-left. He drills across goal, weighting it perfectly for Lacazette to arrive and thud home. Arsenal are ahead! 13 min: Mesut Ozil has the afternoon off here and you wonder how that’ll impact on Arsenal’s creativity. All very well having Aubameyang and Lacazette but you need to get them the ball. Newcastle are doing rather better at finding their front men so far, Lejeune with two delightful long switches from back to front already. 9 min: Ritchie makes a diagonal run and pops the ball sharply into Kenedy, who is in form and thus confident enough to spin and crack in 35-yard left footer towards goal. But it won’t bother Cech, who drops onto it easily enough. 7 min: Holding stops Perez breaking through after a Gayle burst put Newcastle on the front foot again. No clear chances yet but plenty of energy and the home side’s tempo is decent. 5 min: Lacazette spins smartly onto an Elneny pass, completely losing Lascelles, but can’t get enough on his shot and drags well wide. 3 min: Newcastle keep pushing and win a corner, Mustafi having to head an arrowed Shelvey free-kick behind. It’s worked short and eventually ends up with Shelvey overhitting his cross. 1 min: Good start from Newcastle, forcing a couple of hasty clearances in the Arsenal box. It’s a glorious afternoon, and Newcastle get these two form horses underway. Arsenal, in blue, kick left to right. The teams are out in Newcastle ... it’s almost time ... Wenger on Willock: “In training he does well but the real step is in the competition, you have to produce what you can do. It’s a good opportunity, I had in my head to give him a chance before the end of the season and he gets one today. Most of the time you can see in a player’s first game if he is right at this level.” By the by, tenth-placed Newcastle have lost four more matches than they’ve won. This is *not* a criticism of them – but it’s not been a very good Premier League this season, has it? Rafa says: “It will be massive for us to win, a great achievement, but let’s see what happens. I don’t like to talk in this way [to speak of four wins in a row].” He seems more concerned with staying up, still. They’re safe regarding some staggering twists, to be fair, but a win would make one zillion percent certain. Wolves – or rather Newly Promoted Wolves – are a goal up at half-time against Definitely Not Newly Promoted Birmingham and you can follow that one with Rob Smyth here: So the headlines there are that Aubameyang and Lacazette both start for Arsenal – and there is a full Premier League debut for the very talented 18-year-old, Joe Willock. Thursdays night’s hero Danny Welbeck gets a rest. I’ll let all this sink in for a few minutes – so get your emails in. Newcastle fans, has this season gone better than you might have expected? Arsenal fans, is it simply about Atletico now? Newcastle: Dubravka, Yedlin, Lascelles, Lejeune, Dummett, Ritchie, Diame, Shelvey, Kenedy, Perez, Gayle. Subs: Clark, Murphy, Slimani, Hayden, Manquillo, Joselu, Darlow. Arsenal: Cech, Chambers, Mustafi, Holding, Monreal, Elneny, Xhaka, Iwobi, Willock, Aubameyang, Lacazette. Subs: Mertesacker, Ospina, Welbeck, Maitland-Niles, Kolasinac, Nelson, Nketiah. Referee: Anthony Taylor On Sky they are currently showing highlights of the brilliant, remarkable edition of this fixture in 2011 that of course went from 0-4 to 4-4, topped off by a wonder volley from the late Cheick Tiote. Relive what our man there on the day, Paul Wilson, wrote: Welcome to a match upon which ... nothing very much hangs, really. But let’s not allow that to get in our way ... For Newcastle it would be very nice to use this game in hand for good and make a serious play for ninth place, perhaps even eighth, and make this an ultimately very satisfying first season back – especially considering the fact Rafa Benitez hasn’t had nearly enough of the transfer market support he wanted. They are on a very nice three-match winning run, their best since August-September, so three points here would make for their best streak of the campaign. For Arsenal it’s all about getting nice and trim for Atletico Madrid, really, and you’d expect a change or two after that long trip to Russia on Thursday night. But they’re on a very heartening run of their own and it would do no harm to keep it going up on Tyneside even if everything hangs – realistically – on making sure everything is set up properly for a season-defining crack at one of Europe’s elite forces. So what’s it to be? We’ll find out across the next three hours.

Callum Hawkins was leading the marathon by almost two minutes and was less than two miles from the finish when he collapsed from heat exhaustion in 30 degree heat. The 25-year-old, who finished fourth at the World Championships marathon in London last summer, had looked set for gold but he began to sway in distress and fell over on the curb. He managed to rouse himself and briefly continued but supported himself several times using the metal barriers lining the course. But he collapsed again shortly afterwards, hitting his head on one of the roadside barriers. Hawkins was taken to hospital and is sitting up and talking with no obvious long term damage done but fellow athletes and former athletes were damning of how long it took for professional assistance to arrive. Marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe tweeted that there were “big questions” for the local organising committee and medical staff. “That should never happen,” she said. Some spectators even took pictures of a stricken Hawkins with nobody seeming to offer any help. Commentating on the BBC, former middle distance runner Steve Cram said it was “a disgrace” that it took so long for any paramedics to attend to Hawkins. “I’m just concerned for his welfare,” Cram said, “He hit his head on the barrier. I’m sorry if you’re watching this at home, it’s really distressing. He’s going to hurt himself and there’s nobody anywhere near. We should have some more medical attention.” “This is a guy in real distress and someone needs to recognise it for his health at this point. Where on earth is the help? You cannot just wait at the finish line. They’ve got radios. And finally somebody arrives. I think it’s disgraceful.” Mark Peters, Gold Coast 2018 chief executive, said: “I like many others was distressed to see a wonderful athlete like Callum collapse during the closing stages of today’s marathon. We are offering every assistance possible to Callum and Team Scotland.” “Gold Coast 2018 has put in place a wide range of measures to ensure athlete welfare and the response of medical staff this morning was within agreed response guidelines and timeframes. I was also concerned about the behaviour of a small number of bystanders who chose to take images. This is not in keeping with the spirit of Gold Coast 2018.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/15/vote-leave-spending-whistleblower-threatens-sue-downing-street-outing-him","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T07:05:06Z","webTitle":"I’ll sue No 10 for outing me, says sacked EU vote whistleblower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/15/vote-leave-spending-whistleblower-threatens-sue-downing-street-outing-him","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/15/vote-leave-spending-whistleblower-threatens-sue-downing-street-outing-him","fields":{"headline":"I’ll sue No 10 for outing me, says sacked EU vote whistleblower","bodyText":"EU vote whistleblower Shahmir Sanni says he wants to take legal action against No 10 Downing Street for outing him as gay. The 24-year-old volunteer last month revealed that spending rules may have been manipulated by the Vote Leave campaign during the EU referendum. On 23 March, an official spokesperson for the prime minister issued an announcement on behalf of one of her advisers, Stephen Parkinson. The statement sought to deny the claims relating to electoral law and seemed to deflect criticism for Parkinson’s own involvement as a senior director of the Vote Leave campaign by revealing that he and Sanni had formerly been in a relationship for 18 months. On Friday, Sanni lost his job at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, an organisation founded by Matthew Elliott, the CEO of Vote Leave, and said he now has “nothing left to lose”. Whistleblowers are protected by law under the Public Interest Disclosure Act but Sanni was summoned to a meeting at the TaxPayers’ Alliance and told his employment had been terminated with immediate effect. “It’s been so much to deal with. I’ve had to cope with the repercussions on me and my family of being outed against my will and now I’ve lost the job. It’d be a lot for anyone to cope with,” he said. Asked how he felt about the fact that it was an official statement from the prime minister’s office that revealed he was gay, he said: “I’ve actually tried not to think about it. Because every time I do, it sends me into a spiral of anxiety and upset. “I had this opportunity to tell people about what actually happened inside the campaign and they were so scared, they did whatever it took to shut me down. They knew it would implicate Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and two of Theresa May’s senior staff. They threw me to the dogs to stop people actually listening to what I had to say. And the truly upsetting thing is that it worked. They smeared me and they shut me down.” He said the experience had been a brutal insight into the inner workings of government and power. “I really wouldn’t want anyone else to go through this. It’s been a trauma, that’s all I can call it.” Sanni said he currently had £60 in his bank account and has no way to even pay his next month’s rent. “I was asked on Friday what my advice would be to other potential whistleblowers, and I said, ‘Honestly. Don’t do it.’” He said it had been a profoundly depressing and distressing experience. “I have been stripped of everything.” Tamsin Allen, his solicitor, said Sanni is entitled to the protection of the Convention on Human Rights, which says that public bodies such as the office of the prime minister should respect the privacy rights of individuals. “They had absolutely no business disclosing this information,” she said. She added that he had brought potential illegal conduct to the attention of the authorities, which was a “protected disclosure” and under British law could not be used as a reason to dismiss him from his job. “Whistleblowers often face negative consequences but the consequences for Shahmir have been extreme and deeply unfair. He needs support in bringing these claims so he can rebuild his life.” She said a CrowdJustice campaign was being launched to help him do so. No 10 Downing Street declined to respond to questions about why it had chosen to disclose Sanni’s sexuality or whose decision it had been. John O’Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “We don’t discuss internal staffing matters in public. They are between employer and employees.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/15/martin-sorrell-stands-to-pick-up-20m-as-wpp-faces-possible-break-up","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T13:48:03Z","webTitle":"Martin Sorrell stands to pick up £20m as WPP faces possible breakup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/15/martin-sorrell-stands-to-pick-up-20m-as-wpp-faces-possible-break-up","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/15/martin-sorrell-stands-to-pick-up-20m-as-wpp-faces-possible-break-up","fields":{"headline":"Martin Sorrell stands to pick up £20m as WPP faces possible breakup","bodyText":"Sir Martin Sorrell is in line for almost £20m in payouts from WPP over the next five years, as part of the deal struck to leave the advertising group he founded more than three decades ago. The departure of Sorrell, who resigned on Saturday before learning the findings of an internal investigation into alleged personal misconduct, is also being viewed as a potential catalyst for a breakup of WPP. The world’s largest advertising group said its founder and chief executive would be treated as having retired from the company. This means Sorrell will be eligible to receive payouts related to 1.6m shares in a number of award plans that will vest over the next five years. The exact value depends on the company’s performance. At WPP’s current share price of £12 the awards are worth about £19m. WPP has said the investigation into Sorrell, 73, who rejected the allegation of misconduct “unreservedly”, has concluded. The law firm in charge of the investigation, WilmerHale, was due to deliver its findings to the board by next Friday but details of the misconduct allegation and the outcome of the probe will not be made public. The allegations are the improper use of company funds, and improper personal behaviour. Sorrell’s final full-year pay as chief executive for 2017 will be made public when WPP publishes its annual report in about a month. He is thought to be receiving between £13m and £15m, the lower end of a maximum of £19m he could have earned due to the company reporting its worst performance since 2009. Sorrell is one of the UK’s best-paid business leaders, earning more than £200m from pay and lucrative – and highly controversial – reward schemes in the past five years alone. His £70m payout in 2015, was one of the biggest in UK corporate history. Sorrell and his family trust also own a stake of about 1.8% in WPP, worth about £250m. In an email to staff, Sorrell wrote: “I shall miss all of you greatly. As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that.” To fill the leadership vacuum while a successor is found, Roberto Quarta, the WPP chairman, will take on the role of executive chairman. In addition, Mark Read, the chief executive of Wunderman and WPP Digital, and Andrew Scott, a top executive at WPP’s European operation, have been appointed chief operating officers. This would make them the frontrunning internal candidates to take over from Sorrell, as the board also readies to reach out to its “constantly refined list of external candidates”. “The succession arrangements look like a sticking plaster and, until strong and credible long-term leadership arrangements emerge, there will be concerns about the sustainability of the WPP Group, as we know it today, and its strategic direction,” said Guy Jubb, former global head of governance and stewardship at Standard Life Investments, an investor in WPP. Analysts believe Sorrell’s departure combined with a share price slump of almost a third over the past year means investors and the WPP board will have to consider that there is potentially more value in breaking up WPP. “The question to Quarta is how do we create shareholder value from this position. I think most analysts and investors when adding up the sum of the parts of WPP would answer that it is to break it up,” said Alex DeGroote, an analyst with Cenkos Securities. The company’s board is already running the rule over whether it should explore a sale of Kantar, its market research arm, which could be worth £3bn. Beyond its marketing services and PR operations – of which WPP’s global media agency powerhouses such as MediaCom have been the engine of its profits and revenue growth – DeGroote says there is a “treasure trove of hidden value” on WPP’s balance sheet worth billions of pounds that is not reflected in its core profits. He estimates there is £1bn of property and £1.1bn of equity investments in companies including Vice, digital firm AppNexus, measurement company comScore and advertising group Chime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/15/defiant-assad-praises-moscow-putin-criticises-west-strikes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T11:28:40Z","webTitle":"Putin criticises west's strikes as defiant Assad praises Moscow","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/15/defiant-assad-praises-moscow-putin-criticises-west-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/15/defiant-assad-praises-moscow-putin-criticises-west-strikes","fields":{"headline":"Putin criticises west's strikes as defiant Assad praises Moscow","bodyText":"Bashar al-Assad has struck a defiant tone as he welcomed a Russian delegation just one day after a US-led coalition launched missile strikes against Syria, praising Moscow’s military support and declaring Syria would stand its ground against the “agenda imposed by the west”. Vladimir Putin has criticised the strikes launched by the US, UK and France as an “act of aggression”. But with a direct clash between Russia and the US unlikely, Moscow may look for other ways to strike back at the west, using Russia’s status as superpower spoiler to undermine key goals of US foreign policy. There are a number of ways that Russia could cause problems for the US and its allies abroad by providing more advanced arms to Syria or helping North Korea flout sanctions, as well as heating up the Ukraine crisis, launching cyberattacks or upping support for rightwing populist politicians across Europe. But Moscow may opt not to escalate, as it did not after the US cruise missile strike on the Shayrat airbase in 2017, recognising that the strikes were a one-off largely designed to send a political message and would not have a long-term impact on Assad’s prospects or the war in Syria. That would leave the door open to another prize that analysts say Russia wants at the moment: a public summit between Putin and Donald Trump like the one the US president had proposed in a phone call last month, which could change, or at least marginally improve, the dynamic in Moscow’s favour. From a simple point of view, Saturday’s missile strikes appear to be the latest escalation on Syria’s crowded battlefield, where a half-dozen countries and their proxies are jostling for influence and territory. Moscow’s nominal response was to convene a UN security council session to condemn the strikes (its resolution failed to pass) and threaten to sell advanced Russian S-300 air defence systems to Syria and other countries, deterring interventions in Syria for states such as Israel. Sanctions are another possibile response. Russian lawmakers are already proposing countermeasures to US sanctions earlier this month that targeted businessmen close to Putin and sent Russian stocks tumbling. Russia may block access to its market for imports of food and drink or target companies such as Boeing by banning titanium exports. But Moscow lacks the economic heft to inflict equal pain through sanctions and some ideas proposed by lawmakers sound outlandish, like allowing Russian firms to pirate US products by ignoring intellectual property law. Other possible responses include the use of cyber-weapons, which have increasingly played a role in the jousting between Russia and the west since 2014, with hackers cracking power grids and other key infrastructure, leaking sensitive political information and stealing private communications between government officials. Earlier this year, the UK government publicly accused Russia of launching the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack that crippled key infrastructure and firms across Europe, including some hospitals in the UK. The defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, accused Russia in February of “ripping up the rulebook”. “We have entered a new era of warfare, witnessing a destructive and deadly mix of conventional military might and malicious cyber-attacks,” he warned. Through its proxies, Russia could also seek to put pressure on US troops who are fighting in Syria alongside opposition forces. But that could also put Russians at risk. Earlier this week, the CIA director Mike Pompeo told the Senate that US forces had killed “a couple hundred” Russian mercenaries in a shadowy clash that had taken place in February. Despite the heated rhetoric, Saturday’s strike may paradoxically signal a de-escalation. There was a sense of relief in Moscow, and one of defiance in Syria, as it became clear that the strikes would be limited to three sites in Syria linked to chemical weapons production. Seen in context, the attack concluded a tense public negotiation that allowed the US and other western countries to respond to the Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons without sparking an all-out war with Russia. After the strikes, all sides declared victory. Analysts, some who serve Russia in advisory capacities, said this week that a direct military response from Moscow would be extremely unlikely unless Russia’s red line – a threat to its soldiers in Syria – were crossed. Russia could likely brush off the attack, they said, publicly complaining but privately staying its course in Syria that has seen the Assad regime brought back from near defeat. A limited response could keep a meeting with Trump on the table, they said, and the US leader’s unpredictability meant that could provide a very attractive upside. “We’ll buzz your ships,” one said of Moscow’s expected retaliation. “I don’t think we’re about to sink the USS Cook.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/15/child-abuse-inquiry-lawyer-labours-rule-in-rochdale-toxic","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T14:38:08Z","webTitle":"Child abuse inquiry lawyer: Labour's rule in Rochdale 'toxic'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/child-abuse-inquiry-lawyer-labours-rule-in-rochdale-toxic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/child-abuse-inquiry-lawyer-labours-rule-in-rochdale-toxic","fields":{"headline":"Child abuse inquiry lawyer: Labour's rule in Rochdale 'toxic'","bodyText":"Rochdale’s “toxic” political leadership must be overhauled for the town to move on from decades of institutional failure on child sexual abuse, the lead solicitor for victims at the official inquiry has said. Richard Scorer, who represented victims at the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IISCA), said Labour had allowed Rochdale’s political leaders to act in a “dysfunctional bubble”. “If Rochdale is going to be able to move forward there has to be changes at the political leadership level,” he said. His comments came after Richard Farnell, who recently resigned as leader of the council, was accused of lying under oath about his knowledge of child sexual abuse at the now-closed Knowl View school. Farnell was branded “shameless” for his refusal to take personal responsibility for the abuse, which happened during his first stint as town hall leader between 1986 and 1992. The councillor, who was suspended by the Labour party on Thursday amid a possible police investigation into perjury, has denied lying to the inquiry and insisted he was not informed about abuse at Knowl View during his time as leader. He resigned from his second stint as leader in December after criticism of his evidence to the inquiry in October last year. However, Farnell’s successor, the former deputy leader, Allen Brett, has also been criticised by some fellow Labour councillors for representing “no change” to the political regime. His appointment triggered the resignation of Donna Martin, the deputy leader, and two councillors from the town hall cabinet. Brett, a long-serving councillor who has held a number of senior positions on Rochdale council, previously backed Farnell over his evidence to the IICSA. Speaking after his appointment in December, he said people “should believe what has been said” by Farnell and that he hoped the inquiry would show that “what Richard said was true”. Brett refused to discuss the Rochdale abuse inquiry, or say whether he stood by his remarks on Farnell, when contacted by the Guardian. In a press release, Brett said he realised “it was wrong of me to pre-empty the inquiry”. He said Farnell “should now personally reflect on the report” and apologised to victims who had been “let down by people who should have been protecting you”. But Scorer said Brett’s pre-empting of the inquiry, as well as the fact Farnell stayed in post for two months after his much-criticised evidence, “confirms the problem of the political culture” in Rochdale. He praised the work of Gail Hopper, the council’s director of children’s services, but said those improvements were being undermined by the council’s political leadership. “In the very recent past the social services and education teams have tried to make improvements but I think what’s apparent from this report is that Rochdale still has a very toxic culture among its political leadership,” Scorer said. “Labour are now the controlling party. They’ve allowed Rochdale to operate in its own dysfunctional bubble and that now needs to come to an end. They still have a problem at the political leadership level.” Farnell strongly denied lying to the inquiry. He said there was “not one single letter, memo, report, council minute or briefing note addressed to me informing me about the events at Knowl View” and that he was deeply sorry for the “grave mistakes made and the unacceptable failings” of the council during his leadership."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/live/2018/apr/15/celtic-v-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T15:29:15Z","webTitle":"Celtic v Rangers: Scottish Cup semi-final – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/apr/15/celtic-v-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/live/2018/apr/15/celtic-v-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-live","fields":{"headline":"Celtic v Rangers: Scottish Cup semi-final – as it happened","bodyText":"Anyway, enjoy the rest of the weekend – bye. So there we go. That’s that, but there’s more football to be had here with Rob Smyth, who’s bringing you Man United v West Brom. As bad as Rangers were, Celtic were excellent. Ntcham controlled midfield, getting plenty of ball to Rogic, Forrest and McGregor, while Dembele was far too much for Martin and McCrorie to handle. It’ll take something very special from Motherwell to deny them the double treble. It’ll take something very special from everyone to deny them it again next season. Celtic will play Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final! 90+3 min Basically, 4-0 is a result for them. It could’ve been a lot worse. 90+1 min It’s not at all easy to understand this Rangers performance. The players were cheering when they drew Celtic which suggested renewed intensity and intention, but they’ve turned up here and pretty much waited to lose. And in saying that I don’t mean they haven’t kicked people, more that they haven’t made Celtic fight for it - they haven’t run hard enough for the second balls, haven’t concentrated hard enough to be in the right places, and haven’t been composed enough to pass intelligently. They’ve been awful. 90 min There’ll be three added minutes. 89 min Alves is down and doesn’t look able to continue, except Rangers have used all three subs. 87 min Every time Celtic step up the pace, we see the gulf in class. Brown is really enjoying himself, spraying passes about, and after he sends one right, Ntcham squares it back inside for McGregor, who picks a slide for Tierney down the left. He hits the line and cuts back, and though he doesn’t pick out a man, the ball rolls into the path of McGregor, who spanks a shot just over the top. Celtic are enjoying this, playing with the freedom of a side who who’d struggle to lose even if they started scoring deliberate own goals. 85 min Celtic are about to go 10 games unbeaten against Rangers. The Rangers section of the ground is very close to empty, and with good reason: this isn’t just about this game, but about the impending doom of the double treble, never mind what might happen next season. The last Old Firm match suggested that next season might be competitive; this one does not suggest that as any kind of remote possibility. It’s been a total no-show from the Bears. 83 min Gratifyingly, Sky Go on the phone has now gone down – I apologise for the lack of detail in the last few posts. Dembele passes his honour, and Ntcham doesn’t mess about, smacking past Foderingham. Holt fouls Roberts in the box, and this might get messy yet! 77 min In the last 10 derbies, Rangers have led for a total of 48 minutes. Ouch. 77 min Sinclair is doing his best to keep the tempo high - he’s playing like a man who wants his place back, and he makes ground down the left before clipping a cut-back behind Roberts. 75 min After that brief flurry which followed the red and penalty, Rangers haven’t been able to get forward at all. And as for young McCrorie, today has been a real lesson: football is hard, footballers are ruthless. But though I can’t even grasp how frazzled minds get under pressure, even he should’ve know better than to haul his man down in the box as he did. 73 min A change apiece: for Rangers, Holt replaces Dorrans, who’s done nothing; for Celtic, Roberts replaces Forrest. 71 min “I don’t understand why Celtic aren’t going for the jugular here,” says Paul. “The fans would like nothing better than a 6-0! I’ve seen these types of tactics from Rodgers before in OF matches where the game is safely won. Not good enough!” Not good enough? Football fans are never satisfied. I’m not actually sure this is on Rodgers, though – he’s not out there. The players know the game’s won, so perhaps they’ve dropped their intensity – I know as fans we think we’d run like mad for every second of every game, but it’s nonsense. If it wasn’t, we’d never see fighters gas. 69 min This is a relative rarity: a big derby match in which the result is settled with plenty of time remaining. I mean, I know these derby matches have been different lately, but it’s not the way of things generally and as you’d expect, Celtic aren’t wasting the opportunity, wading into Rangers with a right old racket. 67 min Sinclair runs at Alves, who brings him down. Celtic are now so confident that they don’t sling the free-kick into the box, instead taking a short one just to get their passing started again. 66 min Celtic take the sting out of things, knocking the ball around until they’re ready to attack, Ntcham squaring for McGregor who can’t quite slide the ball through for Dembele. 63 min And what’s this! Morelos and Brown and shoving each other round about the sternum. First Dorrans fouled McGregor pretty nastily, the ref played advantage and then Rangers won a free-kick, so Tierney lay on the ball forcing Morelos to yank it from him, forcing Brown to defend his young team-mate. Dorrans, Morelos and Brown were all booked. 62 min I guess Graeme Murty will have to take his share of the blame for this. He doesn’t have the player to compete, but maybe the team he picked sent the wrong message to his player: that they were there to defend and hope, not to compete and be aggressive. 61 min Rangers are playing with a bit more intensity now – funny thing, the prospect of public shame. Might they have foreseen this and acted sooner, at kick-off, say? 60 min Off goes Rogic, who’s done his bit; Sinclair is on. 60 min Oh this is lovely! Ntcham takes the ball outside the box, right side, and as he opens his body to move it inside, instead he guides a pass the other way for Forrest. Beautiful! Forrest hares onto it, but drags his shot wide of the far post. 57 min Have a look! Rangers are swinging like a desperate man, and just by putting the ball in the box, they’re causing problems. Lustig takes a wild swipe at a clearance, slices the ball behind at an improbable angle, and it canons the post, bouncing back to Morelos. He could shoot first time but reckons he’s got time so takes a touch to make sure, except when do you ever have time in the box? By the time he’s set to stick it away, men are around him, and his rushed effort is smothered by Gordon. 56 min Two more corners follow, but eventually the ball goes behind for a goalkick, which Gordon whacks downfield. 54 min It never rains! Great cross from Tavernier and Morelos is up between Boyata and Ajer, banging a header that Gordon tips over! Then, in comes the resultant corner and this time Alves is up, and again Gordon tips it away! 53 min Damage limitation for Rangers. Off goes Candeias, on comes Alves. I reckon they’d take 5-0 here... Foderingham dives to his left and Dembele dinks gently to his right. This is over, and for Rangers it may well get worse before it gets better! Dembele, who has victimised McCrorie something fierce, gets in behind down the left and McCrorie pulls him back just as he gets inside the box! What was he thinking?! 49 min Morelos and Candeias move down the right and Lustig heads away the latter’s cross. It’s much but it’s hope - Rangers are at least making an effort. 48 min In it comes from Candeias, but McCrorie’s leap is to no avail, Ajer thunking clear to set Celtic away on the break, so Docherty decides he’s no choice but to haul back Forrest and accept a booking. 47 min Tavernier, who’s probably been Rangers’ best player so far – such that there is one – advances down the right and wins a corner.... 46 min And off we go again... The players are back with us. So, how do Rangers get back into this? It’s hard to see them matching Celtic in midfield, so they need to get the ball wide and go from there, or get it forward quickly and go from there. Morelos needs to get on Boyata, who did not have a good game the last time these teams met, and he could also use some help from behind him. Half-time email: “Thanks for posting the highlights of the 1991 final,” emails Simon McMahon. “How about adding 1987, when probably the greatest Dundee United team ever, between the two legs of the UEFA Cup final against Gothenburg, managed to lose the Scottish Cup final to St. Mirren, or 1985, or 1988, when we led Celtic on both occasions with 15 minutes to play only to lose 2-1 in both games. Then there’s the 1984 European Cup semi against Roma which we managed to lose after winning the first leg 2-0. Thankfully we don’t get near cup finals these days.” Ha – by way of consolation, here’s a piece on Wee Jim and the rest. Half-time entertainment: one of sport’s more brilliant, ridiculous yarns and one to cheer up Rangers fans. Celtic have been far too good for Rangers. They’re faster to the ball, faster to second balls, and able to pass through midfield; inferiority in those aspects is why we’ve barely seen Morelos, Candeias, Dorrans and Murphy. 45+2 min Just looking down the Rangers team, we’ve barely seen any of the attacking players, but the ball goes wide and Candeias makes space to cross, but is low go is far too close to Gordon who dives forward to claim. 45 min There shall be two added minutes. 45 min Rangers wham it long. To zero avail. 44 min I guess there’s this ... or there’s the double treble. Unless Rangers can muster something spectacular, it’ll be one or t’other. 42 min The Celtic end of the ground is doing its nut, bouncing and hollering. Motherwell it is, then. 40 min Murty has seen enough. He hauls off Halliday, the presence of whom has not helped, and sends on Windass. He’ll need to do something special. This is beautifully taken, but the defending, dearie us. First, Candeias does nowt as Tierney tiptoes past him, and though his cross isn’t great, Martin can’t be arsed getting it away, instead placing a tame touch into the path of the onrushing McGregor who, from 12 yards, curls into the far corner, a third of the way up. 37 min But here comes Dembele, found down the left of the box and McCrorie is over quickly. Gulp. But this time he does well to see the ball away, thanks in part to help he receives from Tavernier. 36 min These last few minutes have been a bit better for Rangers. They haven;t looked like scoring, but have got jheir tootsies onto some green and white real estate, which is a start. 34 min Rangers win a corner down the left which Murphy boots into orbit. Gordon then comes, falls over, and McCrorie is penalised for fouling him. 33 min Celtic are all over this, and Ntcham, maybe the best player on the pitch so far, rifles a shot - Celtic’s seventh - wide of the far post. 33 min “Say what you like about the EPL, with all its money, class and quality,” says Michael George. “I left Newcastle-Arsenal at half-time to watch this, and won’t even bother with Man U-WBA. All we need is Rangers-Celtic every weekend!” Yes, it’s close to the list of things which never disappoint, and until now only contains world snooker and world darts. 31 min Tierney sorts Candeias and proceeds down the left, so Candeias catches up and barges him over. Things are warming nicely - I’d say we’re about twenty to rumble. 30 min Murphy, who’s been quiet, gets away from Lustig who yanks him down in short order. He’s booked, as he knew he would be. 28 min Dembele is banging McCrorie about here, holding the ball up and bringing others into play. He does precisely that for Forrest, who whacks a drive wide past the far post. 27 min Things have got a bit bitty, and that’s no bad thing for Rangers who, by the looks of things, will lose a flowing game. 25 min Candeias, who’s been quiet, incurs down the right and wins a corner. In it comes, but it’s behind Morelos and brown then takes the opportunity to ruckus with the ref. 23 min Dembele misses a chance that my telephone refused to allow me to see. He’s done it again! Rogic has scored each time the Old firm have met this season, and this is another beauty. A pass down the right finds Dembele pulling towards the edge of the box, he slides back to McGregor who squares for Rogic, in the middle of the box. A slick Cruyff turn sends McCrorie for something deep fried, the ball thusly moved from left to right boot, and he eases a low curler past Foderingham! 21 min Rangers give possession away cheaply and end up giving away a corner, curled in by McGregor and flapper away - just - by Foderingham. So McGregor trots over to the other flank and curls towards the near post, where Boyata loses Tavernier and just misses with a header. 19 min Rangers are doing a pretty decent job here, shutting off the half-spaces. Saeeing as we’re here, what is a “half-space” and how does it differ from a “space”? 17 min Morelos comes deep and right, protecting the ball from Ajer, who impatiently wrestles him to the ground. Free-kick Rangers, 35 yards from goal, near the touchline, and Tavernier immediately curls into the nearest defender. 16 min Rangers get some respite, forcing the ball into midfield and following it there. My guess is they’re playing for 0-0 until about 70, at which point they introduce Windass and have a proper shy on the break as Celtic overcommit. 13 min Forrest moves down the right and crosses low but Martin sees the ball away. Rangers can’t get out at the moment, though they’ve only ceded the one chance, and with pretty high tariff. 12 min Celtic are in control here, Tierney and McGregor combining beautifully down the left to work space for the latter to cross. His low attempt is behind those it seeks. 11 min Ntcham takes the ball outside the box and moves across the face of the D looking for a shooting opportunity. But it gets harder and harder as he starts to reach and ends up wafting something hopeful nowhere near anywhere, not even Selhurst Park. 11 min 9 min “Celtic and Rangers using the new World Cup ball, the Telstar 18,” tweets Jonathan O’Brien. “Looks beautiful - first time Adidas have done a decent WC ball since getting rid of the Tango design after France 98.” I’d agree with that. I’ll try and find a photo in due course, but it’s comic-book in style: black and white panels, though not hexagons. 8 min We’ve not see much of Rangers as an attacking force, but here comes Morelos out on the left ... too far out on the left, carrying the ball over the touchline as he looks to move inside. 6 min Dembele hits the post! Out on the right, Ntcham arcs in a delicious cross, and Dembele has stolen ahead of Martin - he’s probably offside but it’s marginal and there’s no flag. So he sweeps the ball on the volley and on the stretch, making glorious contact with a difficult chance ... but can only rattle the near upright! 5 min Nice from Celtic, Tavernier moving forward and combining with Murphy, but Tierney is having no such thing, dashing back, confiscating the ball, and barging forward. 3 min Rangers have a bit of the ball and Morelos is pacing about all over, looking to redeem himself after his horrific miss at the end of the last match between these two. He gets into the space behind Tierney, but Ajer is across quickly when Brown finds him. 1 min Rangers aren’t doing much in the way of pressing, so Celtic move the ball along the back four. 1 min Away we go! Celtic huddle, led by Scotty Broon with classic ostentation. Atmosphere’s building, there’s nothing like it, let’s have a break. There’s a fair old racket at Hampden. This should be good. Here they come! Apparently, “Rangers need to try and score goals”. More as I get it. Graeme Murty says that Rangers need to get their press right. They’ve changed their centre-backs since the sides last met, and this is a particularly big day for Ross McCrorie, who’s only 20. Gulp. It’s amazing how often chips awaiting vinegar end up doused in a quite different liquid. We saw it last week when Manchester United won at Manchester City, and I’d not be at all surprised to see similar happen here. It’s nearly time. Looking at the teams more closely, Celtic are without Stuart Armstrong, whom they’ll miss. He has the ability to beat men in tight areas, and with Rangers picking Halliday and Docherty in front of the back four, that’ll be useful. The last team these teams met, Rangers were great in attack but devoid of midfield control. They’ve looked to address that here, but might miss the thrust of Josh Windass, who’s on the bench. Cheers John – I am now back from lunch, to discover the belting news that Sky Go is down, so I’m on my phone. It was on this day in 1970 at Hampden that Celtic played Leeds United in a Battle of Britain, a European Cup semi-final in which Jock Stein’s Bhoys saw off Don Revie and his boys with a 2-1 in. There were 136, 505 people that day, almost as many as those who saw the Sex Pistols at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in 1976. Of course, it’s the Scottish Cup, not the league that we are dealing with here, and since Rangers came back from the wilderness/formed a new club (delete as applicable according to your leanings and reading of Caledonian company law), their sole success over Celtic was in this competition in 2016, a penalty shoot-out victory that ushered Ronny Deila (remember him?) oot the Parkhead door. Here’s part of that Dave King statement from earlier in the week. “However, on the managerial front I emphasise that the board fully recognises the need for sustained stability in this area of the club. Whoever is appointed must be able to meet the unique challenges of managing Rangers and ensuring immediate success. “It is a priority that we commence next season with the best appointment we can make and that we move forward rapidly. Rangers is synonymous with winning and I want to repeat my commitment that neither I, nor any of the other directors, will consider our work complete until Rangers has been restored to the top of our game.” In essence, Dave doesn’t think that Murty is capable of “Going for 55”, to use the mission statement that Rangers announced their return to the top flight with a couple of years back. The problem that Rangers have is that Celtic are going for 49 and seven in a row, and will get it. Ten in a row - they’ve both done nine - looks very possible. Graeme Murty is Rangers’ temporary boss, and reasonably popular with fans and the media north of the border but his hopes of landing the job he has done since October on a more permanent basis were dashed earlier this week by Dave King, club chairman, announcing he wanted someone better. Way to motivate, Davie. And ahead of the biggest game of the season and all. Brendan Rodgers has a great record against Rangers; he is yet to lose in nine games facing the Light Blues. Last time, that 3-2 comeback win achieved with ten men, was a close-run thing but there is a definite swagger about Celtic ahead of this one. This will be the 51st square go in the Scottish Cup between Celtic and Rangers. Celtic have won 24, Rangers 16 with ten draws. And the referee will be Bobby Madden. It’s his third Old Firm game, which means he ought to be well versed in not booking anyone for crunchers in the first ten minutes. The teams are here. Celtic: Gordon, Lustig, Boyata, Ajer, Tierney, Brown, Ntcham, Rogic, Forrest, McGregor, Dembélé. Subs: Bain, Simunovic, Roberts, Kouassi, Edouard, Sinclair, Griffiths. Rangers: Foderingham, Tavernier, McCrorie, Martin, John, Dorrans, Halliday, Docherty, Murphy, Morelos, Candeias. Subs: Alnwick, Miller, Windass, Cummings, Hodson, Holt, Alves. Celtic are seeking the double-treble, which sounds like some kind of basketball statistic, Rangers are their own only hope of stopping the all-too unthinkable. Hello and welcome a game which needs no introduction. Which is just as well as, thanks to our enemies of brevity on Gold Coast, it’s not getting one. Suffice to say that the game between these two at Ibrox a few weeks ago was one of the best I’ve seen this season. Celtic are there, Rangers are coming, and nae cu person is going to hold anything back.

Before the strikes, leading human rights campaigners in the Syrian opposition such as Fadel Abdul Ghany had said they wanted to see the west attack the entire Syrian air force, including all its airfields. His hopes were dashed. “If this is it, Assad should be relieved,” said Randa Slim rom the Washington-based thinktank the Middle East Institute. The Syrian government sent out a video of Assad turning up for work in the presidential palace as normal. The not-very-subliminal message was “it’s business as usual”. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has suggested an extra benefit of the strikes might be that they encourage Vladimir Putin to bring Assad to the negotiating table. But it is hard to identify the strategic factors likely to change that would make negotiations any more likely to succeed, and in particular make Russia any more likely to put pressure on Assad to make concessions. Greater US engagement does not appear to be one of them. Buried in Trump’s statement announcing the strikes was a rejection of US ambition and engagement. “No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It’s a troubled place,” he said. Trump promised to “try to make it better”, but he repeated: “It is a troubled place.” The one Trump administration speech setting out a long-term strategy for Syria, delivered by Rex Tillerson, has been removed from US state department website. The US went out of its way not to threaten Russian positions inside Syria, knowing to do so would risk a wider conflagration, and risk Russia’s self-appointed position as the power broker in Syria. Theresa May, a prime minister who, beset by Brexit, has so far shown little interest in Syria save as a counter-terrorism issue, has repeatedly stressed British involvement had nothing to do with regime change or the civil war. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has invested more heavily in the region, recently inviting to the Elysée Kurdish leaders under assault from Turkey in northern Syria. But he is clear nothing better than Assad is on offer in Syria. Indeed, some have argued Macron’s red line on chemical weapons had acted as a smokescreen for his absence of a wider strategic policy. He had hoped Assad would never overstep the line. “Just as interesting is what the strikes were not,” said Richard Haass, president of the the New York-based thinktank the Council on Foreign Relations. “They were not intended to unseat the Assad regime or directly protect the Syrian people. Although President Trump expressed his disappointment with Russian and Iranian support for Assad, the strikes took care not to engage them directly.” The agenda of the Geneva peace process remains in the same place as it was before the strikes – a universal acceptance amongst the interlocutors that the Assad regime remains in power but his delegation refusing to engage on the potential constitutional constraints on which the regime operates, both in a transition and thereafter, the degree of federalism and the possibility of UN-supervised elections. A draft UN resolution from western powers, due to be discussed at the security council on Monday, calls on all sides to negotiate, but the Syrian government delegation to Geneva refuses to discuss these issues and will feel under no new pressure to engage. Indeed, Russia has said the attacks would damage Geneva. A Russian-led process of setting up a new committee to draw up a postwar constitution for Syria is making snail-like progress. Assad, a master of the waiting game, knows he can starve and bomb the Syrian opposition from its remaining redoubts so long as he does not resort to chemical weapons again. “The regime’s illegal, indiscriminate use of conventional weapons are the biggest killer of civilians,” said a statement from official Syrian opposition negotiating team. “As long as Assad can pursue his military strategy through conventional weapons, Syrians will continue to die and there will be no resolution to the conflict.” The Assad strategy, with the help of Iran and Russia, is to expel what it regards as the terrorists town by town until they are corralled and destroyed in Idlib, a province of 2 million people in north-west Syria that the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, at the weekend identified as the next humanitarian disaster. Tens of thousands have been displaced to Idlib, partly from previous Assad victories. But that does not mean the conflict has a linear path to a single conclusion, since Syria is now the cockpit for a series of civil wars. Israel, unwilling to tolerate the Iran-backed Shia militia Hezbollah close to its borders, said at the weekend it would continue to attack positions inside Syria. The Arab League meeting in Saudi Arabia on Sunday also adopted a strongly anti-Iranian position after being urged by Trump on Friday to ensure that Tehran does not profit from the eradication of Isis. He added: “We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region.” Turkey, a Nato member, still has ambitions to drive Kurdish forces farther from its southern borders. Russia and Iran are at best ambiguous about Turkish intentions, fearing Syria’s dismemberment. That leaves the west with ever-reducing leverage save the offer of reconstruction money. The EU will hold a Syria reconstruction conference on 24-25 April, but the last week appears to have shown that so far as the west is concerned, Assad can press ahead with this brutality, so long as does not use chlorine or Sarin in the process."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/15/first-rohingya-refugees-repatriated-to-myanmar-despite-un-safety-fears","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T11:44:19Z","webTitle":"First Rohingya refugees repatriated to Myanmar despite UN safety fears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/15/first-rohingya-refugees-repatriated-to-myanmar-despite-un-safety-fears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/15/first-rohingya-refugees-repatriated-to-myanmar-despite-un-safety-fears","fields":{"headline":"First Rohingya refugees repatriated to Myanmar despite UN safety fears","bodyText":"Myanmar says it has repatriated the first Rohingya refugees from among nearly 700,000 who fled a crackdown in the country last year despite warnings from the United Nations that it is not yet safe to return.

The Myanmar government announced late on Saturday that a family of refugees had become the first to be processed in newly built repatriation centres earlier that day. “The five members of a family ... came back to Taungpyoletwei town repatriation camp in Rakhine state this morning,” said a statement posted to the Facebook page of the government’s information committee. Bangladesh’s refugee commissioner, Mohammad Abul Kalam, told Agence France-Presse the family had been living in a camp erected on a patch of “no man’s land” between the two countries. Several thousand Rohingya have been living in the zone since August, crammed into a cluster of tents beyond a barbed-wire fence that roughly demarcates the border zone between the two countries. “They were not under our jurisdiction, therefore we cannot confirm whether there would be more people waiting to go back [to Myanmar],” he told AFP. Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed a repatriation plan in January but its start has been repeatedly delayed as both sides blame the other for lack of preparation. According to the Myanmar statement, immigration authorities provided the family with national verification cards, a form of ID that falls short of citizenship and has been rejected by Rohingya leaders who want full rights. The family members were scrutinised by immigration and health ministry officials and the social welfare, relief and resettlement ministry provided them with “materials such as rice, mosquito netting, blankets, t-shirt, longyis [Burmese sarong] and kitchen utensils”, the government said. Myanmar officials could not be reached for further details and the post did not say whether any more returns were expected soon. The move comes despite warnings from the UN and other rights groups that a mass repatriation of Rohingya would be premature, as Myanmar has yet to address the systematic legal discrimination and persecution the minority has faced for decades. The UN has said the military-led operations that started last August amount to ethnic cleansing, but Myanmar has denied the charge, saying its troops targeted Rohingya militants. Andrea Giorgetta from the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) criticised the repatriation announcement as “a public relations exercise in an attempt to deflect attention from the need for accountability for crimes committed in Rakhine state”. Last week, the most senior UN official to visit Myanmar this year, the assistant secretary general for humanitarian affairs, Ursula Mueller, said conditions in Myanmar were not conducive to the return of the refugees. She cited a continued lack of access to health services, concerns among the Rohingya about protection and continued displacements. She also described conditions in camps for internally displaced people from previous bouts of violence as “deplorable”. Many Rohingya refugees say they fear returning to a country where they saw their relatives murdered by soldiers and Buddhist vigilantes who drove them from their homes. Boats with Rohingya from parts of Rakhine state have continued leaving Myanmar in recent months. The latest confirmed departure took place on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"stage/2018/apr/15/instructions-for-correct-assembly-review-bonnar-and-horrocks-star-in-clever-sci-fi-satire","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T10:21:58Z","webTitle":"Instructions for Correct Assembly review – Bonnar and Horrocks star in clever sci-fi satire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/apr/15/instructions-for-correct-assembly-review-bonnar-and-horrocks-star-in-clever-sci-fi-satire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/apr/15/instructions-for-correct-assembly-review-bonnar-and-horrocks-star-in-clever-sci-fi-satire","fields":{"headline":"Instructions for Correct Assembly review – Bonnar and Horrocks star in clever sci-fi satire","bodyText":"Thomas Eccleshare is a quirky, off-the-wall writer. In Pastoral, seen at the HighTide festival in 2013, he created black comedy out of impending ecological disaster. Now he has written a sci-fi satire about our vain search for programmed perfection. While the play is sharply funny and ingeniously staged, it doesn’t always supply the emotional evidence to reinforce its intellectual arguments. The basic situation is simple: Hari and Max, husband and wife, respectively, are a nice suburban couple who decide to create an ideal flatpack son out of constituent parts. It gradually emerges that their first son, Nick, died of drug addiction. They assemble a replacement, Jan, who conforms to social norms and whose ideas and attitudes can be determined through a remote control. Since Nick and Jan are played by the same actor, a contrast is drawn between the fallible humanity of the one and the machine-tooled precision of the other. Needless to say, predetermined perfection proves to be an impossible dream. As a graduate of the Jacques Lecoq school of physical theatre, Eccleshare comes out of a different box from most British playwrights, but I was struck by his similarity to Alan Ayckbourn. In Ayckbourn’s Henceforward (1987), we saw a composer serviced by an android to whom he related more easily than people; and in Comic Potential (1998), TV soaps were populated by computerised robots. There is one particular scene in Eccleshare’s play, when Jan hilariously disrupts a suburban dinner party, that I suspect his forebear would have been delighted to have written. Eccleshare also has the capacity to link the dystopian and the diurnal, as in Hari and Max’s compulsion to compete with their neighbours, who constantly brag about their own high-flying offspring’s achievements. What Eccleshare has to say is true and relevant: we should love people for what they are rather than for what we wish them to be. The action, however, doesn’t always back up the argument, especially in the scenes involving Nick, whose descent into addiction is never motivated or explained. We are clearly meant to assume that, as parents, Max and Hari have failed due to their inability to cope with messy reality. But we don’t learn enough about Nick, in spite of a speech from the girl next door praising his potential, to know whether he was a victim of parental pressure or social circumstance. Even if there is a hole at the play’s heart, it has been assembled by director Hamish Pirie and designer Cai Dyfan as cleverly as the machine-made Jan: scenes that are glimpsed through a rectangular aperture whisk by on a travelator before the set opens up to show us the suburban jungle. Jane Horrocks captures excellently the trim conformity and residual guilt of the maternal Max, while Mark Bonnar suggests the trouble with Hari is that he believes you can build the perfect son out of DIY fervour. Jason Barnett and Michele Austin are equally good as the boastful neighbours. Brian Vernel is outstanding as both the flawed Nick and the mechanised Jan who, as someone observes, has his head screwed on the right way. Yet while the play aims some deft blows at our desire for an unrealisable perfection and is well worth seeing, its own flaws are all too apparent. • At the Royal Court, London, until 19 May.

Three marathon wins, followed by another basketball triumph and victory on the squash court took Australia’s gold medal tally to 80, but there it remained thanks to last-minute drama in both the netball and the women’s rugby sevens finals on Sunday afternoon. Soon after England’s last-gasp efforts on the netball court in Coomera broke Australian hearts, the nation’s sevens team fell to a 17-12 sudden-death extra-time defeat to New Zealand in the final at Robina. Defeat ended hopes of backing up their Rio Olympic success and compounded the disappointment of the men’s team failing to make the medal matches a day earlier, as New Zealand – who had to settle for silver behind the Australians two years ago – made history by claiming the inaugural Commonwealth title. Just as England’s Helen Housby had delivered the fatal blow in the netball, it was New Zealand’s Kelly Brazier who stabbed a dagger into Australian hearts in the sevens, running almost 60 metres to settle the contest. The Kiwis had earlier jumped out of the blocks, assuming a commanding 12-o half-time lead thanks to Portia Woodman and Michaela Blyde tries, only for Australia to hit back through Emilee Cherry and Ellia Green and send the match into extra-time. Australia coach Tim Walsh, in his last game in charge before moving across to the men’s side, attempted to temper his disappointment with the fact that the sport’s Commonwealth debut has been a roaring success. “We hate losing. We’re pretty disappointed,” Walsh said. “Everyone’s faces are devastated. You can’t fault the effort they put in. They were prepared to perform so they could walk off without any regrets. We don’t like losing and I’m sure there’s always going to be a ‘what if, what if’.” “To be honest it was a top game for people to watch. Australia versus New Zealand, extra-time, is pretty good. The stadium in Rio was nothing [as exciting] like this. What a spectacle and how good is it for women’s sevens to play like that. It’s a huge step forward. Every country represented themselves really well. “Women’s sevens is here to stay. All these teams have contributed to giving a whole new genre in women’s contact sport.” Earlier, champion para-athlete Kurt Fearnley, one of the faces of these Games, bowed out of international racing after claiming gold in the first event of the day with a Commonwealth record for the T54 marathon. The two-time Paralympic marathon champion, who also won silver in the T54 1,500m, said he was ready to call time. “I’m grateful actually [to be retiring] That just hurt. I busted myself out there, I’ve got nothing, I’ve just got nothing [left] that’s positively everything I’ve got. “I want to wake up and not feel ruined. The intensity that you take into training when you know you’ve got to compete for this country. You know that whenever you put on the green and gold, you’ve got to be fierce. I just know that I’m done there.” Madison De Rozario mirrored Fearnley’s success in the women’s T54 marathon after breaking clear of a group of athletes with 5km remaining. It was De Rozario’s second gold of the week, having won the T54 1,500m on Tuesday. “This is everything that I could have hoped for, crossing the line with both of us,” De Rozario said of Fearnley and Australia’s double gold. “It’s always amazing to win a race, but it’s so much better to have another Australian up there. For this to be his last race for Australia, what a way to go out.” David Palmer also bid farewell to his career on a high note, winning the men’s doubles squash title with Zac Alexander with victory over England’s Daryl Selby and Adrian Waller at Oxenford Studios. A third marathon gold came when Gold Coast local Michael Shelley retained his Commonwealth title in the men’s race – becoming just the second man to do so – which was overshadowed by the collapse of Scotland’s Callum Hawkins. The final day haul means Australia end their home Games sitting pretty on top of the medal table by some distance, with a total haul of 198 medals comprising 80 golds, 59 silver and 59 bronze. England were their nearest challengers on 45-45-46, with India in third. Canada and New Zealand had 15 golds each."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/15/australian-pm-malcolm-turnbull-blasts-russia-over-inaction-on-chemical-weapons-after-syria-airstrikes","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T04:49:53Z","webTitle":"Australian PM blasts Russia over inaction on chemical weapons after Syria airstrikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/15/australian-pm-malcolm-turnbull-blasts-russia-over-inaction-on-chemical-weapons-after-syria-airstrikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/15/australian-pm-malcolm-turnbull-blasts-russia-over-inaction-on-chemical-weapons-after-syria-airstrikes","fields":{"headline":"Australian PM blasts Russia over inaction on chemical weapons after Syria airstrikes","bodyText":"The Australian prime minister has given strong support for the military response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons and urged Russia to exercise its authority to ensure the weapons are destroyed. At a press conference on Sunday, Malcolm Turnbull said the Australian government was a strong supporter of the “targeted, proportionate and responsible action by the United States, France and the United Kingdom in targeting three chemical weapons sites in Syria yesterday”. “The use of chemical weapons is a crime,” Turnbull told reporters. “It cannot be tolerated. And we call on Russia, which is the sponsor of Syria, to use its influence to ensure that this most recent chemical weapons attack ... is thoroughly investigated.” Turnbull labelled the chemical weapons attack an “atrocity by the Assad government” and a “shocking crime” that is believed to have killed up to 75 people. The Australian prime minister criticised Russia for using its United Nations security council veto to block motions to investigate the chemical weapons crime and to ensure it cannot be repeated. “It is time that Russia played a responsible role,” Turnbull said. “It has all of the influence and authority over the Syrian government that it needs to ensure that these crimes are not committed.” Russia should “should stop all the denial and the pretence that it wasn’t an action by the Syrian government and ensure that the chemical weapons [are] destroyed”, he said. Turnbull said no Australian aircraft or military assets were involved because they were “not required”. But Australia is committed to working with its partners and allies to stop the criminal use of chemical weapons “whether it is in Syria or on a park bench in Salisbury in the United Kingdom”. Turnbull said he spoke to UK prime minister, Theresa May, on Saturday night to discuss the conduct of the Syrian government and “the use of a nerve agent by agents of Russia or by Russia directly, in Salisbury”. “Of course there we made a coordinated response of expelling Russian diplomats, we showed great solidarity as a global community to absolutely say ... there will be no tolerance of this type of criminal activity.” Asked if Australia could be called on to send fighter jets, Turnbull noted that its superhornets had just returned from the Middle East although Australia continues to provide training to the defence forces and police in Iraq. “We have a continued commitment and we are obviously talking to our ally, the United States, constantly,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/16/labor-demands-charities-advocacy-be-exempted-from-foreign-donations-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T18:00:03Z","webTitle":"Labor demands charities' advocacy be exempted from foreign donations ban","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/labor-demands-charities-advocacy-be-exempted-from-foreign-donations-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/labor-demands-charities-advocacy-be-exempted-from-foreign-donations-ban","fields":{"headline":"Labor demands charities' advocacy be exempted from foreign donations ban","bodyText":"Bill Shorten has demanded that charities’ advocacy work be exempted from the proposed foreign donation ban, clarifying Labor’s demands after a bipartisan report suggested the law be rewritten. The comments set Labor on a collision course with the Turnbull government, which has offered to consider recommendations to amend the bill from the electoral matters committee but refused to completely exempt charities from the ban. In a unanimous report released on Monday, the joint standing committee on electoral matters recommended the electoral funding and disclosure bill should define political expenditure as spending “to influence voters to take specific action as voters, so as not to capture non-political issue advocacy”. That would apply the foreign donation ban to charities in theory but in practice allow them to continue to take international money, unless they more actively engaged in political campaigning by directing people how to vote. In a statement on Monday, Shorten said it was Labor’s policy to ban foreign donations but what it “won’t support is anything that punishes the charity and not-for-profit sector”. “Charities and not-for-profits need donations to fund their issues-based advocacy work and should be able to participate in the policy-making process without being treated as if they have a political intent,” he said. Shorten said the Turnbull government “must fix its poorly drafted and over-reaching legislation, in response to the numerous concerns raised” by the bipartisan committee. “If it doesn’t, Labor will move its own amendments to protect the important work of the charities and not-for-profits sector,” Shorten said. “Labor has always supported Australia’s charities and not-for-profits – and we always will.” The comments suggest that Labor will take a more aggressive stance in parliament than in the bipartisan committee report, and its true position is closer to the Greens’ call for issues-based advocacy to be explicitly exempted from the definition of political expenditure. Guardian Australia understands Labor is leaning towards a guarantee that charities can use donations for advocacy work provided it does not tell voters how to vote, even if that advocacy is around election time and may be on an issue before electors. A Labor source said the opposition would wait to see the redrafted bill but “will continue to work closely with charities and not-for-profits to identify any specific threats to the vital work they do speaking up on critical issues”. Last Monday, the special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, welcomed Labor’s support for the bipartisan report, which he said accepted “the government’s core proposition that for the ban on foreign political donations to be effective it should apply to all relevant political expenditure, including political expenditure incurred by charities”. In February Guardian Australia asked Cormann if the government would consider applying the foreign donation ban only to political parties by allowing charities and not-for-profits to continue to take foreign donations for advocacy. “No – that would make a ban on foreign donations entirely ineffective,” he said. “It would create a massive loophole and is inconsistent with Labor’s own bill designed to ban foreign donations in relation to all political expenditure [including political expenditure by charities].” Cormann noted the government bill would allow charities to take foreign donations to fund charitable activities that are not political expenditure."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/15/australia-breeze-to-second-commonwealth-games-basketball-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T03:44:17Z","webTitle":"Australian basketball rides crest of wave after second Commonwealth gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/15/australia-breeze-to-second-commonwealth-games-basketball-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/15/australia-breeze-to-second-commonwealth-games-basketball-gold","fields":{"headline":"Australian basketball rides crest of wave after second Commonwealth gold","bodyText":"Australian basketball’s purple patch, what is being hailed as something of a golden era, is showing no sign of abating after the men’s team followed in the footsteps of their female counterparts by securing Commonwealth gold in what proved to be a one-sided final against Canada. From the opening tip-off, Australia’s utter domination of Commonwealth basketball was as clear as the waters around the Gold Coast and the Boomers made short work of their opposition in a straightforward 87-47 win. The latest success story comes at an exciting time for Australian basketball, with a sizeable contingent plying their trade in the NBA, that great litmus test of success. It was those players’ Stateside commitments that opened the door to many of this gold-medal-winning squad on the Gold Coast, and provided them with an opportunity to shine on the international stage. “It goes beyond just what the Australian team did here,” the Australian great, Andrew Gaze, told Guardian Australia. “It’s very much on the back of the success of Ben Simmons, Matthew Dellavedova, Patty Mills and the eight or nine guys in the NBA and they way they’re conducting themselves. The way they present is very positive for Australia. “On top of that, our NBL competition and WNBL competition are going through a period of great success and prosperity. All these elements combine for where we are as a sport right now. We’re going through this era where all elements are coming together and working in harmony. When you see NBL players perform like they did in this tournament, it indicates the direction the NBL is going, but it also says a lot about the development programs that have created this level of depth.” Having grasped their chance with both hands, the Boomers backed up their 2006 title in a game that was over as a contest by half-time, at which point the host nation was sitting on a 26-point lead. The result was never in doubt. With the women’s team having secured gold the previous night at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre, Australia remain unbeaten in Commonwealth basketball competition. It’s an impressive statistic, if a slightly misleading one, given the sport has been included just once before, at the 2006 Games in Melbourne. Still, with four golds from four competitions, Australia can rightfully lay claim to the title of standard bearers for the sport in the Commonwealth. The men’s team controlled Sunday morning’s game against Canada, both offensively and defensively, from the outset. Chris Goulding, Nicholas Kay and Nathan Sobey led the way in scoring, but the load was largely shared across the team, which each of the 12 players troubling the scorers. Canada, who had stunned New Zealand in the semi-final with a buzzer-beating three-pointer to reach the gold medal match, had little response. They too were missing their senior contingent and sent a roster made up entirely of Canadian university players to the Gold Coast. A silver medal is a remarkable achievement for Kirby Schepp’s young side. “I was a little surprised that Canada got to the final,” Gaze said.” I thought New Zealand would present the best challenge. They’re a young team but they got better and better as they went on. They deserved to be there.” Goulding, one of the senior Australian players in this group and likely to retain his place in the national squad for next year’s World Cup, said it was not as straightforward a match as the 40-point winning margin – exactly the same as when these two sides met in the pool stage – might suggest. “The scoreboard suggested that [it was easy], but we saw what they did against New Zealand,” Goulding said. “We wanted to come out and show them the utmost respect and give them our A-game, which pushed the scoreboard out a bit. But there was every danger that if disrespected them we could have got our arses handed to us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/parliament-and-public-split-over-theresa-may-decison-to-support-airstrikes-against-syria","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Parliament and UK public split over decision to bomb Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/parliament-and-public-split-over-theresa-may-decison-to-support-airstrikes-against-syria","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/parliament-and-public-split-over-theresa-may-decison-to-support-airstrikes-against-syria","fields":{"headline":"Parliament and UK public split over decision to bomb Syria","bodyText":"Theresa May is to face protests outside parliament and anger from MPs in the Commons , despite her attempts to limit the fallout from her decision to sanction Britain’s involvement in airstrikes on Syria. Wary of anger among MPs at being sidelined, the prime minister wrote to her parliamentary party explaining the action and published the government’s legal argument for intervention. However, anti-war protesters are already planning to demonstrate in Westminster and her failure to consult parliament on the airstrikes will see her face the ire of MPs when she addresses them on Monday. Just hours after Jeremy Corbyn wrote to May demanding the publication of the legal case for the intervention, the government released the tests that had been applied before intervention took place. It appears to be an attempt by May to limit the concerns in parliament, including within her own party. The paper argued that the UK had met three demands under international law. It said there was convincing evidence of extreme humanitarian distress; that there was no practicable alternative to the use of force; and that the action was necessary and proportionate. It concluded: “In these circumstances, and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, military intervention to strike carefully considered, specifically identified targets in order effectively to alleviate humanitarian distress by degrading the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capability and deterring further chemical weapons attacks was necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable.” May also set out the case in a letter to Tory MPs. However, the note made no promises about the consultation of parliament. Some Conservatives, including veteran Ken Clarke, had previously broken cover to say that MPs should be given a vote. With May emphasising that the military action would be strictly limited, Tories look like they will back away from causing problems for their leader. Should opposition MPs find a way to engineer a vote, it also appears likely that May would have had a majority in parliament for action, with the DUP offering their support as well as some Labour MPs. However, many of the Labour MPs who instinctively back the action are frustrated at the failure to recall parliament before action was taken. The strikes drew support from some non-political quarters. The London-based foreign policy thinktank, the Henry Jackson Society, praised May for “taking resolute action” that would help deter further use of chemical weapons. However, executive director Alan Mendoza said the airstrikes should be the start of a wider military campaign, instead of action the US has described as a “one-time shot.” Others were less enthusiastic, with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament describing the action as defying international law and criticising May for bypassing parliament. General secretary Kate Hudson said: “They will only increase the likelihood of this terrible conflict spilling over into the wider Middle East and potentially beyond that. “May has also disregarded public opinion in launching these strikes; polls indicate that only 22% of the population support this bombing campaign. Diplomatic and political solutions must be sought.” Hudson’s criticism was quickly followed by a statement from the Stop the War Coalition, which Corbyn once chaired, with the group claiming that most Britons were against such strikes. “In sanctioning killing at the behest of Donald Trump, May deliberately avoided consulting parliament and risked dramatically widening the war,” it said. “The overwhelming majority of people in this country oppose this action just as they have opposed the series of wars of the last seventeen years.” The group said it would be protesting outside Parliament on Monday. Meanwhile, in Syria, various community and civil society groups have called on the US and Europe to develop a comprehensive strategy to deter future atrocities by Assad’s forces. Fadel Abdul Ghany of the Syrian Network for Human Rights said: “The US, France and UK have sent an important message that Assad’s days of gassing Syrian civilians with impunity are over.” Dr Zaher Sahloul, president of Med Global, founded last year by doctors to address the health needs of the most vulnerable,, said: “Without a larger strategy today’s actions will not change Assad’s calculus – to the contrary, they could make the humanitarian situation worse.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/14/county-championship-roundup-kent-northants-collapse","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T19:24:06Z","webTitle":"County Championship roundup: Kent and Northants suffer stunning collapses","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/county-championship-roundup-kent-northants-collapse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/14/county-championship-roundup-kent-northants-collapse","fields":{"headline":"County Championship roundup: Kent and Northants suffer stunning collapses","bodyText":"And so within 48 hours the County Championship swung from the damply ridiculous to the calamitously camp. A combination of pitches sweating under covers, dampness in the air and tentative early-season batting led to a cascade of wickets – 85 in all – tumbling with a comedy parp and a wiggle all the way from Canterbury to Lord’s. With five of the six first-round games in play on the second day of the season; two teams were bowled out for less than a hundred, one match was into its third innings and one into its fourth. At Canterbury, where the sun promised to dry up the outfield, play didn’t start until lunch but then Kent were bowled out for 64 in 18.5 overs with only the loudly-whispered-about Zak Crawley making it into double figures. The wickets were shared between Gloucestershire’s bowlers, with Matt Taylor’s four for 20, and Craig Miles’ three for 11 the pick. It was Kent’s lowest first‑class total for five years. In reply Gloucestershire stumbled to 56 for six before recovering to 110 for eight at the close, with eight players in single figures and only the wicketkeeper Gareth Roderick holding things together with 51. Darren Stevens took three for 19 and there were two wickets for Matt Henry, including one with the third ball of his Kent career. Over at Lord’s where Friday’s play had promised something rather more strong and stable, 26 wickets fell in the day. Northamptonshire were bowled out for 71, with James Harris pocketing wonderful season-boosting figures of 5.2 overs, five wickets for nine. There was a wicket for Toby Roland Jones and four for Tim Murtagh who captured his 700th first-class dismissal in the process. In their second innings Middlesex folded to 159 all out with Max Holden top scoring with 33 and Murtagh swinging the bat at the end for 31. There were three wickets each for Doug Bracewell and Luke Procter. At the close, Northants were nine without loss, chasing an improbable 294 to win. At Old Trafford, Jake Ball, long‑legged and tidy, and desperately keen to regain the selectors’ affections after a winter of disappointment, ran in purposefully from the James Anderson end. He took five for 43 as the fancied Lancashire batting lineup failed to flourish in a Manchester sun so fierce that at one point it stopped play until a reflective panel under the sightscreen was draped with what looked like a tablecloth. Keaton Jennings, Haseeb Hameed and Liam Livingstone all fell cheaply, with only wicketkeeper Alex Davies of the favoured top four looking confident with 23. Dane Vilas and Shivnarine Chanderpaul put on 64 before Chanderpaul was caught for 11. Vilas was bowled for 49 by Harry Gurney in an impressive bowling performance by promoted Nottinghamshire. Luke Fletcher, who was ruled out of the second half of last season after sustaining a head injury in a T20 match, bowled some vigorously burly spells and grabbed a wicket. In reply, Nottinghamshire batted increasingly anxiously through a sun-drenched evening session finishing on 127 for six with wickets for Graham Onions and Joe Mennie on their Lancashire championship debuts, and three for 17 for Tom Bailey. There were half-centuries for Ian Bell and Tim Ambrose at Edgbaston where Warwickshire knocked up a relatively statesmanlike 284 for nine thanks to an unbeaten last‑wicket partnership of 62 between Ambrose and Chris Wright. There were four wickets for David Wiese. It was Jason Gillespie’s first outing as Sussex coach. At Southampton, Worcestershire fought back from 83 for six to 211 all out thanks to a cracking little fifty from wicketkeeper Ben Cox and 40 from Ed Barnard. There was to be no further cameo from James Vince in Hampshire’s second innings, caught off Magoffin for 12, nor runs for Sam Northeast, bowled Leach for four. The top scorer was Hashim Amla, run out for 36 as Hampshire finished on 163 for eight, leading Worcestershire by 242 runs. There was no play at Headingley for the second day in a row, with the sponge‑like conditions on the outfield near the Football Stand end making it too dangerous to start the match.

Just over four years ago, O’Leary called time on their relationship as owner and principal jockey but Russell rode his way back into the Ryanair man’s good books, leading to this shared moment of glory in the biggest jumps race of them all. Russell seemed at a low ebb in December 2013, when O’Leary fired him over the most famous cup of tea in the history of Irish jumps racing. He was in his mid-30s, at an age when many a fine rider has decided to do something less dangerous, and O’Leary was not the only one who felt the jockey should have been more effective on the track. But, when asked at the time what he would do next, Russell made it clear that stopping was not in his thoughts. “The same as I do every other day, try and take over the world,” he said. “When we parted,” O’Leary said here, “he could have easily gone in a huff, given up. He went back, he had one or two tough years and started riding out for Charles Byrnes and Gordon [Elliott, the winning trainer] and built himself back up. This year he’s been riding better than ever before. It’s the way he keeps bouncing back. He wasn’t particularly good on Petit Mouchoir at Cheltenham, where they went off like scalded cats, and he’d say that himself. But he keeps going and keeps delivering. I think the person I feel happiest for today is Davy. “He’s in a group of elite Irish jockeys, there’s Ruby Walsh, Barry Geraghty, Paul Carberry was one of them before he retired. Barry and Ruby have always been champion jockeys, winning all the best races. Davy’s career has been up and down, characterised by periods of great talent and achievement but also fallow periods. And it’s the way he keeps coming back and back again.” Russell’s craggy features might make him look dour, and the public perception of him is probably as one of the hard men of the weighing room. But he has used his moments of greatest triumph, here and after winning the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Lord Windermere, to acknowledge those he has lost, performing an idiosyncratic wave to the heavens that he copied from a film called 8 Seconds. Years ago, he acknowledged an unnamed friend he lost as a child. After a success at last month’s Cheltenham Festival, he paid tribute to his mother, who had died days before. He dedicated this win to his friend Pat Smullen, a Derby-winning Flat jockey who was diagnosed with a tumour last month. “I was speaking to him the other morning and he’s as tough as nails,” Russell said. Clutching the trophy, he added: “What would I give to be sharing this with my mother?” But mere inches separated triumph from disaster and Russell said he had not known, crossing the line, that he had won. “I saw a lot of him [Pleasant Company, the runner-up] and usually you don’t see that much of a horse. And I really think I just got to the line.” Had he been beaten, he would have blamed the decision to “wake up” Tiger Roll on the run to the final fence, mindful of the horse’s reputation as “a bit of a monkey”. “He had fallen a little bit asleep on me going to the second-last and I’d saved a lot throughout the race. I needed to wake him up and he came alight with me and winged the last. There was a long way to go and, to be fair to the horse, he was brave.” That decision to press on cost Tiger Roll precious energy and he tired so badly in the last 100 yards that he was almost collared. “That’s the choice I made,” Russell reflected. “Obviously it wasn’t the best choice to make but there was a reason behind doing it. “If I’d finished second, I’d be a long ways out of the racecourse by this stage, disappointed with myself. But I didn’t and I’m here and everybody wants to talk to me.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/14/labour-and-tories-level-corbyn-popularity-wanes-poll","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T19:04:28Z","webTitle":"Labour and Tories neck and neck as Corbyn's popularity wanes – poll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/14/labour-and-tories-level-corbyn-popularity-wanes-poll","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/14/labour-and-tories-level-corbyn-popularity-wanes-poll","fields":{"headline":"Labour and Tories neck and neck as Corbyn's popularity wanes – poll","bodyText":"Labour has drawn level with the Tories, but Jeremy Corbyn’s personal approval rating has slumped, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. It suggests that the Conservatives have lost the two-point poll lead recorded by the company last month, with both parties on 40% support. However, the Labour leader’s net approval rating – the difference between those who approve and disapprove of the job he is doing – has fallen from -10 to -19. The fall follows a difficult period for the party, after it faced demonstrations against antisemitism and Corbyn apologised for appearing to defend an antisemitic mural. Meanwhile, Theresa May’s approval rating remains relatively stable, improving one point to -8. May’s lead over Corbyn, in terms of who voters think would make the best prime minister, has risen from 8 to 12 points in the last month. She is now on 36% to Corbyn’s 24%. In the wake of her response to the Salisbury poisoning case, May appears to have increased the number of voters who see her as decisive – up from 32% last month to 41% this month. It gives her a large lead over Corbyn on the question, who has 34% support. May also has a 14-point lead over Corbyn when voters are asked who will “stand up for Britain’s interest abroad”. Half (50%) approve of the way May has responded to the Salisbury attack, up from 41% last month. Asked which of the two main party leaders would be best placed to respond to Russia and its likely involvement in an attack on British soil, 42% said May while only 16% opted for Corbyn. However, Corbyn has a significant 18-point lead when voters are asked which leader is “in touch with ordinary people”. More voters believed Labour was divided than believed the Conservatives were split. The poll also suggests that the Lib Dems remain on single figures of support, recording just 7% backing – up a single point on last month. Some in the party believe that pressure may increase on party leader Vince Cable should it continue to struggle to make an impression in May’s local elections. The poll was conducted online among 2,008 adults between 10 and 12 April."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/14/leave-eu-arron-banks-new-question-referendum-funded-brexit-cambridge-analytica","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Leave.EU, Arron Banks and new questions about referendum funding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/14/leave-eu-arron-banks-new-question-referendum-funded-brexit-cambridge-analytica","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/14/leave-eu-arron-banks-new-question-referendum-funded-brexit-cambridge-analytica","fields":{"headline":"Leave.EU, Arron Banks and new questions about referendum funding","bodyText":"The Information Commissioner’s Office is investigating Leave.EU and its donor Arron Banks over possible breaches of the Data Protection Act. The ICO has issued “information notices” against both Leave.EU – the referendum campaign headed by Nigel Farage – and its director, Banks. The notices – requiring organisations to provide the ICO with specified information within a certain time period – were issued in the same week as the ICO conducted raids last month on Cambridge Analytica’s offices. The notices are both part of Operation Cederburg – the commissioner’s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum. Failure to comply is a criminal offence. Banks – who was by far the biggest funder of Brexit, providing £8.4m in donations and loans – confirmed on Friday that both he personally and Leave.EU had received “information notices”. In an email on Friday, Banks said they were “responding to it’” He said the ICO’s action was not an “investigation” but “an information request”. In a separate development, the Observer has obtained an invoice that Cambridge Analytica issued on 14 December 2015 for £41,500 for work it undertook on behalf of Ukip. The invoice says the payment is for “analysis of Ukip membership and survey data and creative product development”, and it is issued on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC, the American entity, from its office in Alexandria, Virginia. This is the first documentary evidence that Cambridge Analytica did conduct analytics work on behalf of one of the Leave campaigns in the period before the referendum. Banks confirmed to the Observer that he was also sent the invoice at that time too. He said he subsequently made a donation for the amount to cover the invoice to Ukip. A spokesman for Ukip, speaking to the Guardian last month, denied any payment for the work was made but he confirmed Banks had in fact made the donation after “new information had come to light”. He said that the party decided not to pass on the money to Cambridge Analytica. Banks has long denied that Cambridge Analytica did any work for Leave.EU, as has Cambridge Analytica. The question is still the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Electoral Commission. In a written submission to the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) last month, Banks said he had met Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica but that he had declined to take him up on his proposal. Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it “did some preliminary analysis as part of a proposal to work with Ukip, but no contract was agreed, payment was not made to CA, and the preliminary work was not delivered to Ukip.” Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica director, who appeared on a panel at Leave.EU’s launch event, came forward to the Guardian last month and raised further questions about these claims. She said the company had completed around £40,000 worth of work for Ukip, using Ukip data, but agreed that the company had not been paid. She is expected to talk about this on Tuesday when she will testify to parliament as part of the DCMS committee into fake news. A Ukip spokesman told the Observer on Friday: “We got the money from Arron [Banks]. But we never paid it to Cambridge Analytica. We didn’t think it was worth it. It was preparatory work, a pitch.” He also confirmed that the party had handed over its database of roughly 40,000 supporters to Cambridge Analytica despite denying this to the Guardian last month. Ukip had told the Guardian previously that Cambridge Analytica “saw” the data but a spokesman admitted the information – including telephone numbers, email addresses, ages, and other personal information among other things – was given to the company on a computer as part of what he described as “preparatory work”. The spokesman said: “I asked everyone about this work and I was told CA pitched for it, Banks didn’t like it and he’d refused to pay for it. It’s now come out that he did actually make a donation to cover the cost of the work. But we never actually handed it over.” The revelations raise a whole new set of questions about how the referendum was funded and whether strict rules on spending may have been broken. The Observer has seen evidence which suggests that a form of the Ukip data that Cambridge Analytica analysed and processed was passed to individuals in the Leave.EU campaign. And a donation of £42,000 from Better for the Country, Leave.EU’s registered company name, was recorded as a political donation to the party on the Electoral Commission’s site one week before the referendum on 16 June 2016. It was not registered as part of the campaign by either entity as a referendum donation or expense. The unfolding of the Cambridge Analytica scandal has coincided with the final stages of the information commissioner’s investigation into the use of data in the referendum. Leave.EU’s operation has become one focus of the year-long investigation. Another resulted in the ICO’s raid on Cambridge Analytica. Damian Collins, the Tory MP for Folkestone, who is the chair of the DCMS committee, has told the Observer that both Britain’s electoral and data laws needed a radical and urgent overhaul. He said it was “ridiculous” that the ICO had to wait five days before being able to get a warrant to seize Cambridge Analytica’s computer servers and equipment. Separately, the ICO investigation is believed to be trying to understand the relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance Services, the Bristol-based insurance company that Banks owns and that was the HQ for Leave.EU referendum campaign work. A spokesman said: “Leave.EU and Eldon have never shared any data. And Leave.EU has never shared any data with Cambridge Analytica whether in relation to the EU referendum or otherwise.” The ICO may be asking questions because of previous comments Banks has made, including in an interview a year ago with the Observer. When asked about the use of Leave.EU’s database to send advertisements about his insurance products to campaign supporters, Banks said: “Why shouldn’t I? It’s my data.” When asked again last week, he said: “Leave.EU after the referendum campaign carried the occasional ad for insurance, so what?” In an email on Friday he said: “Eldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU. They are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa.” He added: “Make any mistakes relating to the business and we will be most assuredly coming after the Guardian &amp; you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/14/warrington-hull-kr-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T17:33:00Z","webTitle":"Warrington remain in winning form as Kevin Brown ends Hull KR revival","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/warrington-hull-kr-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/14/warrington-hull-kr-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Warrington remain in winning form as Kevin Brown ends Hull KR revival","bodyText":"There is still some way to go for Warrington before any talk of a Grand Final appearance becomes serious but there are undoubted signs of promise as the halfway point of the regular season approaches. This is now six victories in succession for Steve Price’s side, and their eighth in total. After a slow start, the influence of Price, who arrived from the NRL charged with finally delivering the title to one of Super League’s biggest clubs, is slowly becoming more apparent. Price’s first three months have been about making Warrington much tougher to beat than 12 months ago but this was an encouraging glimpse of what they are capable of when their attacking structures begin to click. They were ultimately worthy winners against a Hull KR side who continue to find life back in Super League tough, though they will take heart from a period just after half-time when they made life very difficult for Warrington, scoring three tries in six minutes to reduce a 22-2 deficit into a two-point lead for the home side. The early signs, though, are that Warrington are now made of sterner stuff; shown here by the fact that by the time they conceded the next try with two minutes remaining, they had long since secured victory with three more tries of their own. “There’s a lot more to come from us,” Price said. Defeats against sides such as Warrington will not define Hull KR’s first season back in Super League but the ramifications of this match could yet be severe. After two minutes their influential captain and hooker, Shaun Lunt, was forced off and the prognosis could force the club’s hand in the transfer market for a replacement. “Shaun has ruptured his medial ligaments in his knee and three months is the initial diagnosis,” the Rovers coach, Tim Sheens, said. “He’ll go for a scan and if that’s the verdict, we’ll have to go look for someone.” Ryan Shaw kicked Hull KR into an early lead but Warrington soon found their groove in attack. They scored four magnificent tries before half-time to establish a 20-point lead with their half-back, Kevin Brown, at the heart of much of what they did well. Brown was heavily involved in the tries for Mike Cooper, Ben Currie and Jack Hughes before a contentious moment gave Hughes his second on the stroke of half-time. Hull KR’s Junior Vaivai seemingly grounded the ball before Hughes did. It left Sheens unimpressed. “I was very disappointed with that,” he said. “I’ve got a picture of Vaivai putting the ball down and three officials all missed it.” That made it 22-2 and while Rovers rallied as Maurice Blair, James Donaldson and Chris Atkin scored soon after half-time, Warrington settled down again. They finished the stronger of the sides, with Brown the chief architect in creating the tries for Tom Lineham, Stefan Ratchford and Ryan Atkins that sealed Hull KR’s fate and ensured Warrington’s encouraging start under Price continued.

It was on that same walk the day before that I’d first seen the metre-long, primrose-yellow plastic banana lodged in bankside vegetation, as clean and bright as the moment it had been laughed down a weir or launched on the water to see how fast this bent canoe would go. Did they wonder if their joke would carry to the sea, the open ocean? Did they think the river a sink that would wash it down the plug hole? Had they even heard of microplastics? Unable to retrieve it, I walked on, still simmering, only to be distracted again a few metres on by a snatch of movement on the surface of the river. My brain was computing the possibility of a rat or water vole among the vegetation, when up it burst out of the water, the head of a giant pike, the length of my hand. It opened its long jaws in a great yawn, to display a mean row of jagged teeth. It fell back into the river, then up it came once more, baring the insides of its pale, membranous mouth. I looked into the big, black, blank dead eye of a fish that was very much alive. There was something terrible about this predatory fish out of water, so strong and adept in open air, breaking loose from its watery domain. The pike sank one last time, then rose to leave the rim of its jaw glowering on the surface, and there it stayed. A fish expert told me later that this might have been a male engaged in some ritual of breeding activity – a show of strength, perhaps? And then I thought of this animal’s descendants decades hence, opening wide to swallow small fry, the little fish that would themselves have gobbled down bits of waterweed, mixed in with a fruit salad of plastic banana."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/18/glacier-loss-is-accelerating-because-of-global-warming","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T10:00:22Z","webTitle":"Glacier loss is accelerating because of global warming | John Abraham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/18/glacier-loss-is-accelerating-because-of-global-warming","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/apr/18/glacier-loss-is-accelerating-because-of-global-warming","fields":{"headline":"Glacier loss is accelerating because of global warming","bodyText":"With global warming, we can make predictions and then take measurements to test those predictions. One prediction (a pretty obvious one) is that a warmer world will have less snow and ice. In particular, areas that have year-round ice and snow will start to melt. Alpine glaciers are large bodies of ice that can be formed high in mountains, typically in bowls called cirques. The ice slowly flows downwards, pulled by gravity, and is renewed in their upper regions. A sort of balance can occur where the loss of ice by melting or flowing at the bottom is equal to the gain of snow and ice by precipitation. As the Earth warms, the melt line moves upwards so that the glacier melts faster and faster at the bottom, shortening the glacier and reducing its mass. Ultimately, the melted water flows into streams and rivers and ends up in the oceans, contributing to accelerating sea level rise. While glaciers are interesting from an intellectual standpoint, they are also important to ecosystems and society. For example, the rate of glacier melt affects downstream water levels, river flowrates, and the water available for human use. So, it would be really important for us to be able to predict what will happen with glaciers in the future and plan for how water availability will change. Of the groups that track glaciers, my favorite is the World Glacier Monitoring Service, which publishes a survey of the mass changes from selected glaciers around the world, available here and summarized below. The graph shows changes to the mass of the glaciers that are monitored, measured in millimeters of equivalent water. But this doesn’t tell the whole story because there is very little information about glacier health in the high latitudes (Northern Alaska, Canada, Northern Europe, Northern Russia, etc.). Very few temperature records exist in high elevations in these regions. Furthermore, the temperatures do not extend back very far in time. So, it is challenging for scientists to develop a long-term perspective on glacier health in these areas. And this is why a new study attracted my attention. A paper was just published by the American Geophysical Union that shared research carried out by Dominic Winski and his colleagues. This team of researchers extracted ice cores from the glaciers on Mt. Hunter, in Alaska. The ice cores held snow and ice from as far back as 400 years. The researchers showed that the amount of water melt currently is 60 times greater than it was prior to 1850. They also found that the summertime temperature changes on Mt. Hunter are almost 2°C per century (about 3.5°F). To put this in perspective, the temperatures are rising about twice as fast as global temperatures. The fact that temperatures on these northern mountains is rising faster than the globe as a whole is something predicted by climate models. The reason it warms so fast in these locations is that as the warming starts, snow begins to melt, exposing dark soil, which absorbs more sunlight, leading to more warming. We call this a feedback loop. There are other feedbacks at play, including changes to vertical temperatures in the air, changes to clouds, and changes to atmosphere currents. These areas were predicted to warm particularly fast, and the measurements confirm the predictions. The authors recognized that during the summer, the top layer of snow and ice can melt. The liquid water permeates the ice beneath it and refreezes, creating a more solid ice layer than before. Because the bands of solid ice are formed from melting snow, more bands of solid ice mean that summer temperatures were above freezing when the ice bands formed. Measuring the number and thickness of these bands through time gives information about how warm the summer temperatures are. So basically, the authors used these annual ice-core bands to deduce temperatures as far back as 400 years ago. They found that the frequency of melting events increased by 57-fold from the 1650–1850 time period compared with 1980–2011. They also measured a 60-fold increase in total melt. These are staggering numbers. I asked the lead author, Dominic Winski to summarize his findings and he told me, This research shows that peaks in the Alaska Range sustain additional summertime warming through links with rising ocean temperatures in the tropics. Not only have we learned that summers are much warmer on Mt. Hunter than they were hundreds of years ago, but our research also demonstrates how connected the climate system is, with changes in certain parts of the world affecting places thousands of miles away. It will be interesting to see if others can replicate these findings in other locations. But the collaboration of the conclusions with other evidence is quite compelling. Good work, researchers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/14/countdown-to-conflict-how-may-risked-leadership-by-ordering-strikes","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T20:00:31Z","webTitle":"Countdown to conflict: how May took the decision to order strikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/14/countdown-to-conflict-how-may-risked-leadership-by-ordering-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/14/countdown-to-conflict-how-may-risked-leadership-by-ordering-strikes","fields":{"headline":"Countdown to conflict: how May took the decision to order strikes","bodyText":"Pale and tired after one of the most testing and sleepless nights of her premiership, Theresa May’s voice cracked just a little as she addressed journalists – and the British people – from the state dining room in No 10 Downing Street at 9am yesterday. “There is no graver decision for a prime minister than to commit our forces to combat – and this is the first time that I have had to do so,” she declared with emotion etched across her face. “As always, they have served our country with the greatest professionalism and bravery – and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.” The conclusion that airstrikes would be carried out had been reached over several days of intense diplomatic activity between London, Washington and Paris. All three governments and their intelligence and military services had worked through several nights to agree a tripartite response to the killing of 75 people, including young children, in an apparent chemical weapons attack in the Syrian town of Douma a week before. May’s cabinet had on Thursday unanimously backed the principle of airstrikes. But there were still crucial decisions to be made about their precise nature, purpose and scale, and, critically, about their timing. For May, the need to act was beyond doubt – but the political risks were all too clear. Could a prime minister whose hold on power was so frail, in a country still traumatised by the decision, based on flawed intelligence, to go to war in Iraq in 2003, really authorise airstrikes without the backing of parliament? And without the support of the Labour party, whose leader Jeremy Corbyn was opposed? Should she not wait until MPs returned to Westminster after the Easter break, which they do not do until Monday? According to senior figures in Downing Street, it was at around 7pm on Friday evening, after the prime minister had been in a phone call with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, that the die was finally cast and the timetable set. Macron had been as hawkish, and arguably more so, than May or even US President Donald Trump. The message was that he wanted to go ahead soon. The French president had been preparing the ground. On Friday morning, he had made a phone call to the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, the only one of the trio to do so. In the call, Macron voiced his “deep concern” over the “continuing deterioration of the situation on the ground”, but also said that Paris wanted “to continue and intensify dialogue” with Moscow for a political solution to the Syria crisis. If it was to happen, there had to be a balanced message to assuage Moscow. “The tone was direct, as it often is, but it was also constructive,” said one Elysée source, stressing that Paris now wanted to capitalise on the momentum of the strikes to bring Russia to the table in a renewed effort for a “political process” to end the Syria crisis. No 10 had, throughout Thursday and Friday, been building the case for strikes and establishing their legality. The attorney general had told May that action would not break international law. And the intelligence services had been sending in more and more evidence that the chemical weapons attack was, beyond reasonable doubt, the work of the Assad regime. It was the kind of detailed evidence May needed if MPs were to protest in parliament that she had defied their will. Just before midnight on Friday, the prime minister, who was at Chequers, began a series of calls to UK political leaders, including Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and Vince Cable, to warn them of what was about to unfold. She then stayed up until military officials were able to tell her that the airstrikes had achieved their aim and been a success. She recorded a statement to be broadcast on television to the nation and then turned in. “She got a bit of sleep, we think,” said an aide. “Though not a lot.” At around 6am, she and her husband Philip were driven back from Chequers to Downing Street, where the prime minister was briefed by senior military advisers on the operations and the damage they had inflicted. Inevitably there were difficulties in keeping all members of the tripartite alliance to the same script. Even before French fighter jets had returned to their bases on home soil from the Syria mission, the French defence minister, Florence Parly, said that Russia had been “warned beforehand” to avoid any confrontation or escalation. The Elysée quickly contradicted her and played this down, saying that standard “deconfliction” contacts had been made with the Russian military only once the operation had begun. French sources said France’s part of the military operation had taken 10 hours from the time the country’s fighter jets took off to the moment they returned. At her press briefing early yesterday, the prime minister was clear that the action, while aimed at the Assad regime, also carried a wider message to those who thought they could use chemical weapons on British, or any other country’s, soil. “We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere. We must reinstate the global consensus that chemical weapons cannot be used.” On Monday she will address parliament, telling MPs why the action was necessary and taking their questions. Only then will she be able to fully assess the potential political implications of her first military operation as prime minister."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/14/swansea-city-everton-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T16:15:50Z","webTitle":"Jordan Ayew’s equaliser earns Swansea strugglers a draw with Everton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/14/swansea-city-everton-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/14/swansea-city-everton-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Jordan Ayew’s equaliser earns Swansea strugglers a draw with Everton","bodyText":"Every point feels precious in the scrap for survival, yet Swansea City will lament the fact that they departed with one, not three, from a game they badly needed to win to allow them to breathe more easily in the relegation battle. A superbly-taken goal from Jordan Ayew at least enabled Swansea to salvage something after Kyle Naughton had put through his own net just before-half time, but this felt like a missed opportunity for Carlos Carvalhal and his players. The Welsh club edged another point clear of the drop zone but slipped two places in the table on an afternoon when they paid a high price for their profligacy in front of goal. Everton, in contrast, remained ninth and it was another of those days when their supporters made it clear that they are far from enamoured with Sam Allardyce and his tactics. The Everton manager’s decision to bring on Ramiro Funes Mori for Yannick Bolasie went down particularly badly with the travelling fans, especially after they had just hit the woodwork and the game was there to be won. Swansea had started extremely brightly, opening Everton up with their slick passing and creating several excellent chances inside the first 30 minutes, yet their failure to take any of those opportunities proved costly as the visitors pilfered the lead shortly before the interval and totally against the run of play. Lukasz Fabianski produced two fine saves to deny Bolasie and then Idrissa Gueye from close-range, but the ball rebounded off Naughton and over the line. Swansea thought they had got away with it but Lee Mason, the referee, received a notification on his wrist via the goal-line technology system and Carvalhal’s team found themselves behind in a game where they should have led. Everton had twice cleared balls off the line in the space of 60 seconds earlier in the first half. Leighton Baines seemed to know little about it when Jordan Ayew’s shot deflected off his heel and behind after Tom Carroll had broken away on the right following a Swansea counter-attack. From the corner that followed Cenk Tosun nodded Federico Fernández’s header off the line. Everton seemed unable to stem the flow of white shirts and there was another reprieve for Allardyce’s team in the 26th minute. Jordan Ayew’s lovely first-time pass released Andre Ayew, his brother, through on goal but the forward’s shot was tame and straight at Jordan Pickford, who was able to easily save. Swansea had another couple of openings early in the second half. Carroll’s diving header was saved by Pickford and five minutes later the Everton goalkeeper clawed Andre Ayew’s attempt over the bar. Everton, however, were starting to see a bit more of the ball and Gueye, totally unmarked, wastefully headed a cross from Theo Walcott wide of the far post. With the clock ticking away, Carvalhal knew that he had to roll the dice. Tammy Abraham replaced Ki sung-Yueng as Swansea desperately pressed for an equaliser. Tosun, remarkably, cleared another header off the line, this time from Alfie Mawson, and Swansea must have wondered what they needed to do to score. The answer came via a slice of good fortune. Carroll’s mis-hit volley landed at the feet of Jordan Ayew, who took a touch before drilling an unerring shot across Pickford and into the far corner. With the game now stretched, Everton came desperately close to regaining the lead 15 minutes from time. Tosun crossed from the right and Seamus Coleman rattled the crossbar when it appeared easier to score. Allardyce’s response was to replace Bolasie with Funes Mori – much to the annoyance of their supporters – presumably to try to shut up shop, yet Swansea could and should have scored again. Jordan Ayew’s astute knockdown from Carroll’s free-kick implored Abraham to score but the substitute screwed his shot over the bar from no more than eight yards."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/14/leicester-northampton-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T16:28:04Z","webTitle":"Northampton deal a big blow to Leicester’s top-four hopes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/leicester-northampton-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/14/leicester-northampton-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Northampton deal a big blow to Leicester’s top-four hopes","bodyText":"Northampton’s coaching consultant, Alan Gaffney, wondered before the match whether some of his players had switched off early: as early as last October, it could be argued, given their wretched form since then. But the sight of their oldest rivals, together with the incentive of only a second Premiership double over the Tigers, enlivened a side that started the afternoon with a mathematical chance of being relegated, spirit steering them to an unlikely victory. The last time Northampton faced Leicester, in September, they were also coming off the back of a heavy defeat by Saracens, but there was hope in their air then. A wretched season in which they have conceded more points and tries than any other club in the Premiership, and are fortunate to avoid more than a passing flirtation with relegation, now contains a sliver of silver after they pushed their neighbours out of the play-offs. There may have been a gulf between the teams in terms of league positions but there was far less of a gap on the field. Leicester dominated in terms of possession and territory but they led for only three minutes and committed a series of such egregious errors in attack and defence that they did not look worth their customary place in the top four, highlighting the general mediocrity of the Premiership. Their lineout creaked and they were twice penalised in the scrum after being shoved backwards. The second occasion was when Northampton’s replacement prop Alex Waller was in the sin-bin, and they blew a series of line-breaks through wasteful passing and poor support lines. Leicester conceded their first two tries after their flanker Valentino Mapapalangi positioned himself in no man’s land around the fringes, covering neither the ball-carrier nor a potential receiver. The match was held up for 10 minutes 13 seconds after it started. The Northampton captain, Rob Horne, got his head in the wrong position trying to tackle Graham Kitchener and was strapped on to a stretcher before being taken to an ambulance. Northampton took time to recover from the blow and should have been at least two tries down following Matt Toomua breaks that came to nothing, before striking with their first attack. The prop Paul Hill ran through a gap created by Mapapalangi’s poor positioning and eight phases later Ben Foden scored on the left. Northampton had last won in the Premiership here in 2007 and their only survivor from that day, Stephen Myler, kicked a penalty to put them 10 points ahead. Leicester stirred themselves to take the lead through tries by Telusa Veainu, who had earlier dropped the ball with the line beckoning, and Toomua after Kitchener had charged down Cobus Reinach’s clearance, but instead of taking charge the Tigers conceded a soft try from a lineout when Teimana Harrison tapped the ball back inside to Reinach, who waved goodbye to Mapapalangi. Three minutes after the restart Ahsee Tuala finished off a swaggering move to extend Saints’ lead to 12 points. The harder Leicester tried, the more mistakes they made, three George Ford penalties giving them the consolation of a bonus point. They lost five of their own lineouts, three in Northampton’s 22, failed to establish a dominance up front, were thwarted at the breakdown by Harrison and Jamie Gibson, penalised six times in attack, and when they did create space, Toomua squandered a two-man overlap by throwing a pass behind Luke Hamilton. Jonah Holmes did cross the line five minutes from the end but only after George Worth had cleared his path by blocking Piers Francis. Northampton, who had collapsed in the second half against Saracens the previous week, for once found strength in adversity and two Myler penalties kept them ahead. Their new director of rugby, Chris Boyd, will be at Franklin’s Gardens next week, formulating his plans for next season, and what this campaign has shown is that the gap in the Premiership is between the top two and the rest. Leicester dropped to fifth and their next match is at home to the team immediately above them, Newcastle, before they finish at Sale, who have top-six aspirations. The Tigers have lost four home league matches this season, their worst run since 2003-04, the last time they were doubled by Northampton. “The obstruction decision was brutal but what today showed was that if you do not control the ball and keep teams alive, it does not matter where they are in the league, they will beat you,” said their director of rugby, Matt O’Connor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/14/wasps-worcester-premiership-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T16:16:09Z","webTitle":"Christian Wade double helps Wasps to win over struggling Worcester","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/wasps-worcester-premiership-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/14/wasps-worcester-premiership-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Christian Wade double helps Wasps to win over struggling Worcester","bodyText":"The pitches are firming up, the clouds are clearing and Wasps are coming into their own. They barely moved out of third gear, certainly in the second half, but, such is the torque of their sports cars on the wide outside, third gear was quite enough. Worcester can play a bit, as two late consolation tries attest, but a back three of Christian Wade (two further towards the Premiership try-scoring record), Elliot Daly and Willie Le Roux is enough to terrify even the best of those they might encounter in the play-offs. This bonus-point win consolidates their position in the race for the top four, tucking them in behind Saracens in third place. After their hiccup at the death last week against Sale, Wasps know the margin for error is small, particularly if they harbour hopes of a home tie, but their quest for that bonus point was almost undone by two yellow cards in the second half, the second of which was a scandal. “It’s difficult for us to say anything but that was a real harsh call,” said Dai Young of the card. “We all say, you win some, you lose some, but we’re not winning too many at the minute. If we hadn’t got the bonus point, we’d have been kicking ourselves.” All the more so given that Guy Thompson thought he had scored the fourth try, worked sweetly into the corner in the 65th minute. After a review, the try was chalked off and the yellow card awarded instead to Jimmy Gopperth, who was adjudged to have upended the hefty Andrew Kitchener with his fingetip as he leapt, goalie-style, for a high ball in the buildup. The latter’s treatment for injury did more to alert the authorities than any actual contact. But no matter: Josh Bassett snatched an intercept moments later to earn Wasps the extra point, a measure of justice at least, no thanks to common sense. Wasps were well worth the maximum points, however much they lost their way in the second half, with Danny Cipriani withdrawn as a precaution at the end of the first. By then, their pace out wide had proved too much. You can’t defend against pace, they say, and Wade, Daly, Le Roux et al laid on quite the demonstration of that truth. Each of Wade’s first-half double was set up by the creative axis of Cipriani and Le Roux. Wade burned off Chris Pennell all too easily for the first, and for the second it was Bryce Heem who did not stand a chance against English rugby’s deadliest finisher. In between, Joe Launchbury, magnificent in all departments, drove over from close range after Wasps had caused more havoc out wide. Two Gopperth penalties to a reply from Dorian Jones had Wasps 23-3 up at the break. Jack Willis’s yellow card for a tip tackle gave the home team something to think about in the second half, and the game began to meander until those controversial moments with a quarter of an hour to go. Now 30-3 down, Worcester responded with tries from Dean Hammond and Josh Adams in the last two minutes, but they had been well beaten. Wasps are live contenders."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/15/observer-view-uk-immigration-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on the UK’s increasingly harsh immigration policy | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/observer-view-uk-immigration-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/observer-view-uk-immigration-policy","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on the UK’s increasingly harsh immigration policy","bodyText":"This week marks the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell’s infamous “rivers of blood” speech, delivered to a meeting of the Conservative Political Centre in Birmingham and widely condemned for its anti-immigrant, racist sentiment. It led to his immediate sacking from the Conservative shadow cabinet. But though shunned by the political establishment, he won significant public support for his assertion that immigration was a “preventable evil”, akin to “watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre”. And the context of his speech was significant: it came in the wake of the then Labour government’s shameful immigration policy, which revoked the guaranteed right of Asian Kenyans with British passports to settle in Britain and left them stateless, rightly described as “racial discrimination” by the European Commission on Human Rights. The past five decades have shown how wrong Powell was: as Britain has grown more diverse, it has become markedly less xenophobic. Yes, there remain significant problems: Islamophobia is on the rise, while reported hate crimes spiked in the wake of the Brexit referendum. But this should not obscure the fact that Britain has on the whole become more, not less, tolerant in recent years. Attitudes towards immigration have improved: 55% of people think immigration is good for the country, compared to 40% in 2011. More than 90% of Britons believe immigration is essential but that economic need should determine its levels, and the proportion of people whose hostility to immigration is driven by opposition to all ethnicities or religions other than their own has shrunk from 13% in 2011 to 5% today. What is striking is that despite this profound shift in attitudes – and latent public support for an economically pragmatic immigration policy – echoes of those racist immigration policies of the 1960s can still be detected. Theresa May is pursuing an approach that seems designed to ape the far right and appeal to the sliver of outright xenophobia that still exists. What else could explain her arbitrary target to reduce migration to “tens of thousands” or her objective to turn Britain into such a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants that they are driven out? Not only is there little evidence that the latter is working in encouraging illegal immigrants to leave – it is making the problem worse by driving them further underground, vulnerable to trafficking and slavery. Another sickening consequence is that it is catching in its cruel tangles people who have been legally resident in Britain for decades. Many in the “Windrush generation”, who came to Britain from Commonwealth countries with their parents, are now finding that if they never applied for a passport it has become almost impossible to prove their rights, leaving them unable to access NHS care or take jobs, facing deportation to a country they do not know. The callousness doesn’t stop there. The clampdown on spousal visas has left thousands of children living without one of their parents. And the “hostile environment” policy has obliged doctors, landlords and bank staff to effectively become border policemen. One study found landlords less willing to rent to people with foreign accents or names for fear of getting the paperwork wrong. Far from keeping pace with social change, government policy is dragging us backwards. Meanwhile, incompetent Home Office bureaucracy, the scrapping of legal aid and the removal of the right to appeal against decisions in many types of case have removed any sense of natural justice from the immigration system. Asylum seekers are locked up like criminals; last year, the government tried to close the scheme to take unaccompanied child refugees from Syria. This is politics at its most cowardly and shaming. A government that is loading the burden of austerity on low-income families with children, with few positive solutions to offer in the wake of the financial crisis, slyly nods to an immigrant scapegoat as one cause of the country’s economic woes. History has proved Enoch Powell conclusively wrong: Britain has never been more tolerant and diverse. So why does our government insist on acting as though he was right?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/15/jeremy-corbyn-antisemitism-urged-protect-labour-mps","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T06:00:05Z","webTitle":"Corbyn is urged to protect Labour MPs who protested against antisemitism","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/15/jeremy-corbyn-antisemitism-urged-protect-labour-mps","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/15/jeremy-corbyn-antisemitism-urged-protect-labour-mps","fields":{"headline":"Corbyn is urged to protect Labour MPs who protested against antisemitism","bodyText":"Britain’s two largest Jewish groups are calling on Jeremy Corbyn to protect MPs who attended a protest against antisemitism in his party, before their meeting with the Labour leader later this month. Some of the Labour MPs who attended the demonstration three weeks ago faced a backlash from the left of the party. One MP faced a local motion of condemnation, although it was eventually defeated. Writing in the Observer, Jonathan Goldstein, chair of the Jewish Leadership Council, and Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said that the Labour MPs who attended the protest needed the leader’s support as part of the fight against antisemitism. “Courageous Labour MPs spoke with great pain, honesty and integrity about the problem,” they write. “We knew, as did most of the crowd, the huge risk that these MPs were taking for being there. It is these MPs and many other councillors and members who are now the most vital opponents of antisemitism. “Inevitably, the MPs are facing a perverse backlash for opposing antisemitism and for caring about their party. Corbyn’s leadership in defence of them will now be a crucial component of his promised commitment to combating antisemitism.” The two groups said they acted after a series of allegations of antisemitism by Labour members. The party is facing a backlog of disciplinary cases. The groups have agreed to a meeting with Corbyn on 24 April and said they would use it to ask him to deal with “issues of leadership, of education, ensuring an effective, transparent and just disciplinary process and tackling a culture of ‘victim-blaming’ that has severely compounded matters. “Last month’s protest was a necessary moment of catharsis, as painful for Labour as it was for our community, but we cannot now return to ‘business as usual’. We need this to be a genuine turning point and will do everything we can to make it so. We can achieve this together if Corbyn can fulfil his pledge to be our “militant ally” in the fight against antisemitism and demonstrate his understanding that what is now needed is firm action and not just words.” Corbyn has vowed to tackle antisemitism and has apologised for appearing to defend a mural that he has subsequently acknowledged to have been antisemitic. A recent survey by Deltapoll found that 51% of voters believe Labour has a problem with antisemitism to some degree. It found 17% think it is “riddled” with people holding antisemitic views, including Corbyn. The same proportion think “pockets” of antisemitism exist within Labour, including its leader. Two-fifths of 2017 Labour voters (39%) think that people within the party hold antisemitic views. A Labour spokeswoman said: “There is absolutely no place in our party or our movement for antisemitism. Jeremy has repeatedly made this clear. Jeremy has asked Jennie Formby, Labour’s new general secretary, to make rooting out antisemitism her number one priority.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/15/syria-assad-doing-nothing-disastrous-policy-missile-strikes","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T04:59:04Z","webTitle":"Syria has paid a terrible price for the west’s disastrous policy of doing nothing | Andrew Rawnsley","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/syria-assad-doing-nothing-disastrous-policy-missile-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/syria-assad-doing-nothing-disastrous-policy-missile-strikes","fields":{"headline":"Syria has paid a terrible price for the west’s disastrous policy of doing nothing","bodyText":"Let’s cut the canting. No one thinks, not those ordering them and not those opposing them, that the missile strikes against the Assad regime will influence the outcome of the catastrophe in Syria. That pass was sold long since. If there was an opportunity for America, Britain and their allies to make a difference for the better, the chance was missed many, many deaths ago. What we are witness to – on the part of both the leaders of the western democracies and their critics – is a tableau of actors striking postures designed to make the players feel better about themselves. This posing can never rewrite the blood-drenched history of a seven-year conflict that has turned Syria into a charnel house and shredded international norms about the conduct of war. The proximate cause of this crisis is the chemical attack on Douma last weekend. After years of unmasterly inactivity by the democracies, it is that atrocity that drew attention back to what is happening in Syria and finally stirred punitive action against Bashar al-Assad. In the words of the ineffable Donald Trump, the retaliatory strikes are supposed to demonstrate to “animal Assad” that there is a “price to pay” for the dictator’s use of banned weaponry. In the more measured language of Theresa May, “we cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to be normalised”. Yet the normalisation of chemical weapons is precisely what has already happened in Syria. Assad’s regime has time and again used chemical warfare to slaughter its own people, as it has also deployed hideous “conventional” weapons such as dropping barrel bombs and fuel-air bombs on civilian areas to inflict mass casualties. Over seven years of relentless savagery in Syria, the hands of the leaders of the western powers have been wedged firmly under their bottoms. They have been encouraged to maintain this impotent posture by legislators too feeble to grip the dilemmas posed by Syria and voters weary of engagement with the hard parts of the world. Listening to both their public pronouncements and their private calculations, the abiding impression is that this belated and limited action by Washington, London and Paris is not driven by any conviction that these strikes will make any meaningful difference. They won’t even stop Assad manufacturing more chemical weapons if he chooses to do so. Missiles are flying mainly to soothe guilt about repeated earlier failures to act. Even so, I give these leaders a little more credit than I can find for those whose only counsel is to do absolutely nothing. At least some of these belated interventionists are wrestling with a genuine dilemma. Action over this chemical attack, when so many previous atrocities have been given a free pass, looks like therapy by Tomahawk, a gesture, not a strategy. But to let yet another use of chemical weapons happen without any form of response would have given a complete sense of impunity to the Assad regime and its sponsors in the Kremlin. Every dictatorship on the planet has been getting the message that there is no penalty for the acquisition and use of weapons prohibited since the First World War and that has chilling implications for future conflicts. The other side of our tableau of posturers is composed of those who oppose this action as they have clamoured against all previous attempts to do something about Syria. The non-interventionists come in two categories. There are the “it’s nothing to do with us” brigade who declare that “we haven’t got a dog in the Syrian fight”. Mainly to be found on the hand-washing right, the cold brutality with which they express their indifference to so much human suffering has the sole merit of being candid. Less honest, not least with themselves, are the self-proclaimed peace-lovers. Mainly to be found on the hand-wringing left, they are too busy looking in the mirror admiring their own halos to face the moral challenges posed by a situation like Syria. Jeremy Corbyn opposes this weekend’s action on the grounds that it “risks escalating further” what is “an already devastating conflict”. The Labour leader and those who share his worldview are consistent. Do nothing has been their unvaried policy for the past seven years of carnage. There is no doubt that they can expect support from a lot of a domestic electorate turned allergic to engaging with abroad, especially the Middle East. As the non-interventionists have preached inaction, the death toll in Syria has been remorselessly – what’s the word, Jeremy? – escalated by the Assad regime and its allies. Whenever pressed to say what they would do, the non-interventionists fall back on calling for “negotiations” and more effort at the United Nations. They have to be aware that Russia has repeatedly used its security council veto to shield Assad from any effective action by the UN, most recently by blocking an independent investigation into the chemical attack on Douma. While the non-interventionists have talked about talking, the Assad regime and its backers in the Kremlin and Iran have been free to go on killing. Some argue that the fatal turning point was the summer of 2013 when Assad’s use of chemical weaponry defied a “red line” drawn by Barack Obama, who then failed to enforce it. That has become the main reference point of the British argument because it was then that David Cameron failed to secure parliamentary approval for participation in punitive air strikes. When MPs turned him down, the then prime minister abandoned any further effort with a huffy “I get that”. The people who really “got it” were the Syrian civilians who continued to die in their thousands. It is possible that intervention at that point might have made some difference. In truth, the west made its gravest decision not to act earlier when Assad responded with vicious suppression to the original uprising against his dictatorship in 2011. Rather than offer succour to the secular democrats who rebelled against the regime, the west stood by as he imprisoned, tortured, executed and crushed those who cried out for freedom. Every force in Syria was provided with resources and weapons except for the liberal opposition. Humanitarian initiatives could have been attempted, such as creating safe havens for civilians and imposing no-fly zones to impede Assad’s ability to slaughter his own people. They weren’t even tried. No meaningful pressure was applied to bring him to the negotiating table. The opposition become dominated by jihadists. Regional powers and Russia moved into the voids left by western inaction. It is not provable whether earlier intervention would have altered the course of Syria’s tragic history. Non-interventionists said then, as they say now, that anything that the west does only makes things worse. That we can’t prove either. What we can see is how bad things have become and it is hard to conceive how exactly it could be worse. After seven years of failing to act in Syria, we can audit where a non-interventionist policy has got us. It has been an utter disaster in every respect. The United Nations struggles to put an exact figure on how many people have died, but best estimates put the number at around half a million. More than 5 million Syrians are refugees abroad and more than 6 million have been internally displaced. Assad has flattened cities and smashed through nearly every international taboo about the conduct of war. The Syrian dictator is massacring his way to victory and there is no one who thinks that this weekend’s missile strikes will in any way impede him. The conflict has inexorably widened and now consumes the region as Syria has been turned into a battlefield for proxy conflicts between regional players. Russia has been encouraged in its belligerence. The west looks helpless. Dictators the world over have been emboldened to believe that they can crush opposition using the most barbaric methods and the rest of the world will do nothing to stop them. Those striving for freedom have been commensurately disheartened. The rule of international law has been weakened. Action has consequences and they are not always the ones intended and hoped for. That was the grisly lesson of Iraq. Inaction also has consequences. Doing nothing can have a price every bit as high. I’d think better of the non-interventionists if they’d ever once admit that. Inaction has been a terrible choice in Syria. Interventionists have been rightly obliged to own all that went horribly wrong in Iraq. Non-interventionists, the horrors of Syria are on you. • Andrew Rawnsley is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/15/amir-khan-return-to-britain-phil-lo-greco-liverpool","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T06:59:08Z","webTitle":"Amir Khan must conquer big doubts on homecoming against Phil Lo Greco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/15/amir-khan-return-to-britain-phil-lo-greco-liverpool","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/15/amir-khan-return-to-britain-phil-lo-greco-liverpool","fields":{"headline":"Amir Khan must conquer big doubts on homecoming against Phil Lo Greco","bodyText":"Amir Khan is not so much a prophet in his own land as a generator of profit in someone else’s. So, on his return to the United Kingdom after nearly five years, when he seeks to rebuild his career in Liverpool on Saturday evening against the competent 33-year-old Canadian Phil Lo Greco, he has a few hearts to win back. The narrative running through Khan’s career since he returned from the Athens Olympics in 2004 as a buzzy teenager with a silver medal on his chest and a silver spoon thrust metaphorically in his mouth, has been ambivalent at best. Naked racism mixed with envy informed much of the subsequent resentment towards a flashy young man who had the audacity to spend big when the money started to flow, and the sense of disconnection with those who had looked to him as almost the perfect cross-culture hero the country craved was strengthened in the louder corners of boxing arenas when Khan decided to seek his fortune in the US. He said he would conquer the world, and he did. However, after taking Andreas Kotelnik’s WBA light-welterweight belt in Manchester in 2009, and defending it five months later in Newcastle, he left for the bright lights of Las Vegas and New York. He stopped off first at Madison Square Garden to quieten the challenge of Paulie Malignaggi in 2010, and nine of his next 11 fights were in the United States. They could not get enough of the exciting young punch-thrower with the suspect chin. There were glorious nights, some on pay-per-view, and not so wonderful experiences. The last time Khan stepped into a ring, in front of 20,000 fans in Las Vegas on 7 May, 2016, the much bigger Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez came from behind to knock him cold in the sixth. Anyone who was ringside that night had good cause to wonder if Khan would or should ever fight again. But he has never lacked heart. Even when Breidis Prescott put him in dreamland for the first time, fully a decade ago, and Danny García did the same in 2012, he instinctively tried to right the ship. Yet, at 31 now and with at best a handful of fights left in him, it was mildly disconcerting to hear him say the other day: “I don’t think those knockouts are going to affect me. I would rather get knocked out by one punch against Canelo than take numerous punches. I’ve not taken that many really. I’m quite lucky that way.” He added: “Everything is good. Honestly – and I’m not just saying this, but in training I’m better than ever. I’m smarter now. I’m at the peak of my career. I feel better now than I did when I was 28. I’ve had my best performances after I get beaten. I go back to the drawing board and work on my skills and become a better fighter.” Is it delusion, greed or blind optimism that drives him on? His friends hope it’s mostly the latter. Cynics still wonder. Two years is a long time away from the competitive heat, especially in the lighter divisions where reflexes never quicken and experience does little to repair past wounds. If anything, taking punishment becomes normal for some fighters. Still, he is determined to start fresh, having signed a three-fight deal with Matchroom and Sky. Last month he split with his West Coast tutor, Virgil Hunter, in strange circumstances, the veteran American trainer withdrawing from the scene with unspecified health problems and refusing to answer calls. Khan then picked up with the seasoned Joe Goossen, who has guided such fine champions as Joel Casamayor, Rafael and Gabriel Ruelas, the late Diego Corrales and Michael Nunn. Will he be the same fighter against Lo Greco as he was even two years ago? “It’s hard to tell because I’m one of those fighters who has a huge heart, I love getting into tear-ups,” he said. “I have a good boxing brain, a lot of skills and I like to mix it up. It just depends. Whatever Phil Lo Greco brings, I’m going to have answers for in the fight.” It really would be the end for Khan if he lost to Lo Greco, who has never fought for a proper title in 12 years as a professional, and who lasted just three rounds against a young and developing Errol Spence Jr three years ago, on the undercard of Shawn Porter’s win over Adrien Broner. Lo Greco has won 28 times in 31 bouts. He is unlikely to make it 29 at the Echo Arena on Saturday night."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/apr/15/sports-minister-tracey-crouch-safe-standing","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T06:59:07Z","webTitle":"Sports minister Tracey Crouch is ducking the facts on safe standing | Daniel Taylor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/15/sports-minister-tracey-crouch-safe-standing","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/apr/15/sports-minister-tracey-crouch-safe-standing","fields":{"headline":"Sports minister Tracey Crouch is ducking the facts on safe standing","bodyText":"Over the last week I have been reminded of the time Richard Caborn was appointed sports minister and, in his first week in the job, took part in an interview with the BBC’s Clare Balding in which he was given five relatively simple questions about sporting events of the time and inadvertently showed this was not, after all, his specialist subject. Caborn did not know Martin Johnson was captain of the British &amp; Irish Lions rugby team that was touring Australia. He could not name a single jockey going to be at Royal Ascot or another European golfer apart from Colin Montgomerie competing in the US Open. He knew only one of the tennis players from that day’s semi-finals at Queen’s and when he was asked to name England’s cricket coach his reply was more in hope than expectation. “The Aussie?” he asked. Close. It was Duncan Fletcher, from Zimbabwe. “I did not intend to inflict complete and utter humiliation on the newly appointed minister for sport,” Balding said afterwards, “but it seems that he did that rather successfully for himself.” Headlines included: Is this The Most Stupid Sports Minister Ever? (Daily Mirror) and Are You Dumb Enough to be Sports Minister? (Daily Mail). Caborn consoled himself by keeping in his wallet a Mail article frothing with indignation about the appointment of a foreigner as England football manager, and another from the same newspaper trumpeting the rise of Sven-Goran Eriksson’s team. He was, however, honest enough to accept what was blindingly obvious. “I made an absolute bollocks of it.” Not just him, either. When Helen Grant took the same position in 2013, she was in trouble from the moment an interviewer from Meridian TV asked who had won the FA Cup that year. Grant did not seem to be aware of Wigan’s defeat of Manchester City. “Oh, come on – help – FA Cup holders?” She did, however, have a valiant stab at it. “Manchester United” was her answer. “Because it is my favourite club.” Grant could not name the women’s Wimbledon champion or the captain of England’s rugby union side. She didn’t have a clue which Paralympics athlete won the most golds at London 2012 and, if she wasn’t aware of Ben Watson’s last-minute winner for Wigan, she was never likely to know what year Maidstone dropped out of the Football League. Except, as the Conservative MP for Maidstone, she might have been expected to have a rough idea. “Last year?” she asked, taking whispered advice from one of her press aides and complaining of “these difficult questions”. Not quite. It was 1992. It is fair to say, therefore, that the bar has not been set tremendously high over the years and, if nothing else, at least Tracey Crouch has avoided falling into the same trap as some of her predecessors. Crouch is an FA-registered coach who has worked in grassroots football and describes herself as an avid supporter of Tottenham. I cannot recall too many faux pas during her three years in office and, until the last week, there wasn’t a great deal of evidence to suggest she had too much power and too little knowledge. That was the point the issue of safe standing came on the agenda and it must have slipped her mind, perhaps, that Spurs, her own team, have designed the new White Hart Lane in the hope they can introduce the rail seats that are commonplace in mainland Europe. Presumably she wasn’t aware that Richard Arnold, the managing director of Manchester United, had confirmed he was “applying constant encouragement” for safe standing at Old Trafford, that Arsenal want the same at the Emirates, that Manchester City are equally keen and, crucially, that the position on Merseyside has shifted over the last year or so. Liverpool’s supporters have voted 88% in favour and the club have said they “will listen to the views of our fans and look to offer the best possible match-going experience in whatever form that may take place”. Everton, in turn, have included rail seats in their plans for their new stadium at Bramley Moore dock. All of which makes it curious, to say the least, that Crouch wants us to believe “there is no desire among the top clubs to change”. Really? Chelsea have also incorporated safe standing into their plans for the new Stamford Bridge. West Brom made the formal application that has just been knocked back. Brighton, Burnley, West Ham, Crystal Palace, Huddersfield, Swansea and Watford have all publicly backed safe standing. Stoke and Southampton are privately supportive. Bournemouth say they are open-minded. Newcastle have been to see how it works at Celtic, and Leicester, perhaps, are the only club whose position is not entirely clear. They say they are keeping a watching brief. That’s the Premier League dealt with. As for the Football League, it’s even more emphatic. The league was given a mandate by its 72 clubs as far back as 2013 to pursue safe standing and its stated policy is that supporters should be given a choice of whether to stand or have seated accommodation. Nothing can happen, however, until the government wises up and, plainly, that isn’t going to be straightforward when it involves cutting through a hotchpotch of stubbornness, ignorance and the now-familiar parliamentary disdain for football supporters that goes back to the Spitting Image years of Margaret Thatcher insisting on being called “Sir”, Kenneth Baker morphing into a slug, Douglas Hurd talking like one of the Daleks and Colin Moynihan going by the title of Miniature of Sport. To sum up how crackers it all is, start with the response from the Football Safety Officers’ Association asking why “the government is choosing to ignore what may prove to be a safer alternative”. The clue with safe standing is in the name: it’s safe, and certainly less likely to cause injury than the alternative of thousands of people standing behind rows of tipped-up plastic seats. It will improve atmosphere, make English football more attractive and, in theory, lead to cheaper tickets, and if Crouch has been briefed so badly she thinks it is only a “vocal minority” who want it this way perhaps she should start paying more attention and ask around among her fellow Spurs supporters. In the last four years, the surveys carried out by the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust have shown 85 to 96% in favour of a change. Arsenal’s fans have voted 96%, Everton’s 92%, Leicester’s 86%, Huddersfield’s 96% and so on. Why would the Football Supporters’ Federation spend years campaigning for it otherwise? Add in the fact West Brom’s application was submitted by the deputy chair of the FSOA and supported by the club’s safety advisory group – including representatives of West Midlands police, the fire and ambulance services and the Sports Ground Safety Authority – and that’s a lot of people whose combined knowledge, dare it be said, might just outweigh that of the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford. Perhaps it might make a difference when a delegation from Celtic speaks to the all-party parliamentary football group in a couple of weeks about the club’s positive experiences of safe standing. Then again, I’m not so sure I would put my faith in that group, either. When Roy Hodgson was invited to Westminster before the last World Cup, one MP suggested that if he wanted to bring through younger players the Football Association should impose an age limit of 25 or under for the national team (a suggestion that would have meant keeping only nine players from the previous squad). In the meantime, perhaps our sports minister might reflect, Sunday being the 29th anniversary of Hillsborough, that it was always a myth that standing caused that disaster. Maybe she would be decent enough to name a single club that is actively against the idea when, by my reckoning, it is possibly 92-0. Let us know how something that is acclaimed throughout the sport as a huge success in Glasgow can be illegal 120 miles south-east in Newcastle. And maybe stop to consider why so many people are starting to think that maybe it is you that is the problem now."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/15/after-rape-trials-is-court-of-public-opinion-now-trumping-the-law","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:03:04Z","webTitle":"After rape trials, is the court of public opinion now trumping the law? | Sarah Ditum","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/after-rape-trials-is-court-of-public-opinion-now-trumping-the-law","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/after-rape-trials-is-court-of-public-opinion-now-trumping-the-law","fields":{"headline":"After rape trials, is the court of public opinion now trumping the law?","bodyText":"Why should women respect the law, when the law was written by and for men who have no respect for women? It’s a question that the suffragettes dispatched briskly when their agenda of arson and bombings was attacked: if men refused to let women make laws, women had no reason to obey laws. And while men were deploring the damage to their property, women themselves were being damaged by men: denigrated, abused, assaulted and sexually exploited. For Christabel Pankhurst, one of the strongest arguments in favour of votes for women was that “when they are citizens, women… will have the power to enact laws for their protection”. A century into female suffrage, the law still isn’t working for women. That’s not to say that the situation hasn’t improved vastly since the 19th century. Men can no longer call on the “nagging and shagging” defence when they murder their wives and girlfriends. (If a man could convince a court that his victim was “disobedient” or unfaithful, the court would often decide that he was justified in killing her.) Marital rape is now recognised as a crime, not merely men exercising their reasonable sexual entitlement within the marriage contract. Coercive control is understood, finally, as a form of male violence. But still many women look at the legal system and know, instinctively, that it wasn’t made for them. Take the words of the complainant in the recent trial of two Ulster rugby players for rape. “I’m not going to the police,” she texted a friend the morning after her encounter with the players. “I’m not going up against Ulster Rugby. Yeah because that’ll work.” To say it didn’t work is not to question the outcome but raises a wider issue. The players, Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding, were both found unanimously not guilty (as were their friends Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison, who had been charged with lesser offences relating to the same events). So Jackson and Olding are not rapists. Yet reading the court reports, it’s difficult to believe that what happened was justice for women. An act can fall short of criminal and still be a deep and awful wrong. WhatsApp messages and texts introduced as evidence during the trial revealed that these men, these non-rapists, spoke about women with the deepest, most dehumanising contempt. “Any sluts get fucked?”; “Pumped a girl with Jacko on Monday. Roasted her. Then another on Tuesday night”; “Love Belfast sluts”. The jury settled the legal formality of their guilt, but, as with myriad other men, the case to answer doesn’t end with an acquittal. That’s why women were protesting outside the Ulster Rugby grounds on Friday. That’s why Jackson and Olding have been sacked from Ulster Rugby. This makes some men twitchy, imagining an encroaching dystopia where men will lose their livelihood simply on a woman’s say-so. (The fact that women live in a very present dystopia of sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination is, unsurprisingly, of less concern to these worried men.) Jackson and Olding are not guilty, so why should they be punished? What if #ibelieveher means that men can never be presumed innocent? The case of the man known only as Nick, whose lurid allegations of a child sex ring in Westminster proved to be spectacularly unfounded, shows that testimony is only one kind of evidence and, like all evidence, it may be misleading. But what #ibelieveher answers is the tendency of the legal system to fail to respond to the painful experience of women. For centuries, women’s stories have been discounted, dismissed and ignored. John Worboys was able to rape scores of women because police chose not to believe his victims. Then, when Worboys had been convicted, the parole board repeated the mistake: it failed to consider his wider offending, referring only to the sample brought to trial, and released him early. It was a decision that showed utter contempt for victims of sexual violence, and one that, thanks to the work of the Centre for Women’s Justice, was rightly reversed. Jackson and Olding’s sacking, in any case, is not about #ibelieveher. It’s about #ibelievehim. The words were not evidence of rape, but they’re certainly sufficient for us to make our own casual judgments about what kind of men they are. They’re the kind of men who think women are “sluts” to be “pumped” and “fucked”. If women really are to be citizens, and not objects, then such misogyny should be an absolute bar to acceptance in society. You only have to look at the president of the US to see how rarely men face any kind of consequences for their woman-hating. But it’s in these consequences, such as those faced by Jackson and Olding, that the world begins to change. Their sacking represents a communal decision that women shouldn’t be treated as they treated women. It tells other men that they no longer have the licence to make such comments, to commit such acts. It tells women that we do, after all, matter, and we will – eventually – be listened to. That change needs to go much further than these two men losing their jobs. And the law needs to go further still to catch up. The justice system was not made for women and women have every reason to be suspicious of the police, the CPS and the judiciary. But pressure from feminists has led to the partial reform of all those institutions and with determined work from groups such as the Centre for Women’s Justice, Christabel Pankhurst’s vision of women enacting laws for their own protection can, finally, become a reality. • Sarah Ditum is a freelance writer on politics, culture and lifestyle"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/syria-conflict-assad-putin-russia-iran-israel","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T14:02:57Z","webTitle":"Syria: who are the key players in the conflict?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/syria-conflict-assad-putin-russia-iran-israel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/syria-conflict-assad-putin-russia-iran-israel","fields":{"headline":"Syria: who are the key players in the conflict?","bodyText":"After seven years of murderous conflict, Syria is now the battlefield for a multitude of conflicts, some intertwined, some entirely unrelated and with their own logic, driven by a cast of regional and world powers each with their own agenda. The overnight airstrikes only serve to sharpen their rivalry. Here are the key players: The Assad regime Syrian president Bashar al-Assad is increasingly confident of his survival in office, shored up and propelled forward by his Russian and Iranian backers. His aim is to consolidate his position in the west of the country, eliminating the last pockets of resistance, and then expand his control eastwards. Use of chemical weapons appears to reflect a desire to achieve this at minimal cost by spreading terror. Denying Assad that weapon with airstrikes may slow him down but is unlikely to threaten his grip. Russia For Vladimir Putin, the struggle in Syria is emblematic of the central theme of his rule, the restoration of Russia as a great power, whose views and interests in the Middle East and beyond have to be taken into account. Helping the Assad regime to prevail is an all-or-nothing proposition, a test of strength with the west and the ground on which the spread of western-inspired regime change is finally repulsed. The airstrikes are a humiliation, especially after Russian officials threatened to shoot down incoming missiles and planes, but it is one that has to be swallowed. Putin is well aware of the dangers of head-on confrontation with the US and its allies. Iran Iran sees Syria as an essential buffer zone. The fall of Assad and the rise of a Sunni regime would be a strategic nightmare for them. But Tehran, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, also see Syria as a bridge to Hezbollah, their client militia in Lebanon that has done much of the heavy fighting in Syria. That puts Tehran in a position to pose a serious threat against Israel, which serves as insurance from Israeli attack. Despite posturing from Tehran, it is not looking for a confrontation with the US, and as long as airstrikes are directed only at chemical facilities, it will let them pass without response. Israel Iran’s gain in Syria is very much Israel’s loss. Israel is determined to disrupt Iranian lines of communication, control and supply to Hezbollah and keep Iranian-run militias well back from the line of separation at the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It prefers the US and Russia to restrain the Iranians, but if necessary Israel is likely to plunge in to southern Syria to confront the Iranians and create a buffer zone. It will want to draw in the US on its side in a wider role than counter-proliferation and counter-terrorsim. United States The mantra of the Trump administration is that it is only in Syria to fight Isis. Policing the use of chemical weapons with airstrikes is portrayed as an exceptional responsibility, driven by a national interest in non-proliferation. Trump has cut off the Obama policy of half-hearted and intermittent backing for rebel groups seen as moderate. But the Trump White House is also drawn by the desire to contain Iran, and that may yet pull the US deeper still into the battlefield. That is something that defence secretary James Mattis resisted in the latest wave of airstrikes but he may not prevail in the future. United Kingdom The UK sees its role as a partner in the anti-Isis coalition and sees its participation in strikes as an international non-proliferation responsibility, and part of the price of being a permanent member of the UN security council. London is also highly aware that the refusal to take part in planned punitive strikes in 2013 after an earlier chemical weapons attack weakened its relationship with Washington. France Emmanuel Macron has taken a particularly strong line on punishing chemical weapons use, and like the UK, France sees participation in such strikes as part of the burden of retaining its major power status, by policing non-proliferation norms. Paris also sees the anti-Isis fight as being a national security imperative, given that it has been one of Isis’s principal targets. Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan was initially one of the most vociferous advocates of regime change in Damascus, but now finds himself seeking accommodation with the regime and its backers to break up the Kurdish hold of the territory along the Turkish-Syrian border. His expeditionary “Olive Branch” incursion into Kurdish held territory, however, risks confrontation with the Americans, who see the Kurds as their most effective partner against Isis."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/14/two-boys-arrested-in-manchester-after-teenager-shot","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T13:04:57Z","webTitle":"Two boys arrested in Manchester after teenager shot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/14/two-boys-arrested-in-manchester-after-teenager-shot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/14/two-boys-arrested-in-manchester-after-teenager-shot","fields":{"headline":"Two boys arrested in Manchester after teenager shot","bodyText":"Two boys aged 16 and 14 have been arrested in connection with the shooting of a teenage boy in Manchester.

In a city so accustomed to war, lights were switched on – not off. And so were TVs. The US-led strike had been widely anticipated in the Syrian capital; its likely targets so well flagged that not many seemed to fear its consequences. “I slept through them,” said Khalil Abu Hamza, a resident who lived near the scene of one attack. “This was a pantomime anyway.” Closer to the centre of Syria’s capital, 31-year-old Taha said a familiar series of thumps in the middle distance alerted him to the air raid just before 4:30am. “I watched the news with my wife till 5:30,” he said. “No one went down from their homes. My mother who lives across the street from us wasn’t even bothered. Keep in mind, we are used to this. The Syrian flag has been raised in Umayyad Square as a sign of defiance.” By mid-morning in the Malki neighbourhood, a stronghold of the Assad regime, streets were bustling and the atmosphere calm, residents said. “People are out and about today,” said Samia, 34. “The streets are full and so is the mall. Old ladies are cleaning their carpets on the balcony. I don’t know why it is being blown out of proportion; we’ve been going through war for the past seven years. It’s just like any other day. We’ve grown a thick skin.” Nearby, a 58-year-old woman who refused to give her name said the tension of the past few days had quickly given way to relief when the sounds of the incoming missiles were replaced by silence. Life goes on normally today, she said. “I feel like it was done to save face. People are out on the streets today, shopping and buying groceries, this didn’t faze us.” Abu Haidar, 62, a supporter of the Syrian leader, said he had been waiting for the attack since Donald Trump’s belligerent tweet on Wednesday telling Russia – Syria’s ally – to “get ready” for incoming US missiles. “When we heard the explosions, we knew it was the Americans. People didn’t go down to shelters, didn’t scream, didn’t hide. We were out on the roofs of our buildings. The Damascus sky was lit up. But we knew this was all a front.” In a capital of divided loyalties, not everyone was pleased with the short sharp blitz, which targeted a scientific research base in western Damascus, as well as two other sites near Homs. Some who oppose the Assad regime were hoping for more than a carefully choreographed attack causing only contained damage. “We had high hopes, said Hussam, 40, a supporter of the anti-Assad opposition. “Unfortunately the only thing reverberating among us is disappointment. It wasn’t as intense as they’re making it sound. We have no more faith in the international community. Trump has been saying he will bomb for days now, like he’s warning Bashar ahead of time to be safe. If I am coming to murder someone, will I tell him beforehand? It’s ridiculous, it’s nonsense. They are laughing at us.” In Umayyad Square in central Damascus, residents waved Syrian flags and drove around honking horns. Soldiers in full combat uniform stood by relaxed, witnesses said. There were also small-scale celebrations in the Old City, and near the Sayyidah Zaynab shrine – a focal point for pro-Assad militias, especially Hezbollah. Checkpoints pepper a city still clearly embroiled in insurgency. Though this was the first US air blitz to hit Damascus, Israel has sent its jets to hit targets in Syria more than 100 times, and many of those strikes have been in or around the city. In Douma, the suburb on the outskirts of Damascus that was the scene of the chemical attack that killed at least 42 people and led to the strikes, there was little reaction on Saturday. There, as in capital itself, people were fearful about putting their name to their thoughts. Those who have remained – most were exiled to northern Syria after the opposition group defending it surrendered hours after the chemical strike – say they need to live in silence now. “I can’t talk anymore,” said a Douma resident who had spoken to the Guardian and Observer in the past two years. “Please don’t use my name anymore.” An inspection team from the international chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), arrived in Douma on Saturday to begin an investigation into the attack, which left more than 500 more impaired, according to reports passed to the World Health Organization. In pro-government areas of Damascus, there is little scepticism about the Syrian and Russian claims that the attack was either staged or didn’t happen at all. In anti-Assad households, there are growing fears that investigators will never get to the truth. Zaher al-Sakat, a former Syrian army brigadier, who helped lead the country’s chemical weapons capabilities until he deserted in 2013 said: “The regime will always find someone to defend their crimes. The Russians say their experts went in and found nothing to do with chemicals. While Lavrov the following day said chemicals were found. What is this nonsense? “How can people say he [Assad] will not benefit by using the chemical weapons? The evidence is the displacement of the people of Douma. The regime couldn’t advance, the media spokesperson of the national guard said on TV ‘you will see how they will fall like flies’. Chlorine was indeed used, there were missiles carrying sarin. We have all the documents and proof of his heinous crime. “Now the Russians are in charge of the scene, we are sure they will manipulate the evidence. We have over 50 corpses buried in an undisclosed location that are solid proof of the attack. We will not say where because the regime will be quick to destroy the evidence.” “Chlorine can be mixed with other chemicals. Syandric was mixed with chlorine in Douma. It affects the blood, redness of eyes, difficulty breathing. The Assad regime used the attack to kill the spirits of the people. It was a psychological attack to get people to give up.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/15/despite-trump-bluster-unclear-what-syria-strikes-accomplished","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T04:00:03Z","webTitle":"Despite Trump's bluster, it's unclear what Syria strikes accomplished","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/15/despite-trump-bluster-unclear-what-syria-strikes-accomplished","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/15/despite-trump-bluster-unclear-what-syria-strikes-accomplished","fields":{"headline":"Despite Trump's bluster, it's unclear what Syria strikes accomplished","bodyText":"The US, British and French jets that took off from the British base in Akrotiri in Cyprus, France, the Mediterranean and perhaps other bases in the Middle East never came close to the Russian or Syrian air defence systems. The cruise missiles fired by the US B1-B Lancer heavy bombers, French Rafales and UK Tornados GR4s – as well as from frigates in the Mediterranean – were among the world’s most modern. They had ranges of hundreds of kilometres, designed to be fired from a distance to avoid the risk of aircraft being targeted by Syria’s largely Soviet-era anti-aircraft missile systems. In the space of around 45 minutes, perhaps $50m (£35m) worth of weapons were fired. How effective the strikes in the early hours of Saturday were in targeting the chemical weapons facilities of the Assad regime is an open question, as are the claims by the Russian military that Syria took down 71 of more than 100 missiles launched. For its part, the Pentagon countered that assessment, saying no missiles were intercepted and calling the strikes “precise, overwhelming and effective”, adding that it successfully hit every target. The missiles launched were among some of the most sophisticated in the countries’ arsenals and included the US military’s JASSM cruise missile, which was used in combat for the first time, according to reports. As a demonstration of military firepower, it appears to have been as staged (with ample prior warning to Russia and, in that case Syria as well, as France admitted) as it was extremely limited in its scope, leaving most of the Syrian military’s key assets untouched. Prime minister Theresa May conceded as much by describing the strike as “limited and targeted”, with no intention of toppling Assad or intervening more widely in the war. In the circumstances, Russian forces, particularly those manning the sophisticated S-400 anti-aircraft missile batteries at the naval base at Tartus, were forewarned of the strikes and tracked the incoming missiles but did not engage their systems to prevent them. That was left to the Syrian air defences, the most modern of which is the Russian-supplied, short-range Pantsir S-1 system, which has an anti-missile capability and which some reports suggest Russia may have recently upgraded for the Syrian military. The claims to have intercepted such a high proportion of the missiles were made by colonel general Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian military’s general staff, who insisted that the strikes had not caused any casualties and that the Syrian military facilities targeted had suffered only minor damage. Although Rudskoi added that Moscow had “completely overhauled” the antiquated Syrian systems, the Russian claims over the success of the Syrian air defences still appear unlikely. Among the sites believed to have been struck were Barzeh, near Damascus, which fills chemical shells, according to western intelligence. Other facilities near Homs suspected chemical weapons store were also reportedly struck. But despite the use of chemical weapons on multiple occasions in Syria, the death toll from those attacks has been tiny in comparison with the wider death toll, not least that from crude and indiscriminate munitions such as the widely used barrel bombs. The real question now is not what damage the strikes have done to the Assad regime’s remaining chemical stockpiles but its wider calculus for the ongoing war. In the immediate aftermath, Assad strongly suggested that he intended to continue his war against the groups opposing him. Indeed, after an even more limited strike by the US in April 2017 aimed at deterring Assad from further use of chemical weapons, Syrian forces returned to episodic use of chlorine and perhaps other chemicals. Assad vowed to continue “fighting and crushing terrorism in every inch of the nation”. An equally significant, if perhaps more subtle, threat as the smoke cleared on Saturday morning was Moscow’s warning that it would reconsider whether to supply Syria and others with the far more modern S-300 anti-aircraft missile system. This system put on hold by Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2013 after talks with European Union leaders. While the supply of S-300s to Syria would be unlikely to trouble the US military, their widespread deployment would make it much more hazardous for Israeli jets to target Syria as they have done with relative impunity until recently, amid evidence that Russia is taking an increasingly tough line on Israel’s own strikes. “Considering what has happened, we consider it possible to reassess this question and not just as far as concerns Syria, but other countries too,” Rudskoi said. All of which points to the greatest unknowable of all in the aftermath of the strikes: what the longer term consequences will be in a febrile region amid escalating proxy conflicts and a rapid military buildup, with multiple tensions bubbling to the surface. The latest raids have starkly underlined once again how – despite the huge humanitarian cost of the war in Syria – the country has become the proving ground for some of the world’s most advanced weapons systems, deployed by the US and Russia. Trump and Putin have been engaged in something of a rhetorical arms race over weapons systems and their capabilities, with Putin boasting of new hypersonic nuclear missiles and high-speed submarines before the recent Russian elections. For its part, Russia earlier this year deployed its most advanced fighter jet to Syria, the stealth-capable Su-57, which is a fifth-generation, multi-role combat jet. What seems almost certain is that the war in Syria will grind bloodily on, becoming more complicated than ever. The biggest victims – as they have always been – will be Syria’s own citizens. Full of sound and fury – contrary to Donald Trump’s “mission accomplished” tweet – the strikes may not signify much in Syria’s wider war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/15/address-todays-racism-not-enoch-powell-speech-bbc","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:00:08Z","webTitle":"It’s today’s racism we should address, not Enoch Powell’s | Kenan Malik","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/address-todays-racism-not-enoch-powell-speech-bbc","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/address-todays-racism-not-enoch-powell-speech-bbc","fields":{"headline":"It’s today’s racism we should address, not Enoch Powell’s","bodyText":"Should Radio 4 have broadcast Enoch Powell’s infamous “rivers of blood” speech? Only parts of the speech were recorded at the time. So, spoken by an actor, this was the first time it had been heard in full since 1968. Few would dispute its historical significance, so why the controversy? Labour peer Lord Adonis, one of the most vocal critics, called it “an incitement to racial hatred” and suggested that the BBC had become a “custodian of [Powell’s] racism”. To claim that it is racist to broadcast Powell’s speech in full, rather than provide snippets, to place it in context and question its assumptions is seemingly not to understand what it means to put something in context. When, in 2016, the German government permitted the publication of Adolf Hitler’s banned Mein Kampf, no one suggested that it had become the “custodian” of nazism. Why is it different for the BBC? Should we never be able properly to discuss Powell’s speech? And how to do so without listening in full? Is this a book “you would wish your wife or your servants to read?” the prosecuting counsel asked during the 1960 obscenity trial of DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover. There is an element of this in the response to the Powell broadcast: “Do you really want the masses to listen to this?” Others argue that the BBC was “triggering trauma” in black and Asian Britons who lived through the period. I grew up in the shadow of Powell. Seventies Britain was viciously racist in a way difficult to imagine now. Powell played his role in fomenting that. His words might make me angry, but I’m not “traumatised” by them, and I know few who would be. The real question is not: “Should it have been broadcast?” but: “Why are we still so obsessed by Powell rather than fighting today’s battles over racism?” That could be asked both of the BBC and of its critics. • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/allies-dispute-russian-and-syrian-claims-of-shot-down-missiles","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T11:44:43Z","webTitle":"Allies dispute Russian and Syrian claims of shot-down missiles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/allies-dispute-russian-and-syrian-claims-of-shot-down-missiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/allies-dispute-russian-and-syrian-claims-of-shot-down-missiles","fields":{"headline":"Allies dispute Russian and Syrian claims of shot-down missiles","bodyText":"The US, UK and France have disputed claims made by Syria and Russia that a significant number of incoming missiles were intercepted and shot down and that the damage inflicted by their raid had been minimal. The Pentagon insisted that no missiles were intercepted by Syrian defences and that the raids were “precise and overwhelming” while claiming the Syrian air defences remained “largely ineffective”. At a briefing, Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie said that Syrian air defences fired 40 interceptor missiles in an attempt to thwart the barrage but failed to hit any of their targets. He said most were fired after the last incoming missile had struck its target. There was no indication of any involvement by Russian air defences, he added. Russian officials have said that the incoming missiles did not enter their own air defence zones around their air and sea bases in western Syria. The Syrian brigadier general Ali Mayhoub, who read the statement on Syrian television, said: “Our air defences effectively shot down most of them.” He acknowledged the scientific research centre on the outskirt of Damascus had been hit and that one of the intercepted missiles had injured three people in Homs, which had been a target of the RAF. The Pentagon claimed to have dealt a “severe blow” to the Assad regime’s chemical weapons programmes with a salvo of 105 missiles fired from ships and planes from the US, UK and France, that hit three targets almost simultaneously. The US defence department showed photographs of the three sites: a research centre in Barzeh, in greater Damascus, which US officials said was used for the development of both chlorine and sarin agents, and two sites west of Homs at Him Shinsar, which the Pentagon said were a storage facility and bunker for chemical weapons. McKenzie, the director of the joint chiefs of staff, said: “Barzeh is a core site for them and as you can see, it doesn’t exist any more.” Photographs showed three large buildings at Barzeh which appeared to have been flattened by the air strikes. The centre, which is a branch of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Centre, long suspected of being a key part of the chemical weapons programme, was the main target. It was hit by 76 missiles, 57 of which were sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, and the rest were air launched stand-off missiles fired from US planes and ships in the Mediterranean, the Gulf and the Red Sea. British and French planes took part in the attack on the Him Shinsar targets, with the French firing nine Scalp cruise missiles, and British Tornados based in Cyprus firing eight Storm Shadow missiles. “We took every measure and precaution to strike what we targeted and we successfully hit every target,” Dana White, the chief Pentagon spokeswoman, said, adding that the aims of the mission were exclusively to punish Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons in an April 7 attack on a rebel-held enclave of Douma, north-eastern Damascus. “This operation does not represent a change in US policy or an attempt to depose the Syrian regime. We do not seek conflict in Syria but we cannot allow such grievous violations of international law,” White said. McKenzie said he was “not aware” of any civilian casualties from coalition missiles but said that many of the Syrian air defence missiles had been launched unguided and may have killed people on their descent. “The Syrians shot 40 large missiles into the air, those missiles came down somewhere,” he said. McKenzie said that the three targets chosen for the Saturday pre-dawn strikes did not represent all of the Syrian chemical weapons programmes, but were chosen because of their importance to the programme and because they could be hit with minimum risk of civilian casualties. The US, he added, would continue to watch the other suspected chemical weapons sites. But he said, compared to last April’s more limited strikes aimed at regime aircraft, the new attack dealt a bigger blow to the overall programme. “I believe there is material and equipment associated with these strikes that are not movable. This is far more damaging to Syria,” he said. “There is some left, but we dealt them a severe blow.” Teams from the RAF and UK Ministry of Defence were examining satellite pictures and other material to determine the extent of the damage. Along with the US and France, they will also be attempting to establish the extent to which their missiles came under fire. The MoD is unlikely to make public any operational details about whether or not missiles came under fire from Syrian air defences or were shot down. But it insisted the raid had been successful. There had been fears before the attack that planes, which were not used in the US strike against Syria last year using Tomahawk missiles, would be vulnerable to Russia’s advanced air defence system, the S-400, which it has deployed in Syria. Russia also threatened to upgrade the Syrian air defence systems to include the S-300 system, which Moscow says is also capable of bringing down Tomahawk missiles or planes. The four RAF Tornados that took part in Saturday’s early morning raid did not enter Syrian space. They fired Storm Shadow missiles from the air close to the RAF base at Akrotiri where they are based, well away from any air defence systems. The Storm Shadow, which has been used by the RAF only a few times, including in Libya, can be fired 300 miles from a target. The RAF hit a former missile base 15 miles west of Homs, where Syria is accused of keeping a stockpile of chemical weapons precursors. The other targets for the US and France were a scientific research centre on the outskirts of Damascus and a chemical equipment storage facility and command post. The four Tornados have been in regular action in Syria and Iraq against Islamic State and will remain in Cyprus. The decision to fire the cruise missiles from planes was partly because the UK does not have a submarine in the area. The Russian defence ministry said “a significant number” of the missiles had been shot down by an air defence system installed during the Soviet era. The ministry insisted the new defence system had not been used. Claims from Syria and Russia about the number of missiles shot down ranged from 13 to 79. Although there had been speculation before the raid that Russia might retaliate against targets such as the RAF Cyprus base, the assumption is that Moscow, having declared the impact of the raid as minimal, is unlikely to respond militarily. It could retaliate at a later date in another part of the world or through a deniable attack, such as a cyber-offensive operation. Russia, as anxious as the UK to avoid escalation, did not respond to the raid with air defence systems around its own bases in Syria. The US said it did not target any Russian-built air defence systems and had only hit air defence systems being operated by Syria. • This article was amended on 16 April 2018 because an earlier version omitted a “not” in the last sentence."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/14/commonwealth-games-anthony-joshua-frazer-clarke-boxing-gold","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T15:07:06Z","webTitle":"Frazer Clarke out of Anthony Joshua’s shadow to win Commonwealth gold","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/commonwealth-games-anthony-joshua-frazer-clarke-boxing-gold","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/14/commonwealth-games-anthony-joshua-frazer-clarke-boxing-gold","fields":{"headline":"Frazer Clarke out of Anthony Joshua’s shadow to win Commonwealth gold","bodyText":"At 6ft 3in and weighing more than 14st, Frazer Clarke is not accustomed to being in anyone’s shadow but when you train with the heavyweight champion of the world it is inevitable the brightest spotlight will be directed elsewhere. Accordingly, until Saturday Clarke has been known outside boxing circles as an extension of Anthony Joshua, introduced in every newspaper article, radio or TV interview as his sparring partner. But the super-heavyweight hit back with a title of his own as England’s boxers completed their most successful Commonwealth Games with six gold medals. “I do spar with Joshua but I’m no one’s sparring partner and never have been,” he said. “We work with and help each other. It does help me out but I help him out. Ask the man himself, he can ship them in from all over the world but nobody serves him better than I do. I hope people know me now and recognise me. I’m ‘Big Fraze’ from a little town, Burton-on-Trent, and if you don’t know me, then get to know me because you’re going to be seeing a lot more of me over the next few years.” As an introduction, it was as thunderous as some of the blows he landed on his India opponent, Satish Kumar, during a close fight, which the Englishman won with a unanimous points decision. The 26-year-old had the best of the first round but Kumar edged the second. Clarke ensured victory in the eyes of the judges with a flurry of good punches in the third round, landing a brutal right to the body before the referee paused the fight for him to have his shoelaces retied. At the final bell Kumar raised his arms aloft but the title was awarded to Clarke, his first major championship gold. After the medals were presented, Clarke was overwhelmed by emotion and lay down on the podium, memories of a tumultuous eight years in the British boxing programme in Sheffield flooding his mind. Twice he has been overlooked for selection at the Olympics, first in favour of Joshua, who won gold at London 2012, and again in 2016 when Joe Joyce went on to win silver, but Clarke believes he will be picked for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. “I’m just glad that I stuck with it,” he said. “There were times when I thought maybe this is not for me. I had the injuries, knock-backs, I’ve been pipped to the Olympics twice. When I sit back and think about it, I wasn’t ready. I could’ve competed at the Olympics. Could I have won gold in London? No. Could I have won gold in Rio? Maybe. But the right two lads got picked for the job and served our country very well. “My time will be in Tokyo. I believe everybody’s got an allotted time frame, I just took a bit longer, I’m a slow developer. I’m not perfect, far from it, but I’m getting there.” The other five golds for England started with Lisa Whiteside who defeated Northern Ireland’s Carly McNaul in the women’s flyweight division, previously dominated by Nicola Adams. Galal Yafai, brother of WBA super-flyweight champion, Khalid, also won gold as did Sandy Ryan and Peter McGrail. The Sunderland fighter Pat McCormack beat NI’s Aidan Walsh in a unanimous points decision, fired to glory by watching twin brother Luke’s fight last Saturday. Luke, who is the younger twin by 45 minutes, had to settle for a bronze medal. Pat McCormack said: “All day I was fuming so I took it out on the Indian [Manoj Kumar, his semi-final opponent] and gave him a bit of a hiding.” McCormack said the success of the home nation fighters could be partially attributed to the influence of Joshua who trains at the GB boxing base in Sheffield. “We see AJ in the gym all the time,” he said. “He started on the squad we’re on. So he came to all these sort of tournaments. Starting from there to how big he is now shows anyone can do it. When he’s in the gym it’s good to look up to the heavyweight champion of the world. The man everyone’s talking about and he’s doing the same training as us. “I want the riches, the fame, the glory, everything. I don’t think I’ll be as big as him, but if I get a half or a quarter of that I’ll be happy.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/anti-muslim-campaigners-denied-entry-uk-far-right-martin-sellner-abel-bodi","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T14:20:58Z","webTitle":"Anti-Muslim campaigners denied entry to UK at border","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/anti-muslim-campaigners-denied-entry-uk-far-right-martin-sellner-abel-bodi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/anti-muslim-campaigners-denied-entry-uk-far-right-martin-sellner-abel-bodi","fields":{"headline":"Anti-Muslim campaigners denied entry to UK at border","bodyText":"Two prominent anti-Muslim campaigners have been denied entry into the UK ahead of a conference held by Britain’s newest and most active far-right group. Martin Sellner, from Austria, and the Hungarian Abel Bodi were due to attend the private Generation Identity conference in London on Saturday. They were detained at Stansted airport – the second time in a month that Sellner, the leader of Generation Identity, has been prevented from entering the UK by border officials. Sellner, 29, was also the ringleader behind a controversial “Defend Europe” campaign last summer, responsible for targeting boats attempting to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean. Lauren Southern, a prominent Generation Identity activist who was refused entry to the UK at the border last month, confirmed the latest developments. She tweeted: “Martin Sellner has been detained as well as Hungarian identitarian Abel Bodi who were scheduled to attend a private conference in the UK.” The event, being held at a closely guarded location, was arranged by Generation Identity United Kingdom and Ireland (GI UK), which has emerged over the past few months as the domestic branch of an expanding far-right network active in 13 countries. Campaigners say GI UK has adopted a different approach to other anti-Muslim groups such as the English Defence League (EDL), with a primarily young and tech-savvy membership. “GI’s more ‘respectable’ appearance, slick social media work, distinct iconography and disciplined public face masks an extreme ideology. The core beliefs of GI, such as ‘ethnopluralism’ and ‘remigration’, are far more extreme and race-based than anything posited by groups like the EDL,” said Joe Mulhall of Hope Not Hate. The anti-racism campaign group says GI UK has conducted at least 88 UK actions and meetings since July 2017 in cities including London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Birmingham, Belfast, Wrexham and Glasgow. But it remains relatively small: GI UK has just 7,445 followers on Twitter and its first major demonstration, held in Hyde Park in London last month, attracted 40 people. A report released on Saturday by Hope Not Hate claimed GI UK’s potential belied its size. “GI UK and Ireland does pose a threat that needs to be understood, not least to make sure it fails to grow as its counterparts on the continent have done,” it said. “It has the potential to set new expected norms for young far-right activists and standards for branding and professionalism.” The report’s release came before another far-right gathering in London featuring an anti-immigration European group accused of racialising sexual violence. The group, named #120db and based in Germany, is named after the sound volume of a pocket alarm and claims to highlight “imported violence”, which it defines as sexual violence committed by migrants. Members including those linked to Generation Identity are to give a talk in Hyde Park on Sunday to “represent victims of mass migrant abuse”, a move that has drawn heavy criticism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/14/donald-trump-syria-strikes-mission-accomplished","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T13:10:29Z","webTitle":"Donald Trump praises Syria strikes and declares: 'Mission accomplished'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/14/donald-trump-syria-strikes-mission-accomplished","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/14/donald-trump-syria-strikes-mission-accomplished","fields":{"headline":"Donald Trump praises Syria strikes and declares: 'Mission accomplished'","bodyText":"Donald Trump hailed the strikes carried out against Syria by the US, UK and France as “perfectly executed” on Saturday, adding: “Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!” The US president thanked London and Paris for their “wisdom and the power of their fine Military” in joining Washington in launching more than 100 missiles on Friday night against what they say were Syrian chemical weapons facilities. Trump added: “So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There won’t be anything, or anyone, even close!” Trump announced the military action in a speech late on Friday, a week after the Syrian regime was accused of carrying out a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburb of Douma that left 40 people dead and hundreds injured. The president said he had directed the US military to conduct “precision strikes” against Assad’s chemical weapons capabilities, with targets including a scientific research center in the Syrian capital and two chemical weapons storage facilities west of Homs. Trump’s use of “mission accomplished” less than 24 hours after launching the missiles echoed George W Bush’s infamous 2003 speech a month after US troops were deployed in Iraq. Although Bush did not utter the phrase during his televised address, he stood under a “Mission Accomplished” banner and spoke of how the US and its allies had “prevailed”. The event later became a symbol of the controversy as the war dragged on and resulted in the deaths of thousands of American troops and tens of thousands of civilian casualties. Thousands of US troops remain in Iraq today. The Pentagon struck a similarly defiant tone in a briefing with reporters on Saturday, where officials labeled Friday night’s airstrikes a success. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said: “We met our objectives. We hit the sites, the heart of the [chemical] weapons programme. So it was mission accomplished.” Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie, the director of the joint chiefs of staff, described the mission as “precise, overwhelming and effective”. Officials at the Pentagon notably would not set a bar for what would precipitate further military action, nor did they directly respond to how the US might respond if Russia or Iran made good on their threats to engage in retaliatory strikes. The Pentagon also disputed the Russian military’s claims that Syrian air defense units had downed 71 out of 103 cruise missiles launched by the US and its allies. “The Russia disinformation campaign has already begun,” White said. As the strikes sparked concerns that the coordinated attacks might have escalated confrontation with Russia, the Trump administration made clear that further military action was not off the table. “If the Syrian regime uses this poisonous gas again, the United States is locked and loaded,” Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said at an emergency security council meeting on Saturday. Haley added that the US had worked “in lockstep” with the UK and France in a bid to deter the future use of chemical weapons by Assad’s regime. “We’ve spent a week talking about the unique horror of chemical weapons,” she said. “The time for talk ended last night. We are confident we have crippled Syria’s chemical weapons programme. We are prepared to sustain this pressure if the Syrian regime is foolish enough to test our will.” Haley also took an aggressive tone toward Russia, which called the emergency meeting and has thus far blocked the security council from taking action in Syria. “We cannot stand by and let Russia trash every international norm that we stand for and allow the use of chemical weapons to go unanswered,” she said. UN resolution rejected A Russian resolution at the UN security council condemning the airstrikes met with a stinging diplomatic defeat. Moscow gained support from only two other countries, China and Bolivia. Four council members – Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Peru and Equatorial Guinea – abstained, while the remaining eight members voted against. After the vote, the Russian envoy, Vassily Nebenzia said: “Today is a very sad day for the world, the UN, its charter, which was blatantly, blatantly violated.” Meanwhile a senior administration official on Saturday went further than the Pentagon in saying sarin nerve agent was used by the Assad regime in Douma on 7 April. “We assess that chlorine and sarin were used in the attack,” the official said, pointing as evidence to the nature of the victims’ symptoms, such as the narrowing of pupils in their eyes, and the effects on their nervous systems, along with the sheer lethality of the gas. The launch of more than 100 missile strikes drew mixed reaction in Washington, with some calling Trump’s decision illegal. “A pinpointed, limited action to punish and hopefully deter Assad from doing this again is appropriate, but the administration has to be careful about not getting us into a greater and more involved war in Syria,” the Democratic Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a statement. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said: “The latest chemical weapons attack against the Syrian people was a brutally inhuman war crime. Yet one night of airstrikes is no substitute for a coherent strategy.” Pelosi called on Trump to seek approval from Congress for military action in the region. She said the president must present “a comprehensive strategy with clear objectives”. The US constitution requires that any sustained military action be authorized by Congress. Trump, like his predecessor Barack Obama, has thus far relied on a sweeping 2001 war authorization passed in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The AUMF, which has not expired, approved the use of military force against those responsible for the attacks, primarily al-Qaida, and “associated groups”. The Obama administration justified military action targeting Islamic State by arguing the terrorist group was an offshoot of al-Qaida. A faction of lawmakers in both parties have suggested Trump cannot make the same case for striking the Syrian government. Justin Amash, a libertarian congressman from Michigan, condemned Trump’s refusal to approach Congress before employing military options. He said: “These offensive strikes against Syria are unconstitutional, illegal, and reckless.” Hours before Trump’s announcement on Friday, 88 Republican and Democratic members of Congress signed a letter imploring the president to consult Congress before engaging US armed forces. “Engaging our military in Syria when no direct threat to the United States exists and without prior congressional authorization would violate the separation of powers that is clearly delineated in the constitution,” the letter read. “We stand ready to consider the facts before us and share the burden of decisions made regarding US involvement in the quickly escalating Syrian conflict.” Republican leaders were nonetheless supportive of Trump’s response in Syria and did not provide any indication that they would challenge his authority. Responding to Trump’s announcement on Friday, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said: “I support both the action and objective.” The House speaker, Paul Ryan, said Assad’s “barbaric use of chemical weapons cannot go unanswered”. But he added that Russia and Iran must also be held accountable for enabling the Syrian regime, stating the two countries “have blood on their hands”. Trump’s move on Friday came one year after he similarly launched retaliatory airstrikes against Assad’s regime a following a poison gas attack. In that instance, the Pentagon fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on a Syrian government airbase. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) was set to begin an investigation Saturday at the site of last week’s chemical weapons attacks. The US, UK and France cited their own intelligence to conclude that the Syrian regime was behind the attack, an allegation that has been vehemently denied by Damascus and Russia.

You can join Niall McVeigh for Spurs v Manchester City if you like. Goodnight! 90+1 min Firmino comes off to be replaced by Dominic Solanke. Roberto Firmino finishes off a lovely evening for Liverpool, dragging a disguised near-post shot past the wrongfooted Begovic after a driving run and pass from Oxlade-Chamberlain. 89 min Oxlade-Chamberlain rifles a terrific long-range shot fractionally wide of the far post. 88 min “Whilst following the absorbing commentary, my mind drifted to rather more exciting times from this afternoon,” says Charolude Govett. “I was undecided after minutes of deliberation, so can you decide on antique white or white ivory paint for my bedroom please.” Have you considered Roy Keane Black? 85 min King’s low shot is blocked by Milner. This is Bournemouth’s best spell by a distance, though you suspect it’s mainly because Liverpool are winding down. A goal would make things interesting. 84 min Another chance for Bournemouth! Wilson gets behind Van Dijk, controls a long pass deftly and smacks it wide of the far post from a tight angle. 83 min A Liverpool change: Klavan on, Lovren off. 82 min A great chance for Bournemouth. Francis’s dangerous cross was miscontrolled by Mousset but fell nicely for Gosling, whose snapshot was slapped away by the off balance Karius. 79 min The contest is petering out, if indeed it ever petered in. It’s been like an exhibition match. 78 min I knew that Alexander-Arnold pass reminded me of Beckham. It wasn’t quite in the same class but there were a lot of similiarities. 77 min A Liverpool change: Mane off, Milner on. 76 min Callum Wilson, who must have come on for Jermain Defoe when I wasn’t paying attention, wins a corner for Bournemouth. It leads to a disallowed goal from King, who was clearly offside. 74 min Firmino misses a great chance. Oxlade-Chamberlain slid a pass to put him through on goal, where he decided to dummy both Begovic and Cook in the Romario style. They ended up on the floor, but the time that Firmino took allowed Gosling to get back and make a vital tackle. The ball dribbles towards goal nonetheless and is kicked off the line by Ake. 73 min Bournemouth make another change, with Andrew Surman replacing Lewis Cook. 70 min Mane flashes a low shot just wide from 22 yards. Mo Salah gets his 40th goal of the season with a delightful header! Alexander-Arnold, whose distribution has been brilliant all night, curled a long, Beckhamish pass over Ake from near the halfway line. Salah got the wrong side of Ake, backpedalled sharply and lobbed an ingenious header over Begovic. Brilliant. The pass from Alexander-Arnold was stunning. 67 min Salah goes down in the area after a little shove from Ake. The referee says no penalty. It wasn’t much of a push, so I can understand why the referee didn’t give it. 65 min It’s still 1-0. How is it still 1-0? 62 min Liverpool break four on four, with Salah on the ball. He takes the wrong option and mishits a disguised shot from 20 yards that is comfortably held by the diving Begovic. 60 min If Bournemouth win this, it’ll be the most unlikely comeback since lunchtime. Or maybe Wednesday. Or Tuesday. Or last Saturday. 59 min Wake me up when something happens. 58 min A Bournemouth substitution: Lys Mousset replaces Jordon Ibe. 57 min An unlikely one-two. Cook’s long throw is punched unconvincingly by Karius and comes back to Cook, who sidefoots a long-range volley out for a throw-in. 56 min A sweet long-range strike from Van Dijk flies a few yards over the bar. Begovic had it covered but it was well hit. 56 min Maybe Bournemouth’s plan is to lull Liverpool into a false sense of consciousness. They are so dominant that you couldn’t blame them for falling asleep en masse. 54 min Oxlade-Chamberlain is booked for a lunge at Ibe. 53 min Bournemouth have been unusually poor in possession. The good news is that a) it’s only 1-0 and b) no team has won as many points from losing positions in the Premier League this season. 52 min “I knew I drank too much when we beat City on Wednesday night, however I didn’t realise we also beat Roma and are now in the CL final,” says Frank. “At least that’s what it says in your PREAMBLE.” That’s okay, no need to apologise. 51 min It’s all Liverpool, as it was in the first half. Jermain Defoe is having to come to the edge of his own area to get the ball. Henderson is lucky not to get booked for a high tackle on Defoe. 51 min “’That attack ended quicker than Mac Millings’ wedding night’,” suggests Mac Millings. 50 min A Bournemouth break is ruined when Fraser plays a poor pass to the disappointed King. They’ll be arguing about who owns the Coldplay CDs in no time. 49 min “Hey,” says Matt Dony, “there’s a famously fine line between ‘witty and urbane’, and ‘deserving of pity and smelling like cheap whiskey.’ Either way, I’m definitely not invited because of my delicate first touch and ability to thread a pass.” I now have this image of you in my head. 48 min Jermain Defoe had three touches in the first half, and one of those was the kick-off. 47 min “Not to distract anyone from this mighty tussle but wondered what your thoughts were regarding the new 7.45pm Saturday PL matches?” says Colin Young. “Are these a welcome addition to the calendar or just another nail in the coffin of the traditional Saturday night? I don’t imagine rival TV schedulers are all that pleased about it... I mean isn’t this overkill? I wonder what our fellow Graun readers think about this...” 46 min Peep peep! Bournemouth begin the second half. “Thought I’d let you know I’m following Liverpool’s progress against Bournemouth via your MBM as I’m at my cousin’s wedding,” writes our own Sachin Nakrani. “To make me feel involved, any chance of you getting wedding-related puns into your updates, ie: ‘this is champagne football from Mo Salah’, or ‘Eddie Howe’s midfield two are really well attached’.” I shudder to think what the mind of Mac Millings will do with that invitation. “It occurred to me that Virgil van Dijk is a tremendous porn name,” says Mac Millings, “and that has ‘inspired’ me to come up with a Liverpool-Bournemouth Porn Star XI. Enjoy. Assmir Begforit Dejan Lovin’ Steve Cock Virgil van Dijk Bangnar Klavan Alex Hotlaid-Chambermaid Ben Woodyburn Lewis Cock Mo Salacious Sadio-masochism Mane Dominatrix Solanke.” Unsubscribe. (Also, you’ve got a nerve talking about porn names.) Your half-time task is to sign up for the Fiver. I get 10 per cent commission so you’d be doing me a great favour. Liverpool lead through Sadio Mane’s early goal, and it should probably be 3-0. They look high on spring, full of the joys of life, and produced a swaggering, happy first-half performance. Bournemouth barely had a kick. See you in 10 minutes for the second half. 45 min Liverpool are so dominant that even Lovren can walk forward and put in a good cross that the diving Mane heads wide at the near post. 44 min The Liverpool crowd appeal for handball in the area when Alexander-Arnold’s cross hits Francis. The referee wasn’t interested. 42 min Robertson’s cross is headed onto the roof of his own net by the flying Fraser. Bournemouth have been battered. Alexander-Arnold takes the corner and Cook heads clear. 38 min The impressive Alexander-Arnold starts another Liverpool attack with a confident run. Mane plays a superb scoop over the defence to find Salah, who miscontrols the ball when through on goal. It wasn’t the easiest ball to control, but Salah would usually have done so. 35 min Oxlade-Chamberlain’s long-range shot deflects wide for a corner. Begovic punches Henderson’s inswinger away. In other news, a word to the (London-based) wise. 32 min More excellent play from Liverpool. Salah plays a slick one-two with Henderson and is about to shoot when Cook slides to make a vital tackle. 31 min The biggest danger for Liverpool is complacency, because this has been much easier than they would have expected against a good Bournemouth side. 30 min “Hmmm,” says Matt Dony, “I feel like Phil Podolsky (11th minute) has nailed the only reason I ever get invited to 5-a-side games...” Don’t flatter yourself. 28 min Another chance for Liverpool. Henderson’s deep cross is headed back across goal by Robertson and just evades the stretching Mane. 26 min Francis plays an abysmal pass to Salah, who dances into the D and shoots over the bar. That’s the scary thing about Salah this season - as well as the goals, he has missed a lot of chances and half-chances. He could have scored 50. 24 min Defoe has a goal disallowed for offside against Fraser, whose cross he turned into the net. It was the right decision. 21 min Henderson’s pass over the top is beautifully taken down on the run by Mane, whose shot deflects wide off the covering Francis. 20 min King wins a corner for Bournemouth down the left. Karius punches it clear. 19 min Bournemouth are starting to have a bit more of the ball, though not in dangerous areas. Liverpool have become so much better without the ball since they signed Virgil Van Dijk. 18 min Begovic makes another save, this time a comfortable catch from Salah’s low 20-yard shot. 16 min Alexander-Arnold’s disguised free-kick from 25 yards is pushed away by the diving Begovic. I think it was going wide anyway but it was a clever effort. 15 min Bournemouth have their first extended spell in the opposition half. When they lose the ball Liverpool break superbly and Ake is booked for a foul on the marauding Oxlade-Chamberlain. 14 min On reflection, I think that offside decision against Mane was correct. Not that it matters, I just don’t want people to write in and call me an effing cee. 13 min Begovic makes a good one-on-one save from Mane, though it wouldn’t have counted as Mane had been wrongly flagged offside. 12 min This is a very pleasant game, for richer and poorer. There’s hardly been a tackle. 11 min “Milner should travel with the squad even if he’s not included,” says Phil Podolsky. “He would be a kind of elder statesman, a witty and urbane presence who can lift the younguns’ spirits by regaling them with choice anecdotes and bon mots.” Couldn’t they just bring Jack Whitehall’s dad? 10 min There’s a notable swagger in Liverpool’s football. Bournemouth are under constant pressure. 8 min Jordon Ibe, playing against his own goal, wafts over the bar from 20 yards. Liverpool’s dominant start is rewarded with a goal. Henderson’s ball in from a narrow position was headed towards goal by the unmarked Mane. Begovic made a sharp save to his right but the ball came back to Mane and he rammed it through both Begovic and Francis on the line. 4 min “I’m not a fan of applause as a replacement for a minute’s silence,” says Tim, who was in Pen 3 at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. “Did they expect Bournemouth to not observe a silence? It seems unlikely. A minute’s silence seems so much more appropriate for such an emotionally heavy memorial.” Yes, I wondered about that. There are times when it makes sense, as much as anything because of the fear that silence will be interrupted, but that was never an issue today. 3 min Salah misses an excellent chance, stabbing wide at the near post after a marvellous low cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold. 3 min Liverpool have had almost all of the ball in the first few minutes. Bournemouth are shuffling diligently from side to side like the aliens in Space Invaders. 2 min Bournemouth are playing with a back three 1 min Roberto Firmino gets the match underway. Bournemouth are in their neon blue away kit. Tomorrow is the 29th anniversary of the Hillsborough tragedy, and there is a minute’s applause for the 96 before the match. Another email! “One reason Milner is keeping his engine going and his powder dry is precisely because he is not doing the international gigs,” says Ian Copestake. “No need to change that.” Not much banter in that email mate. In case you missed it, the Mo-ssiah has unsurprisingly been included on the shortlist for PFA Player of the Year. There’s another bit of sport going on in Liverpool today. The Grand National is about to start, and you can follow it with Niall McVeigh. “True...” says Marie Meyer. “but have you seen the state of the current England team?” I quite like it. But yes, fair point. You could certainly make a case for him starting in midfield. It’s a gorgeous evening in Liverpool, and there’s a feelgood mood at Anfield. I’ve got a feeling this could be a pr-etty special game. An email! “Looks like Klopp understands that Milner is so important he has to be kept in cotton wool until the Roma match!” says Marie Meyer. “Couldn’t agree more. What is Gareth Southgate waiting for - can’t he get the Queen to order him to unretire from international duty?” Really? Don’t get me wrong, I like Milner a lot and I’d certainly have him in the squad, but we’re not exactly talking about peak Paul Scholes. Pre-match reading Liverpool (4-3-3) Karius; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Lovren, Robertson; Wijnaldum, Henderson, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Salah, Firmino, Mane. Substitutes: Mignolet, Milner, Klavan, Moreno, Woodburn, Ings, Solanke. Bournemouth (3-4-2-1) Begovic; Francis, S Cook, Ake; Frasier, L Cook, Gosling, Daniels; Ibe; King; Defoe. Substitutes: Boruc, B Smith, Simpson, Surman, Pugh, Wilson, Mousset. Referee Chris Kavanagh. Hail the conquering heroes! Liverpool return home to face Bournemouth after a glorious week in which they beat Manchester City and Roma to reach the Champions League final. They don’t have that much to play for today – they are going to finish in the top four regardless – but Jurgen Klopp’s sides usually play for the sheer love of football and sweat. You’d expect them to put on a show tonight. Bournemouth will come to play as well, so this should be a really enjoyable game. They have lost only two matches since Christmas and are still in with a chance of equalling last season’s ninth-placed finish. In their own modest way they are an amazing team. The story of Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth will make a cracking book one day; so will the one about Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool. Kick off is at 5.30pm."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/theresa-may-speech-military-strikes-syria-full-text","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T11:06:25Z","webTitle":"Theresa May's speech on military strikes against Syria – full text","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/theresa-may-speech-military-strikes-syria-full-text","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/theresa-may-speech-military-strikes-syria-full-text","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May's speech on military strikes against Syria – full text","bodyText":"Last night British, French and American armed forces conducted coordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capability and deter their use. For the UK’s part four RAF Tornado GR 4’s launched storm shadow missiles at a military facility some 15 miles west of Homs, where the regime is assessed to keep chemical weapons in breach of Syria’s obligations under the chemical weapons convention. While the full assessment of the strike is ongoing, we are confident of its success. Let me set out why we have taken this action. Last Saturday up to 75 people, including young children, were killed in a despicable and barbaric attack in Douma, with as many as 500 further casualties. We have worked with our allies to establish what happened. And all the indications are that this was a chemical weapons attack. We have seen the harrowing images of men, women and children lying dead with foam in their mouths. These were innocent families who, at the time this chemical weapon was unleashed, were seeking shelter underground, in basements. First-hand accounts from NGOs and aid workers have detailed the most horrific suffering, including burns to the eyes, suffocation and skin discolouration, with a chlorine-like odour surrounding the victims. And the World Health Organization has received reports that hundreds of patients arrived at Syrian health facilities on Saturday night with “signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals”. We are also clear about who was responsible for this atrocity. A significant body of information including intelligence indicates the Syrian regime is responsible for this latest attack. I cannot tell you everything. But let me give an example of some of the evidence that leads us to this conclusion. Open source accounts allege that a barrel bomb was used to deliver the chemicals. Multiple open source reports claim that a regime helicopter was observed above the city of Douma on the evening of 7 April. The opposition does not operate helicopters or use barrel bombs. And reliable intelligence indicates that Syrian military officials coordinated what appears to be the use of chlorine in Douma on 7 April. No other group could have carried out this attack. Indeed, Daesh [Islamic State] for example does not even have a presence in Douma. And the fact of this attack should surprise no one. We know that the Syrian regime has an utterly abhorrent record of using chemical weapons against its own people. On 21 August 2013 over 800 people were killed and thousands more injured in a chemical attack also in Ghouta. There were 14 further smaller scale chemical attacks prior to that summer. At Khan Shaykhun on 4 April last year, the Syrian regime used sarin against its people killing around 100 with a further 500 casualties. And based on the regime’s persistent pattern of behaviour and the cumulative analysis of specific incidents we judge it highly likely both that the Syrian regime has continued to use chemical weapons since then, and will continue to do so. This must be stopped. We have sought to do so using every possible diplomatic channel. But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted both on the ground and in the United Nations. Following the sarin attack in eastern Damascus back in August 2013, the Syrian regime committed to dismantle its chemical weapon programme – and Russia promised to ensure that Syria did this, overseen by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. But these commitments have not been met. A recent report from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has said that Syria’s declaration of its former chemical weapons programme is incomplete. This indicates that it continues to retain undeclared stocks of nerve agent or precursor chemicals – and is likely to be continuing with some chemical weapons production. The OPCW inspectors have investigated previous attacks and on four occasions decided that the regime was indeed responsible. And on each occasion when we have seen every sign of chemical weapons being used, any attempt to hold the perpetrators to account has been blocked by Russia at the UN security council, with six such vetoes since the start of 2017. Just this week, the Russians vetoed a draft resolution that would have established an independent investigation into this latest attack – even making the grotesque and absurd claim that it was “staged” by Britain. So we have no choice but to conclude that diplomatic action on its own will not be any more effective in the future than it has been in the past. Over the last week the UK government has been working intensively with our international partners to build the evidence picture, and to consider what action we need to take to prevent and deter future humanitarian catastrophes caused by chemical weapons attacks. When the cabinet met on Thursday we considered the advice of the attorney general, the national security adviser and the chief of the defence staff – and we were updated on the latest assessment and intelligence picture. And based on this advice we agreed that it was both right and legal to take military action, together with our closest allies, to alleviate further humanitarian suffering by degrading the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capability and deterring their use. This was not about interfering in a civil war. And it was not about regime change. As I discussed with President Trump and President Macron, it was a limited, targeted and effective strike with clear boundaries that expressly sought to avoid escalation and did everything possible to prevent civilian casualties. Together we have hit a specific and limited set of targets. They were a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a key chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks. Hitting these targets with the force that we have deployed will significantly degrade the Syrian regime’s ability to research, develop and deploy chemical weapons. A year ago, after the atrocity at Khan Shaykhun, the US conducted a strike on the airfield from which the attack took place. But Assad and his regime hasn’t stopped their use of chemical weapons. So last night’s strikes by the US, UK and France were significantly larger than the US action a year ago and specifically designed to have a greater impact on the regime’s capability and willingness to use chemical weapons. And this collective action sends a clear message that the international community will not stand by and tolerate the use of chemical weapons. I also want to be clear that this military action to deter the use of chemical weapons does not stand alone. We must remain committed to resolving the conflict at large. The best hope for the Syrian people remains a political solution. We need all partners – especially the regime and its backers – to enable humanitarian access to those in desperate need. And the UK will continue to strive for both. But these strikes are about deterring the barbaric use of chemical weapons in Syria and beyond. And so to achieve this there must also be a wider diplomatic effort – including the full range of political and economic levers – to strengthen the global norms prohibiting the use of chemical weapons which have stood for nearly a century. Although of a much lower order of magnitude, the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK in recent weeks is part of a pattern of disregard for these norms. So while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity. There is no graver decision for a prime minister than to commit our forces to combat – and this is the first time that I have had to do so. As always, they have served our country with the greatest professionalism and bravery – and we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none. We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere. We must reinstate the global consensus that chemical weapons cannot be used. This action is absolutely in Britain’s national interest. The lesson of history is that when the global rules and standards that keep us safe come under threat – we must take a stand and defend them. That is what our country has always done. And that is what we will continue to do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/viktor-orban-hungary-election-rundercover-stings-orban-secret-war-on-migration","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T20:00:30Z","webTitle":"Sting operations and war on migration help Orbán to victory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/viktor-orban-hungary-election-rundercover-stings-orban-secret-war-on-migration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/viktor-orban-hungary-election-rundercover-stings-orban-secret-war-on-migration","fields":{"headline":"Sting operations and war on migration help Orbán to victory","bodyText":"One day in mid-January, Balázs Dénes, the Hungarian executive director of a Berlin-based NGO, travelled to Amsterdam to meet Ali Mahmoud Alrabie, from a Bahraini company called Orion Ventures Capital. Alrabie’s fund was interested in supporting projects that helped refugees, he said, and paid for Dénes to fly to Amsterdam to discuss potential collaboration. Alrabie was a friendly, jovial interlocutor and was keen to hear all about Dénes’s NGO, Civil Liberties Union for Europe. Dénes tried to follow up the meeting with requests for more information. But Alrabie did not respond. Soon after, the website of Orion Ventures Capital, which described the fund as a “leading boutique investment firm based in Bahrain”, stopped working. The company, apparently, does not exist, and Alrabie is almost certainly an invented persona. Subsequent events show that Dénes was one of many people targeted by what appears to be a coordinated, expensive and sophisticated sting operation. The fake meetings apparently had the aim of collecting compromising material on Hungarian civil society activists, and feeding into the talking points of the prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who convincingly won re-election for a third consecutive term last Sunday in parliamentary elections. Orbán ran his campaign almost exclusively on the threat posed to Hungary by migration. He has accused the Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, a favoured bogeyman of right-wing governments across the world, of fomenting a plot to bring “tens of millions” of migrants to Europe and erode its Christian heritage and national boundaries. The sting operation, which took place over several months in the lead-up to the election, targeted a number of individuals who are, or were, employed by Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF), or else worked for organisations that received grant money from the OSF, like Dénes. It involved meetings in London, New York, Vienna and Amsterdam. Leaked, often doctored, recordings of the conversations were immediately jumped upon by Orbán-friendly media as proof of the existence of a Soros plot against Hungary. The Observer spoke to several people who had been targeted by companies apparently all linked to the same undercover operation over the past four months. Some of them did not wish to be named publicly, but all reported a similar series of events: an email approach offering an all-expenses-paid trip to meet an apparent sympathiser, followed by a meeting in which the interlocutors were friendly, but asked bizarre and provocative questions. Two weeks before Dénes flew to Amsterdam, András Siewert, who runs the Hungarian NGO Migration Aid, went to Vienna to meet Grigory Aleksandrov, who claimed to be from a company called Smart InnoTech that offered technological solutions to migration issues. Aleksandrov, like Alrabie, was chatty and inquisitive, and as well as offering lucrative opportunities for collaboration asked numerous questions about the work of Migration Aid, and any political contacts it might have. Although many of those who attended the meetings said they began to become suspicious over the lines of questioning, there was also an appreciation that they were dealing with experienced deception artists. “These were hardcore pros who knew how to direct the conversation and put me at ease,” said Dénes. The sham companies involved had sharply designed websites, and their employees had Linkedin accounts. Another person who attended a similar meeting said they met an interlocutor who spun a convincing, emotional tale of how his own family had been subjected to political repression during his childhood, which had spurred him to help refugees. However, once the small talk out of the way, the questioning became increasingly pointed. Siewert said “Grigory Aleksandrov” asked repeated questions about Migration Aid’s political links, as well as links to any Soros foundations. Siewert, unlike most of the other organisations targeted, said he has never applied for any external money, including Soros money, and that Migration Aid relies on donations alone for its humanitarian work. Aleksandrov then asked whether he might not consider organising demonstrations, rather than simply distributing aid. He also offered technology to set up a database of refugees waiting in the “transit zone” along Hungary’s southern border. Siewert said Aleksandrov had a clear Israeli accent; Dénes said Alrabie was “pale-skinned Middle Eastern, probably Israeli or Arab”. Another person who attended a meeting in a European city said the interlocutor was “definitely Israeli”. The first public sign of the sting came in mid-March, when an article appeared in the Jerusalem Post quoting a recording of Dénes saying his work involved launching public campaigns and mobilising EU countries to lobby against aspects of Hungarian legislation. There was no indication in the article of how the recording was obtained or made. Almost immediately, there was a response from the Hungarian government, which seized on the Israeli article as “proof” that the Soros network was lobbying against Hungary internationally. “The Berlin lieutenant has been caught red-handed,” wrote Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, in a blog post. “How on earth is a so-called NGO engaged in political decision-making, and working to influence one government using the help of another government? That’s completely and fully against the law,” he later told the Observer. Whoever was doing the leaking then provided other recordings to a source much closer to the Hungarian government. Journalist Zsolt Bayer, an associate of Orbán and founding member of his Fidesz party, wrote articles using other leaked recordings in the government-friendly paper Magyar Idök. Bayer posted audio from Siewert’s meetings with Aleksandrov, as well as a heavily edited recording of Tracie Ahern, former chief financial officer of Soros Fund Management, who said there were “something like 2,000 people” working for OSF, during a meeting with an apparent sympathiser in New York. The figure was meant for OSF globally, but was spun by the Hungarian media to be about employees in Hungary. The figure was immediately seized on by Orbán himself, who said the government knew the names of 2,000 members of the “Soros mercenary army” who were working to “bring down the government”. Kovács said the idea that the recordings were made as part of an undercover sting operation was a “cheap argument” and “fake news”. He denied any government involvement in the affair. Bayer did not return calls, and a source at the Jerusalem Post declined to say how the newspaper received the recording, though did say the paper had rejected Hungarian government requests to hand it over. The sophisticated operation, spanning multiple countries and involving numerous fake identities and companies, matches the modus operandi of a number of corporate intelligence firms that have received negative publicity in recent months. There are numerous companies who provide similar services, a corporate intelligence source said, and there is no hard evidence about which company or government might be behind this particular sting operation. While the tradecraft involved suggests operatives with an intelligence background, the sting was not carried out flawlessly. Siewert said he was so suspicious when he received the initial approach from Aleksandrov that he reported it to the Hungarian intelligence service AH and informed it he thought he was being set up. In an interview at Migration Aid’s office, an apartment in Budapest’s seventh district stacked with cardboard boxes of donated clothes and toys, Siewert said Aleksandrov raised suspicion because his company had little online footprint, and he spelled his own surname in three different ways in emails. Due to his suspicions, Siewert secretly recorded the meetings himself. After partial recordings were released by Hungarian media, Siewert released the full audio himself, to show he said nothing untoward. He also took clandestine photos of the man pretending to be Aleksandrov, and his female assistant, which he posted online. Dénes said the man he met, Alrabie, was a different person to the man in Siewert’s photographs. Siewert was coy about revealing to what extent the meetings he held with Aleksandrov in Vienna were coordinated with the AH, but has made public a document showing he did, indeed, report the approach to the service prior to attending the meeting. The document raises the intriguing possibility that part of Hungary’s intelligence apparatus was, or is, investigating a sting operation that appears to have been carried out with the aim of buttressing the Hungarian government’s talking points. One of Orbán’s major campaign promises was to introduce a so-called “Stop Soros” legislative package targeting civil society, and on Tuesday the prime minister used a post-election press conference to say that passing the bill is a top priority for the new government. Keeping the anti-Soros rhetoric high, a government-linked magazine last week published a list of so-called “Soros agents” active inside Hungary, including journalists and civil society activists. The “Stop Soros” law, when passed, will subject foreign funding for migration-related activities to a 25% tax and will require organisations to undergo vetting to check if they are a national security threat. “After the law is passed they’ll need ‘evidence’, and it’s quite possible that they’ll use these recordings for that purpose,” said Dénes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/russia-claims-syria-air-defences-shot-down-majority-missiles","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T10:07:15Z","webTitle":"Russia claims Syria air defences shot down 71 of 103 missiles","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/russia-claims-syria-air-defences-shot-down-majority-missiles","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/russia-claims-syria-air-defences-shot-down-majority-missiles","fields":{"headline":"Russia claims Syria air defences shot down 71 of 103 missiles","bodyText":"The Russian military has claimed that the Syrian air defences, whose most modern weapon is a three-decades-old Russian-supplied anti-aircraft system, shot down 71 of 103 missiles fired by the US and its allies, the UK and France, a claim denied by the Pentagon. As further details began to emerge about the sites targeted by the US-led strikes, Col Gen Sergei Rudskoi of the Russian military said the strikes had not caused any casualties and that Syrian military facilities suffered only minor damage. It was not possible to verify the claims. The most up-to-date system that Moscow has supplied to the Syrian regime is the short range Pantsir S-1, which has an anti-missile capability. Russia said its advisers had spent the last 18 months completely rebuilding the Syrian air defence system, and said the high number of intercepted rockets spoke to “the high effectiveness of the weaponry in Syria and the excellent training of Syrian servicemen prepared by our specialists”. Although Russia suggested that Syrian forces had been responsible for manning their own air defences, Russian advisers have a long history of operating systems in such situations. Video footage that emerged in the aftermath of the strikes appeared to show air defence missiles being launched. The Pantsir – which has reportedly been used in the past to shoot down several drones and missiles in Syria – is far more modern than Syria’s other anti-aircraft systems that make up the backbone of the country’s air defences, some of which which first came into service in the Soviet Union in the late 1950s and 60s. Syria claimed to have intercepted suspected Israeli missiles fired on a base earlier this month, while an Israeli jet was brought down in February. Moscow said Syria used S-125, S-200, Buk and Kvadrat systems to repel the attack. The US said three targets Russian officials named six airbases as specific targets of Saturday’s attacks, including al-Dumayr military airport, an airbase near the city of Homs, and the Shayrat airbase that was targeted in 2017. Rudskoi said Syria had Soviet-made defence systems that Moscow has “completely overhauled”, including S-200 systems and Buk missiles. He said Russian air defences in Syria – including state of the art S-400 coastal missile batteries located at the Russian naval base at Tartus and elsewhere – monitored the strike but did not engage any of the missiles. Rudskoi said the Syrian military used Soviet-made air defence systems with high efficiency, shooting down all of the missiles aimed at four key Syrian airbases. The most significant Russian response for the region, however, is likely to be the announcement that Moscow will consider supplying Syria with S-300 missiles in response to the attack. Vladimir Putin said in 2013 after talks with EU leaders that Moscow had refrained from supplying the powerful S-300 air defence systems to Assad’s government. While the supply of S-300s to Syria is unlikely to trouble the US military, their widespread deployment would make it much more hazardous for Israeli jets to target Syria as they have done with relative impunity until recently. “Considering what has happened, we consider it possible to reassess this question and not just as far as concerns Syria, but other countries too,” Rudskoi said on supplying the missile system. The latest raids have underlined how, despite the huge humanitarian cost of the war in Syria, the country has become a proving ground for some of the world’s most advanced weapons systems, deployed both by the US and Russia. According to reports in the immediate aftermath of the attack, the strikes involved the first combat use of the JASSM advanced missile, reportedly fired from US B1-B Lancer heavy bombers. The stealthy cruise missiles, which have a range of 230 miles (370km), can carry a 450kg warhead and use infrared sensors to guide themselves towards their targets. Each B1 can carry four. The weapon, like others used in Saturday’s strikes, can be delivered from outside the Syrian and Russian air defences meaning that the aircraft and ships involved would not be exposed. The use of the JASSM – which first came into use nine years ago – would fit with Donald Trump’s tweet this week warning Russia the US would respond with a “new” and “smart” missile. Trump and Putin have been engaged in recent months in something of a rhetorical arms race over weapons systems and their capabilities, with Putin boasting of new hypersonic nuclear missiles and high-speed submarines before the recent presidential election. Russia this year deployed its most advanced fighter jet to Syria, the stealth-capable Su-57."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/apr/15/formula-one-2018-chinese-grand-prix-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T08:05:10Z","webTitle":"F1 2018: Daniel Ricciardo wins Chinese Grand Prix – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/apr/15/formula-one-2018-chinese-grand-prix-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/apr/15/formula-one-2018-chinese-grand-prix-live","fields":{"headline":"F1 2018: Daniel Ricciardo wins Chinese Grand Prix – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for your company today, the race was looking like a procession early before it came alive. Ricciardo is certainly the driver of the day, and he’ll tackle the rest of the season with a win in the bank. If you see Lewis Hamilton over the next few days maybe don’t mention that Mercedes are winless after three... Keep on eye on our ongoing F1 coverage, and we’ll see you at the next race. There’s likely to be plenty of chat about this race in the wash-up, almost all of it surrounding Red Bull. The focus may be on Verstappen’s death-defying driving, but credit must go to Ricciardo for a fantastic drive. After the crowd is roped into an early round of applause from a false finish in the Australian national anthem it’s time for the trophy presentation. Then the celebrations will go - as we say in Daniel’s homeland - “right off”. The shoe is out, with a great shot of Bottas standing behind him looking about as unimpressed as any human possibly could. He’s challenged for disinterest by Raikkonen in the podium photo. We nearly had some more drama on the way back to the garages. Finishing order - before calculating Verstappen’s 10 second penalty 1. Daniel Ricciardo 2. Valtteri Bottas 3. Kimi Raikkonen 4. Lewis Hamilton 5. Fightin’ Max Verstappen 6. Nico Hulkenberg 7. Fernando Alonso 8. Sebastian Vettel 9. Carlos Sainz 10. Kevin Magnussen 11. Esteban Ocon 12. Sergio Perez 13. Stoffel Vandoorne 14. Lance Stroll 15. Sergey Sirotkin 16. Marcus Ericsson 17. Roman Grosjean 18. Pierre Gasly 19. Charles Leclerc RET. Brendon Hartley Lap 56 - Red Bull and Daniel Ricciardo are on the board in 2018! He’s driven a fantastic race to win the Chinese Grand Prix. It’s his sixth win from outside the top three on the grid. Carlos Sainz has one longing look at Vettel on the second last turn, but decides he’s too far behind and settles for ninth. Lap 55 - Alonso goes past Vettel into 7th, and he’s running so badly that even Carlos Sainz next in the queue might have a go. Vettel complains over the radio that he was run off the track, but to be fair he’s had one of those days so let him go. Lap 54 - With two laps to run, Ricciardo is charging away. He’s almost seven seconds up now. Magnussen is your last man in the points, comfortably ahead of Perez. Lap 53 - Brendon Hartley has done me in! Just as I was about to launch a speaking tour about retirement free races he pulls out. The only crucial battles left are Bottas vs Raikkonen vs Verstappen for 2nd/3rd/4th and Alonso within a second of Vettel for 7th. Lap 52 - Vettel has got problems, losing ground on 6th placed Hulkenberg and being outpaced by Alonso in 8th. Raikkonen is closing on Bottas, and may be within range to have a go at him in the next lap. Ricciardo has got this sewn up unless something goes drastically wrong. Lap 51 - We’ve got five laps to go, and Ricciardo is now nearly five seconds ahead. Raikkonen is within range of Bottas, but not getting close enough to launch a move. And more on the ever controversial Verstappen: Lap 50 - Ricciardo has got this in his grasp. He’s 4.2 seconds ahead of Bottas, who is busy trying to ward off Kimi. Looks like Mercedes will go an unprecedented three races in a row without a win. Somehow despite all that chaos we’ve still got all 20 cars running. My own personal record of being on deck for 3 of 8 races in history without a retirement is on. Lap 49 - Christian Horner of Red Bull says his team will ‘clench their butt cheeks’ and hope for the best with Ricciardo at the front. He’s 4.3 seconds ahead of Bottas now, and looking comfortable unless something bizarre happens. Bottas is now only half a second ahead of Raikkonen. Lap 48 - Verstappen gets past Hamilton without incident. The penalty may bring him back behind the Mercedes, but now that he’s got clear air he can try and build a big enough gap that the penalty won’t matter. Meanwhile, Raikkonen has taken advantage of all the chaos to comfortably sit third. Lap 47 - The lead is now over four seconds. More importantly we’ve got Verstappen looking at Hamilton again. Ricciardo may be forced to use the shoe to try and defend his teammate against a surprise Mercedes/Ferrari alliance after the race. Lap 46 - Verstappen has been handed a 10 second penalty. If the race finished now he’d finish in 9th place. Ricciardo is streaking to victory, with a fastest lap 1.36.221. Fancy champagne looks like it will be introduced to a sweaty shoe. The top 10 as it stands: 1. Ricciardo 2. Bottas 3. Raikkonen 4. Hamilton 5. Verstappen (penalty pending) 6. Hulkenberg 7. Vettel 8. Magnussen 9. Alonso 10. Sainz Lap 45 - The Red Bull of Ricciardo finds the narrowest gap inside Bottas, the Mercedes yields under pressure of an imminent collision and lets him go. He’s straight through to a 1.5 second lead by the end of the lap. Race control is investigating the Vettel/Verstappen collision. Lap 44 - At the front the gap is down to 0.4 seconds and Ricciardo is all over the wing of Bottas. Lap 43 - Bottas leads by 1.1 seconds over Ricciardo. The Red Bull has pulled well away from Vettel. Verstappen has hit Vettel! They are both back in the race, but down to 5th and 6th respectively. Will there be anyone not feuding with Max by the end of the season? Lap 42 - Verstappen is back from the dead and past Hamilton! Lewis was struggling for grip, and lost fourth place to his rival. Even better for Red Bull, Ricciardo has gone past Vettel and into second place. He’s well on the trail of Bottas now - 1.5 seconds behind. Lap 41 - Ricciardo sets a new fastest lap with a 1.36.608. He’s half a second behind Vettel. Verstappen is back on Hamilton’s tail, only 0.5 of a second behind. Lap 40 - Ricciardo grabs Hamilton with a great passing move, much to the delight of his mechanics. He’s now 3rd. Reader Dan writes in on the subject of Raikkonen being used as a mobile blocking unit for Vettel. It’s no wonder Kimi always looks miserable. He shouldn’t accept a life of being Vettel’s sidekick. Ferrari ruin the intention of the sport by always favouring only 1 driver and sacrificing the other to try to help them. Many years without a driver championship prove this doesn’t work. Lap 39 - Verstappen runs off the road trying to pass Hamilton! He loses fourth, and by narrowly avoiding a calamity we miss the very real chance of a good old fashioned fistfight between drivers. The gap at the front is 1.4 seconds and falling. Vettel is coming for Bottas. Lap 38 - After Bottas’ 1.7 second gap to Vettel, the rest of the top five are close together. Hamilton is 0.9 behind in third, Verstappen 0.6 back in fourth and Ricciardo a second behind his teammate. At least the Toro Rosso twitterist can see the funny side of the Gasly debacle. Lap 37 - Ricciardo has a look at Raikkonen for 5th but can’t make it work. He finally sticks the move into the hairpin and grabs the position. Vettel is 1.6 behind, but he’s also got problems with Hamilton less than a second behind him. Lap 36 - Bottas timed his restart perfectly, and now leads by nearly two seconds. All the action at the restart came lower in the field, with Alonso getting past Grosjean and into ninth. Gasly has been given a 10 second penalty, showing that the stewards didn’t agree with his version of events either. Lap 35 - We’re racing again. Bottas stays ahead from Vettel, Hamilton, Verstappen and Raikkonen. Lap 34 - The safety car is back in after this lap and we’ll be on again. The field will be bunched up and anything could happen. Hold on to your hats and ensure you’re sitting level in the middle of your chair. Lap 33 - Another lap under safety car. Perez has pitted as well. The cleanup team is on the track, sweeping furiously like a Winter Olympic curling team to clear the way for a restart. Lap 32 - Hulkenberg, Sainz and Ocon all took advantage of the safety car (as correctly predicted by Renault pre-race) to come in. Debris is still all over the corner where the Gasly/Hartley collision happened. The accident is now under investigation. Lap 31 - Safety car! Plenty of debris on the corner where the Toro Rosso incident happened. Red Bull has used the opportunity to double stack their drivers in the pits. Lap 30 - Temporary Yellow flags as two Toro Rosso cars come together. Gasly has a go at Hartley, and collides with him going into the turn. He doesn’t share the widely held view that he was at fault and berates his teammate on the radio. They’re both back in the race, still no retirements. Bottas leads Vettel by 0.9. Lap 29 - Charles Leclerc is the first man to tempt fate on a retirement, spinning off but managing to recover and rejoin the race. If he’d not been able to get started again there would have certainly been a virtual safety car. The gap at the front is still just over a second. Verstappen is 5.7 back from Vettel in third, and he’s got two seconds on Hamilton. Lap 28 - The current top 10: 1. Bottas (0.9 seconds ahead) 2. Vettel 3. Verstappen 4. Hamilton 5. Ricciardo 6. Raikkonen 7. Alonso 8. Hulkenberg 9. Sainz 10. Magnussen Lap 27 - Raikkonen has stopped, and in a win for occupational health and safety fanatics everywhere he’s made it back to the track without any of his pit crew being maimed. He drops down to 6th on his exit. Lap 26 - Bottas has a tentative look at Raikkonen, but opts not to attack. Late in the lap he goes around the outside and eventually wins a wheel-to-wheel battle. Raikkonen has a go towards his inside, opening the door for Vettel to pass him as well and go into second. The Mercedes leads, but with only a 0.6 second safety net to Vettel. Lap 25 - It’s down to 0.6 at the front, as Bottas sits in a Ferrari sandwich with Vettel slowly gaining on him. If he can get past Kimi quickly he’ll be in a great position to win this race. Lap 24 - The lead is down to 2.7 seconds, and Vettel is right on Bottas’ hammer now. He’s just over a second ahead of the Mercedes. Kimi is still going, like that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer tried to drive as long as possible before running out of fuel. Lap 23 - Vettel has only shaved a tenth of a second off Bottas, but the Mercedes is advancing on Raikkonen and may end up being slowed by him soon. It’s still 4.8 seconds at the front. Last man on track is Leclerc. Lap 22 - Raikkonen is 6.2 ahead of Bottas and still on track. Maybe his pit crew have put a ban on him? Bottas is 1.4 up on Vettel in the crucial battle for what is at the moment second. Meanwhile, approaching the halfway mark of the race we’re still without a retirement. Should it stay that way, it will be the third time I’ve done a live blog where everyone has finished. I’m willing to discuss terms with Formula One to retire from the game. Lap 21 - Vettel comes out of the pits and is just nabbed by Bottas. He’s now got 1.3 seconds on the Ferrari and will take the lead when Raikkonen pits. Race on! Lap 20 - Bottas exits well clear of Verstappen, who just set the new fastest lap of the race with a 1.37.755. Vettel is coming in from first, temporarily allowing Raikkonen to take the lead. Lap 19 - Hamilton gets back on track in front of Magnussen and Ricciardo. The Australian quickly wraps up the Renault for 6th. Bottas is now coming in. Lap 18 - Verstappen and Ricciardo have both come in, one after the other. Max has gone on mediums in an attempt to avoid having to stop again. Mercedes have called Hamilton in, and he’s out in 2.5 seconds. Lap 17 - The margin is 3.6 seconds at the front, as we enter the F1 equivalent of the middle overs of a one day cricket game. Lap 16 - The gap at the front is not only extending between 1st and 3rd, but Vettel is getting to the point where he’s a full pit stop behind the Ferrari. Verstappen lost half a second on Bottas in that lap. For those of you following the Sainz vs Gasly race, the Renault man is into 15th now. Lap 15 - Bottas remains well at bay, but he’s got 5.8 seconds on Verstappen behind him. The battle of the lap was Sainz trying to get past Gasly for 15th, but the Renault couldn’t make it and continues to run 16th. Lap 14 - Hulkenberg is the first of the top 10 runners to pit, coming out behind Leclerc and Gasly for 15th. He’s 2.5 seconds ahead of teammate Sainz who has also been in. Vettel continues to hold court, 3.5 seconds out front and as yet unchallenged. He’s barely had to do anything unconventional since shutting the gate on his teammate at the start. Lap 13 - The lead is up to more than three seconds now, as Bottas’ period of keeping up with Vettel has come to an end. Verstappen is five seconds behind them. Lap 12 - Alonso briefly gets ahead of Grosjean, before the Haas man fought back to stay in the points. It’s out to 2.8 seconds at the front now. Lap 11 - Vettel extends his lead to 2.l8 seconds, and Bottas has a further 2.5 on Verstappen in third. The big gap is between Ricciardo in 6th and Hulkenberg in 7th - more than 10 seconds behind. Hartley in the Toro Rosso is the first man to pit. Meanwhile Grosjean has called in to the Haas garage to suggest ditching the ultrasoft tyres at the first available opportunity. Lap 10 - No change at the front, or in the top 10 . The closest drivers are currently Grosjean 0.8 ahead of Alonso in the 10th place battle. Hamilton is 1.4 behind Raikkonen for 4th. Lap 9 - The gap is out to 2.5 seconds, with Vettel left alone to do as he likes at the front. Hamilton is 10 seconds off the lead, with three cars between him and Vettel. This race looks like it’s in a holding pattern at the front until the stops begin. Lap 8 - The gap is 2.3 seconds at the front. No change in the top six since the opening lap. In other news, I’ve saved this Lance Stroll GIF for ongoing use in my daily life. Lap 7 - After losing half a second on Vettel in the first half of the lap, Bottas recovers to only be a 2.3 down. He’s got 3.5 seconds on Verstappen The closest battle on the track is between Magnussen, Grosjean and Alonso for 9th to 11th. Lap 6 - The big losers so far have been Perez (down six positions) and Hartley (down four) Vettel has got 2.2 seconds on Bottas. He’s in control, but he’s not pulling away anymore. Lap 5 - All our runners are still on track. The current top 10: 1. Vettel (2.5 seconds ahead) 2. Bottas 3. Verstappen 4. Raikkonen 5. Hamilton 6. Ricciardo 7. Hulkenberg 8. Sainz 9. Grosjean 10. Magnussen Lap 4 - Bottas stems the bleeding, cutting Vettel’s lead to 2.3 seconds at the end of the lap. Hamilton is still 1.2 behind Raikkonen in the battle for fourth, and he’s 2.1 behind Verstappen. Lewis’ season is starting to resemble the sound of a balloon slowly losing air. Lap 3 - DRS has now been enabled, but nobody’s within range to use it near the front. The margin at the front is now 2.5 seconds, with a further 1.3 from Bottas to Verstappen. Hamilton is 1.1 behind Raikkonen. Last man on track is Ericsson, almost two seconds last behind Gasly. Lap 2 - Bottas lost half a second in the first part of the lap, so it looks like Vettel is going to comfortably control the pace until at least the first round of stops. No change in positions after that lap, Ricciardo is 6th and the two Renaults of Hulkenberg and Sainz behind him. Grosjean and Magnussen are the others in the points. Lap 1 - Vettel has gone well clear on the first lap, he’s already a second ahead of Bottas. Verstappen is third, Raikkonen fourth and Hamilton is down to fifth. The big gainer is Lance Stroll, who has gone from 18th to 12th on the first lap. Vettel cuts across to keep Raikkonen from passing at the start, and Bottas has jumped into second. Everyone has survived the first corner! Raikkonen is down to fourth behind Verstappen. Pit crew everywhere, you have approximately two minutes to make sure your insurance is up to date. The formation lap is underway, we’re a few minutes away from the start of the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix. The front four starters are all on the soft tyres. Everyone down to 10th has ultrasofts, and the majority of the remainder are on softs. Pierre Gasly is your outlier, rolling out the mediums from 17th place. In a scenario you never thought you’d hear, Toto Wolff has just claimed underdog status. Pigs also reportedly about to take flight. Drivers are climbing into their cars, and we’ll find out just how strong Toto’s claim is in the next few minutes. He also told him that he had a “personal thing” to do before getting in the car. Which I can only assume is paying his electricity bill. If your loyalties are towards entertainment rather than either of the teams, like me you’ll be looking at Max Verstappen coming off the row behind Lewis Hamilton towards the first corner. Last week Lewis used that classic Commonwealth term “dickhead” to describe the Red Bull man. They’ve since patched things up semi-convincingly, but if there’s any hint of contact between the two today the post-race scenes could become chaotic. Not Connor McGregor throwing a barricade at a bus chaotic, but the sort of passive aggressive feud that F1 excels at. Pit lane is open, and we’re within 30 minutes of lights out. Lewis Hamilton is the king of the Chinese Grand Prix, with five career wins. The heat is on today, needing to get past his teammate and two Ferraris to add a sixth. Fernando Alonso (x2) and Kimi Raikkonen are the only other previous winners in the field today. Any chance of a replay of the Spinal Tap-esque incident pre-race where a kid asked Lewis for an autograph via a black marker on a black hat? After generously pondering where he was supposed to write and turning it over a few times to try and find an appropriate spot he just wrote on it and hoped for the best. Your copy of the footage will help that child prove to his mates at school tomorrow that he really did meet the world champion. After five passing moves in Melbourne and 42 in Bahrain could this be the rubber match to decide which way the season is going to go? More passing means increased chance of a collision, and Renault has helpfully done the stats and discovered what we’re a nearly 50/50 chance of seeing a safety car today. On the other hand, the 2016 edition of this race was one of the handful in the history of Formula 1 where every starter made it to the finish line unscathed, so [insert that shruggy Emoji thing that is so popular with kids]. Good afternoon, morning, or night wherever you are. Welcome to our coverage of the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix. The key storyline today is whether Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari can continue their red hot start to the season. No driver has ever won the first three races of the season and failed to go on and win the title. To be fair there are a lot more races than there used to be, but nevertheless the German starts from pole today with history on his side. Here’s how the drivers will line up: 1. Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) 2. Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) 3. Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) 4. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 5. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 6. Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) 7. Nico Hulkenberg (Renault) 8. Sergio Perez (Force India) 9. Carlos Sainz (Renault) 10. Roman Grosjean (Haas) 11. Kevin Magnussen (Haas) 12. Esteban Ocon (Force India) 13. Fernando Alonso (McLaren) 14. Stoffel Vandoorne (McLaren) 15. Brendon Hartley (Toro Rosso) 16. Sergey Sirotkin (Williams) 17. Pierre Gasly (Toro Rosso) 18. Lance Stroll (Williams) 19. Charles Leclerc (Sauber) 20. Marcus Ericsson (Sauber) Adam will be here shortly.

He was the Czech new wave émigré who brought the spirit of anti-Soviet rebellion to Hollywood and made its sly comic strategies and humanist passion flower in dozens of different ways. He also became one of the many directors whose work was shaped by working with the great screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière. Forman was a sensational Oscar winner with One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) starring Jack Nicholson as the hyperactive crook who fakes madness to get what he thinks is the soft option of a psychiatric facility; and Amadeus (1984), the gripping myth about F Murray Abraham’s thin-lipped Antonio Salieri planning to kill Tom Hulce’s impish Mozart – the mediocre rational careerist enviously destroying the disorderly genius. Forman became feted for conjuring drama and star performances from the bristling ensemble of smaller roles. And the madhouse scene, in all its poignant farce and Foucauldian political surveillance became a keynote of his movies, even resurfacing in his final, flawed work Goya’s Ghosts in 2006 with Natalie Portman, Javier Bardem and Stellan Skårsgard. Forman studied screenwriting at the Academy of the Performing Arts in Prague and his first big success was A Blonde in Love (1965) which, like so much in pop culture from the west, tapped into the romantic and erotic dissatisfaction, as well as the social restlessness, of the young. A young woman who works in a shoe factory has a one-night stand with a guy, but on moving to the big city to be with him, and on crucially meeting his parents (that unsatisfactory older generation) sees that there is something very wrong. His next big hit was the sensational – but interestingly subtle and indirect – satire The Firemen’s Ball in 1967, a virtual real-time account of an evening fundraiser for the local fire service in which bureaucracy and pompous uniform-wearing officialdom are sent up. Importantly, a building actually burns to the ground in the course of a night dedicated to firefighting. It is a brilliant and persuasive comedy. But it was banned by the Czech authorities, a paradoxical act of important criticism which revealed the film’s and Forman’s importance, and their own hamfisted clumsiness. After the tanks were sent into Prague, Forman established himself in New York. His 1971 comedy Taking Off touched again on the theme of the stuffy and now preposterous older generation failing to understand their children, but it was his 1975 movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest which propelled Forman into the big league. This was based on the Ken Kesey novel which had already been adapted for the stage with Kirk Douglas in the lead role. With the help of his producer son Michael Douglas, Kirk was persuaded to step down in favour of the hot newcomer Jack Nicholson and under Forman’s guidance, his boisterous performance amidst the gallery of holy fools and other unholy people was electric. It was a brilliant film, though still perhaps not entirely understood: Forman directed a great scene in which the hated Nurse Ratched reveals herself to be not driven by sadism but a kind of blinkered, misguided professionalism. Forman’s protégé James Mangold drew on the master’s work for his own film Girl, Interrupted, with Angelina Jolie in the comparable sacrificial-wild-child role. Hair was Forman’s next movie, a screen adaptation of the counter-culture anti-war musical which made protest acceptable to the theatregoing classes. It was another example of how Forman had a flair for the zeitgeist and for artistic dissent, but it perhaps didn’t quite approximate the impact Hair had had on stage: a theatre work which itself looks a little genteel compared to the rock legends of the time. But his movie was a very intelligent, fluent piece of work. Amadeus was Forman’s next theatrical adaptation — and again the actor who had made the lead role a hit on stage had to be persuaded to step aside. This was the brilliant Simon Callow, who perhaps deserved a chance to be directed by Forman and it is a shame that his performance was not immortalised on screen. But Tom Hulce, with his sudden, shriekingly nervous and trumphant laugh, was still a very successful Mozart and F Murray Abraham was horribly malcontented as Salieri, and chillingly convincing as someone who foresees his own destiny in hell. Amadeus is less renowned than Cuckoo’s Nest among Forman’s work, but in some ways it hangs together better. And it really is, to use a critical platitude often given to more solemn work, “mesmerising”. It was ideal for Forman’s own sophistication and his real, lived experience of art and the authorities: how the agencies of the state, in all their stultifying pomposity, will claim to be patrons or sponsors of the arts, but only to spread the word of conformism, to assist in the business of controlling people’s hearts and minds, and in doing so create malign mediocrity. Perhaps Forman saw a battalion of Salieris in Czechoslovakia and all over Eastern Europe, blandly consenting to a soulless regime in return for petty distinctions. In his later career, Forman directed Valmont, an adaptation of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, a movie which was perhaps more obviously passionate and erotic than Stephen Frears’s Dangerous Liaisons which had come out the year before — but which upstaged Forman’s version, with its colossal performances from Glenn Close and John Malkovich. Forman was to address two more classic American bad boys: the porn publisher Larry Flynt and the cult comic Andy Kaufman. In The People Vs Larry Flynt (1996), Woody Harrelson’s impulsive and extravagant Flynt becomes a highly unlikely and satirically ambiguous poster boy for freedom of speech. In Man on the Moon (1999), Jim Carrey plays Kaufman as the rock-n-roll wild man of standup. Forman never quite solved the problem of whether and how the film was allowed to be funny on its own account, but it was great casting and Forman clearly empathised with the comedian and his lonely, courageous artform. Forman was a fascinating and triumphant 20th century artist — his career was a carnival subversion of tyrannies."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/apr/19/the-muhammad-ali-of-marbles-classic-fa-cup-semis-and-seedorf","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-19T08:10:10Z","webTitle":"The 'Muhammad Ali of marbles', classic FA Cup semis and Seedorf","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/19/the-muhammad-ali-of-marbles-classic-fa-cup-semis-and-seedorf","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/apr/19/the-muhammad-ali-of-marbles-classic-fa-cup-semis-and-seedorf","fields":{"headline":"The 'Muhammad Ali of marbles', classic FA Cup semis and Seedorf","bodyText":"1) To the marbles world championship!

The mare registered her 18th Group One win to move within one more of setting herself apart the unbeaten Black Caviar, who retired unbeaten. The victory in the richest race of the Sydney autumn carnival also prompted more comparisons with Phar Lap and ensured the debate continues over whether she could be the best racehorse ever seen. Winx sat in last place for the first half of the race at Royal Randwick Racecourse, but as she began to move up the field on the outside before reaching the home straight, any doubts over the result evaporated. Piloted by Hugh Bowman, she hit the accelerator and blitzed through the rest of the field, which included Humidor and Happy Clapper, to leave them in her wake and win by about five lengths. “What can I say. She is just an exceptional athlete,” said Bowman. “I’m so elated, so proud to be a part of it.” Co-owner Peter Tighe said: “This is the best horse in the world, with the best jockey in the world and the best trainer in the world.

Moments after Donald Trump finished his address on Friday night, reports emerged of explosions in Damascus at about 2am BST. A Pentagon briefing later confirmed three sites were hit: in Damascus and in Homs. The sites were all regarded as linked to the storage, or testing, of chemical weapons. Syrian air defences responded to the strikes but the US said it had suffered no losses in the initial airstrikes. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has described the strikes as an “act of aggression” and said the attack would worsen the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Anatoly Antonov, the Russian ambassador to the US, said “such actions will not be left without consequences” and that Moscow was being threatened. Syrian state TV has shown a video of Bashar al-Assad arriving at work on Saturday morning after the coalition strikes. Syria’s air defence systems intercepted 71 out of 103 cruise missiles fired as part of the US-led strikes, claims the Russian military. The Pentagon has denied any interceptions were made. Russian air defence systems did not respond to the missiles, it added. Trump said the attack in Douma a week ago represented “a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use” by the Assad regime, adding: “We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.” On Saturday, the US president tweeted that the strike was “perfectly executed”, adding it was “mission accomplished!” The British prime minister, Theresa May, said she authorised targeted strikes to “degrade the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons capability and deter their use”. Taking a swipe at Russia, she said: “We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world. We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.” The UK government has released a summary of its legal advice authorising strikes against Syria following calls to do so from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad – has condemned the US-led strikes, describing the leaders of France, the UK and the US as “criminals”. Turkey welcomed the attack, describing the raids as an “appropriate response” to the use of chemical weapons in Douma last Saturday. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, said the US, UK and France had taken “decisive action” against Syria’s chemical weapon infrastructure and did not rule out further strikes. “Clearly the Assad regime did not get the message” last time, he said, referring to the response to the Ghouta chemical attack in 2017. He said the allies had “gone to great length to avoid civil and foreign casualties”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said four Tornado jets flew from Cyprus as part of the strikes on Homs. French defence ministry sources have said France fired 12 missiles from fighter jets and frigates as part of the coordinated air and sea raids. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime posed an “immediate danger for the Syrian people and our collective security”.Corbyn has called thestrikes “legally questionable” and said Theresa May should have sought prior parliamentary approval. The Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has issued his support for strikes. The organisation’s main political decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, was due to hold a meeting to discuss the developments on Saturday afternoon. The EU and Canada have backed the strikes. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said those who rely on chemical warfare must be held to account. Hezbollah, which fights in support of Assad’s regime, said the US-led strikes “will not realise” US goals. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has called for calm, urging “all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/22/leslie-jamison-interview-the-recovering-alcoholism-memoir","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Leslie Jamison: ‘Why was life such a barren tundra if I wasn’t drinking?’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/22/leslie-jamison-interview-the-recovering-alcoholism-memoir","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/22/leslie-jamison-interview-the-recovering-alcoholism-memoir","fields":{"headline":"Leslie Jamison: ‘The failure felt awful. Why was life such a barren tundra if I wasn’t drinking?’","bodyText":"The American writer Leslie Jamison is the bestselling author of the acclaimed essay collection The Empathy Exams (2014). She grew up in Los Angeles, read English at Harvard, studied for her MFA in creative writing at the Iowa Workshop, and has a PhD from Yale, where her thesis looked at addiction and sincerity in 20th-century American literature. She now lives in New York, where she teaches at Columbia University, with her husband, the writer Charles Bock, her stepdaughter, and their three-month-old baby daughter. Her new book, The Recovering: Intoxication and Its Aftermath, describes her struggle with alcoholism, as well as that of key literary figures such as Elizabeth Bishop and John Cheever. But its main focus is on her subsequent sobriety, achieved with the help of the 12-step programme, better known as Alcoholics Anonymous; eventually, she turns her narrative over to the voices of some fellow addicts. She is interested in the connection between storytelling, and both alcoholism and sobriety. As she writes early on: “Yearning is our most powerful narrative engine, and addiction is one of its dialects.” She first felt the buzz of alcohol at 13. She first drank in secret at 15. At a Harvard student initiation ceremony, she drank so much that all she remembers is waking up in her dorm room where whoever had brought her home had left a note that read: “Hope you’re OK.” And on, and on. Booze made her feel, she writes, as if it had plunged her into “a darkness that seemed like honesty… as if the bright surfaces of the world were all false and the desperate drunk space underground was where the truth lived.” How does The Recovering connect, if at all, to The Empathy Exams? There is one line in the last essay in that book where I say “suffering is interesting, but so is getting better”. I threw down some kind of gauntlet, and this book picks that up. The most natural form for it might have been a scholarly monograph; the hybrid nonfiction book is usually a slim volume. But at a certain point, I had to accept that this would be a big book: critical, reported, personal, all sorts of things. I decided to let the material call the shots. You talk in the book of people’s eyes glazing over at the thought of yet another tale of alcoholism and recovery. How nervous were you about tackling the subject? Did it seem daunting? Not really. I was very aware that there is this aesthetic problem embedded in the form of the addiction-recovery story, which is that people feel they’ve heard it before. But you’re not just retelling a story if you’re faithful to your experience. Every story is reborn in each life. My drinking certainly never got as bad as many people’s, but if you’re willing to ask vigorous questions of your interior experience, there is always something there. The book examines the lives of several alcoholic writers, among them John Berryman and Jean Rhys. Again, their stories are quite well known. How did you choose who to include? The picking was largely a function of writers who had been important to me, and of circumstance. So when I moved to Iowa [to join the Iowa Writers’ Workshop], writers who had been there became important: Berryman, Raymond Carver, Denis Johnson. Others I sought out, like Charles Jackson [author of The Lost Weekend, a powerfully realistic novel about alcoholism from 1944]. I felt such a connection with the way the alcoholic impulse is evoked in that book. It was revolutionary, then, that he was willing to be so honest about how petty and banal and claustrophobic drinking can be, but he also captures its enthralment. I was fascinated that he’d tried and failed to write a sober novel. Jean Rhys was important to me in my early 20s: I had a heart-swelling identification with Good Morning Midnight [a 1939 novel about a heavy-drinking woman’s feelings of desperation between the wars]. I returned to her in my 30s, when I was thinking harder about what it meant that Rhys never overcame her drinking. You use Rhys to look at the way our culture may be harder on, more disgusted by, the female alcoholic than the male. Why do you think male drunks are treated with more sympathy than female? Some of it has to do with care-giving: we’re much more prone to bring expectations of care-giving to women than to men. Part of what it means to be addicted to anything is that you’re absenting yourself from your relationships. That’s more of a crime when a woman does it. This is true in the context of Jean Rhys [who never forgave herself for drinking while her baby son lay dying], but you also see it in the media construction of the crack-mother phenomenon. When a man is a drunk, there is self-destruction. A drunk woman is just as self-destructive, but she’s also unseemly, histrionic, melodramatic. Was it painful to write about your own drinking, to remember the blackouts and all the other humiliations involved? Yes, but not in the ways people expect. I don’t want to write personal narrative unless I’m granular. You lose the truth if you glaze over things. I was reluctant to dramatise the fights with my boyfriend at first, but then I realised that in order to bring someone into my experience, I had to be specific. It was an aesthetic imperative. It’s about craft. When I write loaded personal material, something about the process of crafting, it really bolsters me. How is it serving the larger story? Driving questions carried me through it. It’s actually harder for me to write about other people than about myself. Have any of the other people in the book responded to it? Part of my practice is that I ask people who are in a book if they want to read it in manuscript, so we can talk about it, and I can edit. Everyone who’s in it in a substantive way read it a year before publication. Dave [Jamison’s ex-boyfriend], the biggest character, was generous. He made it a better book. But I don’t want to be a Pollyanna. Sometimes, those conversations can be quite difficult. There was material I took out. You write about being a certain kind of clever but insecure young woman: one who devotes too much energy to worrying about how other people, particularly men, see her. As a child, your parents divorced; your father left. To what degree do you connect your drinking to him? When I was younger, I drew a very strong connective line between my father and certain of my personality traits: my deep desire for affirmation from men; my deep fear of being abandoned. But by the time I wrote this book, I thought that was only part of the story. I wanted to honour other things. Alcoholism may be traced back to more imperative sources, by which I mean biological ones. I wasn’t writing a popular science book, but it’s no accident that mental illness is everywhere in my family tree, and so is alcoholism. You were a very high-functioning alcoholic. While you were drinking, you got a PhD from Yale and you published a novel; you held down several jobs. How did you know you needed help? People talk about rock bottom, but I don’t feel you ever got there. I’ve done a lot of thinking about what is shared and not shared between people with addictive impulses that bring them to different levels of functionality. I don’t believe in protocols of suffering, but I also believe every life is different. My high-functioning impulse is deeply related to my addictive impulses. They felt very knitted together, always. I always had to be good enough, to get every gold star. That desperate drive: I wanted some relief from it, just to shut down. When I began to want to get sober, it was cumulative. I’d tried to stop drinking a few times, and it scared me how unmanageable it was for me to stop. The failure started to feel awful. Why was life such a barren tundra if I wasn’t drinking? There were days, weeks, months where the first thing I thought about was: when am I going to get drunk? It wasn’t costing me my job or my reputation in a black-and-white way. But my interior felt really small and obsessed with this one thing. That felt shameful and corrosive. The last nights of my drinking were very ordinary; I took a huge amount of whisky into a room to pass out drunk. But it was the smallness of that which sent me into recovery. And when I failed [to get sober] the first time, the repetition convinced me I would always end up in the same place if I drank. The idea of hitting rock bottom has to do with storytelling. Rock bottom is subjective. It’s what you say it is, and what you need it to be. You got sober by attending AA, an institution that the writer in you thought of as peddling cliches. Now, though, you believe in it wholly. What happened? It’s true that I had a resistance to the kind of cliched language I would hear over and over again; it didn’t satisfy the part of me that always craves or seeks the most original way of putting something. Hearing people fit their lives into a pattern also felt reductive. But as a writer, I’ve always loved other people’s stories. Every life has stories in it worth telling. That appealed. I also came to have a respect for the cliches. I felt they could be useful as alibis against exceptionality. If you feel a cliche resonates with you, then you’re not so original after all – and that’s also a useful way to connect with someone when your external circumstances are quite different. You look at this piece of truth you share. What could I possibly say to a woman who was living with her son in a van? Actually, though, to have these pieces of wisdom gave me a legitimate and meaningful common language. You put a lot of extra voices in the final section of the book: those of other addicts in recovery. Why? I wanted the book to work like an AA meeting, one that lifts you out of your own life by virtue of listening to other people talk about theirs. Also, these 15 people allowed me to show, and not just to tell, that addiction does not go one single way. Some people get sober. Some never do. Some get sober, and then they commit suicide. It allows for this honesty. Where are you now in your sobriety? How does it feel? I’ve been sober since 2010. I still go to meetings. I heard somebody in recovery say things don’t always get better, but they always get different, which I found a useful cliche. The condition of sobriety has risen to meet the changing conditions of my life: the end of relationships, my marriage, having a stepdaughter, and a newborn baby. It helps me to show up for life, to expect it to be ordinary, rather than entirely great or entirely terrible. There’s something about its constancy and ongoing-ness that I feel a bit more equipped to handle. Do you miss drinking? I miss it in a different way than in the beginning, when it was acute and overpowering, and it was hard to imagine not missing it. But there are times when, say, I’ll go back to a city where I used to live, or hit a certain season. I’ll remember what it felt like to drink dirty martinis in the autumn or white wine in the summer. Certain cues bring back everything that felt blissful and enchanting about it. Of course, I wanted to write that into the book. I wanted to be real about how spellbinding it is. Happiness was entwined with my drinking, as well as sadness. I didn’t want to construct some simple before and after."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/13/london-stock-exchange-appoints-goldman-sachs-banker-david-schwimmer-as-ceo","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T16:57:33Z","webTitle":"Goldman Sachs banker appointed London Stock Exchange CEO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/13/london-stock-exchange-appoints-goldman-sachs-banker-david-schwimmer-as-ceo","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/13/london-stock-exchange-appoints-goldman-sachs-banker-david-schwimmer-as-ceo","fields":{"headline":"Goldman Sachs banker appointed London Stock Exchange CEO","bodyText":"The London Stock Exchange has ended its six-month search for a new chief executive by appointing Goldman Sachs banker David Schwimmer to replace Xavier Rolet, who was pushed out in November. Schwimmer, who advises exchanges as the head of Goldman’s market structure business in New York, will join in August after 20 years at the Wall Street firm. He will be paid £775,000 a year plus a bonus of up to £1.7m and will receive £1.05m to make up for not getting his 2018 bonus from the US investment bank. The 49-year-old American’s first task will be to steady LSE after an unusually turbulent period for one of the City’s oldest and most prestigious institutions. After Rolet’s departure was announced in October, TCI Fund Management, one of LSE’s biggest shareholders, called for his reinstatement and accused the board of forcing him out against the interests of investors. The dispute came to a head in late November when Rolet agreed to leave immediately and LSE said its chairman, Donald Brydon, would not stand for re-election after 2019. Schwimmer’s appointment resolves LSE’s quest for a new chief executive less than two weeks before its annual general meeting on 24 April. With a new chief executive lined up, Brydon is likely to face an easier ride at the meeting. TCI declined to comment on the decision to hire Schwimmer. The Yale and Harvard graduate will also have to defend LSE’s position as the world’s biggest clearing house for derivative transactions against competition from European exchanges. Germany’s Deutsche Börse is trying to lure the lucrative business away from London after the Brexit vote. London Clearing House, which LSE controls, processes about three-quarters of the €1tn-a-day (£865bn) clearing market for derivatives, acting as a middleman between buyers and sellers of complex contracts. Rolet warned in 2016 that thousands of City jobs were at risk if London lost responsibility for clearing contracts in euros after Brexit though he said there were very few exchanges that could handle the business. Schwimmer, who is based in New York, spent his first seven years at Goldman advising exchanges and stockbrokers. He then worked as chief of staff to Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, when Blankfein was the bank’s chief operating officer. From 2006 to 2009 he jointly ran Goldman’s business in Russia before becoming head of metals and mining. Last year he combined that job with heading Goldman’s market structure business in a return to advising exchanges. Brydon said: “David is a leader with great experience in the financial market infrastructure sector, which he has been closely involved in throughout his investment banking career, as well as capital markets experience in both developed and emerging markets. He is well known for his robust intellect and partnership approach with clients and colleagues alike.” Schwimmer will be the second former Goldman banker to lead the LSE. Rolet spent 10 years at the bank before leaving in 1994. Mark Carney, the Bank of England’s governor, also worked at Goldman. Carney was drawn into LSE’s dispute with TCI when he said he was “mystified” by events at the exchange. Schwimmer will take over from David Warren, who has run LSE as interim chief executive since Rolet’s departure. Warren will return to his job as LSE’s chief financial officer. Michael Werner, an analyst at UBS, the Swiss bank, said Schwimmer’s appointment was good news for LSE because it clears up the leadership question and investors were hoping an outsider would take over. As a former merger and acquisitions banker, Schwimmer will be equipped to buy other companies, in line with its current strategy, he said. On top of his salary and bonus, Schwimmer will get a cash allowance of 15% of his salary in lieu of pension and other benefits. He will be awarded shares worth three times his salary that will bear fruit if he achieves targets. He will also receive an undisclosed sum for moving from New York and a housing allowance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/apr/13/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T20:00:02Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/apr/13/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• A photograph used with a feature in this Saturday’s Weekend magazine (I gave birth in an Uber, page 13) is credited mysteriously to XXXXXXXX XXXXX.

Now I can’t stand the way my husband touches me or his way of initiating sex. I can’t tell him because I’m afraid of offending him, so I grin and bear it – and hate it. There is another thing he does, without asking me if it’s OK. Out of the blue, he wriggles to the bottom of the bed, and uses my feet to masturbate. I don’t like the feeling and I don’t like that he just uses part of my body for his sexual satisfaction without it being a mutual thing. But it’s the only regular pleasure he gets from me, albeit without my consent. I do love him and I want to make some concessions since I am so uninterested, but I don’t know what to do. Grinning and bearing it is a good way to completely shut down your sexual interest. Menopause can certainly unbalance or reduce the availability of hormones that help a woman enjoy sex and achieve arousal and orgasm, but it should not end your sex life by any means. Talk with your doctor and try to relieve your menopausal symptoms and boost your oestrogen and testosterone. Most importantly, make it a priority to reconnect erotically with your husband by being honest about your responses. No one feels like having sex with a partner who is consistently turning them off. He needs education. First, try to tune into your precise new needs – perhaps these are to be caressed more, soothed more, have more clitoral attention to help with your slower arousal time? Then impart this information very clearly to your husband in a non-blaming fashion. Never allow distasteful or painful sex. Gently guide him to do what pleases you, even if that does not lead you to orgasm. Help him to understand you may sometimes need to stop. You will feel more attracted to him once he is making a genuine effort to pleasure you. Finally, he may also have an erotic connection to your feet, so do not assume his “bottom of the bed” actions are purely mechanical. Talk with him about this and try to appreciate that this is not really unusual. • Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. • If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don’t send attachments).

The Cambridge Analytica scandal, Lord Clement-Jones said, reinforced the committee’s findings, released on Monday in the report “AI in the UK: ready, willing and able?” “These principles do come to life a little bit when you think about the Cambridge Analytica situation,” he told the Guardian. “Whether or not the data analytics they carried out was actually using AI … It gives an example of where it’s important that we do have strong intelligibility of what the hell is going on with our data.” Clement-Jones added: “With the whole business in [the US] Congress and Cambridge Analytica, the political climate in the west now is much riper in terms of people agreeing to … a more public response to the ethics and so on involved. It isn’t just going to be left to Silicon Valley to decide the principles.” At the core of the committee’s recommendations are five ethical principles which, it says, should be applied across sectors, nationally and internationally: Artificial intelligence should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity. Artificial intelligence should operate on principles of intelligibility and fairness. Artificial intelligence should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families or communities. All citizens should have the right to be educated to enable them to flourish mentally, emotionally and economically alongside artificial intelligence. The autonomous power to hurt, destroy or deceive human beings should never be vested in artificial intelligence. The goal is not to write the principles directly into legislation, Clement-Jones said, but rather to have them as a broad guiding beacon for AI regulation. “For instance, in the financial services area it would be the Financial Conduct Authority” that actually applied the principles, “and they would be looking at how insurance companies use algorithms to assess your premiums, how banks assess people for mortgages, and so on and so forth. “Basically, these regulators have to make the connection with the ethics, and this is the way we think they should do it,” Clement-Jones said. “Of course, if in due course people are not observing these ethical principles and the regulator thinks that their powers are inadequate, then there may be a time down the track that we need to rethink this.” In a wide-ranging report, the committee has identified a number of threats that mismanagement of AI could bring to Britain. One concern is of the creation of “data monopolies”, large multinational companies – generally American or Chinese, with Facebook, Google and Tencent all named as examples – with such a grip on the collection of data that they can build better AI than anyone else, enhancing their grip on the data sources and creating a virtuous cycle that renders smaller companies and nations unable to compete. The report stops short of calling for active enforcement to prevent the creation of data monopolies, but does explicitly recommend that the Competition and Markets Authority “review proactively the use and potential monopolisation of data by the big technology companies operating in the UK”. Clement-Jones said: “We want there to be an open market in AI, basically, and if all that happens is we get five or six major AI systems and you have to belong to one of them in order to survive in the modern world, well, that would be something that we don’t want to see.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/13/pm-among-cabinet-members-earning-money-as-a-landlord","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T19:32:22Z","webTitle":"PM among cabinet members earning money as landlords","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/13/pm-among-cabinet-members-earning-money-as-a-landlord","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/13/pm-among-cabinet-members-earning-money-as-a-landlord","fields":{"headline":"PM among cabinet members earning money as landlords","bodyText":"Nine cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, are making more than £10,000 a year by acting as landlords, a Guardian analysis has found. Following Jeremy Hunt’s failure to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he subsequently rented out, an analysis of the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests shows eight other members of the cabinet own property that is rented out for a five-figure annual sum. The health secretary was forced to make an embarrassing apology on Friday after it emerged that he had failed to declare a business interest with both Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests. Hunt has amended the register, which now shows that he has a half share of a holiday home in Italy, a half share in an office building in Hammersmith and seven recently acquired apartments in Southampton. Theresa May and Philip Hammond, who both live in Downing Street, rent out their personal homes in central London. Communities and housing secretary Sajid Javid also rents out property, while Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, rents out two properties, according to the register The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, the minister without portfolio, Brandon Lewis – who is also the Conservative party chairman – and the Welsh minister, Alun Cairns, also own and rent out a property, according to the register. There is no suggestion that the ministers are in breach of the ministerial code. Hunt’s declared property interests are comfortably larger than any of the other ministers listed. He set up Mare Pond Properties Ltd with his wife, Lucia Guo which have since bought seven flats in Alexandra Wharf, a redevelopment project on the Southampton waterfront worth £40m. When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only his wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations. He also breached the Companies Act, which requires anyone with more than 25% control of a company to be declared “a person with significant control”. The act was introduced by David Cameron’s government in 2015 to tackle money laundering and came into force the following year. Kathryn Stone, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday and will consider it early next week, a spokesperson said. Labour said Hunt’s actions represented a “serious breach”. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: “This is simply unacceptable and especially so given the secretary of state’s position at the heart of Theresa May’s government.” Guardian inquiries have established that the flats were developed by a property company owned by a Conservative donor. The 82-flat luxury block was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property company owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach. Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of the complimentary venue hire. Hunt and Roach were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel partly developed by Roachs’ company in Guildford, which is in Hunt’s Surrey constituency. The referral to parliamentary standards comes because House of Commons regulations require all MPs to register any holding larger than 15% within 28 days. Hunt failed to register for five months. He says the omission was an honest administrative error made by his accountant and since corrected. A spokeswoman for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase”. According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m. The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House’ documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight. “With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.” A Downing Street spokesman said: “Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the ministerial code. “We consider the matter closed.” Dr Alex May, the academic who spotted Hunt’s omissions and whose email on 28 March prompted a change to Hunt’s Companies House filing, told the Guardian that the health secretary’s office only admitted wrongdoing after he went public with the information on Friday. “There is a lack of scrutiny from Companies House,” he said. “It allows people to break the law, sometimes unwittingly.” • This article was amended on 14 April 2018. In it we incorrectly stated that Kathryn Hudson is parliament’s commissioner for standards, but she has now left the post. The new commissioner who will assess Hunt’s case is Kathryn Stone."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/13/burberry-hires-former-kingfisher-boss-gerry-murphy-as-chairman","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T16:05:59Z","webTitle":"Burberry hires former Kingfisher boss Gerry Murphy as chairman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/13/burberry-hires-former-kingfisher-boss-gerry-murphy-as-chairman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/13/burberry-hires-former-kingfisher-boss-gerry-murphy-as-chairman","fields":{"headline":"Burberry hires former Kingfisher boss Gerry Murphy as chairman","bodyText":"The luxury brand Burberry has appointed the former boss of B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher as its new chairman. Gerry Murphy, who currently chairs the food group Tate &amp; Lyle and the European arm of the private equity firm Blackstone, will succeed Sir John Peace, who has been in the role since Burberry was spun out of the catalogue company GUS in 2002. Peace said Burberry had found a “superb” candidate with extensive knowledge of the consumer sector. Murphy has had stints at the food group Greencore and the media group Carlton, and filled non-executive director roles at Alton Towers owner Merlin Entertainments and Reckitt Benckiser. “I am confident he is the right choice to lead the board as Burberry embarks on a new chapter,” Peace said. Murphy will take over at Burberry on 17 May, the day before the company is due to announce its full-year financial results. His appointment completes the overhaul of Burberry’s leadership team triggered by the exit of the former chief executive Angela Ahrendts five years ago. Christopher Bailey, the group’s long-term design director, initially took over her role alongside his creative duties. But after shareholder concern about flagging sales, the former Céline boss Marco Gobbetti became chief executive last year. A new finance director, Julie Brown, came to Burberry from the medical supplies firm Smith &amp; Nephew in early 2017. Bailey initially stayed on as chief creative officer and president, but announced plans to leave the company in October. In a surprise move, the former Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci, known for his sexy, urban styles, took over creative duties last month. Burberry said his “skill in blending streetwear with high fashion is highly relevant to today’s luxury consumer”. Gobbetti, who previously worked with Tisci and Givenchy, has also raised eyebrows with a pledge to put Burberry more firmly at the luxury end of the retail market, pulling out of some department stores. Murphy said: “Burberry is a unique British brand that I have admired for a long time, and I am looking forward to working with Marco Gobbetti and the board to guide the company through its next phase of growth.” Steve Clayton, manager of a Hargreaves Lansdown fund that holds a stake in Burberry, welcomed Murphy’s appointment. “I’m not expecting the introduction of Burberry-check power drills,” Clayton said. “Murphy has had a varied management career over the years, including his current day job at Blackstone. Given that everyone is currently linking Burberry to one deal or another, it doesn’t seem a bad idea to have a chairman that can spot a good deal from a bad one.” It not clear whether the departure of 69-year-old Peace from Burberry will mark the end of his long career in the boardrooms of some of the UK’s biggest companies. At one point, Peace chaired three FTSE 100 businesses: Burberry, the credit-checking company Experian and the Standard Chartered bank. At Burberry, he was forced to defend the decision to give Bailey the roles of chief creative designer and chief executive after Ahrendts quit to run Apple’s retail operations. He also came under fire over pay arrangements, with 52.7% of investors rebelling against Bailey’s pay deal at Burberry’s 2014 annual shareholder meeting."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/13/syria-mediators-take-centre-stage-as-moment-for-rapid-strike-passes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T15:56:58Z","webTitle":"Syria mediators take centre stage as moment for rapid strike passes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/syria-mediators-take-centre-stage-as-moment-for-rapid-strike-passes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/13/syria-mediators-take-centre-stage-as-moment-for-rapid-strike-passes","fields":{"headline":"Syria mediators take centre stage as moment for rapid strike passes","bodyText":"The delay in the mooted US-led strikes on Syria, caused in part by divisions between the White House and the Pentagon over the potential targets, has allowed a range of mediators to intervene in an attempt to avoid military conflict. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in particular have been on the phone to Vladimir Putin trying to find a solution. On the basis of his conversations with Moscow and Washington, Erdoğan claimed on Friday that the situation was calming down, but he has given little indication of a scenario that may dissuade Donald Trump from sending cruise missiles into Syria. At the UN, Sweden’s Olof Skoog is testing support for a draft resolution designed to require Syria to get rid of chemical weapons “once and for all”. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons declared in January 2016 that Syria had acted on a 2013 deal between Russia and the Obama administration. The OPCW verified that the Syrian government had destroyed all of its declared weapons stockpile. Subsequent attacks have clearly shown that Syria retained a secret stock or the capacity to replenish some that it lost. Sweden now proposes a high-level UN mission go to Syria to ensure its disarmament. It is not clear, however, how a new UN mission would be any more effective in persuading an emboldened Syrian government to tell the truth or abide by the conventions of war. A new disarmament mission would also mean the west would have twice threatened to punish Syria for its use its repeated use of chemical weapons before backing down each. In the eyes of the Trump White House it would marka repeat of the mistake made by Barack Obama in 2013. It would also mark a reverse of the more punitive stance Trump adopted in 2017 when he launched 59 cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase after a chemical attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun in the north-west of the country. Nor would it satisfy the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has spoken of France’s capacity to act autonomously in Syria. Macron is to travel to Washington later this month. The White House is likely to be listening more closely to the mediatory efforts of Turkey and Israel, the two regional players to Syria’s north and south. Both countries will be pressing something more broad-ranging than a simple disarmament commission. Israel wants to use Bashar al-Assad’s alleged overreach as a lever to change the strategic balance in Syria, mainly by prising Russia away from Iran, its key partner in the country. In his calls to Putin, Netanyahu has pressed his belief that the true source of instability in Syria is Iranian aggression and Tehran’s determination to establish a military presence in Syria that Israel believes would threaten its existence. A Russian pledge to the US to contain the Iranian-backed Hezbollah inside Syria is high on the list of demands of Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton. The US, Israel and Turkey are united in their concern that Iranian-backed forces are intent on expanding in eastern Syria. Ali Alkbar Velayati, the foreign policy adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in Damascus on Thursday: “East of Euphrates is also a very important and valuable area, we hope the next steps will be taken in order to liberate east of Euphrates and expel the occupying Americans from that area.” Russian assurances about Iran’s future role may be unobtainable, but they may have greater strategic value than a simple punitive strike. Influential British MPs, including those with pro-interventionist leanings, also sense the moment for an immediate strike may be passing, and that a better option would be to station assets off Syria with one last warning to Assad about the attacks that will be swiftly mounted if he uses chemical weapons again. Either way, those that want to step back and think about what this episode reveals about the gaping absence of strategic thinking on Syria have perhaps for a short time a stage they previously lacked."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/13/premier-league-video-assistant-referees-var-vote-against","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T13:01:07Z","webTitle":"Premier League clubs vote against introducing VAR next season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/13/premier-league-video-assistant-referees-var-vote-against","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/13/premier-league-video-assistant-referees-var-vote-against","fields":{"headline":"Premier League clubs vote against introducing VAR next season","bodyText":"VAR will not be used in the Premier League next season after clubs voted to extend trials for another year. A decision to defer implementation of the controversial video assistant referee technology was passed by a two-thirds majority at a meeting of the 20 Premier League clubs on Friday. Such an outcome had been expected after widespread criticism. The Premier League said in a statement: “The decision came after comprehensive discussions regarding the progress made in VAR trials in English football and key learnings from the many competitions elsewhere using it.” Testing of VAR technology will continue in the background next season, while Premier League clubs have asked for the technology to be used in more FA Cup and Carabao Cup ties too. They also asked for a greater emphasis on communicating VAR decisions to spectators, one of the most strident complaints against the technology to this point. The major teething problem in VAR’s use during this season’s FA Cup, as well as in other competitions around Europe, has been a lack of communication in the decision-making process. Supporters have been left bewildered while games have been stopped for long periods of time while decisions were being made. “The clubs agreed advanced testing will continue to the end of season 2018-19 to make further improvements to the system,” the statement read, “especially around communication inside the stadium and for those following at home and around the world.” Other problems exposed during the trials were less to do with technology and more about its human application. VAR was supposed to be applied only in the event of a “clear error” by the referee. But decisions, such as Italy’s late penalty against England during their recent friendly, split opinion even after footage had been reviewed from several angles. This was not the only complication, with video assistants also having to interpret where their brief began in, for example, moves that led to controversial goals. These factors led to decisions being delayed during trial matches and, when combined with the lack of communication, they convinced several clubs to refrain from putting their support behind the technology. It is understood this decision could be revisited before the end of next season, enabling implementation in 2019-20. The Premier League is the exception in choosing to refrain from embracing the technology. VAR will be used at the World Cup in Russia and has also been approved for use next season by most of Europe’s major leagues, including La Liga, the Bundesliga and Serie A."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/14/how-i-eat-sam-twiston-davies-grand-national-jockey","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T16:40:00Z","webTitle":"Grand National jockey Sam Twiston-Davies: how I eat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/14/how-i-eat-sam-twiston-davies-grand-national-jockey","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/14/how-i-eat-sam-twiston-davies-grand-national-jockey","fields":{"headline":"Grand National jockey Sam Twiston-Davies: how I eat","bodyText":"Breakfast I can start as early as 5.30am if I’m riding, but on a normal day it’s 7am, and it’s always light: a coffee with a piece of fruit – apple, orange, banana … And maybe a couple of biscuits.

If you wake up five to six pounds heavier you know that somewhere down the line you’re just going to have to lose it again, so even if you try eat a bit more normally while you’re on holiday, you tend to get back on to your working diet very quickly.

Until the international community, including Israel and Palestine, has agreed where Israel is on the map, it will be criticised. Its place became a matter of doubt in the 1960s, when Israel no longer confined itself to its internationally agreed borders. Israel might be perceived as a refuge by Jews worldwide, but refuges do not expand to take over neighbouring territory. This expansion has been justified in some popular discourse by a crude interpretation of Zionism that takes the Bible as divinely ordained property deeds for existing and potential Israeli territory. That non-religious rationalists and people with different views of religion demur is hardly surprising. I appreciate why, in the light of mid-20th century history, the Israeli state might be unreservedly supported, and why, in the light of its disproportionate action against civilians, its wars and its walls, it is also opposed. I am aware that antisemitism is used in anti-Israeli propaganda, but I reject any conflation of rational criticism of Israel’s foreign policy with antisemitism. I too am angered by and fear the stereotyping, scapegoating, hysteria and aggression that indicate antisemitism. I urge Jacobson and all who think like him not to isolate themselves from the wider community which, like them, works to resist and enlighten the prejudiced. Elspeth Knights St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex • Most Jews know what antisemitism is and what isn’t – and it’s complicated. I sent my mum Howard Jacobson’s article and her reply sums it up: “It was hard to read, not for lack of clarity on HJ’s part, far from it, but because of the horrible squirmy feelings it evoked in me. In you too, I would think: it reawoke the shameful feeling, which he refers to, that an act of antisemitism engenders in the victim. “His generation is mine, and all that he says about the attitudes of Jews from eastern Europe were familiar to me. He writes directly of our experience. Everything he says reflects the variety of thoughts and feelings that were common to members of our family. “I hope that non-Jews and younger Jews will read and understand the issues he discusses: the historical background, the comfort of knowing the state of Israel had come into existence, the awkwardness of contemplating later decisions and actions of the state of Israel, the tentative attitude many Jews in the UK have today about how the people of our country truly view us.” Clare Morley London • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/17/stephen-lawrence-police-officer-allegedly-spied-family-identified-david-hagan","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T11:00:12Z","webTitle":"Stephen Lawrence: officer who allegedly spied on family named","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/stephen-lawrence-police-officer-allegedly-spied-family-identified-david-hagan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/17/stephen-lawrence-police-officer-allegedly-spied-family-identified-david-hagan","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Lawrence: officer who allegedly spied on family named","bodyText":"An undercover police officer accused of spying on the family of the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence has been officially identified as David Hagan. He is a key figure in the controversy over the use of police spies to gather information about the Lawrence family while they were trying to persuade the police to properly investigate their son’s racist murder. His fake identity was published on Tuesday by the judge-led public inquiry examining the conduct of undercover officers who were sent to infiltrate political groups. He lost a legal argument to keep his identity concealed. Hagan has previously been labelled “a spy in the Lawrence family camp” by an official report, which said he had gathered personal details about Doreen and Neville Lawrence, the parents of the murdered teenager, including about the breakdown of their marriage. He passed “fascinating and valuable” information about them to his Scotland Yard superiors, according to the report, which did not name him and referred to him by the cipher N81. His superiors allegedly exploited the information to help defend themselves against accusations that the police had bungled the investigation into Stephen’s murder, 25 years ago this month. Theresa May, when she was home secretary, called revelations about his deployment “profoundly shocking and disturbing”, and said they had damaged the reputation of the police. May set up the public inquiry into the undercover infiltration of political groups after the revelations in 2014. It also followed a series of disclosures about the conduct of undercover officers, including how some had deceived women into long-term relationships. Sir John Mitting, the judge leading the inquiry, has said one of the crucial issues will be to determine the involvement of Hagan and his colleagues in the monitoring of the Lawrences during the family’s quest to establish who killed their son. At least three undercover officers collected information about the Lawrences’ campaign and Duwayne Brooks, Stephen’s friend, who witnessed him being murdered by a racist gang. The spying operation was disclosed by Peter Francis, one of the undercover officers, who became a whistleblower. Brooks said on Tuesday: “At last the speculation is over and I can try and piece together what parts of my life Hagan intruded on. Which bits of my private life did he snoop on?” The Lawrences have repeatedly called for the inquiry to uncover the full truth of how they were spied on. They complain, however, along with many others subjected to surveillance, that Mitting has unfairly allowed the police to cover up their misconduct. Hagan was a member of a covert unit, the Special Demonstration Squad, which infiltrated political groups, going undercover between 1996 and 2001 when he pretended to be a leftwing activist. The inquiry confirmed that he had infiltrated an anti-racist group known as the Movement for Justice, which supported the Lawrences’ campaign. He infiltrated other groups including the Socialist Workers party and the anarchist organisation Class War. Some details of Hagan’s deployment were made public in 2014 after May had asked a QC, Mark Ellison, to investigate. In his report, Ellison described how Hagan had a meeting in 1998 with a senior Metropolitan police officer who was then involved in drawing up the defence of its conduct during the murder investigation. According to Ellison, opening up this channel of communication was “wrongheaded and inappropriate” and could be seen as giving the Met a “secret advantage” over the family. Hagan has said he has mental health problems as a result of his deployment and fears his real identity could be exposed. He had argued that his real name and the fake identity he used while undercover should be kept secret. Mitting, however, ruled that his fake identity should be published to enable the Lawrence family and other campaigners to give evidence about him on a critical issue. The inquiry has been delayed because many of the undercover officers have submitted legal applications to keep their identities secret."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/13/indigenous-environmental-campaigner-saw-o-moo-killed-by-myanmar-government-karen-state","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T15:26:31Z","webTitle":"Indigenous environmental campaigner killed by Myanmar government","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/13/indigenous-environmental-campaigner-saw-o-moo-killed-by-myanmar-government-karen-state","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/13/indigenous-environmental-campaigner-saw-o-moo-killed-by-myanmar-government-karen-state","fields":{"headline":"Indigenous environmental campaigner killed by Myanmar government","bodyText":"Indigenous activists in Myanmar’s Karen state are mourning the killing of a community leader who campaigned for a peace park to protect a local forest and its residents’ land rights. Saw O Moo was ambushed by government troops on 5 April as he was riding a motorbike with a soldier from the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), a rebel group that is fighting for autonomy. The military has claimed both men were plain-clothes rebels “suspected of sabotage” who were armed with grenades at the time of the shooting, according to the Irrawaddy newspaper. But colleagues who worked with Saw O Moo say he was a peaceful campaigner who had simply given a ride to the KNLA soldier. “He was a civilian, and the allegations by the Tatmadaw (Myanmar military) that he was a plain clothes soldier are blatant lies,” said Hsa Moo, media coordinator for the Karen Environmental and Social Action Network, which works for indigenous rights in the region. Saw O Moo worked for the network for 12 years and was involved in the campaign to create a “Salween Peace Park”. This is a bottom-up initiative by the Karen people to protect their culture, land and wildlife. Spanning 5,400 sq km in the Salween river basin, it covers the habitats of Asiatic black bear and Sunda pangolin, which are threatened by mercury pollution from goldmines and the Hat Gyi hydroelectric project. The government has never recognised the peace park, which is near an area of skirmishes between the state military and the KLNA. More than 2,000 people have recently been forced from their homes by the upsurge in conflict, which locals say has been driven by government offensives. On the day of his death, Saw O Moo had reportedly been organising humanitarian aid for the displaced people. Fellow activists say the KLNA soldier he took for a ride – Hser Blut Doh – had been on guard duty at the village. He escaped unharmed during the shooting, but the area remains so tense that the dead man’s family have reportedly been unable to reclaim his body.

The high court in Allahabad city on Friday ordered the arrest of Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a member of the Uttar Pradesh state parliament with the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), after days of public outrage over the alleged crime, his defiant response and the apparent apathy of police. Singh Sengar and his brother Atul Singh Sengar have been accused of raping a 15-year-old girl last June in a town in his constituency near the state capital, Lucknow. The family tried unsuccessfully for months to persuade police to register a case against the powerful local official until last Tuesday, when the family alleges he and a group barged into their home, molested the girl again, tied her father to a tree and beat him. The case came to national prominence this week when the teenager tried to burn herself alive outside the residence of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. The next day, her father, who had been detained by local police after he was alleged assaulted, died in custody. At the same time, details of the alleged rape and murder of Asifa Bano, eight, in Kathua, in Jammu and Kashmir state, became national news after a group of Hindu lawyers tried to barricade a courtroom in the district to stop police from lodging charges. The protesters, who were backed by state BJP ministers, allege the investigation into the alleged attack on the girl, who is a member of a nomadic Muslim tribe, was biased because some of the officers involved were also Muslim. Details of the crime – the child was allegedly confined in a Hindu temple in January, repeatedly raped for three days and then killed with a rock – as well as the sight of Hindu protesters advocating the release of the accused men sparked revulsion and protests across India on Friday. The refusal of the Narendra Modi, a staunch Hindu nationalist, to comment has fuelled the anger. The prime minister finally addressed the alleged crimes on Friday evening, telling an event in Delhi they “cannot be part of a civilised society”. “As a country, as a society we all are ashamed of it,” he said. “I want to assure the country that no culprit will be spared, complete justice will be done. Our daughters will definitely get justice.” The previous evening, hundreds of people attended a candlelit vigil for both victims at Delhi’s India Gate monument. The monument was the scene of protests more than five years ago over the gang-rape and murder of Jyoti Singh, a student who came to be known as Nirbhaya – Hindi for fearless. “We are totally questioning what progress we’ve made,” said Poonam Muttreja, an activist who has founded several organisations for women’s rights and health. “After Nirbhaya we got strong new laws, but they don’t seem to be working for the weak, only the powerful.” Protests have been held across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and West Bengal states, and another large demonstration is planned for the capital on Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/23/willy-vlautin-lean-on-pete-richmond-fontaine","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-23T09:00:08Z","webTitle":"Willy Vlautin: 'I think my mother was ashamed that I was a novelist'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/23/willy-vlautin-lean-on-pete-richmond-fontaine","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/23/willy-vlautin-lean-on-pete-richmond-fontaine","fields":{"headline":"Willy Vlautin: 'I think my mother was ashamed that I was a novelist'","bodyText":"For Willy Vlautin, a book tour is not just about books. Yes, his fifth novel, Don’t Skip Out on Me, the melancholy tale of a young, half-Paiute wannabe prizefighter, was published recently. It’s written in the sort of scorched, bare-bones prose, stripped of metaphors and similes, that has won him fans such as Roddy Doyle, Donna Tartt and Colm Tóibín. But there are also gigs to play – Vlautin, who is 51, was the frontman of the twangy alt-country outfit Richmond Fontaine, which he founded in his mid-20s shortly after moving from Reno, Nevada, where he grew up, to Portland, Oregon. He disbanded the group in 2014 after 20 years, keen to part on good terms rather than, as he puts it, waiting until the wheels came off. These days he plays with the Delines, who have a mellower feel, as well as a female singer, Amy Boone. He is happier listening to his own records now his voice isn’t on them. “I never had any confidence,” he admits. “I was always a meek dude. And I’ve never figured out how to make that go away.” He gives an apologetic smile. A week earlier, the sellout crowd at the north London folk venue Cecil Sharp House gathered to hear him pick his way through Delines numbers and Richmond Fontaine favourites. The songs arrived in batches of threes and fours, with Vlautin putting his guitar down every so often to read from Don’t Skip Out on Me or to provide good-natured answers to unusual questions. Challenged to play Kiss, Marry, Kill with Cormac McCarthy, John Steinbeck and Raymond Carver, his nearest spiritual antecedents, Vlautin’s answer was typically self-deprecating: “Kiss McCarthy. Marry Steinbeck. Kill myself.” Several days after the gig, Vlautin had a film premiere to attend. His movingly matter of fact third novel, Lean on Pete, has been adapted by Andrew Haigh, the British director of Weekend and 45 Years. It’s the story of Charley Thompson (Charlie Plummer), a 16-year-old loner who takes a shine to a knackered old racehorse destined for the slaughterhouse. The boy rescues the horse, the horse gives him hope: it’s Kes with hooves. Vlautin, whose 2007 debut novel The Motel Life has also been filmed, is relaxed about adaptations. “I wouldn’t have cared if they’d made the horse talk,” he told the audience at a screening, “so long as Charley wore the right shoes and ate the right way.” The Willy Vlautin Cookbook can’t be far off – food is meticulously catalogued in his novels, from stolen supermarket beans eaten cold from the can to leftovers snatched from a picnic table – but for now any tie-in merchandise is limited to the CDs he has recorded to accompany some of his novels. There was one for his second book, Northline, while the initial print run of Don’t Skip Out on Me comes with a collection of plangent instrumentals, each corresponding to a different incident in the novel (“Living Where You’re Not Wanted”, “Rescue and Defeat in Salt Lake City”, and so on). It’s intended to be an aide memoire not a soundtrack. “Generally people only read a book once,” he says, “but I was hoping if you put on the CD a month later, you might remember it. ‘What was that about? Oh yeah, the old man, the kid…’ It’d take you back without having to reread the book. You’d still have Horace with you.” That’s Horace Hopper, raised by his racist, Paiute-hating grandmother, and taken in as a teenage ranch hand by a doting old Nevada couple, Mr and Mrs Reese, who give him his first experience of a loving family. At 21, he leaves them to reinvent himself as a Mexican slugger named Hector Hidalgo, and goes looking for love and approval in the one place he will never find it: the ring. “I grew up watching fights and always loved the tragedy of it,” Vlautin says. “I like how when you lose it’s such a blemish. If you’re not a well-known fighter and you lose a couple times, you gotta fight your way back up to where there’s money.” The punishments that Horace takes are almost as severe as the psychological beatings he dishes out to himself. In a short but stinging scene, he fails to stand up for a young pregnant mother abandoned at a rest stop in the middle of the night by an impatient bus driver, and scolds himself: “He was nothing. A nobody. An Indian who wasn’t an Indian and a white kid who looked like an Indian … And he wouldn’t even help a broke pregnant woman and her baby. No champion would be like that. No champion at all.” “If you’re not sure at an early age that you’re loved, I think it skews you a little bit,” Vlautin says. “It breaks you. Horace didn’t know love until he was 14 and then it probably took him three or four years to figure out if this couple were for real. In a weird way, he probably wouldn’t leave the Reeses to become a boxer if they didn’t love him so much. He feels he’s not worthy of that love, he’s not enough on his own. He thinks he has to do something to deserve it. I’ve been that person. You always feel like you have to bring a Cadillac to get love. You wanna be something great so that people – your parents, whoever – will like you.” Do the novels assuage his insecurity? “No. A little …” He thinks again. “Not that much.” They certainly didn’t impress his mother. “She was not a fan. She was alive for The Motel Life and the galley of Northline but she wouldn’t read them. I don’t know why. I think she was scared I would say something about her. She was ashamed that I was a musician and that I wrote novels. I think she was embarrassed that I wrote sad stuff. She was a cool lady, though. She taught me a lot about working hard. She just didn’t like the way I was as a person.” He stops and corrects himself. “She liked me. I mean, she loved me. We just didn’t really hit it off.” Vlautin lived in Reno with his mother and his brother, and started writing songs when he was 12. “I always loved rock’n’roll and soundtrack albums. It was like being so in love you didn’t know what to do. I knew I couldn’t actually eat the records so how was I gonna get any closer? You gotta write your own.” Books came next. Steinbeck, a curriculum mainstay, was already a god to him but it was reading Carver at 19 that made Vlautin realise this might be something he could do. “I understood it. It didn’t intimidate me. The sentences were so spare. The men were all failed in an undramatic way. I knew those guys my whole life but I didn’t know you were allowed to write about them. It changed something in me. I was, like: ‘Well if you can write about that, I’ve got a lot of those stories.’” At first he wrote for escapism or to express his fantasies. “I’d wish something would happen so I’d write about it. Trouble is, then my soul would get involved and the stories would get all ugly and tangled up.” His first attempt at a novel was about living on a car lot with an idealised uncle, selling jalopies and having barbecues together. “It was my dream. But then all of a sudden, around page 40, the uncle asked the nephew to steal a car for him. And then it became about the uncle using this kid. It killed me. I was, like: ‘Why’d that happen? Where’d that come from?’ I didn’t understand why it had got so dark.” It wasn’t exactly that the story was writing itself, he says. “It was more like who I was had started to wake up. It felt like the devil was following me and then once in a while in these stories he’d pop up and say, ‘I’m here, motherfucker.’” The wish-fulfilment aspect of writing persisted for him even once he was published. Regretful about not getting along better with his brother (“We got in a couple of fist fights”), he created in The Motel Life two mutually supportive siblings who never argued, no matter what. Writing Lean on Pete got him through a period of hopelessness. “Friends die. There’s so much madness in the world. But I’ve always got to have my saints to pull me out of bed, and Charley Thompson was one of them: the saint of perseverance. I needed to be around someone who didn’t quit, and that’s Charley.” Books have helped save him more than once. Does he have a fantasy about the effect that Don’t Skip Out on Me will have on others? “Sometimes reading about loneliness can make you feel less lonely. And perhaps you could try to be good like Horace and learn to do the right thing. I take inspiration from him and his patience. Maybe after you read the book, you’ll feel a little bit less alone” • Lean on Pete is in cinemas from 4 May."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/13/manchester-city-tottenham-pep-guardiola-sergio-aguero","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T21:38:00Z","webTitle":"Pep Guardiola claims Manchester City could fail to win Premier League","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/13/manchester-city-tottenham-pep-guardiola-sergio-aguero","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/13/manchester-city-tottenham-pep-guardiola-sergio-aguero","fields":{"headline":"Pep Guardiola claims Manchester City could fail to win Premier League","bodyText":"Pep Guardiola has said Manchester City could blow their 13-point lead over Manchester United and fail to be crowned champions. Guardiola’s team are clear favourites to win a third Premier League title, with City and United each having only six matches left. Yet having seen his team lose their previous three games – away and home to Liverpool in the Champions League, and in the league to United – the manager cited the example of Real Madrid in 2003‑04, when they led Valencia by a point but suffered six defeats in the final seven matches to finish fourth in La Liga, behind Rafael Benítez’s then side. City are at Tottenham Hotspur for Saturday’s late fixture. A victory, combined with a United defeat against West Brom on Sunday would secure the title but it was put to Guardiola that if City lose and United beat West Bromwich Albion and Bournemouth before his side play again they may start to feel the pressure. In this scenario United would have cut the deficit to seven points having played a match more. Guardiola said: “It can happen. Football is full of emotions but what we have to try to do is focus and win our games against Tottenham, Swansea and after that the other ones. So we know that. “I am not the most calm, because that is not the right word, but it’s the fact that since November or December [people say] we are already champions – when I saw the pundits and the people in November, they say it’s already done. The players have shown every day, in every game [since then] that it’s not done, because if it was they wouldn’t play the way they play. “But in one week we lost three games. That happened. So we have to play tomorrow and after that we see the result from United. But it doesn’t depend on the United result, it’s in our hands, it’s up to us to win our games, and we are able to win [the] two games [needed]. We handled the pressure – the good, the bad situations – the whole season.” Regarding how pressure is more intense when trying to seal the title, Guardiola said: “That will be good for our future, you have to handle that. You have to learn that because, at the end, if we were not able to do it and United win the league, all we can say is ‘congratulations’ to United, reflect on what we have done badly in the last month and move forward. But in football it can happen.” Guardiola countered any notion that such a scenario is unlikely. “Of course it can happen, I assure you. Real Madrid, years ago, lost six games and didn’t win the league. So of course it can happen, no doubts about that.” He also cited how the Cleveland Cavaliers overturned a 3-1 deficit in the 2016 NBA finals to record a 4-3 victory, the first time that had happened in basketball’s pre-eminent club competition. “They know that [the players]. It’s not necessary to say it to them. Of course it can happen. In football, in sports. In the NBA finals one team recovered from 3-1 down. Cavaliers won against Golden State Warriors 4-3. They won three games in a row, so in sports, it can always happen. But it’s in our hands, we don’t depend on anyone else, and that’s a good advantage. We have six games. We have to win two, or one and draw two games. If we lose, we’re going to do it in a similar way to the way we played against United and Liverpool. I’m sorry, but we’re going to do it in that way, and after that we’ll see. “When the opponent is good, we will congratulate our opponents on beating us, and after learn from that for the next game.” While Guardiola admitted Sergio Agüero’s ability to play again this season is in the balance because of a knee problem, the Spaniard said the 32-year-old David Silva may appear less next year. “Next season, David maybe he will not play every game, that’s why the squad has to be big. David played more because he was absent for a while, due his [ill] son’s situation, that’s why he had maybe more energy in the legs [recently].”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/13/jessops-clicks-with-selfie-market-through-instant-display-gifts","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T16:15:36Z","webTitle":"Jessops clicks with selfie market through instant display gifts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/13/jessops-clicks-with-selfie-market-through-instant-display-gifts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/13/jessops-clicks-with-selfie-market-through-instant-display-gifts","fields":{"headline":"Jessops clicks with selfie market through instant display gifts","bodyText":"Camera specialist retailer Jessops is targeting the selfie-generation with new-style stores that promote instant photo gifts. Five years after being rescued from administration by Dragon’s Den panellist Peter Jones, Jessops now has 58 outlets including 11 in Sainsbury’s stores. Sales rose 24% to nearly £100m in the year to April 2017. While the company slipped to a pretax loss of £764,875, this was largely because of the setup of a new venture to run a chain of stores for Samsung. Jessops expect to return to profit this year. Sales of more expensive high-spec cameras are rising by a few percent a year, but the market for photo-print gifts, such as posters, printed canvases or coasters, is growing much faster – forecast to be nearly 40% between now and 2020. In a bid to grab a greater share of that market, a handful of Jessops stores have introduced specialist printing machines and trained staff who can produce in less than an hour canvas prints, posters and “shuffle” photos which combine multiple pictures on one print so that they can be slipped straight into a montage frame. Speaking at a new-style store in Bromley, Neil Old, chief executive of Jessops, said he expected to have converted 12 shops by mid-summer and potentially half the chain in the next 12 months. He still wants to serve keen hobbyists who are looking for zoom lenses and other kit, but is broadening Jessops’s appeal to enable more casual photographers to put their work on display. “Over the last 10 years everyone has been taking pictures on their smartphones and it’s becoming increasingly clear customers want to do something with those photos.” The trend echoes the renaissance of other traditional media, such as vinyl records and physical books, in recent years. “People do want physical evidence of what they have bought or done,” said Old. While the likes of Photobox, Notonthehighstreet and Snappy Snaps all offer personalised photo gifts, none of them do so in such a short timeframe. Only the latter has a widespread high-street presence while Boots shut 220 of its 320 photo processing labs last year, creating more space in the market. Old said: “For any retailer to succeed on the high street you need to have an experience, good staff and something you are never going to get on the internet.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/13/met-chief-cressida-dick-stop-and-search-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T15:18:12Z","webTitle":"Met chief defends fourfold rise in use of stop-and-search","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/met-chief-cressida-dick-stop-and-search-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/met-chief-cressida-dick-stop-and-search-london","fields":{"headline":"Met chief defends fourfold rise in use of stop-and-search","bodyText":"The Metropolitan police commissioner has defended the use of controversial stop-and-search powers after she reported a more than fourfold increase in their use in London over the last year. Cressida Dick said there had been 106 uses of section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act in the year to March 2018, compared with 23 in the same period a year earlier. Section 60 allows officers to stop and search any person without suspicion within an area designated by a senior police officer if they believe violence has occurred, or is about to occur. For every use of section 60 several people could be searched. The legislation was criticised by Theresa May in 2014, when she was home secretary, for damaging community relations. Statistics have repeatedly shown stop-and-search powers are disproportionately used against black and minority ethnic people. Dick said police would use the power sparingly, but rising arrest rates supported its use. Her comments come against a backdrop of more than 50 murders in London so far this year. “We’re absolutely determined that our stop-and-searches will be professional, captured on body-worn video [cameras] by well-trained officers who are using intelligence, and that it is of course lawful to do it,” she said. Leaflets and social media, such as Twitter, are used to advise the public of section 60 authority areas when the power is implemented. Dick said: “We also make sure local people are aware of what we’re doing, particularly when section 60 is in place. We put messages out across the community about what we either fear is about to happen or what has just happened which is putting fear into the community.” Her comments in support of the powers contradict findings in the government’s serious violence strategy. Documents detailing the measures, unveiled on Monday to great fanfare amid a rise in knife and gun crime, said changes in the level of stop-and-search use had had a “minimal effect”. “Personally I’ve looked at a lot of the research over the years and I think that it is conflicting, that’s for sure,” Dick said. “I don’t think anybody has done the definitive piece of work.” She said, however, that officers knew “absolutely” that for certain types of crime in certain areas the tactic was effective. “We scrutinise the levels of stop-and-searches all the time and involve local people in looking at what we’re doing, why we’re doing it and I can tell you the public are overwhelmingly supportive of it.” The serious violence strategy unveiled by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, said data did not support claims that a reduction in the overall use of stop-and-search was behind an increase in violent crime. “Research by the College of Policing and the Home Office has also shown that changes in the level of stop and search have only minimal effects – at best – on trends in violent crime, even when measured at the local level,” the document read."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/14/imf-senses-not-all-well-economic-upswing-christine-lagarde","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T15:00:24Z","webTitle":"The IMF senses that not all is well with this global economic upswing","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/14/imf-senses-not-all-well-economic-upswing-christine-lagarde","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/14/imf-senses-not-all-well-economic-upswing-christine-lagarde","fields":{"headline":"The IMF senses that not all is well with this global economic upswing","bodyText":"Christine Lagarde ought to be a happy woman. As she noted in a speech in Hong Kong last week, there is good economic news around the world. The US is operating at full employment, the upswing in Europe has spread across the continent, Japan is growing strongly and the outlook for Asia is bright. All the same, Lagarde has plenty to worry about as she prepares for this week’s half-yearly meeting of the International Monetary Fund, the organisation run by the former French finance minister. Her concerns can be summed up in five words: protectionism, unilateralism, war, debt and inequality. The IMF has been issuing increasingly firm warnings about the risk of a trade war in the 16 months since Donald Trump won the US presidency. But it has only been in the past three months that Trump has started to make good on the pledges made during his campaign. Tariffs on imported steel and aluminium imports were followed by US action specifically targeted at China. Lagarde’s concern is not just that Washington and Beijing will become embroiled in a trade war, but that protectionism will spread in a fashion not seen since the 1930s. That anxiety has been heightened by Trump’s go-it-alone approach. The US was instrumental in creating the world’s four key multilateral organisations – the United Nations, the World Bank, the IMF and the World Trade Organisation – but the current president appears to have scant regard for any of them. Lagarde would like to see the US settle its trade differences with China at the WTO but there is little immediate prospect of that. The risk of war between Russia and America over Syria is the most pressing example of the “uncertain geopolitics” mentioned by Lagarde in her Hong Kong speech. Here, Trump has been seeking to secure the support of the US’s traditional allies – such as Britain and France – for military action, but financial markets are already taking fright at the prospect of oil supplies from the Middle East being disrupted. Oil prices rose to their highest since late 2014 when last week’s tension was at its height. Deep down, the IMF thinks the recovery from the 2008 financial crash is fragile and incomplete. It is fragile because a decade of cheap money has left the global economy wallowing in $164 trillion of private and public debt – an all-time high. It is incomplete because too many people have been left behind during the upswing that followed the deep recession of 2008-09. Back in 2006 and early 2007, the IMF was asleep at the wheel as the global economy careered towards a devastating crisis. Lagarde wants to ensure there is no repeat performance."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/13/liverpool-bournemouth-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T13:02:54Z","webTitle":"Liverpool v Bournemouth: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/13/liverpool-bournemouth-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/13/liverpool-bournemouth-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Liverpool v Bournemouth: match preview","bodyText":"The Champions League semi-final dominates Liverpool’s thoughts but Jürgen Klopp wants a top-four finish in the Premier League secured as quickly as possible.

This is, after all, a sport where the entire season tends to fold together into a microcosm of a single family day out at the English seaside, a five-month blur of travel, wet shoes, existential gloom, the consolations of ritual food and familiar faces, and buried somewhere along the way those brief, chancy moments of sun-drenched beauty that end up defining the entire experience in a snapshot. There is an extra layer of uncertainty this time around, something nagging away just out of sight at the start of the seven-Test summer. Sporting anxieties come in various shades. This one is highly specific and also something of a tell when it comes to wider currents of change. Yes, it’s the top six! It’s Cook-Stoneman-Vince-Root-Malan-Stokes, incumbent members of England’s Test match top six, which was once a matter of vital shared urgency but has become an oddly troubling thing, a little strange, a little distant and blurred. England’s No 3. England’s No 5. These are important people. Knowing exactly who they are at any given moment is a bit like knowing who the current James Bond is or the latest Doctor Who. The first really epic‑feeling top six I can remember was England’s 1985 Ashes powerhouse: Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson at the top, followed by the miracle of David Gower at No 3, swaying and bobbing in his wide-brimmed hat, like the most divinely talented scarecrow ever to raise a bat; and below him the reassuringly paunchy, sweating rump of Gatting-Lamb-Botham. Fast forward to the present day and it seems the same batsmen from England’s disastrous Test winter will keep their spots against Pakistan next month. This despite the fact there is a fair statistical argument they add up to England’s weakest top six of the modern age. Trevor Bayliss has already announced the cupboard is bare when it comes to alternatives, a masterstroke of demotivation for every single current county cricketer and a statement that confirms the impression of Bayliss as a lavishly rewarded head coach who is not only unmoved by Test cricket but also inconvenienced by its basic existence, wincing and prevaricating beneath his floppy hat like a crisis-ridden minor shadow cabinet minister ambushed by TV cameras on a fishing trip. Meanwhile the basic notion of the Test match top six, its primacy as a thing, continues to atrophy. There have been periods of fragility before but this top six feels different: miscast and a little vague, a product of carelessness and category mistake. Even the openers feel wrong. Alastair Cook has been a giant of English cricket, a patch of cold white light in the middle of all that gruelling heat. But he plays now with a constant flinch, most often seen wandering off with that air of wounded nobility, a minor central European monarch being marched through the palace colonnades en route to his own impeachment. Mark Stoneman has been a fun addition, an opener, finally, who strikes the ball aggressively. But when playing the short ball like a man swatting flies with a frying pan is no longer reason to be dropped as an England opener, then we might as well all give up. No 3 remains an odd kind of problem. The ideal Test No 3 has some base note of genuine aristocratic talent. Brian Lara came jogging out still casually putting on bits of kit, waggling at the buckles of his pads, as though he’d just tumbled out of bed and into the Rolls and down the pavilion steps. James Vince does have a real beauty in his batting, most obviously in that easy yawning drive through the covers. But it seems pretty obvious Joe Root at No 4 scoring fifties should be Joe Root at No 3 scoring hundreds, defining this team from the tipping point. Below him, Ben Stokes at six is pretty much the only real note of authenticity, a No 6 who comes out as all No 6s should, in a genuine fury, reeking of cigars and body odour, with a sense of bristling disdain for his opponents, for the five batsmen ahead of him and for the five still to come. So what now? As ever, this becomes a discussion about changing times, talent-drain, old forms being shunted to one side like an outdated combine harvester. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Test cricket is not dead. There is no reason to accept this. The product is still good. It just needs some care, to be nursed along as it always has been, not to be abandoned or left to wither while T20 defines itself on another stage. For now, England need to rip out the cobwebs, to take a chance on talent, to give the Test team the same invigorating approach afforded the white-ball line-up. Get Jonny Bairstow up the order. Haseeb Hameed needs to play, and keep playing. We can handle it. Just give us a team and a top six to believe in, while the memory that all this matters still remains."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/13/belfast-feminists-rally-ulster-rugby-match-rape-acquittal","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T11:32:02Z","webTitle":"Rugby unions revoke Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding's contracts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/belfast-feminists-rally-ulster-rugby-match-rape-acquittal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/belfast-feminists-rally-ulster-rugby-match-rape-acquittal","fields":{"headline":"Rugby unions revoke Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding's contracts","bodyText":"The Ulster and Irish rugby unions have revoked the contracts of rugby players Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding following their acquittal of rape, and have told the pair they will no longer play for Ulster or Ireland. The Irish Rugby Football Union and Ulster Rugby issued a joint statement on Saturday, saying their commitment to “respect, inclusivity and integrity” had led them to the decision, following a review conducted after Jackson and Olding’s high-profile rape trial in which they were cleared. The unions also announced an in-depth review of Irish rugby, which has been widely criticised by campaigners for what they call a prevailing culture of misogyny in the sport. Another player, Craig Gilroy, was also sanctioned by the unions over a text message he sent, and has been suspended until 26 April. Protests against the pair’s acquittal, led by the #IBelieveHer movement, have continued across Ireland after degrading and lewd WhatsApp messages came to the public’s attention during their trial. On Friday, more than 300 campaigners and women’s rights groups took part in a protest outside the headquarters of Ulster rugby ahead of Ulster’s clash with the Welsh team Ospreys. It is understood the players might seek to continue their rugby careers outside the UK or Ireland, possibly in France or Japan. The demonstration is part of a wider movement – appearing online under #IBelieveHer – that has sprung up across Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the acquittal of the Ireland rugby internationals Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding for rape last month. One of their friends, Blane McIlroy, was found not guilty of indecent exposure; another, Rory Harrison, was cleared of perverting the course of justice and withholding information. Although there was a large police presence on the avenue that runs parallel to the stadium, the atmosphere between Ulster supporters and the demonstrators was generally civil. One of the protest’s organisers from the Belfast Feminist Network, Kellie Turtle, said it was designed to put pressure on the Ulster and Irish rugby authorities to tackle what she called the “ongoing culture of sexism and misogyny” around the sport. Turtle said that before their protest the organisers had been contacted by a large number of female rugby players who said they were too afraid to speak out. “They said they feared being sidelined by their clubs if they speak publicly over their concerns regarding sexism and misogynistic attitudes in rugby. That has got to change. Ulster rugby has to start an education programme teaching players from their elite players downwards that the kind of attitudes to women we heard about during that trial are stamped out,” she said. The trial focused on the events in June 2016 at a party in Jackson’s south Belfast home in which a 21-year-old woman alleged she had been raped and sexually assaulted. A day after the men were all found not guilty last month, up to 1,000 people demonstrated outside Belfast’s Laganside courts criticising the trial but also demanding that Jackson and Olding no longer play for province or country. For the Belfast Feminist Network, the lifting this week of reporting restrictions from the nine-week long trial revealed the prevalence of sexist behaviour and attitudes in sports such as rugby. It can now be revealed that Harrison sent a pornographic video to Olding’s mobile phone the morning after the party at Jackson’s house showing three unknown people – two men and a woman – engaged in a sex act. The trial judge, Patricia Smyth, had ruled that this evidence could not be heard by the 11-member jury. The latest revelation has compounded the anger of many Irish women over the attitudes of the players and their friends. Arguments over whether Jackson and Olding can resume their top-level rugby careers have been played out in two full-page advertisements in the Belfast Telegraph. The newspaper is a sponsor for the Ulster team. Jackson and Olding’s supporters paid £2,000 this week for an ad in which they demanded that “these innocent men are reinstated and rightly allowed to resume their roles for both club and country”. The advertisement was in response to a previous ad last week organised by a rugby fan, Anna Nolan. In a direct appeal to Irish and Ulster rugby’s high command, her ad said the players’ behaviour “falls far beneath the standards that your organisations represent and as such we demand that neither of these men represents Ulster or Ireland now or at any point in the future”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/13/raf-base-in-cyprus-prepares-for-potential-strike-on-syria-akrotiri","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T13:24:09Z","webTitle":"RAF base in Cyprus prepares for potential strike on Syria","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/raf-base-in-cyprus-prepares-for-potential-strike-on-syria-akrotiri","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/13/raf-base-in-cyprus-prepares-for-potential-strike-on-syria-akrotiri","fields":{"headline":"RAF base in Cyprus prepares for potential strike on Syria","bodyText":"The road to Akrotiri is strewn with daffodils. Vineyards are also in blossom, lending this south-western corner of Cyprus a bucolic feel. Further along, towards the RAF facility at the end of the road, a handwritten board announces strawberries for sale at a roadside farm. Closer to the military enclave, past traffic signs in English and Greek, a fish and chip shop, the Swan pub and a barber come into view. It is in this slice of Little England that preparations are under way as western nations consider a military strike on Syria, and are warned against doing so by Russia, Bashar al-Assad’s main backer. Though the setting may seem incongruous, RAF Akrotiri is at the sharp end of the British military presence in the eastern Mediterranean. Rumour is rife on the island that the installation would be targeted if Russia were to retaliate in the event of US-led military action in Syria. Beyond the facility’s double-wire perimeter fence, armed guards and a heavily reinforced vehicle checkpoint, defensive measures are reportedly being taken. As the prospect of punitive airstrikes mount in the wake of last week’s deadly poison gas attack in a rebel-held town on the outskirts of Damascus, the focus has fallen increasingly on the role RAF Akrotiri would play if conflict were to erupt. At the last count, Britain’s main forward mounting base for overseas operations in the Middle East had eight Typhoon and six Tornado fighter bombers ready for action. This week it was secrecy that reigned supreme at Akrotiri. The illuminated brick plinth at the facility’s entrance, embossed with the words Royal Air Force Akrotiri beneath the RAF’s eagle and crown insignia, amounted to the most forthcoming statement the British base was willing to make. “Please address all questions to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,” said Sean Tully, a base spokesman. “The Ministry of Defence isn’t commenting.” Akrotiri is one of two sovereign base areas Britain retained in the former colony after it gained independence in 1960. Altogether, these territories cover 99 square miles, although much is Cypriot farmland and villages. Among the military assets is the gigantic golf ball that is the RAF’s long-range radar station on the top of Mount Olympus, the island’s highest peak. Akrotiri lies less than 112 miles (180km) from the Syrian coast. Cyprus’s proximity to the Middle East, as the EU’s most easterly member state, has given the installations further strategic significance with facilities to gather vital signals intelligence for Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Britain. During the cold war, US use of the base also intensified and Akrotiri has played a crucial role in strikes against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. An unbroken record of sorties without loss changed when the Syrian regime, equipped with Russia’s latest surface-to-air missile defence system, shot down an Israeli F16 as it attacked Iranian troops in Syria in February. In nearby Limassol, otherwise known as Limassolgrad because of its 40,000-strong Russian community, expatriates linked to intelligence services in Moscow have been known to train binoculars from the roofs of local buildings on jets conducting bombing missions from the base. Cypriot authorities have watched the latest developments with barely concealed alarm. Britain’s ownership of the installations has not been without its problems over the years, with sporadic protests by Greek Cypriots denouncing them as anachronistic. Under President Nicos Anastasiades, ties with fellow Orthodox Russia have not only improved dramatically but seen the island’s Greek-run south reap the rewards of Russian investment and soaring tourist arrivals. The Russian embassy in Nicosia, the divided capital, is Moscow’s second biggest diplomatic mission in Europe. In the war of words over the past week, commercial flights in the vicinity of the island have been rerouted amid mounting anxiety over the impact of potential airstrikes. Fearful of the repercussions on tourism at a time when Nicosia is only just beginning to emerge from economic crisis, the foreign minister, Nikos Christodoulides, sought to allay concerns, saying Cyprus was “one of the safest places in Europe”. The island, he insisted, was “in no way involved in what is happening, or what may happen, in Syria”. Except, of course, along the road with the daffodils that leads to RAF Akrotiri."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/16/mps-urge-may-to-resolve-immigration-status-of-windrush-children","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T07:51:49Z","webTitle":"MPs urge May to resolve immigration status of Windrush children","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/mps-urge-may-to-resolve-immigration-status-of-windrush-children","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/16/mps-urge-may-to-resolve-immigration-status-of-windrush-children","fields":{"headline":"MPs urge May to resolve immigration status of Windrush children","bodyText":"More than 140 MPs from all parties have signed a letter to Theresa May, expressing concern about the many Commonwealth-born, long-term British residents who have been incorrectly identified as illegal immigrants and calling on her to find a “swift resolution of this growing crisis”. The letter was written by David Lammy, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on race and community, and has been signed by Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, as well as the Conservative MPs Sarah Wollaston, Bob Blackman and Peter Bottomley. It urges the government to find an “effective, humane route” to resolve an immigration anomaly that has caused “undue stress, anxiety and suffering” to many. The international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, acknowledged on Monday that there was a need for the Home Office to improve the way it treated people facing this problem. “What clearly needs to happen is we need to do a better job with the process that these individuals are having to go through,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “People who are in that situation, there is absolutely no question of their right to remain and their right to gain access to services such as healthcare. “My advice to anyone who finds themselves in these circumstances is to contact your local MP … that is what we are there for. People should not be concerned about this. They have the right to stay and we should be reassuring them of that.” The issue of the children of Windrush generation migrants experiencing serious immigration issues in the UK, despite having lived here all their adult lives, will be discussed on the fringes of the Commonwealth heads of government meeting this week. Downing Street last week refused a request from the high commissioners of 12 Caribbean nations for a dedicated meeting on this subject and declined to put it formally on the agenda. Guy Hewitt, the high commissioner for Barbados, called on No 10 again to see if there were any windows in the prime minister’s schedule for a last-minute meeting. He said the refusal to offer a sit-down meeting with May was “most unfortunate”. “I am hoping No 10 will look at the schedule for Prime Minister May and if they find any opening they will give priority to Caribbean heads,” he told Today. He felt the UK was saying to “people of my region: you are no longer welcome”. There is growing unease among politicians about the situation that has affected an unknown number of people who arrived in the UK as children, but never formally naturalised or applied for a British passport. The Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, the chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, tweeted: “The news that Windrush kids are finding it difficult to establish legal status is very serious. I look forward to the Home Office sorting this problem quickly so those who helped build our country get their rights confirmed fast.” Abbott said she would be holding a public meeting on the issue in parliament on Thursday, inviting individuals affected and representatives of Caribbean governments “snubbed” by the prime minister. The MPs’ letter to May said bureaucratic errors had brought “irreparable damage to lives in addition to undue stress, anxiety and suffering”. “The impact has been felt in the cases of individuals losing the right to work, to rent property, to receive pensions, to access their bank accounts or even to access vital healthcare – a particularly cruel twist of fate as so many of those affected have spent their lives in the service of our National Health Service. Indeed, following world war two our country and its government sent out a call to the Commonwealth and invited these individuals to Britain to help build our National Health Service and rebuild our country,” it says. Describing the situation as “immoral and inhumane”, Lammy said: “The prime minister must act urgently to right this historic wrong. The government is essentially stripping people of the rights that our government itself gave them decades ago. These individuals have done nothing wrong and there is no basis upon which the Home Office can justify what they are doing. Some of the cases that have caught the public’s attention are truly heartbreaking.” He warned that many people in this situation were “too scared and anxious to seek to clarify their own status for fear they will be stripped of their status or deported back to a country that they have no memory of and is certainly not their home. Their home is here.” MPs’ letter to Theresa May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/17/black-and-proud-remembering-the-day-nicky-winmar-changed-footy-forever","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T18:00:16Z","webTitle":"'Black and proud': remembering the day Nicky Winmar changed footy | Jonathan Horn","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/17/black-and-proud-remembering-the-day-nicky-winmar-changed-footy-forever","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/17/black-and-proud-remembering-the-day-nicky-winmar-changed-footy-forever","fields":{"headline":"'Black and proud': remembering the day Nicky Winmar changed footy forever","bodyText":"In 1993 it was the international year of the world’s Indigenous peoples. The Australian High Court had recently abolished the legal fiction of terra nullius. An Indigenous man had just been named Australian of the Year. A few months earlier, Paul Keating had delivered the Redfern Address. “Imagine if our feats on sporting fields had inspired admiration and patriotism and yet did nothing to diminish prejudice,” he said. Many insist that Australian rules football reached its zenith in 1993. Up to a dozen teams were in premiership contention. Wayne Carey took the competition by storm. Gary Ablett booted 124 goals from 17 matches. In Adelaide, Tony Modra was permanently perched on defenders’ heads. Some of the best players of that era were Indigenous. Peter Matera pretty much won the 1992 grand final off his own boot. Michael Long would win the Norm Smith medal the following year on the back of one of the great individual finals series. His team-mate Gavin Wanganeen would win the Brownlow medal. But their presence was provisional. A players’ survey found that 36% had racially abused an opponent. Tony Shaw told Caroline Wilson: “I’d make a racist comment every week if I thought it would help win the game.” Neil Elvis “Nicky” Winmar copped it more than most. Like Matera, he was a Noongar man, the warrior tribe from the south-west corner of Western Australia who now make up a third of all Indigenous AFL players. He grew up in a tin shack, with no running water and a bucket for a toilet. An iridescent talent with a short fuse, he was considered fair game by opponents and fans. He arrived at a club that was something of a joke. St Kilda was famous for its wild disco, its quagmires and its wooden spoons. But new coach Ken Sheldon straightened the place up. They cultivated an intense rivalry with Collingwood, with a succession of matches going down to the death. In 1992, the Saints won a brutal final by eight points, their first finals win in nearly two decades. Because of the vagaries of the system in those days, the Magpies were bundled out, despite finishing third. But they were undefeated heading into their round four, 17 April clash. St Kilda hadn’t won at Victoria Park since 1976. With Tony Lockett rubbed out for belting Tony Malakellis, they were considered a fluker’s chance at best. For the people of the Kulin Nation, Victoria Park was a sacred place, the scene of corroborees and ceremonial rituals. For Collingwood supporters, it held similar significance. Its feral nature is sometimes overplayed. Granted, some fans were untroubled by intellectual concerns. But it was hardly The Den in South London. Sure, the facilities were primitive. And it could be intimidating. But most of the suburban grounds were like that. St Kilda’s “Animal Enclosure” could get hairy. And Adelaide and West Coast’s grounds had their fair share of birdbrains too. But it was a sulphurous crowd that day. They felt like they owed the Saints. And Winmar, who’d been St Kilda’s best player three weeks on the trot, was right in the gun. At half-time in the reserves, he and Gilbert McAdam walked down the race to familiarise themselves with the conditions. From the get-go, they were spat on and abused. In the centre square, McAdam grabbed hold of his team-mate. “We’re not going to put up with this crap,” he said. “Let’s go out there and run amok. We’ll show this mob.” Geelong’s Bob Davis once said that the mark of a champion was the ability to don the white shorts at Victoria Park and come away as best on ground. By that and many other measures, Winmar and McAdam were champions. They wrought havoc that day, collecting five Brownlow votes between them. Charlie McAdam, down from Alice Springs, didn’t see much of it. He’d been forcefully removed from his mother when he was six. He’d worked as a stockman and a boxer. He was standing in the outer but the abuse directed towards his son quickly proved too much. He left Victoria Park in tears. He listened to the rest of the game on radio back at his hotel. “I just couldn’t stomach it,” he later said. By three-quarter-time, Gilbert had kicked five goals. A recurring image is of him loping away, tucking the ball under his arm, slicing and skewering the Collingwood midfield. Winmar was different. He ran in straighter lines. He was more spring heeled. He had long, chicken legs. He moved like a gazelle. Few footballers have been so proficient on both sides of their body. His sealing goal, a 60-metre running drop punt, perfectly captured his joy, his flair, his rage. Shortly afterwards, the siren sounded and the abuse intensified. Winmar blew kisses and bared his backside to the crowd. He then lifted his jumper and pointed to his stomach. “I’m black and I’m proud to be black,” he said. It was “both intimate and public, a pronouncement of pride, in the form of an open challenge,” wrote Matthew Klugman and Gary Osmond in their superb book, Black and Proud. “It remains an arresting statement of race, discrimination, dignity and defiance.” Lurking nearby was the Sunday Age’s Wayne Ludbey. As an 18-year-old cadet photographer, he’d accidentally set fire to the darkroom. But by the early 90s, he was recognised as one of the premier snappers in the game. He was close enough to hear what Winmar was saying. There were no rapid-fire lens shutters in those days. He knew he had to nail the image. He knew he was sitting on something special. He raced back to Spencer Street and badgered his editors. They sent him home, saying he was hysterical. Deadline was approaching. They were already running with the verdicts in the Rodney King case, race riots in South Africa and an expose of Australian sex tourists in Thailand. But they telephoned him half an hour later. They were running his image on the front page. Many believe that football – and the country that obsesses over it – irrevocably changed as a result. Or perhaps not. The Collingwood president quickly weighed in. “As long as they conduct themselves like white people off the field, everyone will admire and respect them,” he said. “As long as they conduct themselves like human beings, they will be all right.” Winmar, meanwhile, spent the night at Molly Meldrum’s house. Both he and McAdam were already receiving death threats. St Kilda barred the pair from talking about the issue. Winmar immediately became embroiled in a pay dispute, which culminated in a bizarre slanging match between agent Peter Jess and Meldrum on the Sunday Footy Show. St Kilda promptly imploded, losing the next five games. A golden generation of footballers – Lockett, Loewe, Winmar and Harvey – never got the flag they perhaps deserved. By the end of the season, Sheldon had been sacked. A piglet had been released onto the SCG to ridicule Lockett. McAdam was asked to take a pay cut and left for Brisbane. His brother Adrian had meanwhile exploded onto the scene for North Melbourne, kicking 23 goals in his first three games. He too was racially vilified at Victoria Park, a day where he saw off half a dozen opponents and kicked nine goals. He was barely seen again. Winmar would go on to become the first Indigenous footballer to play 200 games in the AFL. But his career at St Kilda ended horribly. In 1998, he was the subject of a scathing Caroline Wilson profile piece. He was moved on to the Western Bulldogs. When he failed to appear as scheduled on The Footy Show, Sam Newman responded by blackening his face with boot polish. For reasons that no one can explain, he’s yet to be inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame. He’s worked in iron ore mines and as a rouseabout in a shearing shed. In 2012, he had a heart attack. In 2013, he returned to Melbourne for the 20-year anniversary of the Victoria Park game. He was at the MCG the night a young girl called Adam Goodes an ape. A few weeks later, Goodes brandished an imaginary spear and Australia embarrassed itself a little bit more. Ludbey’s image is ubiquitous. It’s been hung in galleries. It’s been spray painted on inner city walls. It’s assumed pride of place at both the Age and AFL headquarters. Indeed, for the keepers of the code, it symbolised a seismic shift, whereby bigots would be unmasked and re-educated. Together with its racial and religious vilification code, the AFL quickly positioned itself as Australian sport’s torch-bearer for reconciliation. The fact that Aboriginal people had lit Olympic flames, captained Australian rugby teams, won world title fights and triumphed in Wimbledon finals was apparently a moot point. Things change. A Noongar man is halfway through a nine-year, $10m contract. These days, Victoria Park is populated by hipsters walking French bulldogs and retired greyhounds. The face of intolerance in footy now isn’t some toothless prole in the outer, it’s a former Geelong Grammarian on The Footy Show. As Wilson wrote all those years ago, the image always meant more to others than it did to Winmar. But every few years, he returns to Melbourne. He recently attended a pride match with his gay son, Tynan. He’s bedevilled by memory loss and dizziness and is considering joining a concussion class action of former AFL players. He’s a shy man, an evasive man, a man who was chewed up and spat out by the sport, having provided it with its most significant moment in time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/16/five-things-james-comey-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T05:07:39Z","webTitle":"Five things we learned from the James Comey interview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/five-things-james-comey-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/five-things-james-comey-interview","fields":{"headline":"Five things we learned from the James Comey interview","bodyText":"Former FBI director James Comey has taken part in his first televised interview since the release of his book about his dealings with Donald Trump, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership. Speaking to ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, Comey came out swinging, describing Donald Trump as “morally unfit” to be president. He also talked about impeachment, the Hillary letter and a president who he says “lies constantly”. Here are the key things we learned: • Donald Trump has a heavyweight opponent Prime-time television, a medium that Donald Trump understands, is attracting interviewees ready to deliver damning verdicts on the US president. But whereas Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal were describing alleged affairs from years ago, James Comey is the former director of the FBI. As Anderson Cooper of CNN put it: “Somebody who’s actually been in the room with him, seen it from the inside.” And his account to George Stephanopoulos was as brutal as any heard from a former government official talking about an American president: “A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it: that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds.” • Comey is not afraid to get personal, maybe too personal Comey’s recollection of his first meeting with Trump was vivid and colourful, with small details that are perhaps calculated to demonstrate the reliability of his memory. “He looked shorter to me than he did on television, but otherwise exactly the same ... He had impressively coiffed hair, it looks to be all his. I confess, I stared at it pretty closely and my reaction was, ‘It must take a heck of a lot of time in the morning, but it’s impressively coiffed.’ His tie was too long, as it always is. He looked slightly orange up close with small, white, half moons under his eyes, which I assume are from tanning googles.” This is catnip for Never Trumpers, confirming every scornful suspicion, raising a laugh with audiences and selling books. But the insults could also be counterproductive, suggesting Comey is willing roll in the mud with Trump and handing ammunition to his supporters. • Yes, he will talk about prostitutes and the supposed pee tape Whether motivated by a desire for transparency, animus towards Trump or an eye for publicity, Comey is willing to speak candidly about the so-called Steele dossier, which contained the salacious – and unverified – allegation that the Russian government has video of Trump watching prostitutes urinate on each other in a Moscow hotel room in 2013. Comey recalls that when he first briefed the incoming president on it during the transition, Trump replied: “Do I look like a guy who needs hookers?” And Comey carefully leaves the issue hanging: “I honestly never thought these words would come out of my mouth, but I don’t know whether the current president of the United States was with prostitutes peeing on each other in Moscow in 2013. It’s possible, but I don’t know.” • When it comes to the Hillary Clinton letter, he believes he did the right thing Many Hillary Clinton supporters have still not forgiven Comey for his handling of the investigation into the former secretary of state’s use of a private email server. Stephanopoulos challenged: “Your critics say this is where your ego got the best of you. This was your original sin?” Comey is not apologising. He said he was in a “no win” situation. Asked if he would still send the 28 October letter, which announced the FBI was looking back into the Clinton investigation just days before the election, Comey admitted he must have been influenced by the assumption she would win but that he would do it again. “If I ever start considering whose political fortunes will be affected by a decision, we’re done. We’re just another player in the tribal battle.” • Life in the Comey household must have been awkward after the election Early in the interview, Comey said he did not vote in the presidential election, explaining: “I’m the director of the FBI. I’m trying to be outside of politics so intentionally tried not to follow it a lot.” But he said his wife, Patrice, and his four daughters all wanted Clinton to win and took part in the 2017 women’s march in Washington the day after Trump’s inauguration. Patrice told Stephanopoulos: “I wanted a woman president really badly, and I supported Hillary Clinton. A lot of my friends worked for her. And I was devastated when she lost.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/16/shark-attack-closes-margaret-river-pro-surfing-event","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T07:15:30Z","webTitle":"Two surfers attacked by sharks on Western Australia coast near Pro tournament","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/16/shark-attack-closes-margaret-river-pro-surfing-event","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/16/shark-attack-closes-margaret-river-pro-surfing-event","fields":{"headline":"Two surfers attacked by sharks on Western Australia coast near Pro tournament","bodyText":"Two people have been bitten by sharks while surfing off the same stretch of Western Australia’s southwest coast on Monday. A 37-year-old man was bitten on the lower leg at Cobblestones beach in Gracetown, near the Margaret River Pro surfing tournament, just before 8am and managed to bodysurf back to shore. Friends used the rope from the victim’s board as a tourniquet and provided first aid until emergency crews arrived from Margaret river within six minutes, a St John Ambulance spokesman said. The victim was flown to Royal Perth hospital where he remains in a stable condition and will have surgery. A second man was bitten while surfing off Lefthanders beach about 2.30pm. Jason Longrass, 41, told reporters in Gracetown that he had not heard about the first shark attack and did not know the beach was closed, saying he thought he was lucky to find it so empty. He identified the shark as a 4m long great white shark and said he managed to push it off after it bit his board and return to shore. He was treated by paramedics at the beach. The Margaret River Pro, about 15km away from the first attack but also close to the second, was suspended for about one hour before resuming at Main Break with enhanced safety measures including skis and drones. “We have been alerted of a shark incident that occurred near Gracetown,” organisers said on Monday morning. “The #MargiesPro is on hold while we work with local authorities. “The safety of our surfers and staff is a top priority. We have mitigation protocols in place and will be enhancing those when competition resumes.” Beach closures are in place including at North Point, Big Rock and Lefthanders. The first incident was reported on the Surf Life Saving WA Twitter feed, which broadcasts reports of shark sightings, just before 9am local time. Surf photographer Peter Jovic told the ABC that the man bodysurfed to the beach after a shark pushed him off his board. “A shark popped up and pretty much ended up knocking a surfer from his board,” Jovic said. “There was a lot more thrashing around. After that it was hard to see what was going on.” Jovic said he saw the man catch a wave, “which he managed to bodysurf all the way in”. “The surfer who was being attacked ended up miraculously bodysurfing into a little wave and getting pushed in by a local at the same time, who was out there with him, and making it to shore before everyone came to his aid.” The Department of Fisheries sent officers to investigate the incident. Under an agreement with the federal government, WA fisheries officers are authorised to kill sharks that are identified as causing an “serious threat” to human life, such as those involved in an attack. The carcass of a beaked whale was discovered on a nearby beach. Whale carcasses have been known to attract sharks. There have been three fatal shark attacks in the area since 2004, when Bradley Smith was fatally mauled by a great white. Chris Boyd, 35, was killed at nearby Umbies surf break in 2013. Nick Edwards, 31, also died after a shark attack while surfing at nearby South Point in 2010. All three were surfers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/16/nurses-facing-financial-hardship-over-student-loan-company-error-rcn","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T23:01:04Z","webTitle":"Student nurses face financial hardship over loan error, says nursing body","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/16/nurses-facing-financial-hardship-over-student-loan-company-error-rcn","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/16/nurses-facing-financial-hardship-over-student-loan-company-error-rcn","fields":{"headline":"Student nurses face financial hardship over loan error, says nursing body","bodyText":"Hundreds of student nurses whose loans and grants have been cut off or reduced because of administrative errors are facing financial hardship and in some cases may not be able to continue their studies, nurses leaders have warned. More than 800 people at 20 universities have been told they had been paid too much by the Student Loans Company (SLC) and informed subsequent payments would be reduced or halted to recover the overpayments, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said. Professional bodies and trade unions, including Unison, the RCN and the National Union of Students (NUS) are calling on Damian Hinds, the education secretary, to urgently intervene to ensure those affected will receive the financial support they have budgeted for next term. In a joint letter to Hinds, the organisations said: “We are writing to ask you to take urgent action to ensure healthcare students in England and Wales affected by errors made by the SLC will receive their anticipated payment of support in spring, as they had budgeted for. “We also ask that you use the power at your discretion as education secretary to write off overpayments in the long term for these students.” The letter added: “Our student members are telling us that the risk of receiving a reduced payment, or no payment at all, will compromise their ability to continue studying. In some cases, we are hearing concerning reports from individual students who are considering discontinuing due to these financial pressures.” Overpayments between £600 and £6,000 have been made in error by the SLC, according to the RCN, which added that many students had queried the sums but had been assured the payments were correct. According to the letter, a “huge volume of calls” were being made by “worried and distressed students” whowere concerned about their financial future. “A sudden withdrawal of payments will have disastrous consequences for these students, who budget on a term-by-term basis according to loan and grant forecasts,” it said. The letter, which was been organised by the RCN, is signed by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, the NUS, the Royal College of Midwives, the Royal College of Occupational Therapists, the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, the Society of Radiographers, the College of Podiatry and Unison. In response to the letter, a Department for Education spokeswoman said: “We have been clear that none of the affected student nurses should suffer hardship as a result of this error. “We have been working with the Student Loans Company to ensure students have the support they need and will shortly provide details on specific initiatives to help them.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/15/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T16:02:45Z","webTitle":"Tom Rogic opens floodgates as Celtic rout Rangers in Scottish FA Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/15/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/15/celtic-rangers-scottish-cup-semi-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Tom Rogic opens floodgates as Celtic rout Rangers in Scottish FA Cup","bodyText":"Scottish Cup semi-finals can deliver seminal moments. Two years ago a shock Rangers victory in an Old Firm clash signalled in effect the end for Ronny Deila’s time at Celtic. The subsequent arrival of Brendan Rodgers triggered a stunning upturn in fortunes in Glasgow’s east end. Rangers apparently lack the resources to attract a manager of Rodgers’ calibre. Nonetheless the ease with which they were swatted aside here should illustrate the scale of overhaul required at Ibrox. Had Alloa Athletic’s players moonlighted in Rangers shirts for this game, the outcome would have been no different. Graeme Murty, who has the Rangers manager’s job only until the summer, saw his team embarrassed by a Celtic side who do not need the assistance of such lame opposition. Rangers did not have much shape to start with. They lost it all, and their discipline, long before full time. Murty, who looked shellshocked, apologised to the Rangers support as he reflected on his worst day in football. “I don’t think we got close enough to them,” Murty said. “All four goals were avoidable. I said we had to be clinical in both boxes but I don’t think we managed to do that at all. “I’m not here to speak about my own position; it would be churlish and selfish to do that now. I won’t talk about my role, it isn’t about me.” In truth it is the absentee Rangers chairman, Dave King, who should be doing the talking. King continues to preside over an inefficient club which has not won a major trophy since its financial collapse of 2012. For Rodgers, further history beckons. No Scottish team has ever won back-to-back domestic trebles. With the League Cup in the trophy cabinet and a successful top-flight defence within touching distance, victory against Motherwell in the Scottish Cup final would deliver that consecutive clean sweep. “I think what the players have done over the past couple of seasons has inspired the supporters into believing the impossible,” the Celtic manager said. “There is always a lot of talk up here about the gap [between Celtic and Rangers] but these are tough games. Rangers have good players and there is always pressure at this club. The expectations are huge.” Moussa Dembélé, who was to run amok, had already struck a post by the time Celtic edged ahead. Tom Rogic danced inside Ross McCrorie, with the bemused young defender left to look on as the Australian midfielder rolled a calm finish beyond Wes Foderingham. The half-time score at least partly reflected the gulf in class. A routine Kieran Tierney cross should have been dealt with by Russell Martin. Instead the veteran centre-back played the ball straight to the feet of Callum McGregor. The return came with interest as Celtic doubled their lead. Murty’s response, which appeared little more than tokenism, was to replace Andy Halliday with Josh Windass. There were still five first half minutes to play. Any faint hopes Rangers retained of a recovery were extinguished by a Dembélé burst. The floundering McCrorie hauled down the French striker, a red card and penalty the legitimate outcome. Dembélé took the spot-kick himself and duly made no mistake. A Rangers flurry followed. Mikael Lustig almost scored a bizarre own goal but instead watched his sliced clearance rebound from the crossbar. Craig Gordon saved smartly, twice, from Alfredo Morelos. The latter stages of the game were flat on the basis that Rangers had no chance of salvation and Celtic knew it. There was time for a fourth, though, again from the penalty spot, after Patrick Roberts was upended by Jason Holt. The excellent Olivier Ntcham used the opportunity to notch his eighth goal of the season. “We have a way of playing that we know can win games,” Rodgers said. What Rangers and Murty would give for that."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/apr/15/dress-mutton-up-as-lamb-for-the-best-shepherds-pie","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T17:00:33Z","webTitle":"Dress mutton up as lamb for the best shepherd’s pie | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/15/dress-mutton-up-as-lamb-for-the-best-shepherds-pie","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/apr/15/dress-mutton-up-as-lamb-for-the-best-shepherds-pie","fields":{"headline":"Dress mutton up as lamb for the best shepherd’s pie","bodyText":"In 1998 Mo Mowlam (My stepmother Mo helped to achieve peace, 13 April) was made an honorary freeman of the City of Sheffield, not only in recognition of who she was and of her political career, but particularly for her role in helping to secure peace in Northern Ireland.

With the NBN Co chief executive, Bill Morrow, due to address the National Press Club in Canberra on Tuesday, the latest report from the TIO finds there were 22,827 complaints lodged between July and December 2017 about the broadband network – 14,055 about service quality and 8,757 about delays in establishing an NBN connection. Given consumer complaints about the NBN, fixed line and mobile services are all on the rise, with almost 85,000 complaints recorded in total over the reporting period, the Turnbull government has produced terms of reference for a review into current consumer safeguards in the telecommunications sector. The communications minister, Mitch Fifield, said the TIO’s latest six-monthly update showed “the existing model for complaints handling and redress is not working”. “Customers are continuing to experience poor service and are unable to get their service provider to satisfactorily resolve issues,” Fifield said. “Telcos need to lift their game”. The minister said the government had already directed the Australian Communications and Media Authority to work to give consumers a better experience during the NBN transition and imposed a complaints handling standard. “It is now time to look at the effectiveness of consumer protections across the board.” While the latest snapshot of customer dissatisfaction builds on a wealth of criticism about the national broadband project, NBN Co points to a 16% decline in the rate of complaints in the closing months of 2017 as evidence that it is addressing highly publicised problems in the roll-out. The NBN Co’s chief customer officer, Brad Whitcomb, said the complaints were made in the midst of “one of the biggest deployment years in the company’s history, with NBN Co increasing the number of activated premises on the network in the six months to 31 December 2017 by 39%”. Whitcomb said the total number of complaints made to the TIO about services delivered over the NBN network equates to 0.67% of total activated services on the NBN access network. He said that, of the 22,827 complaints, less than 5% (1,052 complaints) were sent to NBN Co to resolve. Morrow will use his speech on Tuesday to unveil new research on the economic impact of the NBN and polling about customer attitudes. The research compares areas where the NBN access network rollout is more than 90% complete with areas where the rollout was less than 10%. The outgoing chief executive is expected to tell the National Press Club the new research by management consultants AlphaBeta indicates the NBN network generated an additional $1.2bn of economic activity in 2017 by “helping create new jobs, new businesses, better productivity”. According to a speech extract, Morrow will say: “This is exciting because it excludes the economic stimulus of the NBN rollout itself – things like capital investments, financing and the workers need to build the network have not been counted in this $1.2bn. “By the end of the rollout, this ‘NBN-effect’ is predicted to have multiplied to $10.4bn a year. This represents an extra 0.07 percentage points to GDP growth, or 2.7% of the estimated GDP growth rate in 2021. “By the end of the rollout, the NBN effect is forecast to have helped create 31,000 additional jobs”. Morrow will also point to evidence the NBN is creating economic opportunity for women who want to work from home. He will say women with access to NBN connections are becoming self-employed at twice the overall rate of self-employment growth in NBN areas. “In percentage terms, these results are stunning,” the NBN CEO will say. “The number of self-employed women in NBN regions grew at an average 2.3% every year, compared to just 0.1% annual average growth in female entrepreneurs in non-NBN areas. “If this trend continues, up to 52,200 additional Australian women will be self-employed by the end of the roll out due to the NBN effect.” Morrow was brought in as CEO of NBN Co in 2014 from his post as CEO of Vodafone Australia, where he had overseen a turnaround of the telco. He replaced the inaugural NBN CEO, Mike Quigley, who clashed with Malcolm Turnbull when he was the then Coalition opposition’s communications spokesman. He told staff at the beginning of April he would move on from the role by year’s end."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/16/banking-royal-commission-told-90-of-financial-advisers-ignored-clients-best-interests","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T09:29:58Z","webTitle":"Banking royal commission told 90% of financial advisers ignored clients' best interests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/banking-royal-commission-told-90-of-financial-advisers-ignored-clients-best-interests","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/banking-royal-commission-told-90-of-financial-advisers-ignored-clients-best-interests","fields":{"headline":"Banking royal commission told 90% of financial advisers ignored clients' best interests","bodyText":"Australia’s corporate regulator has revealed 90% of financial advisers who provide advice to self-managed super funds have failed to comply with the best interests of their clients. The startlingly high figure was revealed during the financial services royal commission on Monday, as the commission began its second round of hearings. The focus of the royal commission has shifted to the financial advice industry and it has heard a litany of examples of inappropriate advice and misconduct including falsifying documents, with multiple cases of consumers paying ongoing fees and failing to receive regular advice reviews. Senior counsel assisting Rowena Orr told the commission that the number of “financial advisers” in Australia had exploded since the global financial crisis, from roughly 18,000 in late 2009 to now 25,386 – an increase of 41%. She said just 8,704 of all financial advisers – or 35% – have completed a degree at bachelor level or above. Peter Kell, the deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), said the corporate regulator did not believe the financial advice industry was a “profession” yet because it had not reached the standards of a profession. “In Asic’s view, we would say that the standards around competency and the qualifications you have to have to be participant in the financial advice sector, the ways in which advisers have been remunerated in many cases, and the conflicts of interest that that remuneration has generated between advisers and licensees and the clients ... [and] some of the conduct and consumer outcomes, that have been very poor on a widespread scale, indicate that we’re not yet at a position where we have a profession.” Kell said Asic recently asked an independent expert to review the quality of financial advice that had been provided by 137 licensees to self-managed super funds, and found that 90% of cases had failed to be in clients’ best interests. “It is obviously very disappointing, to say the least,” he said. He said Asic currently had roughly 60 staff trying to regulate the conduct of 25,000 financial advisers across the country. Orr listed poor behaviour by financial advisers in Australia in recent years, including falsifying documents, miss-selling financial products and charging fees for services that never eventuated. She said $383.1m had been being paid in compensation over the past decade to clients who had suffered financial loss as a result of financial advice or a failure to provide ongoing advice services. About 306,000 customers of Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Westpac, ANZ and AMP Limited have been paid $216.4m as a result of fees paid for no service. Kell said eight separate financial services entities had reported breaches to the regulator over fees for no service. “I think it’s clear from our experience that the firms in question prioritised fee revenue from their advice businesses over the provision of services to the clients,” he said. Orr also said Westpac, National Australia Bank, and AMP had only recently admitted to the royal commission that they have made payments breaching a ban on banks and wealth management businesses from paying kickbacks to financial advisers. “NAB did not disclose any of these events of prohibited conflicted remuneration to the commission in the two submissions it provided earlier this year, despite each of them constituting a breach of the Corporations Act,” Orr said. AMP failed to provide satisfactory information to the commission until 9.30pm on Sunday, leaving the commission without time to scrutinise it properly, Orr said. • Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/ng-interactive/2018/apr/18/the-great-australian-garbage-map-75-of-beach-rubbish-made-of-plastic","type":"interactive","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T18:00:05Z","webTitle":"The great Australian garbage map: 75% of beach rubbish made of plastic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2018/apr/18/the-great-australian-garbage-map-75-of-beach-rubbish-made-of-plastic","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/ng-interactive/2018/apr/18/the-great-australian-garbage-map-75-of-beach-rubbish-made-of-plastic","fields":{"headline":"The great Australian garbage map: 75% of beach rubbish made of plastic","bodyText":"Australians are battling against a tide of millions of pieces of discarded plastic debris at beach clean-up events all across the continent, according to two years of data analysed by Guardian Australia. Some 2,651,613 pieces of debris were collected from beaches and recorded in a database during 2016 and 2017, with about three-quarters of items made from plastics. Tangaroa Blue Foundation gave Guardian Australia exclusive access to data for 2016 and 2017 from its huge Australian marine debris initiative database of beach clean-ups stretching back to 2004. “We know it’s bad and we don’t need any more data to tell us that we have a problem,” says Heidi Taylor, founder and managing director of charity Tangaroa Blue. An assortment of plastic items are filling the bags and buckets of collectors, from plastic straws, bags and film to food containers, bottles, caps and drinking straws. Many items have already broken apart into an almost uncountable number of smaller microplastic pieces. Taylor says aside from their own records, a huge amount of material is also collected by volunteers, casual but conscientious beach walkers and local government staff. Craig Macintyre, a director of Surfrider Foundation and its Sunshine Coast branch president, is in his tenth year involved in beach clean-ups. “You walk up to the high tide line and you see all these really small pieces and in my time, those smaller pieces have got a lot worse. It’s turning into sludge.” Surfrider Foundation is one of more than 1000 organisations that collects data from its clean-ups and passes it to Tangaroa Blue. Macintyre says at an event at Byfield National Park, north of Rockhampton, the amount of plastics had some volunteers in tears. “It’s a beautiful part of the world but it’s getting smashed by marine debris,” he said. “We even dug down about a metre [into the sand] and it was unbelievable.” Tangaroa Blue, named after the Māori and Polynesian god of the ocean, recorded its 10 millionth piece of plastic debris last year. More than 1000 partners, including schools, other charities, local car groups and government agencies, send their data to the initiative for recording. “They do amazing work and we would not have all this data without them,” Taylor added. A big motive for the data collection is to help stakeholders to understand where the debris is coming from, so they can then work with industries and governments to cut off litter at the source. “This is all about source reduction so we can identify the people that we need to talk to and have as a partner to try and stop this happening in the future. “One large item that’s removed stops that from fragmenting into millions of tiny pieces – and those smaller pieces are much harder to remove.” In one example, Taylor says coloured plastic strapping tape found on beaches in south-west Western Australia was traced with help from a commercial fisherman to the rock lobster industry. After about six years of meetings and negotiations, the West Australian government stopped those plastic straps being taken to sea. “We need to shift our focus from cleaning up to stopping it at source and the responsibility is holistic – we need legislation and compliance, but we also need manufacturers and retailers to do their bit,” she said. “At a federal level, we really have little response – zip. But we also need an international response.” “And we need consumers to stop buying crap and to dispose of their stuff properly. We have items in our hands and we can think if we actually need it and what do we do with it when we’ve finished with it. We should be able to solve this.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/17/facebook-may-have-to-register-as-agent-of-foreign-influence-in-australia","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T02:52:21Z","webTitle":"Facebook may have to register as agent of 'foreign influence' in Australia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/17/facebook-may-have-to-register-as-agent-of-foreign-influence-in-australia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/17/facebook-may-have-to-register-as-agent-of-foreign-influence-in-australia","fields":{"headline":"Facebook may have to register as agent of 'foreign influence' in Australia","bodyText":"Social media companies including Facebook and Twitter, as well as their users, may have to register as agents of “foreign influence” on Australian politics, Labor has warned. Acting shadow attorney general Brendan O’Connor has highlighted the potential unintended consequences of the foreign influence transparency scheme bill as bipartisanship breaks down on the foreign donation ban, another plank of the Coalition’s foreign interference package. The bill would require people who undertake political, campaigning or lobbying activities “on behalf of foreign principals” to sign up to a public register. Foreign principals include not only foreign governments but also businesses, political organisations and any individual who is not a resident or citizen of Australia. Labor is concerned that because “communications activity” is defined as distributing information in any form – including social media – that tweets or Facebook posts about Australian policy issues may trigger a requirement to register. The bill contains exemptions for carriage service providers, but at a January hearing of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, witnesses from the Law Council said this did not appear to exempt Facebook, Twitter or Google. The deputy director of policy Natasha Molt said that communications was “defined very broadly” and the exemptions are “narrowly confined and do not appear on their face to capture” conduct such as discussions on social media. Law Council president-elect, Arthur Moses, said it was “certainly arguable” the social media platforms themselves would have to register. A strict interpretation of the legislation could leave Australian employees of foreign companies who tweet about company tax cuts or an academic receiving a foreign scholarship who retweets a petition vulnerable to criminal prosecution and prison sentences for failing to register. O’Connor told Guardian Australia that Labor agrees with “the concept of a registration scheme for those who represent foreign actors in Australia – but the government’s scheme won’t work properly, so Labor will work with them to fix it”. “Several submitters have pointed out the lack of clarity created by the rushed production of this bill,” he said. “The result is many stakeholders – including social media companies, and potentially their users – may be unaware as to whether they could be liable to register as foreign agents under this bill. “It is imperative that major legislative changes like this are clear in terms of who they impact and how. More work needs to be done on this bill.” A spokesperson for the acting attorney-general Greg Hunt noted the exemption for carriage service providers and said to “the extent that social media companies fall outside the definition they would not be required to register for providing the service which hosts material produced by foreign users”. Only activities “within Australia on behalf of a foreign principal for the purpose of political or governmental influence” trigger a requirement to register, the spokesperson said. “As such, social media users located outside Australia would also fall outside the scope of the scheme.” The Turnbull government has already offered an amendment to its proposed foreign espionage bill and amendments to fix the foreign donation bill are also under consideration. On Monday Bill Shorten demanded that charities’ advocacy work be exempted from the proposed foreign donation ban, increasing Labor demands after a bipartisan report suggested the opposition and government could agree on amendments. The special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, said Shorten was being “dishonest”, citing the fact that an earlier Labor bill would have banned foreign gifts to charities. “Bill Shorten is being shifty and using weasel words to try and create an impression that somehow he is proposing to be more generous to charities than the government and that is just not true,” he said. At a press conference in Brisbane Shorten accused the Coalition of using “a sledgehammer to crack a walnut”. “Part of me wonders if the reason that the government is going after charities is because they’re not fair dinkum about foreign donations because their own party has so much of it,” he said. Earlier, Malcolm Turnbull said the government’s foreign interference package was designed “to ensure that our laws are fit-for-purpose, they’re up-to-date and they serve to ensure that Australian politics and Australian public administration is not interfered with or improperly influenced by foreign interests”. “We are an open democracy and we welcome people having their say as long as it’s open and disclosed,” he told reporters in Canberra.

A spokesman for the UK-based masthead said the reporter was responsible for the uploading of inappropriate words about reality TV contestants. “After an internal investigation, Daily Mail Australia has now terminated the employment of the journalist responsible for the offending words,” the spokesman told Guardian Australia on Monday night. Sources at the Daily Mail earlier said the young reporter was “mortified” by the mistake. The Daily Mail reporter was writing in a Google document because of problems with the content management system and she inadvertently cut and pasted a paragraph about Bachelor in Paradise contestant Florence Alexandra which she says was written for her own eyes only, Guardian Australia understands. “Florence initially rose to fame on Matty J’s season of The Bachelor, before unsuccessfully trying her luck at love again in Paradise,” the Daily Mail reporter wrote in the published article. “But most people who were educated at a high-school level know these vapid cunts only go on the shows to find mediocre Instagram fame and make a living promoting teeth whiteners and unnecessary cosmetic procedures.” The article, about Alexandra posting on Instagram about a cure for her eye bags, was headlined: “Not a single person has told me I look tired!’ Bachelor In Paradise star Florence Alexandra reveals the VERY unusual cosmetic treatment she uses to combat eye bags.” The Daily Mail finally amended the article after being alerted to it via Twitter, but not before some on social media had praised the sentiment expressed by the reporter. The reporter, who has been working on the Australian arm of the Daily Mail for a year, described her job as one in which she was “responsible for breaking exclusive global news stories in a 24/7 newsroom”. Daily Mail reporters are expected to produce copy faster than is usual in other newsrooms. The reporter had filed no fewer than five stories on Sunday and four on Monday, which is a normal workload for a Daily Mail journalist. It is customary for Mail reporters to upload their own copy into the system unless the story is legally contentious. The reporter had deleted her Twitter bio photograph and locked her account on Monday. She did not respond to messages from Guardian Australia. A spokesman for the Daily Mail apologised for the error. “Daily Mail Australia would like to apologise for inappropriate language that appeared on an article published by this site on Sunday morning,” he said. “The story about Bachelor in Paradise star Florence Alexandra contained offensive wording that should not have been included. As soon as we became aware of the mistake, the wording was removed. The Daily Mail Australia apologises for any offence taken by either our readers or contestants of the show.” Alexandra said she was talking to her lawyers about taking legal action over the offensive language. “That’s not a word I would ever use, even for someone I don’t like,” she said. “I’m not shallow, or materialistic, which is what the journalist is suggesting.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/18/the-last-post-has-sounded-for-cricket-on-channel-nine-but-the-great-game-carries-on","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-17T18:00:02Z","webTitle":"The Last Post has sounded for cricket on Channel Nine – but the great game carries on | Geoff Lemon","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/18/the-last-post-has-sounded-for-cricket-on-channel-nine-but-the-great-game-carries-on","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/18/the-last-post-has-sounded-for-cricket-on-channel-nine-but-the-great-game-carries-on","fields":{"headline":"The Last Post has sounded for cricket on Channel Nine – but the great game carries on","bodyText":"It’s all about the trumpets. They cut through everything, long shoots of clean brass. Bwaah-bwa-bwaaaaaah. Bwa-bwa-bwa-bwaaaaah. But the instruments in the background were there first – violins or cellos (who among the unqualified knows?) with bows grinding staccato in that fibrous violence that turns strings to drums. Holding down a steady background beat, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum, cavalry charging a fortification. It’s drama, the sense of imminence. A heartbeat could only hit this tempo soaked in adrenaline. Then the horns return, like on days of heavy cloud when a few fat beams of sun stab earthward in homage either to God or The Lion King. This time, the tripartite phrase ends further up the octave, a searching high note, the questioning inflection jammed incongruously at the end of so many Australian statements. Then the main strands dissolve to final fanfare: diddle-um diddle-um diddle-um, bomp bomp bomp bomp. An ornate flourish like a mirror frame in a grandparental bedroom. Admittedly, describing music is rarely effective at making the reader hear it. Transliterating it in plain text is almost as useless and far more silly, while also denying the pleasure of the description. But apply mine to the start of a day of televised cricket, and some of you may find that your internal audio library sends the theme springing to life. Wide World of Sports. The theme that launched a thousand broadcasts, the ritual prelude on Channel Nine. When I was growing up they tried to display 1990s modernity by switching up to electric guitar. More recently came a return to the classic mode, an evocation of times past in a search for the reflected credibility of heritage. At the first Sydney Test after Richie Benaud’s death, the devotees who bear his likeness used their trumpeters to send the tune echoing around the empty, rain-soaked stands in an accidental lament, naked horns finding the feel of a sporting Last Post. I was always an ABC kid if given the preference: radio up, TV down, my voice of summer more Jim Maxwell than Benaud. But still, Nine’s omnipresence soaked in. To this day, I have a vital Pavlovian response when the lift doors close at the Sydney Cricket Ground and those notes fire up on the internal speakers. A snap of anticipation; feel the horses’ hooves approaching the brow of the hill? And no single refrain conjures cricket more potently than when Bill Lawry chimes in over the music: “Bowled him! The last ball, can you believe that?” But no more. The SCG Trust will have to fall back to The Girl From Ipanema, because Nine’s days hosting the home season are done. For 39 summers, such was the right of the station that was once Kerry Packer’s, but for the next six years at least, it has gone. At the rate media consumption changes in this era, television in its current iteration may be close to extinct next time around. Given my frank assessment three years ago of Nine’s shortcomings, readers might expect to see me holding a cocktail soiree on the broadcast’s freshly furrowed place of interment. But a late-life dip doesn’t invalidate all that came before. The most venerable citizen can lose dignity in dotage. Nine changed the game from 1979 on, growing the number of cameras as standard, updating the surrounding technology year on year. Graphic overlays, multi-angle replays, animation, file footage, speed guns, super slow-mo, pitch maps. Viewer aids like Hot Spot and Snickometer became incorporated into the official Decision Review System. If Nine wasn’t first to innovate, it acquired and backed others’ inventions. The quality of the technical crew was evident: whatever one thought of the accompanying commentary, the camera operators almost never lost a ball. That made a strong foundation for the public facade. Nine on your screen was summer undeniable. Tan slacks, straw hats, cream jackets. The Beige Rainbow, in all its muted splendour. Richie, Bill, Tony, Ian: way less cool than the Beatles, but stars in their own milieu way. Others who came and went around them: Max Walker, Doug Walters, Keith Stackpole, dozens more. Collectively the genesis of the Twelfth Man, the parody which won Nine’s callers more popularity and affection than they could have achieved on their own, the broadcast feeding off Billy Birmingham as he fed off it. This affection has ended up as a nostalgia trip, an indulgence in past kitsch: Greig with his Weatherwall, or the Toyota keys jammed into the pitch in such a way that would now have umpires and groundsmen in conniptions; terry towelling hats and pastel t-shirts with piped sleeves; the cigarette ads and unalloyed skin cancer and the strict limit of 24 cans of full-strength beer per person per day, give or take the odd vodka watermelon. But it’s also to do with genuine attributes. Lawry feigning querulous indignation, or not feigning it, while Greig thudded along with bass-drum bluster. Chappell always ready to fire a blunderbuss, rather than the popgun criticism of later colleagues. Benaud seen as a venerable old sage, Cricket Yoda saying “Bowl the flipper, he will,” while people forgot the feisty operator who backed Packer’s rebellion at great risk to his own career, or who barbecued Greg Chappell live on air after the underarm ball. Of course, that cast faded away: Benaud and Greig into the dissolution of death, Lawry into retirement bar the odd Melbourne game, the youngest in Chappell now an elder statesman among less robust company. Over the last decade, they were gradually replaced by recent players with no training and inadequate direction. The quality tanked, in a way that I covered in such detail as to spare anyone a repetition. The interesting thing is, Nine did improve in its last two summers. When new head of sport Tom Malone came in, old director of cricket Brad McNamara was soon on the way out. Some commentary dead wood was cut, in James Brayshaw and Brett Lee. The call dropped back to two-man teams, helping with focus. Guest commentators from visiting nations returned. It wasn’t perfect, but there was more cricket and less barf. Some people involved had recognised the problem. But even with good intentions, it felt like Nine was done. Richie, Bill, Tony, Ian: those names speak too of demographics. Solid white blokes of Middle Australia, notwithstanding a South African twang or a French connection. White men’s voices in what for so long was a white man’s sport, with a bare few players of colour in Australia’s long Test history, and a women’s team pushed to the margins. Cricket is trying to catch up on this homogeneity; the homogeneity eventually caught up with Nine. The backlash to its most recent season promo was instructive: a line-up photo of Lawry, Chappell, Mark Nicholas, Mark Taylor, Ian Healy, Michael Slater, Michael Clarke and Shane Warne. A parade of pink faces in dark suits, the monotony couldn’t have been more starkly illustrated. Online responses took the piss mercilessly. Other publications ran it as a story, or wrote critical op-eds. But then this was absurd given their own positions: Australian broadcasters and written outlets between them hired a total of four women to cover the Ashes. Perhaps what really did the damage was Nine’s language. “Meet our Ashes commentary team,” it said, when anyone who had vaguely glanced at cricket in the last 15 years would have seen the same names, same faces, same gags: a parade of former Australian captains spiced up with a couple of former England captains. It seemed to be celebrating the lack of change. Sometimes, perception is all that matters. It wouldn’t have mattered how prime minister John Howard campaigned in 2007: people were tired of him, so they moved him on. Lose your public, and accumulated faults that have been let pass are charged to your account en masse. Recent assuagement won’t spare your past mistakes. There are lessons in this for Channel Seven and Foxtel as they set up to replace Nine. Not everyone commentating on a Test match has to be a middle-aged man. Not everyone has to be a former cricketer. Not everyone has to be Australian. At a base level for the broadcaster, it’s not even about equality, it’s about boredom. Inclusion isn’t a buzzword, it’s a way to bring people in. That, above all, is what a television network is trying to do. But whatever Nine’s failings, some part will remain. For those who grew up on it, or were steeped in its brew over the course of years, it has seeped into our bones. The background rumble of distant spectators, of wooden bench seats creaking under the hot sun. The silence, the scrape of spikes. Some things will continue and some will be gone. Cricket will carry on, a summer cicada squeezed out soft and fresh to leave a former carapace. Those remnants will be left, just a current running through us that will twitch to life when we hear a trumpet line, or a familiar voice. “Bowled him! The last ball, can you believe that?” The last ball has been bowled. We believe it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/16/japan-shinzo-abe-tipped-to-resign-june-cronyism-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T05:43:04Z","webTitle":"Japan's Shinzo Abe tipped to resign in June as cronyism scandals take toll","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/16/japan-shinzo-abe-tipped-to-resign-june-cronyism-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/16/japan-shinzo-abe-tipped-to-resign-june-cronyism-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Japan's Shinzo Abe tipped to resign in June as cronyism scandals take toll","bodyText":"Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is likely to resign in June after two cronyism scandals sent his approval ratings to an all-time low and risk damaging his party’s fortunes in elections next year, according to one of Japan’s most popular postwar leaders. Junichiro Koizumi, a flamboyant reformer who was prime minister from 2001-06, told a weekly magazine published on Monday that Abe has found himself in a “dangerous” situation over the scandals, adding: “Won’t he resign around the time the current parliamentary session ends [on 20 June]?” Speaking to Aera magazine, Koizumi said Abe could harm his Liberal Democratic party’s chances in next summer’s upper house elections if he manages to cling on to the LDP presidency in a leadership election due in September. Abe has been badly bruised by allegations of cronyism centering on the heavily discounted sale of public land to the operator of an ultra-nationalist kindergarten in Osaka with links to his wife, Akie Abe. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and said he would resign if he or his wife were shown to have been intervened in the sale of the land. The finance ministry recently admitted to tampering with documents to remove references to Abe and his wife in papers relating to the decision to provide an 85% discount on the appraised value of the land. He is also alleged to have used his influence to help a friend secure permission to open a veterinary school – claims he has rejected. Last week, however, an official document emerged describing the veterinary school as “an issue that involves the prime minister”. Although he shares Abe’s hawkish views on defence, Koizumi has emerged as a vocal critic of the prime minister’s support for nuclear power. Abe wants to expand nuclear’s share of the energy mix, while Koizumi has called for its abolition following the March 2011 meltdown in Fukushima. His comments came after he speculated that Abe would find it “difficult” to secure the LDP presidency for a third three-year term this autumn, telling reporters: “He has lost trust and whatever he says sounds like an excuse.” New polls show the twin education scandals have caused dramatic slump in Abe’s support ratings, with many voters saying they were not convinced by his explanations. A survey by broadcaster Nippon TV released on Sunday showed Abe’s support had sunk to 26.7%, the lowest since he took office in December 2012. An Asahi newspaper poll published on Monday put his rating at 31%. On Saturday, protestors gathered in front of the national diet building to demand his resignation, with organisers claiming up to 50,000 people had taken part. Shigeru Ishiba, a former defence minister, was the most popular choice to replace Abe in a weekend poll by Kyodo news, with 26.6%. Koizumi’s son, Shinjiro Koizumi, came second with 25.2%, with Abe in third place with 18.3%. Abe will arrive in the US this week for talks with Donald Trump on trade and North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme. Despite his attempts to establish a close personal relationship with the US president, there are concerns Abe has been sidelined by a recent flurry diplomatic activity that will see the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, meet South Korea’s president, Moon-Jae-in, this month, as well as a possible summit between Kim and Trump the following month.

People would also be allowed to grow up to six marijuana plants at home for their personal use under the new policy, which was announced by Richard Di Natale on Monday. The policy is the first time a party with significant federal representation has backed full legalisation, providing a point of difference with the Coalition and Labor, which both support a scheme initiated in 2016 to legalise cannabis for medicinal use only. Under the plan cannabis would be taxed and regulated in much the same way as alcohol and tobacco. It would be sold to adults by licensed shops and attract GST as well as federal excise tax. In a statement, Di Natale characterised the policy as a harm minimisation approach that treats “drug use as a health issue, not a criminal issue” and a rational response to the “failed” policy of prohibition. The Greens’ policy notes that 35% of Australians have used cannabis, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare statistics, and there were 79,643 cannabis related arrests in 2015–16, up 6% from 2014-15. Prolonged use of cannabis can cause dependence, depression and psychological effects, especially if a person has a predisposition to schizophrenia. But according to the AIHW the impact of cannabis on Australians is dwarfed by the effects of alcohol and tobacco. A study released in March found that tobacco accounted for 9% of Australia’s combined fatal and non-fatal disease burden and alcohol 4.6%. Illicit drugs were responsible for 2.3% of the disease burden, of which cannabis accounted for only 7%. Di Natale, a former doctor, said he had “seen that the ‘tough on drugs’ approach causes enormous harm”. “It drives people away from getting help when they need it and exposes them to a dangerous black market,” he said. “Our plan to create a legal market for cannabis production and sale will reduce the risks, bust the business model of criminal dealers and syndicates and protect young people from unfair criminal prosecutions.” The president of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation, Alex Wodak, welcomed the announcement. “Banning cannabis hasn’t reduced its use or availability yet it has distracted police from following up more serious crimes, harmed a lot of young people and helped make some criminals rich,” Wodak said. “Regulating cannabis will give government more control and increase government revenue, which can be used to fund drug prevention and treatment.” Cannabis is legal in Spain, Uruguay and nine states in the United States, including California. Canada has committed to legalisation this year. An Essential survey conducted in September 2016 found that 47% of respondents were in favour of decriminalising cannabis, compared with 39% who opposed it and 13% who said they did not know. Support runs as high as 55% when people are asked if cannabis should be taxed and regulated like alcohol or tobacco. In January the health minister, Greg Hunt, announced a plan for a home-grown industry of cannabis products for export but at that time only 350 patients in Australia had accessed local products. Labor has accused the government of not doing enough to grant access to medicinal cannabis, particularly for blocking imports of cannabis products. After the health ministers’ meeting on Friday, Hunt announced that all states and territories had now agreed to a NSW and commonwealth joint trial to provide faster access to medicinal cannabis. “So there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,” he said. Hunt said after a medical professional prescribes cannabis, a patient should get access within 48 hours and in many cases 24 hours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/apr/16/cost-of-raising-children-much-higher-than-previously-thought-research-shows","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T18:00:17Z","webTitle":"Cost of raising children much higher than previously thought, research shows","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/cost-of-raising-children-much-higher-than-previously-thought-research-shows","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/apr/16/cost-of-raising-children-much-higher-than-previously-thought-research-shows","fields":{"headline":"Cost of raising children much higher than previously thought, research shows","bodyText":"Raising two children costs a low-income family $340 per week, including $77 for food, $65 for housing and $61 for schooling, new research shows. The study, released on Tuesday, uses a new, more precise method for estimating family costs, and finds they are significantly higher than previously thought. Researchers from the University of New South Wales’s social policy research centre identified each regular expense for low-income and unemployed families at acceptable standards of living and estimated the cost. They found the cost of raising two children for a low-income family was $340 per week. The same cost was $280 for unemployed families in receipt of Newstart allowance. A single child would cost a low-income family between $137 and $203, or $106 to $174 for unemployed families. The research is part of a broader study aiming to inform decisions about the adequacy of minimum wages and Australia’s social safety net. In an earlier report, researchers found social security payments such as Newstart were completely inadequate. The earlier study also detailed harrowing stories from unemployed families struggling under the weight of cost of living pressures. “They were having terrible times,” author Prof Peter Saunders said. “Talking through the kinds of things they went without, or how they had managed with a toothache, trying to knock teeth out with screwdrivers. “Horrendous stuff, really horrible.” The study aims to reflect modern attitudes on what constitutes a proper standard of living. It also captures shared costs associated with children like power and rent, and captures new and emerging costs like mobile phones. Researchers say old models for estimating family costs are now near useless, because they simply update decades-old assumptions with changes to the consumer price index (CPI). Saunders said the study should prompt a rethink of the adequacy of key social security payments, such as Newstart, which has not increased in real terms for more than 20 years. “I would like to see the adequacy of low-income social security payments and minimum wage be subject to a more sensible, reasoned discussion about what we expect people to live on in Australia,” Saunders said. “What you can do with the budget standards, is if you find that the Newstart allowance is $50 a week short in your budget then you can say, well those people who are missing $50, what are they going to have to go without to make ends meet? “I think that’s a much more sensible way than what we’re doing at the moment. The automatic indexation kind of lets the government get away without addressing these issues.” The Australian Council of Social Service this year launched a campaign to increase Newstart, arguing the single rate of $278 per week was completely inadequate. Acoss says Newstart is now so low that recipients cannot afford basic needs such as housing, food, and transport. It says lifting payments by $75 per week would “reduce poverty for hundreds of thousands of people across Australia”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/16/james-comey--donald-trump-morally-unfit-president-abc-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T10:30:56Z","webTitle":"James Comey says Donald Trump 'morally unfit' to be president","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/james-comey--donald-trump-morally-unfit-president-abc-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/16/james-comey--donald-trump-morally-unfit-president-abc-interview","fields":{"headline":"James Comey says Donald Trump 'morally unfit' to be president","bodyText":"James Comey has accused Donald Trump of being “morally unfit” to be president and treating women like “meat” in his first television interview in support of his new book, A Higher Loyalty. Comey further described Trump as a “stain” on everyone who worked for him, according to a transcript of a five-hour interview published by ABC and first obtained by the New York Times. Yet Comey said he does not wish for Trump’s impeachment because that “would let the American people off the hook”. “People in this country need to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values,” Comey said. “And impeachment in a way would short-circuit that.” A one-hour edited version of the interview with George Stephanopolous aired on ABC News on Sunday night. “Our president must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country,” Comey told Stephanopoulos. “The most important being truth. This president is not able to do that. He is morally unfit to be president.” Turning first to Trump’s defence of a white supremacists’ march, he said: “A person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it, that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds.” Replying to a question about whether Trump had committed an obstruction of justice, Comey said “it’s possible”. “There’s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice,” Comey said. But for the president to follow through on threats to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, Comey said, would “set off alarm bells that this is his most serious attack yet on the rule of law”. In his book, Comey compares Trump to a mafia don and challenges the president’s character, honesty and commitment to public service. Sitting in his Virginia living room across from Stephanopolous, Comey answered questions about the Trump team’s response to Russian election tampering, about his handling of the Clinton emails investigation and his personal impressions of the president-elect. “He had impressively coiffed hair that looks to be all his,” Comey said. “I confess I stared at it pretty closely … He looked slightly orange up close with small white half-moons under his eyes which I assume were from tanning goggles.” Comey also described the “really weird” Trump Tower meeting in which he briefed the president-elect on the contents of an unverified intelligence document compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele, including allegations that Trump had been in a Moscow hotel room in 2013 with urinating Russian prostitutes. “I did not go into the business about people peeing on each other” in his briefing with Trump, Comey said. “I just wanted to get it done and get out of there.” It was “unlikely” but “possible” that Russians had material with which to blackmail or otherwise compromise Trump, Comey said. “It is stunning, and I wish I wasn’t saying it, but it’s the truth.” Comey spoke for the first time about his immediate family’s disappointment at Hillary Clinton’s loss. He said his four daughters and his wife, Patrice Comey, all wanted Clinton to win, and as the ABC broadcast showed pictures of them protesting, Comey disclosed they attended the Women’s March in Washington a day after Trump’s inauguration. Comey responded to criticism by Clinton and others that he had cost her the election by making public a late-stage twist in an investigation of her emails. “It sucked,” he said. After the election, Comey said, he felt “vaguely sick to my stomach, feeling beaten down. I felt that I was totally alone, that everybody hated me, and that there was no way out because it was the right thing to do”. But Comey said he would make the same decision again, quoting verbatim from his book: “Down that path lies the death of the FBI as an independent force in American life.” Comey described his intense discomfort at his first meeting with the president, at a reception for law enforcement officials at the White House two days after the election. Comey tried to camouflage himself in the drapery but was spotted by Trump and called across the room, video of which moment has been widely circulated. Patrice Comey called the look on his face in the video “Jim’s Oh Shit face,” Comey said. Comey also detailed a one-on-one dinner with Trump in the Green room of the White House at which he said Trump asked for his pledge of loyalty – an account Trump has denied. Trump made his pitch “after the salad but before the shrimp scampi”, Comey said. The former FBI director said – not wanting to give the president any signals and realizing the gravity of the moment – that he thought to himself: “Don’t you dare move.” Comey dismissed Trump’s denial of a different scene, in which Comey said Trump told him to “let go” of an investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. “The president says he didn’t say that,” Stephanopoulos said. “What am I gonna do? He did,” Comey replied with a shrug. Brisk pre-sales for the book, and the ambitious national tour Comey has planned beginning in New York City on Tuesday, have prompted criticism about the amount of money Comey seems to be making as he settles scores with the president. Yet Comey’s career as a government prosecutor speaks to the seriousness of his commitment to the public good, and whatever other motivations he may have for going in front of the cameras, Comey clearly sees Trump as a threat to the country and sees himself as capable of defending it. Comey described his reaction to finding out on TV, during a trip to California, that he had been fired less than halfway through his 10-year term. “That’s crazy,” Comey remembered thinking. “How could that be?” Then Comey got on the FBI plane for the long flight back to Washington. “I drank red wine from a paper coffee cup and just looked out at the lights of the country I love so much as we flew home.” The White House did not reply to a query about whether Trump planned to watch the Comey interview, which was taped earlier in the week. Trump did not tweet during the broadcast. However, Ronna McDaniel, Republican National Committee chairwoman, said on Twitter that Comey had “no credibility” and “his true higher loyalty is to himself”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/16/plans-to-extend-personalised-health-budget-scheme","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T23:18:33Z","webTitle":"Thousands of patients to get personalised NHS budgets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/16/plans-to-extend-personalised-health-budget-scheme","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/16/plans-to-extend-personalised-health-budget-scheme","fields":{"headline":"Thousands of patients to get personalised NHS budgets","bodyText":"Hundreds of thousands of people with mental health conditions and physical disabilities could be given the option of a personalised NHS budget for their own care needs under government proposals. People with learning difficulties and dementia are among around 350,000 who could have the right to select and pay for treatments that improve their health and wellbeing through a bespoke care plan agreed with medical professionals. For children and people unable to manage the money, parents or carers will be able to manage the budget. Ministers believe the measure will improve patient satisfaction with the NHS and harmonise health and social care budgets. Currently, about 23,000 people have personalised NHS budgets, but ministers want to expand the scheme. The government hopes that care provided to the qualifying groups on the NHS will improve, after complaints about current standards of treatment. Tens of thousands of pounds could be made available to a single person. People who qualify for the personal healthcare budget would have the option of receiving the money through a direct payment, giving the money to a third party to manage or leaving it with the NHS to control. The move has received the backing of the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and Simon Stevens, the head of the NHS. It will be set up later this year when the government announces changes to health and social care. Caroline Dinenage, the minister for care, said: “If you have complex needs, our current health and social care system can be confusing, so it’s right people should be involved in the important decisions about how their care is delivered. “These changes will put the power back into the hands of patients and their families, potentially allowing up to 350,000 extra people to take up a personal health budget if they so wish.” One example of the existing NHS scheme mentioned in the government consultation is of a 90-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s disease who uses the personal health budget to pay for care at home, osteopathy treatment and respite care for her family. The woman has not had any emergency admissions to hospital or nursing home since she was given the personal budget, according to the report. Dinenage said: “This would not only improve quality of life and the care they receive, it will offer good value for money for the taxpayer and reduce pressure on emergency care by joining up health and social care services at a local level. “As the health and social care secretary set out in his speech last month, we’re determined to focus care around the person, and this will form one of the key principles of reform for the sector in a green paper published this summer.” However, Caroline Abrahams of Age UK told the Times: “Older people in declining health with social care needs generally tell us they are not very interested in getting involved in organising the services they receive. They just want them to be effective and joined up, and delivered by kind and skilful professionals.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/15/arsene-wenger-arsenal-rafael-benitez-newcastle-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T18:31:36Z","webTitle":"Arsène Wenger says Arsenal defeat at Newcastle was ‘a worry character wise’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/15/arsene-wenger-arsenal-rafael-benitez-newcastle-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/15/arsene-wenger-arsenal-rafael-benitez-newcastle-united","fields":{"headline":"Arsène Wenger says Arsenal defeat at Newcastle was ‘a worry character wise’","bodyText":"A resigned, almost brutally realistic, Arsène Wenger described Arsenal’s fifth successive away defeat in the Premier League as “the story of our season”. His side’s 2-1 defeat at Newcastle United means Arsenal have failed to collect a single point on the domestic road during 2018, casting their manager’s future into serious doubt. Much hinges on their ability to overcome Atlètico Madrid in the Europa League semi-final and then win the trophy but the fatigue induced by the quarter-final second-leg draw at CSKA Moscow on Thursday clearly played a part in their second‑half downfall on Tyneside where they could not sustain a fiercely intense early tempo. “It’s the story of our season,” said Wenger, who thought Arsenal might have had a penalty when Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang’s first-half shot hit Jamaal Lascelle’s hand. “We had 70% of possession and were 1-0 up. You wonder how you can lose this game. It could have been over at half-time. It’s very harsh to swallow a defeat like this. It’s very disappointing. “Of course it’s a concern to have lost five games in a row away because traditionally we have a very strong record away. It has become a subconscious weight on our minds. Once you’re in a negative spiral like this it is very hard to get out of.” By way of mitigation he cited European commitments. “It’s very difficult to combine the Europa League on Thursday night and the Premier League on Sunday afternoons,” Wenger said. “Some of our players were affected physically by getting back from Moscow so late. “But losing like this is a worry character wise. Our attitude today was spot on but I have to be realistic enough to say that maybe our balance offensively and defensively doesn’t work.” In contrast a delighted Rafael Benítez banished any lingering relegation fears by lifting his 10th-placed Newcastle side to 41 points after a fourth successive victory. “It’s a great achievement,” he said. “A fantastic achievement at the end of a very difficult season.” Asked if he would extend the remaining year on his contract Benítez, who celebrates his 58th birthday today, replied opaquely. “If everything’s right, we have a good opportunity here but everything has to be right. We have to be sure that, next year, we have the tools to compete at the level we want to compete at.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/15/wolves-birmingham-city-championship-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T13:25:29Z","webTitle":"Diogo Jota sets promoted Wolves on the way to win over Birmingham","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/15/wolves-birmingham-city-championship-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/15/wolves-birmingham-city-championship-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Diogo Jota sets promoted Wolves on the way to win over Birmingham","bodyText":"Nuno Espírito Santo said he would celebrate Wolves earning promotion to the Premier League but the manager wants them to aim for “something special” by finishing with 104 points. This canter past a relegation-threatened Birmingham gives Wolves 95 points with three matches remaining of their Championship campaign. Espírito Santo’s side were the classy proposition they have been throughout the season, as goals from Diogo Jota and Benik Afobe on 21 and 87 minutes sealed the victory the Portuguese demanded for the home crowd. Wolves came into the match with a place in the Premier League guaranteed thanks to Fulham only drawing with Brentford on Saturday night. Asked to look ahead to how Wolves might fare next season in English football’s top tier, Espírito Santo said: “Now is not the moment – we would ruin everything. We have 95 points. Let’s try to achieve more, something special – 101 or 104 points. That’s the dream, now let’s try it. “It doesn’t finish yet. We know we still have things to go for, can achieve something special. This season does not deserve any kind of bad moment.” Wolves hit the top of the Championship in mid-November and have stayed there. The manager said: “I’m very pleased. It is a big moment – first for our fans. This is why we work. It was a special feeling. They are with us, always behind us, along with the club and city. And it is more special for the players. They have been fantastic from day one. “We showed today that yesterday was finished [promotion being confirmed] and the boys went out [and focused]. Thank you for each and every one of the players who was with us. We achieve it together, together we are strong.” He pointed to the faith his charges have shown since he took over last summer. “They deserve it. The players are the key, the way they start and they believe. First of all what you have to conquer is the trust of players and it’s fantastic [their belief]. The Championship is the hardest competition in the world. When I’m saying this is because it’s true; it is so competitive.” Espírito Santo had indulged in a little celebration. “Of course, I do it with joy and I enjoy it. It was a very hard season. I drink beer in the dressing room for the first time – I must be really happy. But Wednesday we are back in work.” His side travel to Bolton next Saturday before hosting Sheffield Wednesday and making a final-day trip to Sunderland. Wolves have been criticised over their relationship with the super-agent Jorge Mendes, with rivals concerned that this has allowed the club an unfair advantage in the transfer market. Asked about his compatriot, Espírito Santo – a Mendes client – said: “I think everybody who loves the idea of Wolverhampton deserves credit.” Conor Coady, the captain, said there had been no problem concentrating on the game. “It’s not hard to focus when we’ve got a manager like that,” he said. “It’s huge for this club to be back in the Premier League.” Birmingham are two points above the drop zone in 21st place and have played a game more than Barnsley, the side immediately beneath them. City’s manager, Garry Monk, was unhappy about the straight red card shown to Harlee Dean for a challenge on Hélder Costa early in the second half. “Harlee went for an attempt for the ball. The ruling is that’s a yellow card; we are definitely looking at that to be rescinded.” Of the survival battle, Monk said: “We’re fighting. Everyone is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/15/wakefield-st-helens-super-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T17:40:02Z","webTitle":"Liam Finn’s penalties propel Wakefield to win over league leaders St Helens","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/15/wakefield-st-helens-super-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/15/wakefield-st-helens-super-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Liam Finn’s penalties propel Wakefield to win over league leaders St Helens","bodyText":"Wakefield became only the second side to defeat St Helens this season and ended a five-match losing run to reaffirm their credentials as potential play-off contenders in 2018. Trinity’s three defeats over Easter came by a combined losing margin of eight points and, despite genuine top-four ambitions, they have tumbled down the Super League table. So this first win in more than a month was timely, though not straightforward. Having led 22-6 midway through the first half, Trinity added only two more points in the final hour – via a penalty from the boot of Liam Finn, the scrum-half who epitomised the team’s endeavours by playing with a broken finger. Yet, despite an enormous amount of late pressure from the visitors, Wakefield somehow hung on to leave their coach, Chris Chester, relieved. “I think I aged about 10 years in that last five minutes, but it’s a huge result for the club,” he said. “We’ve been there or thereabouts for the last five games and it’s nice to win a tight one today. I feel we deserve it and it will do the players a world of good. I’m really pleased. It means I can sleep a bit better tonight.” St Helens remain at the top of the Super League table but their lead has been cut to two points. They rallied well here to reduce the deficit to two points before Finn’s nerve-calming penalty – and while it has become traditional for the Saints to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in recent years, this was not one of those occasions. Mark Percival initially broke the deadlock after two minutes and Wakefield responded superbly, scoring 22 points in a blistering 17-minute passage to put them comfortably ahead. By half-time, though, Percival’s second and a further try from Tommy Makinson made it 22-14. The league leaders continued to improve in the second half and Luke Douglas reduced the deficit further seven minutes after the break. But a sustained period of pressure thereafter came to nothing, thanks largely to some magnificent Trinity defence. Justin Holbrook, the St Helens, coach, said: “I was disappointed with our effort today. It was a close game but we couldn’t come away with the win. Full credit to Wakefield. I thought they just worked harder than us.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/15/grand-national-aintree-tv-figures","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T17:10:31Z","webTitle":"Sunny outlook for the Grand National as safety first policy reaps rewards | Greg Wood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/15/grand-national-aintree-tv-figures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/15/grand-national-aintree-tv-figures","fields":{"headline":"Sunny outlook for the Grand National as safety first policy reaps rewards","bodyText":"The news on Sunday morning that Saint Are, now a veteran of five Grand Nationals, was well enough to return to Tom George’s stable after Saturday’s race at Aintree capped another great weekend for the sport’s most high-profile event. For the sixth year running since the old wooden cores in the fences were replaced by more forgiving plastic, every horse returned to its yard afterwards and, where the last National on heavy ground was a grim, attritional spectacle, the race this year produced a close finish and a popular winner in Tiger Roll. “He had a good, comfortable night,” George said of Saint Are on Sunday morning. “They looked after him well at Aintree. His lad stayed up with him and the vets checked him every few hours. He’s eaten his breakfast and he’s ready to come home. He walked out brighter this morning, I just think he was a bit shaken [when brought down at The Chair]. He’s feeling good about it and we’re looking forward to getting him home.” There is, of course, an element of risk attached to any horse race and it is inevitable that a horse will suffer a fatal injury in the National eventually. But we are now at a point where the effect of the changes to the fences before the 2013 renewal is becoming increasingly clear. The new fences look like the old ones and the race itself looks little different, while the number of finishers has risen slightly over the past six runnings compared with the six years from 2007, from 38% to 43%. This in itself is good news, as more punters are getting more of a run for their money. But the most significant difference, as might be expected since the fences are now more forgiving, is in the number of fallers. Proper statisticians may flinch at this point, because half a dozen years is not, admittedly, an extended sample, but the effect does seem obvious and unmistakable. Between 2007 and 2012 there were 57 fallers in the National from 240 starters. Since the changes to the fences there have been 32 from 236. Fewer fallers, inevitably, also means fewer horses being brought down in their wake. The ratio of falls to riders being unseated, meanwhile, has shifted from 1.4:1 to, in effect, 1:1 because the number of unseats is virtually unchanged. It appears that mistakes that were once bad enough to cause a fall are now more likely to unship the jockey, while lesser errors that might have been 50-50 to unseat in the past are more likely to leave the rider sitting tight and going on to complete, or pull up when their chance has gone. In other words the redesigned fences – which received unqualified approval when they were unveiled six years ago – have worked precisely as the organisers intended and reduced the rate of fatal injuries in the National much closer to the rate of just below 0.4% of starters in the rest of National Hunt racing. The sunshine at Aintree on Saturday also added to the generally positive mood around the big race, especially after a damp and chilly Ladies’ Day on Friday. It was not, perhaps, welcomed quite so warmly by ITV’s senior executives, however, as sunny weather was cited as a reason for a slump in the National’s audience figure last year, the first since it grabbed a monopoly on terrestrial racing coverage from Channel 4. The theory is that on one of the first spring-like Saturdays of the year, many potential viewers preferred to be outside with their families rather than stuck in front of the TV. It seemed to be borne out last year by a big drop in the total audience on Saturday afternoon, of which the National took a peak share of 62%. The peak viewing of 8.5m for this year’s race was a 3.6% increase on last year’s peak of 8.2m, although the peak share of total viewers while the National was being run was down slightly, at 60%. It was still well short of the 10m viewers for the last National on Channel 4 in 2016, however, and even further adrift of the 12m peak that John Baker, Aintree’s managing director, suggested would be “at the low end of expectations” when the contract was signed. Last year’s ITV coverage is up for a Bafta next month and this year’s also seemed to be well received. Both racing and ITV will hope earnestly for a spike in the figures next year, however, before negotiations start in earnest on a possible extension to the £30m contract."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/16/hospital-trusts-accused-of-backdoor-privatisation","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T23:01:03Z","webTitle":"Hospital trusts accused of ‘backdoor privatisation’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/16/hospital-trusts-accused-of-backdoor-privatisation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/16/hospital-trusts-accused-of-backdoor-privatisation","fields":{"headline":"Hospital trusts accused of ‘backdoor privatisation’","bodyText":"Hospital trusts are spending millions of pounds setting up arm’s-length private companies, which health unions fear will turn staff transferred into them into “second-class employees”. Fifteen trusts in England have already spent £3.2m between them creating wholly owned subsidiaries, figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show. The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre trust on Merseyside, one of the NHS’s cancer hospitals, has spent the most – £661,335 – on setting up a firm called PropCare with the help of consultants Hill Dickinson and KPMG. Gloucestershire Hospitals trust has spent £403,000 establishing Gloucestershire Managed Services, with a further £15,000 likely. The Royal Free trust in London has also used an estimated £400,000 of its budget, though its board has yet signed off the creation of the company involved. Unison, which obtained the figures, said it was “a disgrace” that cash-strapped hospitals were using vital NHS resources to establish private firms that give staff inferior pay and pensions. While transferred staff retain their NHS terms and conditions, new joiners do not. “The amount of public money being frittered away on transferring NHS staff to private companies is a disgrace, especially at a time when there’s such a squeeze on resources,” said Sara Gorton, Unison’s head of health. “These wholly owned subsidiaries are creating a two-tier workforce where new staff are likely to be far worse off in terms of their pay and pensions. Porters, cleaners and other staff chose to be part of the NHS team, not to be contracted out and treated like second-class employees.” Nineteen NHS trusts have already set up at least one wholly owned subsidiary, eight of which have had an estimated 3,000 staff – mainly cleaners, porters and maintenance workers – moved into them. At least 16 other trusts are considering doing the same with 5,000 more personnel. Such firms can bring tax and VAT benefits for trusts that set them up. Labour’s shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “This transfer of staff to effectively private companies amounts to a backdoor privatisation and creates a two-tier workforce with fair pay and conditions undermined. Ministers should block this process now.” However, NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, denied that such firms constitutes privatisation and insisted they help avoid trust staff being outsourced. “Unison’s claims are inaccurate and misleading. Wholly owned subsidiaries have been operating entirely without controversy in the NHS for many years,” said Chris Hopson, its chief executive. “They are not private companies; they are wholly owned by the NHS trusts that set them up. They are not outsourcing; they are being set up in many cases to avoid outsourcing to the private sector. “They are not being set up solely to avoid tax or cut staff pay. Unions are recognised and there is extensive consultation with staff.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/apr/15/nca-considering-new-criminal-inquiry-into-stephen-lawrence-case","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T16:22:22Z","webTitle":"NCA considering new criminal inquiry into Stephen Lawrence case","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/nca-considering-new-criminal-inquiry-into-stephen-lawrence-case","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/apr/15/nca-considering-new-criminal-inquiry-into-stephen-lawrence-case","fields":{"headline":"NCA considering new criminal inquiry into Stephen Lawrence case","bodyText":"The National Crime Agency is considering starting a new criminal inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case, potentially placing four former detectives under criminal investigation for the offence of misconduct in public office. It is understood that the inquiry would focus on why officers in charge of the first Metropolitan police investigation into Lawrence’s murder 25 years ago did not make arrests for two weeks, despite police repeatedly being given the names of suspects. Lawrence, 18, was stabbed to death by a racist gang of at least five white youths on 22 April 1993. It took 19 years for two of the gang to be convicted of his murder. Those who may face the new inquiry, 25 years after the Met’s much-criticised decisions in the first fortnight after the murder, are the senior management team in the first Lawrence murder investigation. They have retired from policing and have always denied any wrongdoing. They are Det Supt Ian Crampton, in charge for the first three days after the murder; Det Supt Brian Weeden, who took over as senior investigating officer; Det Ch Supt William Ilsley, who oversaw them; and DI Ben Bullock, who was the deputy senior investigating officer. If the NCA proceeds, it will consider interviewing the former officers under criminal caution. For the past two years, the NCA has been investigating whether the suspects were shielded as a result of corruption and who in the police may have been involved. The NCA does not believe it has evidence to suggest the four officers acted corruptly and nor are they suspects for that. The Lawrence murder suspects were arrested a fortnight after the racist murder and only after Nelson Mandela met Lawrence’s parents during a trip to London and embarrassed the Met. The criminal offence of misconduct in public office “is committed when the office holder acts (or fails to act) in a way that constitutes a breach of the duties of that office”, according to guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service. Questioning under caution gives investigators certain powers, but is also meant as a protection for those facing suspicion. It does not imply guilt. The public inquiry into how police failed to catch Stephen’s murderers, chaired by Sir William Macpherson, was critical of all four men in its 1999 report, and of the Metropolitan police in general. Macpherson’s report said: “There is no doubt but that there were fundamental errors. The investigation was marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior officers.” Macpherson said of Crampton, the first senior investigating officer for the first three days after the murder: “A vital and fundamental mistake was made in failing to arrest the suspects named in that information by the morning of 26 April. Enough information was available to make the arrests by the evening of 24 April, at about the time when Mr Crampton says that he made a ‘strategical’ decision not to arrest.” Macpherson said of Weeden, who took over as senior investigating officer from Crampton: “He did not exercise his own critical faculties in order to test whether the right decisions had been made. He was confused as to his power of arrest. His fundamental misjudgment delayed arrests until 7 May, at which time the arrests were made because of outside pressures.” Macpherson said of Bullock, the deputy senior investigating officer: “The major responsibility for the team’s failures lie with those who supervised Mr Bullock, but as DIO he bears his share of responsibility for the team’s failures.” Ilsley was also criticised in the public inquiry’s report: “Mr Ilsley allowed himself to go along with the weak and unenterprising decisions made by his SIOs, in which he had been himself directly involved. … He failed to supervise and to manage effectively this highly sensitive murder investigation.” In a BBC documentary marking the 25th anniversary of the Lawrence murder, to be broadcast this week, Crampton defends his decision making in the first murder investigation, saying: “I was made aware that there were phone calls coming in, naming people but not saying how they knew. Many of the calls were of a similar nature, as if a rumour’s going round and people are phoning in the rumour they’ve heard. “At no stage at that point had we got any actual evidence ... information isn’t evidence, there is a distinct difference. “The strategy was not to arrest – they were juveniles. You had to handle juveniles very carefully, obviously – to get them in to simply release them wasn’t really making a lot of sense.” In a 1999 BBC interview, Ilsley also rejected the criticism: ”We’ve been made scapegoats. The key issue was the issue of early arrests. There is nothing at all in this investigation that has shown me that if we had done anything differently, we would have got a good result.” The NCA is working on behalf of the Independent Office of Police Conduct. It declined to talk about the inquiries into the four senior officers in the first Lawrence murder investigation. Sarah Green, of the IOPC, said: “We are determined to leave no stone unturned and we remain keen to speak to anyone who feels they might have information to aid our efforts.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/15/hurricane-hit-islands-need-debt-relief","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T17:01:33Z","webTitle":"Hurricane-hit islands need debt relief | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/15/hurricane-hit-islands-need-debt-relief","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/15/hurricane-hit-islands-need-debt-relief","fields":{"headline":"Hurricane-hit islands need debt relief","bodyText":"This week we will meet with fellow Commonwealth heads of government in Windsor. One of the most pressing challenges facing smaller Commonwealth governments is the impact of climate change, and the rising debt burden we face as a result. The 2017 hurricane season was one of the most devastating in Caribbean history. In Barbuda and Dominica destruction totalled more than twice annual GDP. The growing severity of hurricanes in the Caribbean is related to climate change, a major global threat primarily caused by countries far richer and larger than our own. In the wake of increasingly frequent and devastating disasters, and in the absence of sufficient grants to support climate mitigation and adaption and sustainable development, small islands have no choice but to resort to taking on more debt. Yet many already have large debts as a result of past disasters and injustices, loss of trade preferences, and exclusion from debt relief schemes, while our small size makes us more vulnerable to economic shocks such as global financial crises. As climate change gets worse, we urgently need a new system for fast and effective debt relief when disasters hit. We should not have to bear these extra costs ourselves through climate risk insurance. We call on larger Commonwealth countries, including the UK, to play a leading role in the creation of such a system. Those who have contributed the most to climate change are the real debtors and it is, therefore, unfair that small island developing states, which are most vulnerable, like those in the Caribbean, be indebted as a result. We look forward to this meeting resulting in a bold decision to address the issues raised above, in the best interests of all. Keith Mitchell Prime minister of Grenada Gaston Browne Prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda • Heads of government from the 53 nations of the Commonwealth arrive in London on Monday for their biennial meeting. The official meeting website says that they will “agree how to … create a better future for all our citizens”. But this commitment rings hollow to the millions of LGBT+ people who live in the 37 Commonwealth countries where homosexuality is illegal. For every one of these countries with an anti-gay law, lives are on the line: a lesbian in Sri Lanka who can’t go to the police when she’s attacked; a gay man in Nigeria behind bars just for being who he is; the activists who organise Pride Uganda denied the right to peaceful freedom of assembly and arrested and beaten by police. Many Commonwealth leaders shamelessly scapegoat LGBT+ people for domestic political advantage. They often exploit the false narrative that homosexuality is a “western import” and argue that for this reason it must be eradicated. With the UK hosting this year’s meeting, we want to put the record straight. It is not homosexuality that is a western import, but homophobia. Most of the laws used to criminalise and persecute innocent LGBT+ citizens across these Commonwealth countries are British exports. This is colonial-era legislation, often unamended, that has been retained since Commonwealth countries became independent. The UK must accept that these laws are one more damning indictment of Britain’s colonial past. All Out and other Commonwealth organisations have come together to demand action. Through our petition we are calling on the UK to use this week’s meeting in London to acknowledge that most homophobic laws across the Commonwealth came from Britain, and to apologise to the millions of LGBT+ citizens of these countries who still suffer under these laws. An apology will clear the legacy of the past and expose the direct responsibility of today’s Commonwealth leaders for the human rights violations they commit against LGBT+ people in their countries. There is no plan to discuss LGBT+ rights at this week’s meeting. But if the leaders gathering in London and Windsor want the Commonwealth to be recognised as a credible 21st-century global body, they must include an open and frank discussion of anti-LGBT law decriminalisation on their agenda. It is no longer acceptable that love is illegal for millions of Commonwealth citizens. It’s time to fix it.

Making the first defence of this claim since Porton Down scientists said they could only describe the agent as novichok, but not ascertain its country of origin, Johnson implied he had never said Porton Down told him Russia was responsible. Since he made the claim, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has confirmed the British finding that the nerve agent was that described by British scientists, but again did not say the agent could only have been made in Russia. Johnson was severely criticised over misdescribing his conversations with Porton Down chiefs, mainly in an interview with Deutsche Welle last month. There is great pressure on British politicians to be precise in their allegations against Russia, and the source of them. Johnson told BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: “I was being very clear. I thought I was being very clear to Deutsche Welle, the German programme, which is that Porton Down told us in absolutely no uncertain terms that this was a military grade novichok agent, and furthermore of a type that had been produced and stockpiled in the former Soviet Union.” He told the BBC he asked Porton Down “‘Are you sure about that?’ And they said they were absolutely certain that it was. Now it is not the business of Porton Down, and I don’t know if whether it is even possible for them to identify the origin, any more that you might be able to identify the origin of a sample of sulphuric acid. But, as the OPCW confirmed this week, it was indeed a military grade nerve agent novichok of a type that has bene stockpiled likely for assassination purposes by Russia in the last 10 years.” Johnson added he had made his remarks to Deutsche Welle before UK intelligence told him Russia had been practising putting novichok on door handles. UK intelligence in a letter to Nato released on Friday also revealed that Soviet spies had been hacking Yulia Skripal’s phone for years. He said anyone who continued to deny Russian involvement in the Skripal affair was showing an extraordinary and perplexing blindness to reality. Without naming any individual or the Labour frontbench, he said some people seemed to possess a “defiant refusal to accept that the Kremlin could be responsible”. In the Deutsche Welle interview, Johnson was asked: “You argue that the source of this nerve agent, novichok, is Russia. How did you manage to find it out so quickly? Does Britain possess samples of it?” Johnson replied “Let me be clear with you … when I look at the evidence, I mean the people from Porton Down, the laboratory …” The interviewer interrupted “So they have the samples …” before Johnson replied: “They do. And they were absolutely categorical and I asked the guy myself, I said, ‘Are you sure?’ And he said ‘there’s no doubt’.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/15/newcastle-united-arsenal-premier-league-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T14:49:13Z","webTitle":"Arsenal slump to another defeat as Matt Ritchie hits Newcastle winner","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/15/newcastle-united-arsenal-premier-league-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/15/newcastle-united-arsenal-premier-league-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Arsenal slump to another defeat as Matt Ritchie hits Newcastle winner","bodyText":"As Rafael Benítez strode towards the centre circle and acknowledged a richly deserved standing ovation, yet another grisly Arsenal inquest was about to begin. At the end of an afternoon when, courtesy of a fourth successive win, Newcastle United emphatically banished any lingering relegation fears, the rather fixed expression on Arsène Wenger’s face indicated that, once again, it was time to reach for his metaphorical tin helmet. With the music blaring and locals serenading Benítez to the tune of a specially adapted version of La Bamba, debates raged in all corners of the stadium. Had the impressive Jonjo Shelvey finally done enough to convince Gareth Southgate to offer him a place on England’s World Cup flight to Russia? Might Benítez’s achievement in overseeing Newcastle’s collection of 22 points from a possible 36 since New Year’s Day earn him the manager of the year award? And, crucially, will Arsenal’s failure to collect a single point on the domestic road during 2018 finally spell the end for Wenger in north London? They may be looking forward to a Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid but this was the visitors’ fifth straight Premier League away defeat. It provided plenty of clues as to why Wenger’s side remain a disappointing sixth, only four places ahead of Newcastle. In mitigation, Arsenal’s Europa League quarter-final draw at CSKA Moscow on Thursday night was followed by a 5am Friday landing at Luton airport. After a dominant first‑half display here, that rude awakening appeared to catch up with them, with fatigue clearly intruding. Initially though a visiting XI featuring the 18-year-old attacking midfielder Joe Willock making his league debut looked neither overly tired nor missing the absent Mesut Özil – given the day off. Instead Alexandre Lacazette volleyed Arsenal into an early lead at the end of a wonderfully fluent attacking move also featuring Shkodran Mustafi’s 60-yard pass and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s adhesive control and intelligent square ball. It was Aubameyang’s second visit to the north-east, the first having come when he played 2012 Olympic football for Gabon at St James’ Park. Then Aubameyang and friends limbered up with a friendly at nearby Northern League club Heaton Stannington, where he caused quite a stir by arriving in a pair of £2,500 Swarovski crystal-encrusted trainers. Ayoze Pérez – who cost Newcastle a relatively modest £1.5m – is unlikely to ever command the £56m that Arsenal paid for Aubameyang but, almost imperceptibly, the young Spaniard has grown into what initially seemed an unnatural No 10 role in Benítez’s hallmark formation. So much so that Pérez has now scored three times in the last three games, with the latest pulling Newcastle right back into things on Sunday. In some ways almost a carbon copy of Arsenal’s opener, the equaliser began with a fine 50-yard delivery from Shelvey. Once Dwight Gayle had brought the playmaker’s pass under seamless control and Mustafi – defensively disappointing throughout – negligently stood off, the striker fed DeAndre Yedlin. The right-back’s superb low cross was met by Pérez’s right foot and the ball arrowed beyond Petr Cech. Martin Dubravka’s arrival on loan from Sparta Prague in January has been a key factor behind Newcastle’s renaissance – significantly Lacazette’s goal was the first the Slovakia goalkeeper had conceded at St James’ Park – but bar a momentary brain freeze on Willock’s part he would surely have been beaten again just before half-time. When Mo Diamé slipped, Lacazette was gifted possession and the striker’s pass seemed to have cued the teenager up for a memorable goal but Willock got his feet in an awful tangle and a glorious chance evaporated. The afternoon had turned into an intriguing tactical duel between Arsenal’s slick possession game (featuring the odd encouragingly mature cameo from Willock before his replacement by Danny Welbeck) and the counterattacking strategy that has enabled Benítez to overachieve greatly this season. If the containment capabilities of the vastly improved Jamaal Lascelles and Paul Dummett should not be underestimated, Shelvey’s defence-splitting contributions alongside the quietly influential Diamé have frequently changed games. Against Arsenal Shelvey did much to suggest that Southgate is wrong to continue turning a blind eye to his England candidacy. After all, an unusually subdued Mohamed Elneny would surely not relish facing Shelvey and Diamé every week. As Elneny and company’s legs grew heavier, Islam Slimani, on for Gayle, created Newcastle’s second goal with a header across the area. That delivery allowed Pérez to contribute a clever dummy and neat flick, leaving Matt Ritchie to lift an accomplished chip over Cech, with Nacho Monreal culpable. With Slimani creating havoc, Kenedy subsequently hit the bar and the Blaydon Races was sung ever louder. Beneath a tepid April sun, one team was crumbling. For once, it was not Newcastle."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/15/puma-put-its-foot-in-it-with-campaign-to-sell-trainers","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:00:09Z","webTitle":"How Puma put its foot in it with a campaign to sell trainers | Rebecca Nicholson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/puma-put-its-foot-in-it-with-campaign-to-sell-trainers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/15/puma-put-its-foot-in-it-with-campaign-to-sell-trainers","fields":{"headline":"How Puma put its foot in it with a campaign to sell trainers","bodyText":"Without the brilliantly furious open letter that social worker Amber Gilbert Coutts posted on Instagram, Puma’s “House of Hustle” party might have simply faded into one of any number of similar nights. The promotional event, thrown in partnership with JD Sports and marketing agency Urban Nerds, took place in Soho, central London, last week and has been widely criticised not only for glamorising drug dealing, but for crude class tourism too. “It is sadly nothing new for sports brands such as yourselves to attach your logo to the lived experiences of prominently working-class people of colour,” wrote Gilbert Coutts, pointing out that, among the event’s many flaws, the increase in violent crime in the capital this year made its choice of “theme” particularly outrageous. According to Dazed magazine, invitees to the House of Hustle were sent a Puma shoebox filled with fake £50 notes and a business card that instructed them to “turn on the trap line” – a burner phone that, when switched on, came with the message: “Yo G what u sayin today? Pass tru the House of Hustle.” The party had “blacked-out windows and dirty mattresses strewn on the floor”, said the report, because nothing says “buy some trainers” like addiction, misery and squalor. Puma eventually issued a statement saying any connotations of illegal activity were unintentional. “We never intended associations with drug usage, drug culture or drug dealing in any way and we regret any misunderstandings in this respect,” it read, apologising for any offence caused, though strangely leaving out an explanation of the legal activities those burner phones were supposed to be emulating. Brands co-opting youth culture is as old as time, but doing so in such a crass way is quite an achievement and may be one of the worst promotional moves since Pepsi tried to fix institutional racism with a Kardashian and a fizzy drink. • Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/apr/13/scooter-libby-trump-pardons-cheney-aide-convicted-of-lying-to-fbi","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T20:21:43Z","webTitle":"Scooter Libby: Trump pardons former Cheney aide convicted of lying to FBI","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/13/scooter-libby-trump-pardons-cheney-aide-convicted-of-lying-to-fbi","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/apr/13/scooter-libby-trump-pardons-cheney-aide-convicted-of-lying-to-fbi","fields":{"headline":"Scooter Libby: Trump pardons former Cheney aide convicted of lying to FBI","bodyText":"Donald Trump has issued a full pardon to I Lewis “Scooter” Libby, the former chief of staff to vice-president Dick Cheney under George W Bush. Libby was convicted in 2007 of obstruction of justice and perjury, in connection with an investigation into the leak of the identity of a CIA agent, Valerie Plame. His conviction was the result of an investigation by the special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald, who was appointed by the then deputy attorney general, James Comey. President Bush commuted Libby’s sentence, sparing him jail time but leaving him a convicted felon who had to pay a fine and do community service. Trump’s pardon totally expunges the conviction. In a statement, the president said: “I don’t know Mr Libby but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.” The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters: “The president thought it was the right thing to do.” A spokesman for Bush said: “President Bush is very pleased for Scooter and his family.” Sign up to receive the top US stories every morning In his own statement, Libby said: “My family and I are immensely grateful to President Trump for his gracious decision to grant a pardon. For over a dozen years we have suffered under the weight of a terrible injustice.” Plame, whose identity was made public after her husband, Joseph Wilson, wrote an op-ed critical of part of the Bush administration’s justification for the Iraq war, said it was “simply false” that Libby had been treated unfairly. She added: “If a person does not tell the truth, particularly if he serves in government and holds the public trust, he must be held accountable. President Trump’s pardon is not based on the truth.” Recent reports that a Trump lawyer inquired about pardoning power prompted controversy in Washington. The inquiries were reportedly made in relation to the former Trump aides Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, the former having pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and the latter having pleaded not guilty on financial charges arising from the Mueller investigation into Russian election interference. Trump has reportedly considered firing Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed after Comey was fired as FBI director last May. Talking to reporters on the way into the White House on Friday morning, Trump’s adviser Kellyanne Conway said: “Many people think that Scooter Libby was a victim of a special counsel gone amok.” In a statement, the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, said: “President Trump’s pardon of Scooter Libby makes clear his contempt for the rule of law. “This pardon sends a troubling signal to the president’s allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded. The suggestion that those who lie under oath may be rewarded with pardons poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy.” A White House statement said: “Before his conviction, Mr Libby had rendered more than a decade of honorable service to the nation as a public servant at the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the White House. His record since his conviction is similarly unblemished, and he continues to be held in high regard by his colleagues and peers.” Libby said: “Many good and noble Americans have told me that, having seen how I was treated, they would never go into public service. No one understands their misgivings more than I do. Perhaps one day public service in America will prove less of a blood sport. Until then, we are all fortunate that there are those who will enter the arena for their love of our country and our freedoms.” Libby is the third person pardoned by Trump. He has pardoned former sheriff Joe Arpaio, a Trump supporter convicted for violating a federal court order to stop racial profiling against Latinos, and Kristian Saucier, a sailor who took photos in a classified area of a submarine. Saucier’s case was often compared by Trump and other Republicans to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. Libby’s case is discussed in A Higher Loyalty, the book by Comey which was obtained by the Guardian and other outlets on Thursday ahead of publication next week. The book prompted an angry Twitter outburst from Trump in which he called Comey “a proven LEAKER &amp; LIAR” and “an untruthful slime ball”. Comey writes that the Libby case was “one of my early experiences in Washington of people deciding motivations based on their partisan allegiance. To Democrats, it was obvious members of a Republican administration were subverting justice to undermine and punish their critics. To Republicans, it was just as obvious that this was a witch-hunt against people who made an inconsequential mistake.” On Friday, there was disagreement within Bush-era Republican circles. Liz Cheney, the former vice-president’s daughter and now a US representative for Wyoming, wrote on Twitter: “Scooter Libby is a good, honorable and innocent man who was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct and a miscarriage of justice. Thank you [Donald Trump] for righting a terrible wrong and delivering the full pardon Scooter deserved.” But Matthew Dowd, an ABC political analyst who was chief strategist on Bush’s re-election campaign in 2004, wrote: “This pardon of Scooter Libby is simply outrageous. “I worked for President Bush from 1999 to 2005, and Scooter is a felon whom President Bush would not even pardon. He was convicted of obstruction of justice, lying, and perjury. This is a dark day for the rule of law in America.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/21/made-in-fishbourne-kate-mosse","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-21T09:00:09Z","webTitle":"Kate Mosse on Fishbourne: ‘This place helped make me the writer I am today'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/21/made-in-fishbourne-kate-mosse","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/21/made-in-fishbourne-kate-mosse","fields":{"headline":"Kate Mosse on Fishbourne: ‘This place helped make me the writer I am today'","bodyText":"There’s a certain quality of light on autumn afternoons on the Fishbourne Marshes that speaks of childhood and the past. It tugs at the heartstrings and prompts memories of other chill October days. The sour scent of stubble burning in the farmers’ fields, the vastness of the blue Sussex sky over the Downs, the whispering of the reed beds as the tide comes in, setting the stalks rattling. A gull might wheel and cry, an oystercatcher might leave its spiky prints in the black mud by the burnt-out remains of Farhill’s Mill. From where I am now standing, on the Bosham side of the creek, I can follow the line of the old sea wall down to Apuldram and Dell Quay, where dinghies and little boats bob in the current. I can catch a glimpse of the old flint-faced church of St Peter &amp; St Mary in the fields framed by yew and poplar and willow trees. My sisters were married in that church, summer brides both. Ancient pilgrims’ marks are scratched into the north wall, crude yet somehow touching marks of devotion. They mean something. Beyond, on the horizon, the spire of Chichester Cathedral soars and boasts of the bustle of the town. I was made here, this small village to the west of Chichester known, mostly, for its Roman palace. In those days, there was a general store and a post office, three public houses, – ‘The Woolpack’ and ‘The Bull’s Head’ are still going, but ‘The Black Boy’ is long since converted to housing – a primary school and a railway halt. I caught the bus or cycled if the weather was good. I played Pooh sticks with my sisters at the millpond, fed the ducks and attended the local Guides on a Monday evening. And, yes, the Marshes. In the 1960s, I explored with my parents, climbing into the branches of the stunted oak trees down by the water where a scuttled rowing boat rotted slowly. In the 70s, the teenage years, I wandered with a copy of Wuthering Heights in the hope that someone would admire such solitude. I wasn’t thinking of writing but, with hindsight, I can see that my reading was filled with novels of shifting and dominating landscape, of place. Books that belong absolutely to the place in which they are set, the time in which they are set. And although we are all guilty of rewriting the past through the prism of the present – rearranging the emotions, the facts, to suit the narrative we wish to tell about ourselves – I can see that this childhood, in that place, helped make me the writer I was to become. It’s just that I had to go away to do it. In 1989, we bought a tiny house in the shadow of the medieval city walls of Carcassonne in southwest France. I fell utterly and head-over-heels in love with the history, with the spirit of place, with the endless Midi sky and the garrigue, the fierce Tramontana wind and the red tiled rooves of Languedoc. Sunflowers and lavender and vines. Standing on the pont vieux, which connects the medieval city on the hill to the fourteenth century Bastide on the other bank of the Aude, little by little a story – that was to become my first historical novel, Labyrinth - started to take shape. Because in Carcassonne, I had no personal history or connection. I wasn’t somebody’s daughter or sister or schoolfriend, the wonderful ties of community and family didn’t reach this far south. In Carcassonne, I was free to be a writer. It took years before I could bring those skills home and write about Sussex – home home – rather than my adopted home. Now, after a few years of not being able to write full time, I’m embarked on a sequence of novels inspired again by French history – a new series of love letters to Carcassonne. The story of two families – one Huguenot, one Catholic – three hundred years of conflict, betrayal and intrigue set against the backdrop of the Wars of Religion. But although the series begins in Carcassonne – and will end in Franschhoek in 1862, by way of Paris, London and Amsterdam – I planned much of The Burning Chambers walking on the Marshes in Fishbourne, where memory, inspiration and imagination collide. Echoes in the landscape. • The Burning Chambers will be published by Mantle in May 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/apr/15/joys-of-spring-ideas-to-inspire","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:59:06Z","webTitle":"Finally, the joys of spring: from wildlife to blockbusters, ideas to inspire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/15/joys-of-spring-ideas-to-inspire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/15/joys-of-spring-ideas-to-inspire","fields":{"headline":"Finally, the joys of spring: from wildlife to blockbusters, ideas to inspire","bodyText":"THE COUNTRYSIDE Patrick Barkham Does spring begin for you with a carpet of bluebells? The jinking flight of an orange-tip butterfly? Or the first swift screaming in the sky? There are many ways we can join this joyous explosion of life among the species witth which we share the world. Spring may be late, but bluebells are unfurling across the nation. Wildlife charities provide plenty of ideas about where they can be spotted: National Trust suggestions include Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire and Winkworth Arboretum, Surrey; Woodland Trust recommendations include Crinan Wood, Argyll and Bute, and Coed Aber Artro, Llanbedr, Harlech; while the Wildlife Trusts have 100 hotspots from the splendidly named Twentywellsick Wood in Yorkshire to Sydenham Hill Wood in south London. My favourites include Finemere Wood, Buckinghamshire, Lady’s Wood, Cambridgeshire and Foxley Wood, Norfolk. Spring butterflies are on the wing again, and late April to early May is the perfect time to spot two of our rarest species. The Duke of Burgundy flies on downland in the Cotswolds and Hampshire, such as Rodborough Common and Noar Hill, while the pearl-bordered fritillary enjoys sunny woodland rides in western Scotland and south-west England – ukbutterflies.co.uk has great location information. You can hear glorious birdsong wherever you live. Your local Wildlife Trust will organise dawn-chorus walks, but you can do your own: rising at 5am is painful but you never regret an early morning orchestra of blackbirds and blackcaps. Don’t overlook the joys of dusk either. April is ideal for watching badgers before vegetation obscures their setts: position yourself downwind of a sett an hour before sunset, scatter a few peanuts, and wait quietly. You’ll see owls and bats, too. BCN Wildlife Trust organises bat punt safaris on the River Cam in Cambridge: 90-minute trips every Friday from 11 May. Warwickshire Wildlife Trust has a bat walk at Brandon Marsh on 10 May; the Royal Parks and the Bat Conservation Trust have details of more bat walks.

Chalkup21 is a new 17-mile architecture trail along the top of the white cliffs between Folkestone and Deal, Kent, which highlights contemporary buildings en route, such as the Battle of Britain Memorial building at Capel-le-Ferne and the timber and glass cafe at the end of Deal pier. If the change in temperature puts you in the festival mood, what could be more spring-like than one that celebrates cherry blossom? In Japan the arrival of the flowers is greeted with almost religious fervour. One of the best displays in the UK can be found at Brogdale farm in Kent. The home of the national fruit collection will be offering Hanami picnics until the end of April (booking essential) and a Japanese-inspired festival on 21 April with cultural demonstrations and food . For a more formal floral display, the Harrogate spring flower show is one of the first big events in the gardening calendar – at the Great Yorkshire Showground from 26-29 April, with show gardens, floral displays and talks and demonstrations. In Scotland the Celtic May Day festival of Beltane is celebrated with bonfires, torchlit processions, drumming and the arrival of the May queen on Calton Hill, Edinburgh, on 30 April. And in Wales you can witness the end of the lambing season at the RSPB Lake Vyrnwy organic farm in Powys. Tours of the lambing sheds will be available at weekends until the end of April (but booking is essential). For a magical experience, why not try one of the singing with nightingales events in Cambridgeshire, Essex and Kent throughout April and May? Organised by singer Sam Lee of the Nest Collective, these are intimate woodland concerts held around a camp fire. If you’re lucky, the musicians will be accompanied by the sound of nightingales singing, and you will be able to celebrate this very African bird that takes its summers in England THE GARDEN Allan Jenkins I almost hesitate to say the frost has gone (I was mugged in March after I’d sown early salad seed), but it is probably safe to say that you can start spring gardening now. So go to your local garden centre. Stock up on fresh compost and seaweed feed and a few early summer flowers. Open your shed or seed drawer; sharpen your tools. It’s been purgatory this year, frogspawn frozen, broad beans blackened by frost. But gardens are forgiving; almost everything can be fixed in an afternoon. First, have a look at the flower seed sites. Roger Parsons for scented sweet peas, Higgledy Garden for colourful annuals (calendula, cornflowers and cosmos), Sarah Raven for something posh. Scatter grass seed in places where yours has worn thin. If you have room for vegetables, I rate Brown Envelope Seeds for organic and unusual varieties (why grow the same salads that are cheap and available in every supermarket?). Franchi are good for anything Italian such as basil, chards, chicories, courgettes and borlotti beans. Tamar also has a good range. The old gardener’s rule says that soil is warm enough to germinate if it’s comfortable to sit on in thin shorts. I just tend to see if the weeds are growing well. You will need to dig, or at least to hoe. Turn in compost if you can: well-rotted manure is best of all (cow for vegetables, horse for flowers, if you can find it). I know it is supposed to be warm this week but I would caution against sowing most flowers outdoors till May. That said, I’ve scattered nasturtiums and calendula. Start annual seeds off in trays and pots on a windowsill. Same with tomatoes. If you have room, sow a few rows of radishes, rocket and lettuce. If you haven’t, stock a kitchen window box with rosemary, thyme, chives and oregano. Remember to find yourself a spot in the sun to sit and talk, have a cup of tea, a beer or a glass of wine. Gardening isn’t just about flowers and food, it’s also therapy and fun.

Elsewhere, the only acceptable hat is a beret (think Dior, buy Topshop) and while you should slough off your coat, do keep a light jacket, ideally a trench, worn open (Céline), in checks (Burberry) or in lilac (Dries Van Noten). Men, try a short jacket as seen at Sandro but available at Cos, or a brightly coloured raincoat – anything from Vetements to Patagonia is fine. Spring 2018 is also about the nuance of colour. Muted ice cream shades such as lemon sorbet and strawberry are in abundance everywhere, from Victoria Beckham to Cos on both men and women, although neons are also appearing on the high street (particularly on T-shirts at Topshop and &amp; Other Stories). Men should try the trend via a brightly printed shirt – Aloha versions were at Balenciaga and Ami, but really any foliage will do. Spring suits for women are a good weatherproof addition. Matching, of course, in light pink or stripes. And frankly, on men too. Take inspiration (honestly) from Harry Styles’s Gucci and Palomo Spain tour outfits. When it comes to shoes, women wear them with a low heel (spiky like Balenciaga or square like Topshop), and men can do anything (a loafer, a chunky boot or a trainer works). Definitely wear socks. In other trend news, streetwear continues to dominate the catwalk at Fendi and Burberry and everything in between. If a full Adidas tracksuit feels a bit much, start sensibly with footwear. Veja trainers are becoming the updated answer to Stan Smiths for women, but equally the much-derided ugly trainer – from Balenciaga’s Triple S to Fila’s chunky platform trainer – is all over the shops. Ideal if the weather turns damp again, which is highly likely.

In May the Barbican will partner with the Museum of London for London Nights, a major photography exhibition and film season celebrating the capital city after dark. The British Film Institute, meanwhile, marks the 30th anniversary of the anime classic Akira. On stage, Alfred Molina discovers his artistic side in John Logan’s Red (Wyndham’s Theatre from 4 May); Ben Chaplin stars in Joe Penhall’s Mood Music (the Old Vic from 21 April); Maxine Peake tackles Samuel Beckett’s Happy Days at Manchester’s Royal Exchange Theatre (from 25 May) and Michelle Terry takes on the role of Hamlet in her first production since becoming artistic director of the Globe (from 25 April). The movie blockbuster season will see Avengers: Infinity War and Solo: A Star Wars Story in cinemas this month. Those looking for a more understated experience should try Beast, Michael Pearce’s atmospheric crime debut, set in Jersey; Claire Denis’s sophisticated delight Let the Sunshine In and Lean on Pete, Andrew Haigh’s stirring take on “one boy and his horse” tales.

Meal for two, including drinks and service, £80-£120 There’s a glossy kind of over-engineered food television which, whatever its other virtues, provides a brilliant workout for my throwing arm. It’s the cooking demo stuff, narrated by a restaurant chef who insists upon peppering every stage of the process with the word “simply”. Now “simply bone out the entire chicken” or “simply make a brioche dough” or “simply carve a representation of the fall of Saigon out of chilled dripping as a table centrepiece”. While it would be unfair to name the guilty (Gary Rhodes, I’m looking at you for starters), I’m not ashamed to admit it has me reaching for the nearest piece of soft fruit. My aim is getting pretty good. One of the greatest lies ever told by our food media is that all cooking is easy or simple or straightforward. It isn’t. A lot of it is complicated and frustrating and unreliable and, like an outbreak of bantz between Jeremy Clarkson and Piers Morgan, extremely irritating. It takes practice, larded with enough greed to encourage you to press on however often you screw up. You fail, then do it again in the hope that next time, you will fail better. Forget your boudins and your soufflés, your hand-raised pies and boned-out pigs’ trotters. That sort of show cooking may be tough, but trickier still is the seemingly effortless; the edible equivalent of, say, Anthony Hopkins’s performance in The Remains of the Day. For most of the movie Hopkins appears to do nothing. He says little, reacts sparely. But his face tells you all you need to know. Tomos Parry’s cooking at Brat is the culinary equivalent of a Hopkins performance. For the most part it is simplicity itself. Some of it seems to be less cooking than assemblage. And then you eat. Take a dish entitled “chopped egg salad with bottarga”. It’s a thick slice of still-warm toast topped with a crushed mess of an egg, also just still warm, the yolk languidly fixed between solid and soft, overlaid with shavings of cured and dried grey mullet roe. The cosy nursery softness of the egg is punctuated by the salty, grown-up hit of the bottarga. I found myself wondering drowsily about going home and smearing toast with the anchovy-boosted fireworks of Gentleman’s Relish, then pelting it with soft boiled eggs. What larks. Which is how this kind of cooking deceives you. It looks so simple. Surely, it’s more an idea than a recipe. But I suspect that if you went home and tried it yourself, it would be a massive disappointment and the evening would end badly. Parry knows exactly what he’s doing. You’re paying him just £5 to do it. That’s a good deal. Don’t complain. Let him. I first tried Parry’s food at Kitty Fisher’s in Mayfair, which for a while was the restaurant everyone talked about in eye-rolling, hushed tones. I was meant to feel clever just for getting through the door, but the meal I had didn’t quite do it for me. It seemed little more than solid bistro cooking at gold-plated Mayfair, “I have a three o’clock colonic” prices. And yet here, in this clubbable wood-lined first-floor space in Shoreditch (above the latest incarnation of Thai barbecue place, Smoking Goat), it’s a revelation. By the door is the open kitchen, dominated by the sparking embers of the burning coals, because in 2018, every cook worth their hand-mined salt wants to cook like an 18th-century hearth jockey. Who needs gas or electricity when you can singe your eyebrows nightly? The restaurant is supposed to celebrate Parry’s Welsh heritage by way of the open-fire cooking of the Basque country. To complicate things even more, Brat is apparently an old English term for turbot, one of the star ingredients on a short list of major grillable items. Whatevers! And so on. I’m meant to be interested in Welsh heritage and Basque peasant culture, but all I care about is the end result. Here, the end result is a blistered and golden grilled fish. The night we are there, every other table seems to have ordered a whole turbot. It is brought to us by one of the brigade who cheerily points out some of the not-to-be-missed sights, as if it were less a food item than a city mini-break: here are the plump cheeks, over there the rich, oily flesh around the collar, and don’t miss out the pristine fillets. The smaller turbot costs a gulp-inducing £55. Then you start working your way through its flesh and realise there is enough here for three (£65 gets you a bigger fish; find some friends). It is slow-cooked over indirect heat for half an hour and spritzed with vinegar from time to time. The result is a soft, lightly sticky skin that seems to melt on the tongue, and pearly flesh. Alongside is a simply dressed salad of sweet, taut-skinned tomatoes, plus buttery “smoked” new potatoes which have been allowed to slump in on themselves over the fire. This is the pinnacle of a meal with many high points. Before its arrival, we have cockles served in the shell in a light broth thickened with chicken livers. Two discs of a butch wild rabbit boudin come with another of spiced black pudding, on a stew of white beans, with a dribble of salsa verde. An option listed as spider crab, cabbage and fennel leaves me a little breathless. The brown meat has been smeared across the bottom of the plate. Sliced fennel has been slow-cooked then allowed to cool before being mixed with the crab. The cabbage seems to come in the form of the “crispy seaweed” served in Chinese restaurants, the green flecks lending an Asian touch to what is a perfect example of simplicity executed with indecent amounts of skill and good taste. There is lemon tart or baked cheesecake to finish, which is a pleasing change from the “will this do?” of creamy things in a bowl. Both are models of their kind. Happily, the wine list follows Nuala’s lead from a few weeks back by being broken down into categories from unthreatening through classics to fearsome and gnarly. Is it cheap? No. Is it good value? At £6.50 for the cockle dish and £9.50 for the spider crab, yes. Of course, it’s achingly Shoreditch and so staunchly Now, which is enough to put most people’s backs up. But all that fashion blather doesn’t change a thing. The food at Brat is both seemingly effortless and utterly lovely. Jay’s news bites On a quick trip to Paris I stumbled on the brilliant Semilla on the Left Bank’s Rue de Seine, an airy space with a light menu which at lunchtime breaks down to a non-meat, fish and meat choice at €40 (£35)for three courses. It might be a lightly dressed tartar of bream to start, followed by slow-cooked belly pork, and a mandarin sorbet with meringue to finish (semillaparis.com). A company called Tile Acoustics, which normally installs noise-reducing acoustic panels in offices, has just been employed by Aldo’s, an Italian restaurant in Bradford. The new ceiling tiles, designed to match the restaurant’s décor, have apparently reduced noise reverberation by over 50%. Could other hard-surfaced restaurants please take note (tileacoustics.co.uk). An (admittedly small) study by the umbrella organisation Champions 12.3 has found that hotels which invest in food waste reduction measures are saving £7 for every £1 spent on the process, and 95% recoup their entire investment within two years (champions123.org).

Edward Heath, then Conservative leader, sacked him at once as shadow defence minister; four colleagues had warned they would otherwise resign. One newspaper described his words as “evil”. This was a speech of real and malign import and the BBC is right to analyse its impact, as it will do in a Radio 4 programme on Saturday. It was and is a serious matter, deserving serious attention. It is even more relevant as the 70th anniversary of the Windrush generation’s arrival, upon invitation, approaches; and as long-term residents from the Commonwealth, Britons in all but paperwork, face deportation in a “hostile environment” for migrants that began with populist rhetoric and is now official policy. But to promote the show by boasting that Powell’s speech will be read in full on radio for the first time “EVER”, by a well-known actor, is not only crass but damaging. This is what the presenter and BBC media editor Amol Rajan did in a tweet. Whether the address should be aired in its entirety is questionable, even if it is broken up and critiqued. The show purports to examine its historic effect, yet perversely will give it a much larger audience than it had at the time, when only extracts were broadcast. Listeners will judge the merits of the programme for themselves. But treating such a sensitive and important matter as if it were a titillating showbiz exclusive is wrong, and dangerous. It trivialises the very real damage Powell wreaked, and contributes to ongoing attempts to rehabilitate him. Sympathisers portray him as too clever, too scholarly, too polyglot to be racist and claim his speech was purely about immigration. That is absurd. He was attacking the race relations bill; he spoke of “grinning piccaninnies” and quoted the prediction that “the black man will have the whip hand over the white man”. He warned of the “growth of the immigrant-descended population” and, most notoriously, looked ahead “with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see ‘the River Tiber foaming with much blood’”. History has, broadly, proved him wrong; there has been no race war. But blood flowed from black and Asian families in the wake of his words and, as dockers and meat porters marched in his support, many more households packed suitcases just in case. And half a century on, some still heed him. Nigel Farage has said that the “basic principle” on immigration was right. Jenny Bourne of the Institute of Race Relations has outlined the ways in which Powell’s rhetoric fixed arguments to this day: integration (by which he means assimilation) is impossible; its failure will lead to race hatred; immigration was a grand conspiracy; the only answer is reducing numbers. Most striking is the cult of victimhood, portraying the white majority as a persecuted minority, warning that immigrants “seek domination” and the voter must not be “denied his right to discriminate”. The persistence of these ideas is what makes the note of self-congratulation in promoting the programme so ill-judged. The tone is one of daring in breaking a taboo. But if many have moved on in their views and others are more cautious in their wording, the sentiments are still shared and expressed too widely. In 2016/17, the police recorded more than 80,000 hate crimes: an increase of almost 30% year on year, ascribed to a genuine rise in such offences as well as improved recording. Powell’s contemporaries recognised how dangerous his speech was, and took a stand. That commitment must be renewed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/14/support-second-mortgage-interest-benefit-complaints","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T23:35:21Z","webTitle":"Government urged to postpone  ‘second mortgage’ scheme","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/14/support-second-mortgage-interest-benefit-complaints","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/14/support-second-mortgage-interest-benefit-complaints","fields":{"headline":"Government urged to postpone  ‘second mortgage’ scheme","bodyText":"The government has been urged to stall controversial benefit changes which came into effect in the new tax year, amid claims they unfairly penalise the most vulnerable in society. On 6 April, a “second mortgage” system replaced the Support for Mortgage Interest (SMI), which helped financially constrained homeowners with their mortgage payments. From this month, it will no longer be paid as a free benefit but, instead, the government is offering to loan people the money, which will have to be repaid later with interest. The move attracted anger from a number of recipients of the benefit who said they had not been properly informed of the move. Now mutual insurer Royal London, which has been a consistent critic of the measure, is calling for the changes to be postponed to give those affected more time to absorb them. In a letter to the 10 biggest mortgage lenders, Royal London policy director Steve Webb says many people who received the benefit are at risk of falling behind in their mortgage repayments. The benefit cost the state £205m a year, and was credited with saving some people from losing their homes. Critics said it was not the role of the taxpayer to subsidise other people’s mortgages. In the letter to lenders, shown to the Observer, Webb says there was concern over how people were told about the scheme and how many claimants were engaging. “Figures issued by the DWP showed that with just two weeks to go before the change was introduced, only 13,000 out of 90,000 SMI claimants had indicated they would accept the loan. “The DWP had also only managed to successfully contact 54,000 by phone,” says the letter, which aims to gauge what measures lenders have in place to deal with those who fall behind with payments. “We have been contacted by several people affected by these changes. They outline a process where communications are not received, telephone calls not returned, and there is a lack of support to help explore their options. “Claimants have been left distressed and confused about their situation with some believing their only option is to sell their home. “We think this is an unacceptable way to treat some of the most vulnerable people in society and have called on government to delay the changes and offer more support to help claimants come to an informed decision.” Under the new system, the DWP will continue to make the payments to the mortgage lender, but interest will be added every month to the total owed. The longer the loan is in place, the more the recipient will have to pay back. However, the mortgage holder does not have to do so until the property is sold, or transferred to someone else, although they can make voluntary repayments. A spokesperson for the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) says: “Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back. People who sign up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest and it is only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold. “If people decide to decline the loan now, but change their mind in future, the loan can be backdated so, in effect, there would be no break in payments. We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"music/2018/apr/22/kimbra-primal-heart-review-banker-but-a-bit-bloodless","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-22T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"Kimbra: Primal Heart review – lacking in blood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/22/kimbra-primal-heart-review-banker-but-a-bit-bloodless","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/apr/22/kimbra-primal-heart-review-banker-but-a-bit-bloodless","fields":{"headline":"Kimbra: Primal Heart review – lacking in blood","bodyText":"Still known chiefly for her part on Gotye’s 2011 hit, Somebody That I Used to Know, New Zealand pop outlier Kimbra is now on her third album of idiosyncratic pop.

Now, in the wake of #MeToo, there’s Everybody Knows – an oblique electronic pop tune about broken boundaries. “I was young and gullible,” sings Kimbra, “but baby I grew.” A Tumblr post specifies the everyday sexism she encounters as a musician (she plays guitar, keys and electronics; like Sia, she also writes for other artists). Just as arresting is Top of the World, which finds the singer virtually rapping, recalling former tourmate Janelle Monáe.

Its 12 linked tales of the city are fine-grained to the point of mundanity – finding an apartment, discovering a leak, visiting a park – but in Tsushima’s hands they achieve a deceptive, luminous clarity. The territory of the title is a flat “with an unusual layout in a dilapidated office building ... on a three-way intersection” – an unpromising but much-treasured first room of one’s own: “The two-mat bedroom was as small as a linen cupboard, and I felt at home.” Tsushima is honest about her narrator’s difficulties: she boozes, leaves the chores undone and hurls “vile abuse” at her two-year-old daughter when woken in the night.

The UK Statistics Authority asked Raab, a leading Brexiter, to publish the evidence for his claim. A document published on Friday by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government shows that the finding was based on an out-of-date model that had never been intended for this kind of analysis. Raab defended his use of the model, which estimates the impact of population growth, inflation, interest rates, housing stock and wage growth on house prices. He said he had been asked specifically about the impact of immigration. “I did indeed say care was needed with the data, and I was right that immigration put average prices up by 20%. We need a balanced approach.” The research was conducted using an affordability model described a decade ago in reports by the long-defunct National Housing and Planning Advice Unit. It shows that between 1991 and 2016, the population of England grew from 47.1 million to 54.5 million; the number of non-UK-born residents grew from 3.5 million to 8.4 million over the same period. But population was one of many factors that had a bearing on house prices. The impact of immigrant households is only a small part of the total. Real income growth, for example, would have pushed up prices by 150%, according to the analysis. The ministry insisted the information used by Raab was an accurate representation of the research. Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London, said it was a reasonable number to try to make a rough estimate, but the evidence on which Raab’s claim was based was so flimsy it could not be described as research. “The publication is of a standard that I am shocked that [the ministry] would publish. They’ve basically taken an out-of-date model ... it is a very crude back-of-the-envelope approach. It would nonetheless be acceptable to use it for a rough estimate of the impact of an extra 100,000 immigrants next year. What you cannot do is apply that to immigration over 25 years.” John Healey, Labour’s housing spokesperson, said: “The evidence is clear that immigration is not the major driver of rising housing prices. “Rather than try to blame others for unaffordable housing costs, Dominic Raab should look at the decisions Conservative ministers have made since 2010. Deep cuts to housing investment have halved the number of new low-cost homes for first-time buyers and driven the number of new social rented homes being built to a record low.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/apr/18/top-of-the-pots-the-smashing-rise-of-ceramics","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-18T05:00:16Z","webTitle":"Top of the pots: the smashing rise of ceramics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/18/top-of-the-pots-the-smashing-rise-of-ceramics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/apr/18/top-of-the-pots-the-smashing-rise-of-ceramics","fields":{"headline":"Top of the pots: the smashing rise of ceramics","bodyText":"Its elegant shape was inspired by ancient Aegean figures and its pleasingly mottled surface made it feel like it had just been dug up from the ground. Yet when it was first sold in the 1970s, this understated vase by the late British potter Hans Coper changed hands for just £250. An unloved present, the creation was then kept in an old shoebox by its recipient, who finally decided to offload it last month – and was stunned to see its price soar to £381,000 at auction, a figure you might expect for certain Ming dynasty or Picasso vessels. The world of ceramics was stunned too, but not as much as it might once have been. While it’s true that Coper is a key figure in British studio pottery, with works in London’s V&amp;A and New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, what this whopping sum – more than double the previous record for a Coper – really reflects is the fact that ceramic art is currently experiencing something of a boom. Last month’s Ceramic Art London was oversubscribed like never before, with a queue of pottery nuts snaking around Central St Martins College, impatient to bag top contemporary pieces while they could still afford them (prices ranged from £30 to £10,000). The previous weekend, the Barbican’s conservatory was transformed into another ceramics fair, this time showcasing 60 artists from the Turning Earth collective’s two London studios. Many of these makers got their starts through taking classes there, while similar urban ceramic-making communities that pool resources and share kilns are flourishing across the country, including Glasgow Ceramics Studio and Clay Studio Manchester. In Cambridge, meanwhile, the Fitzwilliam Museum is celebrating a “spring of ceramics” with two simultaneous shows. The larger one, called Things of Beauty Growing, is a major survey of British studio pottery – a first for the museum, which is responding to what co-curator Helen Ritchie refers to as “a steady rise of interest” in the museum’s 20th and 21st-century ceramics stash. The show combines influential antiques from China, Korea and Japan with the work of 20th and 21st-century potters. These range from Bernard Leach (whose famous pottery lives on in St Ives), Coper and his teacher Lucie Rie (who both settled in Britain after fleeing the Nazis), through to Kenyan-born Magdalene Odundo (incoming chancellor of the University for the Creative Arts) and Edmund de Waal, best known for his installations of shelves of pale and delicate porcelain vessels, sometimes huddled in conspiratorial groups. “There’s been a lot of chat,” says Ritchie of the strapline for the show: “British Studio Pottery. Where does it begin and when does it become art?” Some of the makers, she says, like to be known as potters while others prefer the term ceramic artist. “It’s partly a generational thing,” she says, mentioning Grayson Perry, who also has a vase in the show and who came up through art school rather than a pottery studio. “More people now just prefer to be called an artist – and clay is their chosen medium. Whereas Bernard Leach, often known as the father of British studio pottery, is very much in the potter camp.” Halima Cassell, who was born in Pakistan in 1975 and grew up in Manchester, is among the younger artists in the show. Her installation Virtues of Unity comprises a row of exquisitely carved (as opposed to thrown) bowls, each made with clay from a different place, lined up in order of colour like a tea-strength chart, from the palest cream to the darkest brown. The ongoing project, she says, “is to do with my own identity, growing up in Manchester and the various comments you get, like ‘foreigner’.” In 2009 she returned to her “own country” for university residencies in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad. “I expected to be treated like a homecomer, but I was always introduced by the university staff as ‘a foreigner from England’. It got me thinking about where we belong. You think about the migration of people over thousands of years, and really we’re all the same. We’re made from the same material, we’re from the earth and we go back to back the earth.” Recent exciting ceramics acquisitions for the museum, says Ritchie, include work from Alison Britton, famous for her colourful interpretations of traditional pottery vessels, and “a very hot artist” called Jesse Wine, who is based in New York but was born in Chester. “He makes this fabulous sculptural work,” says Ritchie, which ranges from vast organic earthy abstracts to glossily glazed renditions of his bowl of pasta, Sports Direct mugs with a snail idling between them and the Adidas sliders he wears to potter about in the studio. One reason why ceramics feels quite “buzzy at the moment”, she says, “is that we are seeing younger collectors. That idea of spending more on something and buying less is spreading. You do see people spending on something handmade that they really love rather than buying something mass-produced or disposable.” And there’s a simple human joy in feeling a connection to the maker through a tactile 3D object. “When it’s made with the hands, you can hold it or imagine holding it, or use it, and your hands are where their hands were. People really love that directness. And they love knowing how things are made – we get asked that all the time. People are interested in technique, materials and process.” In fact, more people are getting involved in making themselves, says Toby Brundin, director of Ceramic Art London. The urge to take up pottery, he says, goes hand in hand with the recent boom in knitting, sourdough bread-baking and craft beer brewing. “It’s all connected. If you pick up a pot – which is shorthand for any ceramic object – a lot of it’s about texture and there’s no way to digitise it. There are no shortcuts in the making. If you lose concentration, you’re screwed. It’s so rudely analogue that it’s an antidote to the analytical, screen-based way that most of us spend our working, and a big chunk of our non-working, lives. People are craving physical experience.” There was also the BBC2 game show, The Great Pottery Throw Down, which ran between 2015 and 2017. Filmed at Middleport Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent, it saw members of the public compete to make the best pots, in the mould of The Great British Bake Off. “I think Throw Down definitely drew attention but I also suspect the programme was commissioned in response to the rising popularity of ceramics,” Brundin says. “So while it definitely helped the growth of the craft, it was also a response to it rather than the cause of it.” Some ceramic artists have become role models for an alternative way of life, such as Adam Buick, who has a few pieces in the Fitzwilliam show. “He makes only moon jars,” says Brundin, referring to traditional spherical vessels. “He lives on the Pembrokeshire coast, surfs every morning at six, digs his own clay out of the earth.” Sometimes he leaves a pleasing bowl impression in the ground, as is documented on his Instagram feed. “Instagram is a key driver for the younger generation of makers,” says Brundin. “It’s changing the way they sell.” The American potter Eric Landon, of Tortus studio in Copenhagen, is as close to a rock star as a potter could get, touring the world and posting to his 786,000 Instagram followers videos of himself with tanned, muscly arms effortlessly manipulating wobbly wet clay, or a selfie with Susan Sarandon at one of his workshops. Fashion and textiles illustrator-turned-potter John Booth says he gets a kick out of selling directly through Instagram rather than through galleries. New to the medium, he started an evening class at Turning Earth in 2015 and his first edition of 50 painted plates sold out in two days. Previously best known for designing prints for fashion house Fendi, he now funds his studio with his bright, crude vases. “It’s such a simple process and there’s a roughness to them – they’re for using,” he says of the works, built from slabs of clay, with faces painted on. Booth is currently co-designing “a ceramic side table that you can put your ceramic pot on”, along with bed linen and soft furnishings. “It takes me away from that uncomfortable feeling that art should be elitist, or conceptual. People aren’t scared of my work. It’s a fun decorative or functional object.” Not surprisingly, such fashion figures as Simone Rocha and Silvia Fendi are fans of Booth’s pots. And, with ceramics’ roots in craft, they’re not the only designers who are ambassadors for the medium. Jonathan Anderson, the Irish creative director of Spanish luxury house Loewe, has admitted to making personal budget cuts to facilitate his Bernard Leach pottery collection, and this May will see the third instalment of his Loewe craft prize, which showcases ceramic artists among other makers. Meanwhile Raf Simons, the Belgian designer who is currently chief creative officer at Calvin Klein, has long been addicted to buying and selling ceramics and unflinchingly displays breakable Picasso pots in his living room. At Ceramic Art London, a representative from Bonhams approached exhibitor Nichola Theakston, who makes deeply empathetic sculptures of animals, to commission her to make fresh work for the auction house to sell. “The auction world follows trends and finds underexploited areas,” says Brundin. “Ceramics has historically been undervalued because of its connection with craft so they can see room to move upwards.” But generally, he says, “we’re still in the realm where people are buying for themselves rather than for an investment. In any case, that’s how you should do investments: buy things that give you pleasure.” Things of Beauty Growing: British Studio Pottery is at Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, until 17 June."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/13/john-hood-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T17:19:09Z","webTitle":"John Hood obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/13/john-hood-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/13/john-hood-obituary","fields":{"headline":"John Hood obituary","bodyText":"My father John Hood (also known as Jack), who has died aged 103, was a joiner and a lifelong socialist who, as Stoke-on-Trent’s senior clerk of works, oversaw the construction of many of the city’s public buildings. Among them were the police station, library, polytechnic and, in John’s last job before retirement in 1979, the city’s Potteries Museum and Art Gallery. He joined the Labour party as a young man, remaining a member all his life – except for a brief period when he left over the Iraq war – and served as both secretary and chair of the Newcastle-under-Lyme constituency. At the 2015 Labour party conference he received a lifetime merit award. Son of Florence (nee James) and Albert Hood, John was born and brought up in Burslem, one of the six Potteries towns that form Stoke-on-Trent. He left school at 14 to become an apprentice joiner, after pneumoconiosis forced his father, who worked in a potbank – a pottery factory – to give up his job. In the 1930s John was an active anti-fascist, disrupting meetings of Oswald Mosley’s Blackshirts in the Potteries. In 1939, at the outbreak of the second world war, he volunteered for the army. Posted to Libya, he was involved in running supplies to the Free French army; he was then transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in Cairo, where he took charge of a workshop. In 1944 he was part of a group who set up a forces parliament which, following a mock election, produced a Labour government committed to nationalisation of the banks and the building of 4 million homes. At the end of the war, John returned to the building trade with Stoke-on-Trent’s public works department, rising to become a clerk of works and eventually senior clerk of works for the city. In 1980 he was a founder member of the Keele World Affairs group, which has grown into Europe’s largest public forum on global issues. A popular member, known for asking difficult questions, he continued to attend into his 100th year. An enquiring, outgoing, caring man and engaging raconteur, John had many friends. At the end of 2017 he was proud to receive the French Légion d’Honneur in recognition of his wartime service. On returning from war John had married his fiancee, Elsie; sadly, she had contracted TB and died two years later. In 1949 he married Sheila Roy, my mother. She died in 1974. Three years later John married Enid Ward, with whom he shared many happy, adventurous years until her death in 1995. This marriage also brought a large stepfamily, with whom John had a loving relationship. He is survived by me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/14/farmers-crops-livestock-turmoil-beast-from-east-climate-change","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T19:26:04Z","webTitle":"British farmers in turmoil as delayed spring plays havoc with growing season","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/14/farmers-crops-livestock-turmoil-beast-from-east-climate-change","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/14/farmers-crops-livestock-turmoil-beast-from-east-climate-change","fields":{"headline":"British farmers in turmoil as delayed spring plays havoc with growing season","bodyText":"Last year, asparagus growers were harvesting as early as 8 April. This spring, they are not expecting to harvest their open-field crop until the last week of April – a week later than the official start of the season, St George’s Day, 23 April. Welcome to just one of the consequences of Britain’s disastrously delayed spring. “We have had a very challenging time,” said Guy Smith, vice president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU). “March breezed in with the ‘beast from the east’ and went out with the worst bank holiday on record.” For asparagus-lovers there is at least an upside. “The combination has to be right for the crowns to push through,” explained Per Hogberg, of grower Wealmoor. “The air temperature has to be at least 12C, while the soil temperature should be between 8C and 10C. With warmer weather expected, consumers can expect a bumper crop in mid-May,” he said. It is not just asparagus growers praying for a warm, dry spell. The earlier farmers can sow, the more chance their crops have to achieve their potential. “My father was a farmer and one of his sayings was ‘a peck of dust in March was worth a king’s ransom’,” Smith said. “If the ground is nice and friable and makes a good seed-bed then it can be potentially quite lucrative for the farmer. Well, that’s gone this year.” Farmers griping about the weather goes with the job. But Smith fears something is happening to Britain’s weather that has consequences which stretch far beyond farming. “We farm in north-east Essex, in the driest spot in the British Isles, and so we’re keen observers of the British weather. More often now we seem to be stuck in long periods of wet months and then long periods of dry months, which is more challenging for farmers.” Adam Lockwood grows spring onions in the Vale of Evesham in Worcestershire. “At the minute we’re struggling to get going,” he said. “Potato growers haven’t even started planting yet and drilling dates are well behind where they should be. “We’re lucky in one sense that what we’re doing is all seed. I can buy seed and put it in a shed and it doesn’t matter, but lettuce and brassica growers who have plants raised in a nursery that were ready weeks ago, they’re now having to throw those away.” Like Smith, Lockwood thinks that the climate is changing. “We’re getting more rain in a shorter period rather than evenly distributed across the year – that’s what I’m noticing. And you’re getting more intense dry periods. It’s more extreme.” Livestock and dairy producers have been particularly hard hit. “It’s been a very late spring, even for a hill farm where we are,” said Richard Findlay, chair of the NFU’s livestock board, who farms in the North York Moors National Park. “Instead of keeping the sheep in a couple of days after they’ve had lambs, we’re keeping them in for two or three weeks. We’re very fortunate in that we have the buildings to do it, but a lot of neighbours who don’t are struggling and have had many more losses. “We have nearly 1,000 sheep and it’s costing us about £1,000 extra a week at the moment to feed and house them to avoid a lot of losses. If we turned them out in poor weather there would be very little grass to eat.” Findlay believes that it will be farmers who end up absorbing the extra costs, rather than consumers. But this puts them at the mercy of the markets, and poor prices for their lambs later in the year could see some producers call it a day. “It’s been the worst and most challenging time that I can remember,” Findlay said. “It really started last summer, which was very wet and quite cool, and the autumn and winter have generally been very wet. Sheep can stand cold weather and they can stand wet weather but when there is a prolonged period of both, it really pulls them down. We would normally expect to lose 1% of the ewe flock in this winter period and we’ve probably lost 3% to 4%, despite our best efforts.” What the farmers are experiencing first-hand accords with what scientists are finding. Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at NCAS-Climate, University of Reading, who helps run www.WeatherRescue.org – a site where volunteers digitise millions of historical weather observations – says that UK temperatures have risen by around 1.5 degrees in the last 150 years. “It’s basic physics: warmer air can hold more moisture so, as the atmosphere warms, it means, when it does rain heavily, we get more rain than we would otherwise have done from the same storm 100 years ago.” In the short term, farmers like Smith hope that the coming week’s warmer, drier conditions are going to stretch through April. In the longer term, he believes that the first three months of 2018 should sound alarm bells. “We need to remember that it’s reckless to take food production for granted,” he said. Counting the cost of Britain’s recent bad weather Asparagus Growers say their crops will not be ready until the end of the month, almost three weeks late. Potatoes Many growers have yet to plant. Spring onions Seeds which should have been sown back in February yet to go in. Lamb and beef Stocks have been kept indoors for weeks, meaning higher fodder prices and possible price rises for consumers. Brassicas and lettuce Plants due to go into the fields have had to be thrown away.

Greatly interested in western philosophy and Urdu literature, Maqbool wrote in both English and Urdu. Shakespeare’s plays and Shakespeare criticism were Maqbool’s lifetime passion. He loved to quote Shakespeare in all situations and could discuss almost all major and minor Shakespeare critics. Though he wrote a book on Edward Dowden in the mid-80s, and essays on AC Bradley’s and Walter Raleigh’s Shakespeare criticism, his work is also full of interesting asides on other Shakespeare critics, including Coleridge, Granville-Barker, EE Stoll, LC Knights and G Wilson Knight. He obtained an MA in Shakespeare studies from the Shakespeare Institute at Birmingham University in 1974, after being awarded a British Council scholarship. He also edited the Aligarh Journal of English Studies, which specialised in Shakespeare scholarship, and the annotated editions of Hamlet and The Tempest, with long introductions, for Orient Longman Drama Classics. Born in Malihabad, Lucknow, a town known for its rich variety of mangoes and Urdu poetry, Maqbool was the only brother to his five sisters. His father, Mahmood Hasan Khan, owned mango orchards and his mother, Razia Begum, taught the Qur’an to children and started a school for girls. Maqbool received his early education at Mahatma Gandhi high school, Malihabad, and did an MA in English at Lucknow University in 1959. He worked briefly as a lecturer of English at Government College, Kota, Rajasthan, in 1961, before joining Aligarh Muslim University in 1963. He stayed there for 35 years until his retirement in 1998. He wrote many essays in Urdu, and his long article on Qurratulain Hyder, an important Urdu novelist, won him critical acclaim in Urdu literary circles. He was a shy, modest and private person, almost obscure even in his own university town, and never fond of public speaking, but the classroom transformed Maqbool into a very articulate, confident and inspired speaker. He possessed a refined sense of humour and an extraordinary flair for teaching. His lectures were unfailingly interesting. In fact his greatest contribution lay in awakening in students a love of literature. Maqbool married Ayesha Hussain in 1961. She died in 1971 and Maqbool brought up their four children singlehandedly before marrying Afsar Bano, a geography teacher, in 1981. She survives him, together with his son, Ayaz, three daughters, Tamkin, Tazeen and Taskeen, and nine grandchildren."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/13/one-palestinian-killed-and-hundreds-injured-in-gaza-clashes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T18:24:04Z","webTitle":"One Palestinian killed and hundreds injured in Gaza protests","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/one-palestinian-killed-and-hundreds-injured-in-gaza-clashes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/13/one-palestinian-killed-and-hundreds-injured-in-gaza-clashes","fields":{"headline":"One Palestinian killed and hundreds injured in Gaza protests","bodyText":"Israeli forces stationed on the Gaza frontier have killed one person and wounded hundreds of Palestinians, who were demonstrating for the third week in a row. Health officials in Gaza said 363 people were injured by live ammunition and tear gas inhalation, although they did not provide a breakdown. They said a Gazan journalist was in a serious condition after being shot in the abdomen. The Palestine Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian organisation, has said one of its medics was shot in the knee. Rights groups accuse Israel of wanton use of live fire. Israel says the protests are a cynical ploy by Gaza’s rulers Hamas to stage attacks, including using explosives, or to breach the border. Close to 30 Palestinians – including Hamas militants, civilians and a video reporter – have been killed during the rallies, which started on 30 March. At five spots along the frontier, tent complexes have been erected hundreds of metres from the border where families have gathered. Crowds of mostly young men have moved closer, slinging stones, torching tyres and setting Israeli flags alight. East of Gaza City in the northern part of the coastal enclave, ambulances brought the injured to a field hospital where paramedics rushed to attend floods of patients. Several men, bandages wrapped around their calves and ankles, had been shot. One lay unconscious after a bullet had passed through his lower torso. Outside, at the entrance to the area, a large Israeli flag had been placed on the ground for people to walk over. And closer, across the beige and green fields towards the perimeter, thick black smoke from burning tyres rose high, the seaside winds pushing it into the skies above Israel. The protests began as a plan to peacefully gather near the border, an idea that has since been supported by Hamas and other political parties. Thousands have called for the “right of return” for refugees and their descendants to ancestral homes in Israel. Across the fence on the Israeli side, sniper teams lay low on sandbanks overlooking the area. An Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) official, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused to detail specific rules for engagement that admitted live sniper fire or say how many people had been shot. Sitting under the shade of trees near the kibbutz of Nahal Oz, he said: “Using live fire is a last resort. Obviously, I’m not talking about a terrorist shooting but a person trying to approach the fence, cut the fence, throw a hand grenade.” All targets were chosen by commanders and shot by “well-trained” teams, he added, and every bullet fired had been recorded. No Israeli civilian or soldier has been harmed as a result of the rallies. The IDF sent footage to journalists on Friday of protesters attempting to pull down barbed wire using a rope. It said an “explosive device” had been detonated near the border and forwarded a photo of what it said was a “firebomb” attached to a kite. Human rights groups have decried the use of lethal force, saying live bullets should only be used when facing imminent mortal threats. Five former IDF members from sniper teams said in an open letter that they were “filled with shame and sorrow”. “Instructing snipers to shoot to kill unarmed demonstrators who pose no danger to human life is another product of the occupation and military rule over millions of Palestinian people, as well as of our country’s callous leadership, and derailed moral path,” they wrote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/14/manchester-united-west-brom-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"Manchester United v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/14/manchester-united-west-brom-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/14/manchester-united-west-brom-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United v West Bromwich Albion: match preview","bodyText":"All Manchester United can do is keep winning while praying Manchester City perform a flop of Devon Loch proportions.

Both the White House and state department announced on Friday that the US had “a high level of confidence” about the regime’s culpability for the use of poisonous gas in Douma. The declaration marked a shift from a statement by the defence secretary, James Mattis, on Thursday, that the US was still looking at the evidence. But the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, told the security council that the Trump administration had still not decided on a military response. The UK denounced as “a blatant lie” Russian claims that the country’s intelligence services were responsible for staging “the fake chemical weapons attack” in Douma, as a pretext for launching a wider military assault on the Syrian regime forces. Moscow had previously said there was no traces of any chemical attack in Douma. Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are due to visit the scene on Saturday. However, France, UK and the US have said their own evidence already points to Damascus. Western diplomats would not rule out military action while the OPCW is on the ground, but said their capitals would try to avoid a situation in which inspectors could be vulnerable to harm or being taken hostage. Asked about the Russian accusation against the UK, the White House spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders said: “Our intelligence tells us otherwise ... We have a very high confidence that Syria was responsible”. The state department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said: “We can say that the Syrian government was behind this attack... We know there are only certain countries, like Syria, that have delivery mechanisms and have those types of weapons.” Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said he had obtained documentary evidence showing that “special services of a country, which is now seeking to be in the first ranks of the Russophobic campaign, were involved in this staged event”. The UK Foreign Office said the claims were preposterous. Alexander Yakovenko, the Russian ambassador to London, told reporters the UK-funded Syrian civil defence forces, the White Helmets, were responsible for staging fake chemical attacks by the Syrian army in an attempt to mislead the world. Igor Konashenkov, a Russian defence ministry spokesman, went further saying: “We have … evidence that proves Britain was directly involved in organising this provocation.” He said Russia had proof that London put pressure on the White Helmets to stage the attack. The White Helmets is a humanitarian organisation made up of 3,400 volunteers who rescue civilians from the rubble after airstrikes. Karen Pierce, Britain’s ambassador to the UN, described the claims as “grotesque, bizarre and a blatant lie”. She added: “I want to state categorically … that Britain has no involvement and would never have any involvement in the use of a chemical weapon.” A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “Russia has wielded its UN security council veto six times since February 2017 to shield the Assad regime from scrutiny for its use of chemical weapons. These accusations from Moscow are just the latest in a number of ludicrous allegations from Russia, who have also said that no attack ever happened. The allegations plunged the two countries’ intelligence agencies into yet more conflict, and came as the first members of a UN weapons inspectors fact-finding mission arrived in Damascus to see whether evidence remained to prove a chemical weapons attack had occurred, as photographs, blood samples and accounts from witnesses have shown. The inspectors are expected to be given access to Douma on Saturday. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, insisted the inspectors from the OPCW must be given full and unfettered access to witnesses and buildings. Russia, in conjunction with the forces of the Syrian president, Bashar-al Assad, is in charge of the Douma area. At another highly charged session of the UN security council on Friday, Russia’s Vassily Nebenzia repeated the claim that the attack was staged. Hayley, his US counterpart, said she was “in awe” that Nebenzia could make such claims “with a straight face”. Pressed outside the UN chamber on when the US would decide whether to launch a military strike, Haley said: “You don’t rush decisions like this.” She added that if there was haste, “you make a mistake”. On Thursday Trump called Theresa May, the UK prime minister, and the two agreed “it was vital that the use of chemical weapons did not go unchallenged”. But the US delay in taking action appears to be caused by divisions between the White House and Jim Mattis, the US defence secretary, on the viable targets that could be struck in an effort to wipe out Syria’s alleged chemical weapons stores and factories. The hesitation in Washington gave Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, a chance to consult with Vladimir Putin to see whether they can construct a compromise that will avoid a military attack but still satisfy western demands that Russia stops protecting Assad’s breaches of the chemical weapons conventions. Macron, who on Thursday said he had proof of use of chemical weapons by Syrian regime – also called for dialogue with Russia. But the glimmer of hope for diplomacy came alongside continued planning for a military assault. Britain’s military chiefs have been working on a range of scenarios over the last few days. The focuss of an attack would be on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons research and storage facilities. Other targets under consideration by the Ministry of Defence, working in coordination with the US and France, include Syrian command and control centres as well as airbases, planes and helicopters. An attack on Assad’s presidential palace in the hills above Damascus has been ruled out as a step too far. May will be challenged by MPs to spell out her military plans on Monday, if no weekend assault has been launched. The planners are anxious to avoid destroying Russian equipment or killing Russian personnel based in Syria, potentially provoking a reaction from Moscow. They insist missiles and intelligence are better than in the 1991 Iraq war in which the Amiriyah bomb shelter was hit killing more than 400 civilians, or the Nato bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. A spokesperson for the French defence ministry, chiming with MoD partners, said Macron had specified there would be no targeting of Russians in Syria and the focus would be on Syria’s alleged chemical weapons capabilities. A prime target is the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, west of Damascus, which the US has claimed has been involved in the preparation of chemical weapons. Targets could include airbases where the chemical weapons are alleged to have been stored, as well as aircraft which have allegedly been used attacks. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, an expert who led the UK and Nato chemical weapons response teams, said it was highly unlikely that an attack on Syrian chemical facilities risked spreading the poison. “The best way to destroy chemical weapons is to blow them up,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/16/value-of-london-flats-slashed-by-grenfell-style-cladding","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Value of London flats slashed by Grenfell-style cladding","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/16/value-of-london-flats-slashed-by-grenfell-style-cladding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/16/value-of-london-flats-slashed-by-grenfell-style-cladding","fields":{"headline":"Value of London flats slashed by Grenfell-style cladding","bodyText":"A homeowner in a housing complex in London with Grenfell-type cladding has been told the value of her £475,000 home has collapsed and is now just £50,000. Galliard Homes, the developer of the 11-block complex in New Capital Quay in south-east London, is facing a £30m-£40m bill to replace the cladding and is locked in a legal dispute over who should pay. The dispute, which could take years to resolve, has left Mary Tlick (not her real name) and potentially thousands of others up and down the country, with an unsellable flat. “It is like someone has taken away our life choices, our freedom,” she said. “And nobody is doing anything about it,” she added, in tears. Tlick has a two-year-old son and was due to give birth to her second child on Saturday. She had put their flat on the market in the hope of moving out of London to a bigger home. She got a Rics-approved surveyor to value her flat recently and was shocked when he came back with a £50,000 price tag. But now she realises the whole complex is blighted. “All ongoing sales in the development have fallen through. Banks are not lending to potential buyers and provide valuations of zero for flats in our development,” she said. Tlick is one of about 2,000 residents in NCQ in Greenwich, believed to be the largest private development found to have flammable cladding after the west London disaster that cost 71 lives. “I don’t sleep at night. I wake up most nights for a few hours and I write emails to people I think that can help,” said Tlick. “I can’t move very fast. What would happen if my husband was away one night? We are on the seventh floor. What if if I was there with my son and new baby and all the people were at the stairs and I couldn’t get out?” she asked. While cladding remains on such buildings, the fire brigade requires 24/7 fire patrol in case evacuation is needed, but in three cases so far in private blocks, including one in Croydon and another in Salford, this has meant leaseholders will face bills potentially of tens of thousands of pounds. “It is quite shocking that the residents are living in potential death traps while everybody else tries to deny liability for the cost of making them safe. There is the potential for the residents to bring group legal proceedings to recover the cost of fixing the buildings and for the considerable distress they must be suffering,” said Chris Haan, a lawyer at the London law firm Leigh Day. He has been approached by a number of home owners in NCQ and said they may have a case against the developers for breach of contract when they sold homes “fit for habitation when completed”. Tlick funded the flat in 2014 through some savings, a mortgage with a high-street bank and a £95,000 government loan under the Help to Buy scheme designed to help people without enough savings to get on the property ladder. She said she could repay that loan without selling, under the government’s rules. But she believes she has to repay only 20% of the market value, which at £50,000 means she would owe £10,000 and the government would lose £85,000 of its loan to her. Tlick believes that many other homes in the NCQ development were purchased on the Help to Buy scheme, which was heavily promoted by Galliard at the development’s launch. She has had no answer from Target HCA, which is administering the scheme, other than to say it is a “novel” request. “They are being evasive, because they know if they have to do this for me they have to do it for everyone who asks,” she said. Regardless of how much of the government loan she has to repay, Tlick is still subject to huge negative equity because the value of the flat has plummeted. She said she is at her wits’ end and suffering from stress over her situation. She said she can’t move out and rent to others because she would feel terrible “if they were caught in a fire”. It is also not permissible under her Help to Buy contract. She contacted the housing minister, Dominic Raab, but he did not reply. “I don’t think he cares about ordinary people,” she said. It is likely that thousands of private homeowners are in Tlick’s situation, with government data showing 301 blocks over 18 metres tall have Grenfell-type cladding, of which 130 are in the private sector and 13 are hospitals or schools. Of the public buildings, only seven have had their cladding replaced so far. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We have made clear that we want to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs of essential cladding replacement to leaseholders. “We are keeping the situation under review and ministers are meeting industry representatives shortly to discuss this.” Campaigners said the cladding was causing financial ruin for homeowners. “The blight caused by Grenfell is national and the government doesn’t seem to be too bothered about that. So far, what we have heard from Greenwich and Croydon is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Martin Boyd, a trustee at the charity Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a service that advises leaseholders on their rights over cladding and other issues. Galliard Homes declined to comment.

Trump joined an effort by Cohen to assert attorney-client privilege over records covering Cohen’s representation of Trump over the past decade, setting up another extraordinary conflict between the president and his own justice department. Meanwhile the Trump Organization, which Trump led until entering office last year, claimed to prosecutors that “each and every communication” involving Cohen and their executives should also be considered privileged. The Trump interventions came as federal prosecutors in New York confirmed Cohen “is being investigated for criminal conduct that largely centers on his personal business dealings”. Cohen’s office, home, hotel room, electronic devices and safe deposit box were searched on Monday by FBI agents who seized records and data. Prosecutors also revealed in a court filing on Friday that Cohen’s emails had secretly been searched, and that the raids were part of “a monthslong investigation” involving a grand jury. FBI agents are believed to have taken documents relating to a payoff to Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic actor known as Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump. Records relating to Cohen’s business interests, including his ownership of several taxi firms, are also thought to have been seized. Attorneys for Cohen filed a request at Manhattan federal court for a restraining order which would prevent prosecutors from accessing the seized documents until disagreements over what should be sealed are settled. Cohen’s attorneys argued at a hearing on Friday morning that they should be allowed to review the documents themselves. As a “fall-back option”, they propose that the judge appoint a special master to review them. “We think we deserve to know some of the findings from this ongoing investigation,” said Todd Harrison, an attorney for Cohen. A new attorney for Trump appeared unexpectedly at the hearing and argued that the president should be involved in ensuring that his his own communications with Cohen are shielded from investigators. “As a privilege holder, he has an acute interest in these proceedings and in the manner that these materials are reviewed,” the attorney, Joanna Hendon said at the federal court in Manhattan. Thomas McKay, an assistant US attorney, argued in the court filing that Cohen and the Trump Organization had made “inaccurate and/or overbroad” claims of privilege that should be rejected. McKay argued that a so-called “Filter Team” from the justice department should be allowed to check all the seized documents for possible privilege. Interactions between attorneys and their clients are typically kept secret, but an exception can be made if the documents contain evidence of criminal activity. Hendon persuaded Judge Kimba Wood to delay until Monday arguments over the restraining order that would temporarily ban authorities from inspecting the records. “He is the president of the United States. These interests are so weighty I think we need more than an afternoon’s adjournment,” Hendon said, after Wood proposed that the court take only a short break and reconvene later on Friday. “This is of most concern to him,” said Hendon. “I think the public is a close second. I think anyone who has hired a lawyer is a close third.” McKay, the prosecutor, told the court that Trump had been “on notice about this search since Monday” and had waited until the last moment to intervene. “With respect, his attorney-client privilege is no stronger than anyone who seeks legal advice,” said McKay. Michael Avenatti, an attorney for Daniels, was also present in court on Friday and asked the judge to involve him in the discussions on who should have access to the documents seized from Cohen. “We have every reason to believe that some of the documents relate to my client,” said Avenatti. Much of Friday’s hearing focused on arguments from the media that hearings on the dispute should not be heard in secret. Wood said she had been intending to protect the identities of “innocent people” whose information was scooped up in the raids. Wood was nominated by Bill Clinton to be US attorney general in 1993 before withdrawing after it was discovered that she had hired an undocumented immigrant as a babysitter. An attorney for ABC News argued that authorities could use pseudonyms to protect identities. Lawyers for the New York Times submitted a letter to the judge asking that the press be allowed to object to any arguments in the case taking place privately. Attorneys for Cohen have requested to have the entire proceedings sealed and kept private. Hendon said Trump was entitled to have a say in order to ensure the “appearance of fairness”. Hendon said that “given the interest at stake and the exceptional nature of my client” it was important for everyone that the process be done “scrupulously, so that it is not subject to taint complaints later, and so that it withstands scrutiny for all time”. “The privilege belongs to the privilege holder, not the lawyer,” said Hendon. “The client can waive the privilege, the lawyer cannot.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/13/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-uk-to-lead-un-push-to-defuse-syria-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T17:05:01Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn calls for UK to lead UN push to defuse Syria crisis","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-uk-to-lead-un-push-to-defuse-syria-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/13/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-uk-to-lead-un-push-to-defuse-syria-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Corbyn calls for UK to lead UN push to defuse Syria crisis","bodyText":"Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK must lead at the United Nations security council to bring the US and Russia together to end the conflict in Syria, insisting it is “never pointless” to push for UN involvement. The Labour leader and his Liberal Democrat counterpart, Vince Cable, were to receive a security briefing from the government on Friday afternoon. Corbyn insisted in an interview earlier in the day that he wanted to see the evidence of who was behind the apparent chemical weapons attack in Douma. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said his country has seen evidence the attack was carried out by Bashar al-Assad’s government, and Theresa May has said her administration considers it highly likely Syrian forces were behind it. Corbyn said those who had perpetrated the attack should be held responsible, but that judgment should wait until after a UN investigation. “It’s up to the UN as the primary actor in the international community to find out who did it. I want to know who did it. If there is proof the regime did it, they must be held responsible. If there’s a proof anybody else did it, they must be held responsible,” he said. Corbyn had requested the security briefing on privy council terms, which are normally granted to opposition leaders at the government’s discretion on matters of national security. In his interview with Sky News, Corbyn pointed to the 2013 investigation into the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta and the agreement reached between the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, to allow the destruction of large quantities of chemical weapons in Syria. “I think we do need the same spirit between Russia and the US, and I hope that is going to be possible,” he said. “I would say very strongly to Russia and the US: ‘Stop blocking each other’s resolutions.’ Maybe a British-sponsored resolution on this would be a helpful way forward?” Russia has repeatedly used its security council veto to block resolutions on Syria, including one on Tuesday that would have established an independent investigation into the suspected use of chemical weapons. Corbyn denied that it was pointless, given Russia’s record, to continue to call for UN investigations. “It’s never pointless calling for that, anything that brings a cessation of the use of chemical weapons moves us nearer, if not totally to, a ceasefire and a reopening of the Geneva talks which has got to be the right way forward,” he said. Corbyn did not say he regretted voting against airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria in 2015, but he did admit the action had “might have isolated and destroyed support for Isis”. “I took those decisions with my eyes open and my views because my default position is to save human life,” he said. Downing Street insisted on Friday that there was no set timetable for any potential military action to begin. May will come under increasing pressure from her backbenchers to grant a Commons vote on the matter if there are no further developments before the House of Commons returns from Easter recess on Monday. Earlier on Friday, Corbyn also accused May’s government of “waiting for instructions” from the US on how to proceed in the Syrian crisis, but that Donald Trump was giving “alarmingly contradictory signals”. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the Labour party believed there was no military answer to the Syrian crisis. Asked whether Labour did not believe in military action in any circumstances, she said: “No. There was the second world war.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/apr/13/livia-gollancz-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T15:56:23Z","webTitle":"Livia Gollancz obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/13/livia-gollancz-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/apr/13/livia-gollancz-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Livia Gollancz obituary","bodyText":"Livia Gollancz, who has died aged 97, was one of the first women to head a publishing company, serving for 17 years as managing director of Victor Gollancz Ltd. But it was her earlier career as a French horn player, working with many leading conductors, including John Barbirolli, Thomas Beecham and Adrian Boult, that captured her heart. Her 15 years as a professional musician were brought to an end only by dental problems exacerbated by and inimical to horn-playing. In 1953, out of desperation rather than desire, she accepted her father’s invitation to join the family firm. The change in lifestyle was a tremendous shock at first. Describing herself at that time as “like a drowning person grasping at a raft”, she only planned to stay for a couple of months, but remained with the company for 36 years. She started “right at the bottom”, making coffee and typing labels, laying out advertisements and book covers, and then writing cover copy. After two years she was allowed to edit her first book: Journey into a Fog by Margareta Berger-Hamerschlag, an art teacher’s account of her work with young people in a deprived area of London. Over the next decade Livia’s father taught her the workings of the industry, grooming her to be his successor. Her position as the boss’s daughter caused resentment at times: one of the casualties of her advancement was her cousin, Hilary Rubinstein, who left the firm and became a literary agent. When Victor suffered a serious stroke in 1966, Livia took over as managing director, and ended her time with the company as chairman (1983-89). Professionally, if not emotionally, Livia was deeply committed to publishing. Her list of authors included Ivy Compton-Burnett, Daphne du Maurier, Michael Innes/JIM Stewart, Terence de Vere White and the spy thriller writer Anthony Price, whom she claimed to have discovered. As well as the thriller list at Gollancz, she took on all the music books and the mountaineering and walking titles, her own passions well into old age. Under her leadership, Gollancz remained an old-fashioned company. Promotion came primarily from within and overtime was unpaid. Always willing to publish a book she liked, regardless of its commercial viability, she regretted the rise of large conglomerates and was critical of literary agents for the decline of the editor-author relationship. She made little effort to keep up with technological advances, although the accounts were finally computerised. In spite of having suffragette ancestry, Livia was surprisingly indifferent to feminist publishing or lists aimed at female readers, and her attitude towards women’s advancement in publishing was far from progressive. “A publishing firm is like an hour glass,” she once said. “If you don’t get through the little gap into the top bit, you tend to leave. Once you’ve got through the gap you’ve probably got past the age when you want to be having a family.” For Livia, books always took second place to music. In an interview given shortly after she retired, she remarked: “It’s very funny that the whole of the publishing thing has just gone from my mind – I must have absolutely hated it really.” Born in west London, Livia was the eldest of five daughters of Victor and his wife, Ruth (nee Lowy), and grew up in a large and long-established Anglo-Jewish family. Her maternal grandmother, Henrietta, was an active suffragette who taught all her daughters to drive. Imprisoned on several occasions for her suffragette activities, she and Emmeline Pankhurst would sometimes swap clothes after meetings to enable the latter to evade arrest. Livia’s mother was a fully qualified architect, one of the first four women in 1917 to gain admission to the Architectural Association. Art, music and books played a central role in Livia’s childhood. All her pocket money went on concert and opera tickets, including the 15 shillings intended for her school certificate. She was also intensely political in her teenage years, heavily involved with the Left Book Club, which her father founded in 1936, and an ardent member of the Young Communist League. The German-Soviet non-aggression pact of 1939 shattered her political beliefs, after which she lost all confidence in politics and politicians. Educated at Kensington high school and St Paul’s Girls’ school, Livia bought her first French horn for £5 at the age of 15, and at 16 was accepted at the Royal College of Music to study horn and viola. The second world war created opportunities for female musicians and she joined the London Symphony Orchestra straight out of college in 1940. When Barbirolli became conductor of the Hallé Orchestra in 1943, he chose Livia as principal horn. She admired his insistence that female musicians should be treated on their musical merits, but after two years they parted company when she told him his approach to classical music was “too romantic for my taste”, an opinion she later regretted as the “audacity and stupidity of youth”. She then joined the Scottish Orchestra (1943–45, now the Royal Scottish National Orchestra), and the BBC Scottish Orchestra (1945-46, now the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra). Returning to London in 1947, Livia was appointed principal horn at Covent Garden, where she had her first experience of pit work and chauvinism. Karl Rankl, then its musical director, who was known for his resistance to female musicians, refused to work with her. In 1949 one of the most enjoyable phases of her musical career began at the Old Vic Theatre Company. At Sadler’s Wells Opera (1950-53), she worked under Michael Mudie, whom she considered the best British conductor of his generation. In retirement, she returned to the viola and violin, the instruments of her childhood, and also sang, both solo and chorally. A member of the Alpine Club, in 1964 she climbed the Matterhorn. She thought nothing of walking for five or six hours a day well into her 70s, and was still playing chamber music on a regular basis in her 80s. As a musician, she was proud of having played the demanding fourth horn part in Beethoven’s Choral Symphony in the first season of Proms concerts after their move to the Royal Albert Hall, in 1941. As a publisher, she was proud of having sold Gollancz to Houghton Mifflin in 1989 without the loss of a single job. She is survived by six nephews, three great-nephews and five great-nieces. • Livia Ruth Gollancz, publisher and musician, born 25 May 1920; died 29 March 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2018/apr/13/southampton-chelsea-match-preview","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T14:41:38Z","webTitle":"Southampton v Chelsea: match preview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/apr/13/southampton-chelsea-match-preview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/apr/13/southampton-chelsea-match-preview","fields":{"headline":"Southampton v Chelsea: match preview","bodyText":"In the corresponding fixture last season, Diego Costa sealed a hard-fought win that showed Chelsea’s title credentials to end Southampton’s long unbeaten run at home.

On Tuesday, Roma pulled off one of the great European comebacks: recovering from three goals down to eliminate Barcelona from the Champions League and reach the semi-finals. The shoe was on the other foot for Lazio two days later, as their 4-2 lead from the first leg became a 6-5 defeat to RB Salzburg in the Europa League. Such results define entire seasons. Even if Roma lose to their semi-final opponents Liverpool, this would still be the furthest they have gone in a European Cup since the Reds beat them in the 1984 final. The almost 60,000 fans who attended on Tuesday will never forget watching their team reduce Lionel Messi to a helpless bystander. Lazio’s supporters, conversely, saw the dream of only a second European trophy slip away. Perhaps that will bring Sunday’s game into even sharper focus. In another season, this might have been the most important fixture by far. Roma and Lazio will kick off joint‑third in Serie A, level on 60 points with seven matches remaining. Fifth-placed Inter are also on 60 but have played a game more, drawing 0-0 at Atalanta on Saturday night. With Juventus and Napoli in effect locked into the top spots, it is a case of three into two for a place in next season’s Champions League. The financial implications are obvious. Roma have already earned upwards of €70m from this European run, a hugely significant sum for a club that posted losses of more than €40m after missing out last season. For Lazio, whose operating revenue is far smaller than that of their rivals, the impact would be even greater. Sunday’s game, though, is about far more than bank balances. This has been a year of footballing revival in Italy’s capital, those European runs breeding fresh enthusiasm in the stands. Full houses such as the one that greeted Barcelona are still an uncommon sight at the Stadio Olimpico but average attendances at both Rome clubs’ games have risen by more than 4,000 from last year. Such energy stems in part from the presence of two young and ambitious managers, each with a clear and contrasting vision of how the game should be played. Roma’s Eusebio Di Francesco is a Zdenek Zeman disciple who views rigour as the key to victory, drilling the same movements over and over. At their best, his teams are compact, opportunistic and aggressive. Simone Inzaghi is more of a pragmatist. At Lazio, he has identified individual players’ strengths and designed his team to exploit them. In Ciro Immobile he found a striker whose game was lacking in certain areas but who could time a run as well as anyone. So Inzaghi set the Biancocelesti up to sit deep and play on the counter, waiting for opponents to overcommit and leave space in behind. The results have been wildly entertaining. Lazio are Serie A’s top scorers, with 75 goals in 31 games. Immobile leads the league with 27, but Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Luis Alberto each have nine. Inzaghi’s team have, however, also conceded 40 times in the league, more than Juventus and Napoli combined. Di Francesco could never abide such sloppiness. Roma are more reliable and yet perhaps more predictable for it. Edin Dzeko destroyed Barcelona with his direct and powerful runs but when opponents do find a way to neutralise him, the Giallorossi sometimes struggle. The craft and unpredictability of Cengiz Under has been a boon, but he is only just back from a hamstring injury. This will be the Turkish forward’s first game against Lazio, if he plays. Will he feel the occasion as keenly as his manager once did? Di Francesco, who spent four seasons at Roma as a player, recalls walking out beneath his team’s supporters in the Curva Sud before his first derby, and feeling his legs start to shake uncontrollably for the one and only time in his career. There have been more weighty editions than this one, but not many. Most obvious is the 2013 Coppa Italia final, the only time Rome’s two leading clubs have met with a piece of major silverware on the line. Lazio won 1-0, with a goal from Senad Lulic. The fallout continued for months, with Lazio supporters holding a mock funeral procession for Roma through the city and flying planes trailing reminders of their triumph during the summer that followed. Sunday’s game cannot deliver such a permanent verdict. It is conceivable that either team could lose and yet still pip the other to a top-four spot. But after a week of such contrasting highs and lows, it is a game that offers tantalising opportunities for glory or redemption. “Right now we are in pieces,” said Inzaghi in the wake of Thursday’s collapse. “But on Sunday we have another big chance.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/pentagon-large-body-of-evidence-steered-trump-to-syria-strikes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T05:20:14Z","webTitle":"The Pentagon's 'large body' of evidence that steered Trump to Syria strikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/pentagon-large-body-of-evidence-steered-trump-to-syria-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/pentagon-large-body-of-evidence-steered-trump-to-syria-strikes","fields":{"headline":"The Pentagon's 'large body' of evidence that steered Trump to Syria strikes","bodyText":"The US has claimed it has “a large body” of evidence pointing to the Assad regime’s responsibility for the 7 April chemical attack on Douma, including eyewitness sightings of helicopters dropping barrel bombs on Douma, and “reliable intelligence” that Syrian military officials coordinated the attack. The White House released an information sheet making its case for regime involvement in the Douma attack shortly after Donald Trump announced he had ordered air strikes on Syria. Damascus and Moscow have denied any involvement in the Douma attack. Russian officials first said their experts had found no trance of chemical weapons in Douma, on the northeastern outskirts of Damascus, and then claimed that the attack had been staged by rebels. On Friday, Moscow claimed that British government had been behind the “staged” attack. Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) were due to visit to Douma on Saturday, but it was not clear if that visit would proceed in the wake of the overnight air strikes. The OPCW mandate allows it to state whether banned chemical weapons were used but not attribute responsibility. “A large body of information indicates that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons in the Duma area of East Ghutah, near Damascus, on April 7, 2018. Our information is consistent and corroborated by multiple sources,” the White House statement said. “This conclusion is based on descriptions of the attack in multiple media sources, the reported symptoms experienced by victims, videos and images showing two assessed barrel bombs from the attack, and reliable information indicating coordination between Syrian military officials before the attack,” the White House assessment said, but did not give details on whether the information on the officials was from intercepts, informers or other channels. The White House said the Douma poison gas attack was part of a major offensive on the rebel-held area by the regime, and that regime helicopters were seen dropping improvised “barrel bombs” on the district. “Multiple government helicopters were observed over Douma on April 7, with witnesses specifically reporting a Mi-8 helicopter, known to have taken off from the Syrian regime’s nearby Dumayr airfield, circling over Douma during the attack,” the statement said. “Numerous eyewitnesses corroborate that barrel bombs were dropped from these helicopters, a tactic used to target civilians indiscriminately throughout the war. Photos of barrel bombs dropped in Douma closely match those used previously by the regime.” Based on that evidence, the White House assessment concluded: “These barrel bombs were likely used in the chemical attack.” The statement said that “a significant body of information” pointed to the use of chlorine in the Douma attack while “some additional information” indicated that the nerve agent sarin was also used. The defence secretary, James Mattis, said on Friday evening the US was sure about chlorine use in Douma but was “not certain about sarin right now”. “Reliable intelligence also indicates that Syrian military officials coordinated what appears to be the use of chlorine in Duma on April 7,” the White House assessment said. It suggested the evidence for sarin use was based principally on the symptoms of the victims, which it says were “consistent with exposure to sarin.” Citing descriptions from the media, NGO’s and the World Health Organisation, the White House documents described constricted pupils, convulsions, and disruption to the central nervous system. “These symptoms, in addition to the dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries reported, suggest that the regime also used sarin in its attacks on April 7,” the White House said. There have been press reports citing officials as saying the US had got hold of blood and urine samples from the victims, but these were not referred to in the published evidence sheet. In it, the White House rejects Syrian government and Russian claims that the attack was staged by the last rebel group in the area, Jaysh al-Islam. “We have no information to suggest that this group has ever used chemical weapons,” it said, adding that it was unlikely the group could have fabricated such a long number of reports pointing to regime involvement. The White House said that the Assad government was “the only actor in Syria with both the motive and the means to deploy nerve agents.” “The use of helicopters further implicates the regime,” it added. “No non-state group has conducted air operations in the conflict.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/insulting-russia-furious-over-syria-attacks-as-politician-likens-trump-to-hitler","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T09:10:22Z","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin calls US-led Syria strikes an 'act of aggression'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/insulting-russia-furious-over-syria-attacks-as-politician-likens-trump-to-hitler","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/insulting-russia-furious-over-syria-attacks-as-politician-likens-trump-to-hitler","fields":{"headline":"Vladimir Putin calls US-led Syria strikes an 'act of aggression'","bodyText":"Vladimir Putin has condemned US-led military strikes in Syria as an “act of aggression” and said Russia would convene an emergency session of the UN security council over the attack. In a statement released by the Kremlin, the Russian president denied evidence of a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburb of Douma and said the strike would “have a destructive effect on the entire system of international relations”. It did not appear late on Saturday morning that the attack would trigger a military response from Russia, as Moscow reported that the missiles had steered clear of Russian military bases in the country. Speaking later on Saturday, Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, described the actions of the UK, US and France in Syria as “unacceptable and lawless”. The remarks capped an angry response from across the Russian establishment to the strikes carried out by the US, France and Britain. Russia’s ambassador to the US warned of “consequences”, while a high-ranking Russian politician compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Russia on Saturday also claimed that Syrian air defences shot down 71 of 103 cruise missiles heading for military installations using antiquated Soviet technology, potentially raising questions of whether Moscow secretly helped repel the strike. “Syrian air defence systems S-125, S-200, Buk and Kvadrat took part in repelling the missile strike,” a Russian defence ministry official said on Saturday. “These air defence complexes were produced in the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago.” The official said on Saturday Russia had completely rebuilt Syria’s air defence system over the past 18 months. Defence officials also threatened that Russia would resume discussions with Syria and other countries over the sale of modern S-300 air defence systems to protect against future US strikes. Russian embassy officials in Damascus said they did not have information on Russians harmed in the attack, a red line for the Moscow defence ministry it has said would provoke a military response, possibly against the planes and ships that launched the attack. Russian officials also said the missiles launched by the coalition of French, British and US forces did not enter the airspace protected by their air defence systems. In a strongly worded statement, Russia’s ambassador to the US described the airstrikes as a direct threat to Moscow and said insulting Putin was “unacceptable and inadmissible”. “We are being threatened,” said the ambassador, Anatoly Antonov. “We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences.” Alexander Sherin, the deputy head of the Duma’s defence committee, likened Trump to Hitler and described the strikes as a targeted threat against Russia. Russia has had a military presence in Syria since 2015 to support the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. In comments reported by the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Sherin said Trump “can be called Adolf Hitler No 2 of our time because, you see, he even chose the time that Hitler attacked the Soviet Union”, making reference to the Nazis’ first attacks against the Soviet Union in 1941, which were also launched at about 4am. In its first reaction to the strikes, Russia’s foreign ministry claimed Syria had been attacked just as it had “a chance for peace”. “First the ‘Arab spring’ tested the Syrian people, then Islamic State, now smart American rockets. The capital of a sovereign government, trying for years to survive under terrorist aggression, has been attacked,” the foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Facebook.” “You have to be quite abnormal to attack Syria’s capital just at the moment when it had a chance for a peaceful future,” she added. The comments came after Russia accused the UK of “staging” the chemical weapons attacks in Douma, the last rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus. At least 70 people are reported to have died and more than 500 injured. Russia’s defence ministry claimed the attack was faked and said it had “irrefutable evidence” the UK was instrumental in staging it as a way to justify western intervention in Syria. “We have evidence that proves Britain was directly involved in organising this provocation,” the defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. Britain’s UN envoy, Karen Pierce, described the Russian accusation as a “grotesque, blatant lie”. The US, Britain and France made the case for military action against Syria at a UN security council meeting on Friday. However, Russia’s UN ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said the three countries had ulterior motives and wanted to “oust the Syrian government and to deter, contain the Russian Federation”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/trumps-attack-on-syria-is-not-without-risk-but-its-not-world-war-three","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T04:00:20Z","webTitle":"Limited US action against Syria suggests conflict unlikely to escalate","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/trumps-attack-on-syria-is-not-without-risk-but-its-not-world-war-three","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/trumps-attack-on-syria-is-not-without-risk-but-its-not-world-war-three","fields":{"headline":"Limited US action against Syria suggests conflict unlikely to escalate","bodyText":"The US-led operation against Syria, which included contributions from the UK and France, was a modest one, limited to a short, sharp attack against targets alleged to be linked to chemical weapons. It is intended as a one-off, with no further strikes planned unless the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, conducts chemical attacks in the future. There had been speculation in advance of the attack that there was a risk it could lead to world war three. It was far from that. The operation involved more weapons than the strike the US conducted unilaterally against a Syrian airbase last year. On that occasion, 20 Syrian planes were destroyed, estimated at 20% of the Syrian air force. The US fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles in that attack: no planes were used, to minimise the risk of American losses. The attack in the early hours of Saturday morning involved almost twice as many, 110 missiles. That is not a major escalation. There were only three targets, including a research and scientific institute on the outskirts of Damascus and a storage space west of Homs, alleged to have been used to store precursors, which was hit by the RAF. The main overall aim, apart from sending a message to Assad to desist from chemical weapons attacks, was to keep as far away as possible from Russian and Iranian positions, to avoid widening the conflict by directly drawing in Russia or Iran. In spite of Russian rhetoric during the week of potential retaliation in the event of the attack, in reality Russia is far short of the military strength it enjoyed as part of the Soviet Union, with Moscow as anxious as Washington to avoid conflict. In almost every area other than nuclear weapons, Russia is heavily outnumbered in terms of defence spending and equipment compared with the US. The US spends about $550bn annually on defence compared with Russia’s $70bn. To take just one indicator, Russia has one ageing aircraft carrier while the US has 20. To help avoid conflict, the US warned the Russians in advance that the attack was coming and the air corridors that would be used, but not the targets. The US aim in Syria, as Donald Trump indicated before the Douma attack, is to leave Syria as soon as the US judges Islamic State to have been totally defeated. The attack does not change that. It was not used to attempt regime change. Assad’s presidential palace, exposed on a high hill above Damascus, was left off the target list. Assad could well be relatively happy with the outcome and the impact on him may be even less than the US raid last year. Most of his air force, as well as helicopters allegedly used to deliver the chemical weapons, remains intact. The US, British and French escaped unscathed. There was a risk from the relatively sophisticated air defence system that Russia has or even from the more antiquated Syrian ones. An Israeli plane crashed in February, which the Syrians claimed they had downed. The RAF had four Tornados in action, but at no point did they enter Syrian air space, instead flying close to the the RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus, and firing the Storm Shadow missiles, which have a range of about 300 miles. Another potential risk that failed to materialise was that an attack on chemical weapons might spread the poison, engulfing Syrian military personnel and civilians. Chemical weapons inspectors suggested such an outcome was unlikely, as a missile would blow up chemical weapons. The other risk was for a miscalculation that led to high civilian casualties. Although the US and UK military insist missiles are more precise and intelligence better, mistakes happen. In the 1991 Iraq war, the al-Amiriyah bomb shelter in Baghdad was hit killing more than 400 civilians, and there was the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. To try to avoid Russian or Iranian or civilian casualties, the US, British and French planners opted for targets they believed were far enough away to avoid such an outcome. Trump contributed to the hysteria that the world was on the verge of WWIII with his tweet: “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” In spite of rhetoric on the Russian side to match Trump’s hysteria, claiming they would shoot down incoming missiles and retaliate against US and other targets, they settled only for monitoring the incoming missiles and did not attempt to shoot them down. Moscow could respond, as it has threatened, by upgrading Syria’s air defence systems, which could worry Israel. And they could yet retaliate in some other region or by using deniable hybrid warfare, such as a cyber-attack. But equally, looking to showcase the upcoming World Cup, they might opt for a period of calm. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, had warned just hours before the raid that the cold war was back with a vengeance, potentially more dangerous because the old mechanisms for managing conflict seemed to have disappeared. But, as the night demonstrated, the mechanisms are still in place, still intact and worked as they were meant to. The US was in communication with the Russians. And the Russians did not retaliate. In the end, this raid was about as modest a one as the US-led coalition could mount, more symbolic than anything else."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/14/the-week-in-patriarchy-janelle-monae-donald-trump-circus","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T13:00:22Z","webTitle":"The White House is a circus – but at least we have Janelle Monáe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/14/the-week-in-patriarchy-janelle-monae-donald-trump-circus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/14/the-week-in-patriarchy-janelle-monae-donald-trump-circus","fields":{"headline":"The White House is a circus – but at least we have Janelle Monáe","bodyText":"Well, no one could say this week has been boring.

Still covered in Rigby’s blood, the older of the two men calmly spoke to the cameraphones of those nearby, justifying his act, declaring it revenge for atrocities in “Muslim lands”. Armed police arrived soon afterwards, shooting the attackers and detaining them. But their act had already been memorialised and continues to resonate half a decade later. Rigby’s murder was not the first time knives had been used in a violent Islamist act in the United Kingdom. In one example, three years earlier, a young east Londoner called Roshonara Choudhry walked into her MP’s constituency surgery and stabbed him, in revenge, she said, for voting for the war in Iraq. Stephen Timms survived his attack and the act was so strange at the time that it took quite a while for people properly to realise what had happened. Terrorist groups had been urging such attacks for some time. Al-Qaida’s English-language magazine, Inspire, called for people to carry out such acts regularly under the title of “just do it” terrorism. It had been particularly proud of Choudhry’s act, highlighting how a woman had been stepping up to carry out acts that men, as the magazine put it, were failing to do. But the important difference is that these previous acts had not “worked” – as in resulted in death. In contrast, Rigby’s murder was public, brutal and recorded for posterity. Shocking in its nature, it seemed a very different terrorist attack to those that we had been used to: such as the coordinated operations of 9/11 or 7/7 or the team of marauding gunmen who executed the Mumbai attack in 2008. Yet, as time passes, it is clear that Rigby’s murder has had a substantial impact on the terrorist threat picture in the UK and around the world. It was the most public terrorist knife attack and it became something of a model. In the UK alone, at least 16 plots or incidents took place afterwards in which bladed weapons were either used or planned to be used. The transmission of terrorist ideas and methodology is something that is hard to track precisely. But in the first instance, a public “success” such as this will breed emulation. This was most clearly visible in the immediate wake of the attack in two incidents. A few days after the murder in Woolwich, Alexandre Dhaussy, a French recent convert to Islam known to authorities for his radical views and petty criminal activity, stabbed a soldier in the neck as he patrolled in La Défense in Paris. A week later, after an imam called for prayers for Rigby’s family during a service at HMP Full Sutton in east Yorkshire, a group of radicalised prisoners kidnapped a guard, called for the release of other extremists and tried to take over part of the prison. In both cases, questions were asked about the degree of ideological commitment of the attackers, but it seems clear that their action was in part inspired by the murder of Rigby. In the longer term, the Woolwich action and imagery provided people with an example to copy and perceived heroic figures to follow. Almost a year later, Brusthom Ziamani, a confused young man who had moved in (now banned) al-Muhajiroun circles and looked up to Adebolajo as an older brother – he described him to his girlfriend as a “legend” – was arrested by authorities as he went to carry out an attack similar to that of his idol. For others, the act lives on in imagery and legend. Nadir Syed, another al-Muhajiroun extremist who was later convicted of planning a knife attack against authority figures, was found to have shared images of Rigby’s killers among his friends on social media. On the other side of the ideological spectrum, in January 2015, Zack Davies started hacking at a South Asian man he saw in a Tesco supermarket in Mold, Wales, shouting “white power” and saying that he was undertaking the attack in revenge for Rigby. Later investigation showed he was an isolated and paranoid young man who was obsessed with the far right. The drama of the act is transmitted through the media, which help magnify it and give it resonance. This brings it to others’ attention and gives them a sense of great acts of history at play. In the longer term, it generates a wealth of imagery that can be used and manipulated by groups to show the message they are advancing. Ultimately, the key thing the Rigby murder showed was that there was no need to overcomplicate the terrorist act. Rather than build a bomb, go to a training camp in a far-off land, source expensive and elusive weapons or gather a large network of people, you could conduct a highly effective terrorist attack using tools sitting in your kitchen and your car. Rigby’s murderers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were, in fact, committed and long-term extremists connected to the al-Muhajiroun network in the UK. They were linked to a group of British extremists in Yemen alongside the radical Islamist Anwar al-Awlaki (the preacher whose videos inspired Choudhry, she claimed, to attempt to kill Timms). Adebolajo was arrested in November 2010 in Kenya trying to get into Somalia to join the militant al-Shabaab group. He had first appeared on security services’ radars in mid-2008 on the fringes of a network linked to individuals who were trying to obtain material to conduct a terrorist attack and had been in direct contact with core al-Qaida; he had in fact been active in the al-Muhajiroun community as early as 2003 when he was only 19. Adebowale, the junior in the partnership, had a similar history. He was first investigated by MI5 in 2011, but is known to have had contact with a “subject of interest” to the security service as early as 2009. At the time, he was just coming out of a young offender institution where he had been incarcerated on narcotics charges. Leaving prison, he was reported to be wearing Islamic robes and had adopted a more hardline Islamist ideology. He then joined in the constant churn of activism that marks al-Muhajiroun, showing up at protests, attending events, shouting for cameras. So while they might have been two jihadist drifters, they nevertheless managed to carry out a terrorist act that captured attention and set a new example. We still do not know the degree to which they were talking to others about doing this, but it does not completely matter. They were committed, long-term extremists who decided to act in a way that they could and, in the process, they changed the dynamic of how we saw terrorism and terrorist acts. The UK had not experienced a successful violent Islamist terrorist attack since the 2005 bombings on London’s public transport system. Repeated cells had been disrupted, including the 2006 airlines plot, which would have probably killed more than the 9/11 attacks had it succeeded in bringing down up to eight airlines on transatlantic routes. In 2007, a double car bombing in the heart of London was thwarted (two bombs were discovered and disabled), as was a subsequent vehicle-borne explosive device at Glasgow international airport. The pattern still seemed to be for terrorists to want to achieve large-scale spectaculars that brought mass casualties or caused massive economic damage. This was not true across the ideological spectrum. Shortly before the Rigby attack, an elderly Muslim man had been stabbed and killed in Birmingham. At the time, it was not clear what had taken place in the murder of Mohammed Saleem. It later turned out to have been the act of a lone far-right extremist from Ukraine, Pavlo Lapshyn, who had arrived in the UK on a scholarship only five days earlier and set off on a one-man terror campaign. But after this stabbing, Lapshyn reverted to what he seemed to really enjoy doing and set off a series of bombs outside mosques in the West Midlands. At the time, questions were asked about whether the murder of Saleem might have inspired Adebolajo and Adebowale, but there was no evidence of this. Rather, they carried out a targeted act of terror in advance of the ideology to which they were dedicated. The Woolwich attack was shocking for many reasons. There was an ease and randomness about it that seemed so much more brutal than anything that had been seen before. The fact that the men had undertaken their act, paused for the cameras, not attacked anyone else, all showed a level of calculation and menace that suggested something new was afoot. While horrific, the suicide bombings on the London underground were comprehensible and left a distinct trail: training camps, terrorist leaders in far-off countries directing individuals and sophisticated plots involving hard-to-assemble bombs. Adebolajo and Adebowale changed this profile, showing how everyday household items were redeployable as terrorist weapons. The wider effect was to lower the threshold of what constitutes a terrorist attack, suddenly making the act much more “accessible”. And this is reflected in what came next, with repeated attempted attacks using bladed weapons, as terrorists realised that this was all that was needed. In the UK alone, at least 16 plots of this type are identifiable on the violent Islamist end of the spectrum. On the continent, the pattern is similar, with the car and bladed weapon terrorist methodology becoming depressingly ubiquitous. Terrorist groups tried to claim credit. Al-Shabaab, the group that Adebolajo had tried to join in 2010, released an hour-long video taking its title from his comments to camera. In it, al-Shabaab championed the Woolwich murder and elevated it into the pantheon of lone actor terrorist attacks. It called for others to emulate this and seemed to suggest targeting various individuals who were seen on film commenting in the wake of the murder. Just over a year later, the methodology was given an extra jolt of life by the Isis leader Abu Muhammad al-Adnani’s fatwa, which electrified the extremist community. It ran thus: “Kill a disbelieving American or European – especially the spiteful and filthy French – or an Australian, or a Canadian... and kill him in any manner or way however it may be. Smash his head with a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car…” This was of a piece with an approach advanced by an al-Qaida theorist called Abu Bakr Naji. In his book The Management of Savagery, Naji advocates the use of persistent and extreme violence to grind an enemy down, using as crude tactics as possible. Adnani’s savage litany resonated and subsequent terrorist attacks have clearly drawn inspiration from it. Numerous cells of plotters were shown to discuss its effect and appeared to accelerate plotting in response. At the same time, the speech was following a path that had already been trodden by Rigby’s murderers. The narrative tying Adebolajo and Adnani together was on display in the Nadir Syed case, where he discussed on social media the importance and inspirational impact of the Adnani fatwa, while praising Adebolajo’s act. It is in many ways extraordinary that things have turned out like this. In the first instance, the attack by Adebolajo and Adebowale, while a tragedy for the murdered soldier’s family, was in some ways a reflection of how hard it had become to launch terrorist attacks in the UK. The security services had learned how to manage the threat. Complicated plots got disrupted; networks of extremists had been penetrated. Many of those in the al-Muhajiroun circle of friends were in jail or under surveillance. Out of this effective security response emerged the assault on Rigby. But what could not be known at the time was how the simplicity of this attack would inspire others and show them an “easier” path to take, offering crazed individuals a path to perceived grandeur through others’ misery using tools they had lying around the house. The ideology was accessible through the internet and easy to regurgitate, the methodology and targeting was easy; suddenly, the idea of terrorism was no longer an elite activity for the select few who had access to specific groups and weapons. In the wake of the Woolwich attack, there was a renewed crackdown on the extremists who make up al-Muhajiroun. It did not eliminate them, but it took some off the streets and a growing number went to Syria. For them, Islamic State’s declaration of the caliphate in June 2014 changed everything, forcing them to make a choice between joining what they had advocated for years or showing themselves up as empty loudmouths. While there continued to be plots that were disrupted, the ideology spread beyond their tightknit community and sprang up in random circles and homes around the country. Khuram Butt, a known al-Muhajiroun extremist who was the focus of police investigation, was the leader of the cell who, using a van and knives, murdered eight people as they enjoyed a night out, close to London Bridge in June 2017. His act was one that had clear inspiration from his previous al-Muhajiroun comrades. Yet while diffusion of the threat picture has made it more dangerous, it has also started to tear at its coherence. It becomes quite hard to maintain a consistent ideology when you are trying to bring together organised and ideologically motivated plots with what look like random acts of terror. The spectrum from the concert massacre in Manchester to the bafflingly incompetent attack attempted by Mohiussunnath Chowdhury against police at Buckingham Palace is wide. An Uber driver angry at the world, Chowdhury entered the wrong co-ordinates into his satnav the first time and found himself stuck outside a pub before figuring out the way to Buckingham Palace. Once there, he drove at a police van, shouting: “Allahu Akbar” and was subdued by police officers with CS gas. One officer was injured as Chowdhury brandished the samurai sword he had with him. This is the issue difficult to assess: when terrorism has become so random, how does it still maintain any of its ideological power? The attacks of 11 September 2001 or the 2015 massacre at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris have an archetypal imagery about them. They capture the maxim advanced by Brian Michael Jenkins, a former US special forces officer and one of the early writers about modern terrorism, who argued that “terrorism is theatre”. The drama and scale of the act draws attention and advances a group’s message. And this is important to remember: terrorists are fundamentally seeking to advance a political ideology and message. The terrorist act is a way to deliver this. Consequently, the act needs to have drama and effect. A large network plotting to carry out a mass atrocity is a terrifying concept, which will draw attention to itself. The Rigby murder in its novelty had an equal drama. But as time went on, this approach lost its lustre. In a city where a campaign of stabbings is the major criminal activity preoccupying the police, what effect will a random ideologically motivated one have? If the act becomes indistinguishable from other murders that take place in our societies every day, how does the group continue to advance its message? This is something that al-Qaida theorists have worried about. The godfather of the lone actor methodology, Abu Musab al-Suri, highlights in his text The Global Islamic Resistance Call that campaigns repeatedly failed because of a lack of proper “education” of ideologies among terrorists. As networks were ground down through confrontation with authorities, “the cadre of supporters that had been formed through lengthy education were expended and the level of education declined among the succeeding bases of cadre”, he writes. This resulted “in the complete failure [that] manifested itself in the inability to realise the goals of the general project”. In other words, as the terrorists committing the act became more detached from the core group, the strength of the ideology was weakened. Seen in this light, it is possible that we might try to interpret the murder in Woolwich as the beginning of the end or, cleaving to caution, at least the beginning of a path that might take us towards the end. Isis, and its brutality, has extended the lifespan of this threat by years, but ultimately the trajectory will be downward. Terrorist attacks that are indistinguishable from random murders that take place in our cities or from the brazen acts of lunatics will increasingly have less power to shock. And with no coherent movement, the truly dangerous ideological core will struggle to motivate the right people to launch an effective struggle that has a goal. Rather, it will be occasional lunatics who hurt ordinary citizens but ultimately are unable to change anything. Societies have survived sustained terror campaigns and while none of this is any sort of panacea to those who lose loved ones, the terrorist project is in decline. Five years on from the murder in Woolwich, the act has achieved a totemic place in the jihadist canon. Yet, decades from now, it might be seen instead as a harbinger of the end of a movement.

MoveOn and more than a dozen other activist organizations, including Indivisible and Women’s March, have been working on the protests for weeks. The groups have set out how the emergency rallies would work in a detailed plan on trumpisnotabovethelaw.org. If Trump moved to fire Rosenstein or Mueller before 2pm local time, activists would spring into action at 5pm the same day. If the president dismissed Mueller later, protests would begin at midday the day after. CNN and the New York Times both reported this week that Trump had been weighing firing Rosenstein, who according to reports personally approved the raid on the offices and home of Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen on Monday.

Iron Stache looking good in Wisconsin Paul Ryan’s announcement that he will resign at the end of his term offered even more hope to Randy “Iron Stache” Bryce – the ironworker backed by small donations who is running in Wisconsin’s first congressional district. Trump narrowly won the district in 2016 and Bryce, a union member who has railed against tax cuts for the rich, believes he is the man to win those voters back. He’s raised $4.75m to date, with 75% coming in increments of $200 or less, the Guardian’s Dominic Rushe reported on Thursday: Bryce sees change coming, and is determined to be a leader of it. For too long politicians have served the interests of corporate donors and the rich – and not working people, he said. Trump won because he spoke to those disenfranchised people. But he lied, said Bryce, and along with Ryan he has further tilted the playing field against workers. “They won’t be happy until people in Wisconsin have dirt floors,” said Bryce. Even before he announced his resignation, Ryan had not held a public event in the district for over 900 days. Bryce said Ryan was “scared to death about” about how voters would respond to the “tax scam” – Trump’s $1.5tn tax overhaul. What we’re reading “Over decades,” writes Gabriel Winant, here at the Guardian, “employers have built and maintained a massive collective political apparatus to hold down wages.” Wages generally increase with productivity, says Winant, but while that was credible from the end of the second world war to the 1970s, since then it has not been the case. In part it’s down to a concentration in labor markets – something known as a “monopsony”, Winant says. The Nation has published a list of 10 progressive candidates it will be monitoring in the run up to the midterms. The list features mini-profiles of people like Ben Jealous, the youngest ever leader of the NAACP, who is running for governor of Maryland, and the veteran grassroots organizer Mandela Barnes, who is vying to be Wisconsin’s lieutenant governor.

This applies less to global stars like Gareth Bale and Luis Suárez, both of whom play for clubs who are always in the news, and more to foreign players with a quirky character, like the maverick talent who gains cultish adoration despite never quite living up to the hype, or the flop who disappears without a trace before surfacing again to complain about the food, the people and the weather in a scathing interview about his “English hell”. For a reminder that a world exists far beyond the Premier League, look no further than Marseille’s comeback victory in their Europa League quarter‑final against RB Leipzig. The French side had Kostas Mitroglou up front and there were more blasts from the past alongside the Fulham disappointment. Florian Thauvin, who once tried to dazzle Tyneside with the sartorial elegance of a tuxedo, scored in the 38th minute and Dimitri Payet, a hero at West Ham before his messy exit, grabbed the decisive goal with a lovely piece of skill. The nostalgia flowed after Payet’s moment of magic and there was a similar feel at the Stadio Olimpico where Roma knocked Barcelona out of the Champions League two nights earlier, with Federico Fazio hitting a level of defensive excellence that always seemed beyond him at Tottenham and Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko demonstrating there is life after Manchester City. This is not about to become a critique of Pep Guardiola’s decision to sell Kolarov last summer, or of his failure to travel back in time to stop Dzeko leaving City in 2015. Yes, it was unfortunate Dzeko destroyed Barcelona on the same night his old side went out to Liverpool but on reflection it would be setting a dangerous precedent if Guardiola is forced to take the blame for things that happened before his arrival in Manchester. Where would it end? Soon he would be apologising for Jamie Pollock’s own goal and the signing of Rodney Marsh. More to the point, Dzeko would probably be out of place in this City team. Target men rarely get Guardiola’s creative juices flowing. He flirted with the idea of having one at Barcelona, only to burn his fingers with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and he never really saw eye to eye with Robert Lewandowski at Bayern Munich. Dzeko, ultimately, probably would have been too traditional for Guardiola’s tastes. It is difficult to see him flourishing in City’s slick system. Yet there is more than one way to play, even if Guardiola’s methods tend to be the most entertaining and sophisticated, and it was fascinating watching Dzeko destroy Barcelona, if only because it was hard to remember the Bosnian producing a performance of such power and intensity against that level of opposition for City. He scored his fair share of big goals during his time in England, including the equaliser that preceded Sergio Agüero’s title-winning strike against QPR in 2012, and he was a useful impact substitute. He helped City win trophies, scored 72 times in four and a half years and was appreciated by supporters. Yet there was always the sense of unfulfilled potential, more to come, a striker playing within himself and never quite convincing Roberto Mancini or Manuel Pellegrini he deserved to be a regular starter. Dzeko, remember, was described as the new Marco van Basten when he joined City in January 2011. He had fired Wolfsburg to a historic Bundesliga title in 2009, was establishing himself as Bosnia-Herzegovina’s greatest goalscorer and looked capable of excelling in the Premier League. Yet if you want to understand why City decided to let Dzeko go, his record of three goals in four seasons in the Champions League is a good place to start. His mojo seemed to have gone by the time he joined Roma and his first year in Serie A was a struggle. He scored 39 goals in all competitions in his second season, however, and has gone up a level this year, thriving at last in elite competition. He scored a special volley in the 3-3 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October, hit the decisive goal in the last-16 victory against Shakhtar Donetsk and grabbed a lifeline for Eusebio Di Francesco’s side at the Camp Nou just over a fortnight ago. But Dzeko’s best came in a way that his critics never imagined possible. In an interview with the Guardian’s Sasa Ibrulj last October, he railed against the idea that he does not work hard enough for the team. “Every match I give my very best,” he said. “Every single match.” But those were just words. The real substance came when he rose to the occasion against Barcelona with a display of immense leadership, occupying Gerard Piqué and Samuel Umtiti with his strength and aerial prowess, scoring early before giving Roma’s comeback unstoppable momentum when he won a penalty in the second half. Now, at the age of 32, Dzeko is in his first Champions League semi-final and it is strange to think the story would have taken a different direction if Chelsea had succeeded in bringing him back to the Premier League in January. Olivier Giroud ended up at Stamford Bridge instead and made no impact when Chelsea lost to Barcelona last month. Dzeko must be relieved Roma stood firm. Italy suits him."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/13/canada-mosque-shooter-alexandre-bissonnette-trudeau-trump-refugees-travel-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T19:19:42Z","webTitle":"Canada mosque shooter says he was motivated by Trudeau welcoming refugees","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/canada-mosque-shooter-alexandre-bissonnette-trudeau-trump-refugees-travel-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/13/canada-mosque-shooter-alexandre-bissonnette-trudeau-trump-refugees-travel-ban","fields":{"headline":"Canada mosque shooter says he was motivated by Trudeau welcoming refugees","bodyText":"The man who shot and killed six men at a Canadian mosque told police that his attack was motivated by Justin Trudeau’s message of welcome to refugees following Donald Trump’s travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. Alexandre Bissonnette pleaded guilty last month to six charges of first degree murder and now faces up to 150 years in prison for the attack in which 19 other people were injured. In video footage of his police interrogation shown during a sentence hearing on Friday, Bissonnette told officers that he had grown increasingly preoccupied by the the threat of terrorism. But the former social sciences student said the final motivation for his attack was Trudeau’s response to Trump’s travel ban, when he became convinced his family would be threatened if more refugees came to Canada. “I was, like, sure that they were going to come and kill my parents also, and my family,” he said. A day after Trump’s travel ban unleashed chaos and uncertainty at airports across the US and the world, Trudeau made international headlines with a series of tweets highlighting the contrast with his own government’s stance. “To those fleeing persecution, terror &amp; war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada,” he tweeted on January 29, 2017. The following day, Canada announced it would offer temporary residence to those left stranded by Trump’s ban. “I was watching TV and I learned that the Canadian government was going to take more refugees who couldn’t go to the United States, and they were coming here,” Bissonnette told police. “I saw that and I, like, lost my mind. I don’t want us to become like Europe. I don’t want them to kill my parents, my family,” he said. “I had to do something, I couldn’t do nothing. It was something that tortured me.” Bissonnette said that he became obsessed with the 2014 attack in which an Islamist gunman killed a soldier at the national war memorial and then stormed parliament, and the 2016 truck attack that killed 86 people in the French resort city of Nice. He also told police he had struggled with depression, and hoped medication would quell his anxiety. “I haven’t felt well for months and months and months and I don’t know what to do,” he told the officer during the interrogation. He had previously researched the Quebec City Islamic cultural center online and knew its prayer schedule when he drove to it on 29 January 2017, armed with a rifle and handgun. More than 50 people were at the mosque when the shooting began during evening prayers. The attack, which lasted less than three minutes, killed six men and injured 19 others. After the shooting, Bissonnette was apprehended by officers six miles from the mosque. Over the last week, the court saw for the first time the methodical nature of Bissonnette’s attack on the mosque, in which he paused a number of times to reload his semi-automatic Glock handgun and shoot injured people on the ground. Video footage also shows the quick reactions of mosque attendees sheltering children and what prosecutors called the “heroism” of Azzeddine Soufiane, a grocer who was killed by Bissonnette as he attempted to tackle the gunman."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/15/ethiopians-urge-britain-return-bones-of-stolen-prince-and-loot","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T23:05:34Z","webTitle":"Ethiopians urge Britain to return bones of ‘stolen’ prince after 150 years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/15/ethiopians-urge-britain-return-bones-of-stolen-prince-and-loot","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/15/ethiopians-urge-britain-return-bones-of-stolen-prince-and-loot","fields":{"headline":"Ethiopians urge Britain to return bones of ‘stolen’ prince after 150 years","bodyText":"For 150 years, Ethiopians have been asking when Prince Alemayehu will come home. The orphan prince, a descendant of Solomon, was taken to England – some say “stolen” – after British soldiers looted his father’s imperial citadel following the Battle of Maqdala in 1868. He died at the age of 18, after an unhappy childhood, and was buried at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle at the request of Queen Victoria. Now, as discussions take place with the Victoria &amp;Albert Museum about the return of royal treasures taken by British forces during the battle, the Ethiopian government told the Observer it is “redoubling” its efforts to finally bring back the prince’s remains. Last week there were celebrations in Addis Ababa to commemorate the life of the prince’s father, Tewodros II, on the 150th anniversary of his death in the battle. A selection of the objects in the V&amp;A’s possession went on display last week. Lemn Sissay, the poet and author, has joined the campaign to repatriate the young prince’s remains. Sissay, whose birth mother was Ethiopian, has been invited to speak about Alemayehu by the Ethiopian goverment in June. “It’s my goal, my sincere hope that in my lifetime [Alemayehu] will go back to Ethiopia,” Sissay told the Observer. “This isn’t going away because I’m not going away.” Sissay, who was fostered then put into care in Lancashire despite the wishes of his mother, feels there is a resonance between Alemayehu’s life and the widespread international adoption of Ethiopian children, a practice which was banned by the Ethiopian government earlier this year. “The first corrupt theft of an Ethiopian child was this one in 1868,” Sissay said. “He was taken from his family. He deserves, too, for his remains to go back to Ethiopia, back to where he was stolen from.” The campaign to return Alemayehu began in earnest in 2006, when the Ethiopian president wrote to the Queen asking for the remains to be exhumed, but the request was rebuffed. According to the Ethiopian embassy, the Lord Chamberlain replied on behalf of the Queen, saying that “while Her Majesty was in favour of repatriation [...] identifying the remains of young Prince Alemayehu would not be possible.” The prince’s remains had been added to a grave at St George’s Chapel with nine others. Campaigners for his repatriation believe the key to identifying the remains may lie in in the National Army Museum, which has a collection devoted to the battle of Maqdala. In the aftermath, as the British forces carried off crowns, scrolls and fine clothing, a war artist cut a lock of Tewodros’s hair. The lock of hair is now at the National Army Museum in London. Sissay and others believe that a DNA test could establish whether any of the remains in the grave match it. “Slowly but surely the excuses we’ve been given, that we can’t find him because we can’t identify the bones, doesn’t hold water,” Sissay said. After the sacking of Maqdala, a British officer named Tristram Speedy took the prince and his mother, the Empress Tiruwork, to Britain. The empress died on the way and before the party was due to embark on a ship from Alexandria in Egypt, the officer ordered all the other Ethiopians to return. Speedy took Alemayehu to his home in the Isle of Wight, where he was presented to Queen Victoria. Speedy was paid a stipend for the education of the prince, who went to Rugby school then Sandhurst. “At school he suffered racism, his letters show,” Sissay said. “He had to sleep on the floor at one point. “He was taken away from all of his family and told he had to build a relationship with this man, who was one of those responsible for his father’s death.” The intensity of feeling among Ethiopians is growing, according to the Ethiopian embassy. “Ethiopians revere Prince Alemayehu as a young prisoner of war – he was only seven years old when taken hostage,” it said in a statement. “Prince Alemayehu remains the son of a hero, who chose to end his own life, rather than surrender to foreign soldiers. Ethiopians view the Prince with the same level of affection and respect.” Addis Ababa is also stepping up pressure for the return of objects taken after the Battle of Maqdala, which include a gold crown with intricate filigree work, a royal wedding dress and hundreds of illuminated manuscripts, including six which are kept in the Queen’s personal library at Windsor. Maaza Mengiste, an Ethiopian-American writer, said: “We’re seeing global renewed interest in the return of looted items currently in British museums and the library, and I am hoping that with this will come increasingly vocal calls to finally do what is right and let Prince Alemayehu’s remains be sent back to his home country. “ Embassy officials said that Ethiopians viewed the status of the Maqdala artefacts with “anger as well as fervid desire to leave no stone unturned to secure their restitution to Ethiopia”. “Great Britain should not have accepted treasures extracted by way of plunder,” the embassy said in a statement, adding there was a “strong-willed desire to right a historic wrong. “The government of Ethiopia is committed to ensuring that Her Majesty the Queen’s 2007 consent to repatriate the remains of Prince Alemayehu is realised. The Embassy will therefore redouble efforts to realise the repatriation of the remains of Prince Alemayehu, as well as looted items from Maqdala.” Maqdala 1868 A force of 13,000 soldiers from India was sent in 1868 under the command of Sir Robert Napier into the Abyssinian mountains to capture the mountain capital of Maqdala, at the top of a dead volcano. Prince Alemayehu’s father, Tewodros II, had taken a group of missionaries hostage in the hope of persuading the British to join him in a campaign against the Ottoman empire. Some 700 Abyssinians died and more than a thousand were injured in the siege. When Tewodros saw he had lost, he shot himself with a pistol that had been a gift from Queen Victoria. The fortress was looted and razed to the ground. It is said to have taken 15 elephants and 200 mules to remove the loot."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/apr/15/clipper-teabags-plastic-biodegradable-public-pressure","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T05:04:04Z","webTitle":"As public pressure grows, Clipper is latest brand to end use of plastic in teabags","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/15/clipper-teabags-plastic-biodegradable-public-pressure","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/apr/15/clipper-teabags-plastic-biodegradable-public-pressure","fields":{"headline":"As public pressure grows, Clipper is latest brand to end use of plastic in teabags","bodyText":"The UK’s longest-established Fairtrade tea brand has become the latest to ditch synthetic sealants in its teabags, amid mounting consumer pressure on manufacturers to help cut down on plastic pollution. Clipper Teas – which champions the unbleached teabag – hopes to introduce a new, fully biodegradable bag free of polypropylene, a sealant used across the industry to ensure bags hold their shape, by the summer. Meanwhile a new national petition from the campaigning organisation 38 Degrees, calling on other brands to do the same, has attracted more than 125,000 signatures. Its first petition, directed at the UK’s largest tea brand, PG Tips, attracted 230,000 signatures in February – at which point it announced that its new eco-friendly pyramid teabags – made from a plant-based material that is 100% renewable and biodegradable – were about to go on sale in UK supermarkets. The Observer reported in January that the Co-op, which sells 367 million teabags a year, is creating a fully biodegradable paper teabag for its own-brand Fairtrade 99 tea. The new bags are expected to go on sale by the end of the year. Amid growing concern about plastic waste, many consumers have been shocked to learn that most UK teabags are not fully biodegradable. Twinings recently announced it is “actively developing and trialling fully biodegradable tea bags”, while Yorkshire Tea and Tetley confirmed they are looking at removing plastic from teabags. Yorkshire Tea hopes to make the switch after the end of trials in June. Clipper Teas was the UK’s first Fairtrade tea brand – launched in 1994 – and is known for using only unbleached teabags and 100% natural ingredients. Adele Ward, brand controller at Clipper, said: “To help minimise our impact on the environment our aim is to create a teabag paper made from all plant-based material. Not only will it be biodegradable, but it will remain unbleached and adhere to our organic principles. The development of this new substrate, which is completely GM free and 100% unbleached, means it is taking a little more time to finalise, but is a key priority. We hope to have a plastic-free teabag in operation by the summer.” According to the trade body the UK Tea and Infusions Association, teabags account for 96% of the 165 million cups of tea drunk every day in the UK. “It will come as a shock to many tea drinkers that almost all of the 165 million cups of tea are adding to our burgeoning plastic crisis,” said Ben Craig, campaign manager at 38 Degrees. “If Clipper and PG Tips can switch, there is no excuse for Britain’s other big tea companies like Typhoo – who must now live up to their environmental responsibilities.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/13/odious-use-of-chemical-weapons-must-not-be-ignored-says-may","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T21:04:16Z","webTitle":"Odious use of chemical weapons must not be ignored, says May","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/odious-use-of-chemical-weapons-must-not-be-ignored-says-may","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/13/odious-use-of-chemical-weapons-must-not-be-ignored-says-may","fields":{"headline":"Odious use of chemical weapons must not be ignored, says May","bodyText":"Theresa May has made a strident argument to her cabinet ministers that Britain should not allow the creeping erosion of the taboo of using chemical weapons that been an international norm since the first world war, the Guardian understands. Downing Street said there is still no precise timetable for further military action, most likely to commence over the weekend, but the prime minister is understood to have argued in her opening address to cabinet that any British action in Syria should be limited to precise targeting of chemical weapons facilities and distribution. May told her cabinet, which was recalled on Thursday to discuss next steps in the international response to the Douma chemical attack, that the UK’s intention was not regime change or prolonged involvement in the Syrian civil war. The prime minister has previously said her administration considers it highly likely Syrian forces were behind the atrocity. Speaking to ministers, she said the UK had long striven to uphold the international norm that the use of chemical weapons was abhorrent, but in recent years that norm had been eroded, citing a pattern of behaviour from the Assad regime in Syria. That norm must be restored, she said. A government source said the prevention of the normalisation of chemical weapons was the whole rationale behind May’s decision that Britain should join any international response. Any agreed military response would be focused on that, the source said. May spoke to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, late on Friday night, after speaking to Donald Trump overnight on Thursday. Earlier on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn also accused May’s government of “waiting for instructions” from the US on how to proceed in the Syrian crisis, but said Trump was giving “alarmingly contradictory signals”. The Labour leader and his Liberal Democrat counterpart, Vince Cable, received a security briefing from the government on Friday afternoon. Corbyn has insisted he wanted to see the evidence of who was behind the apparent chemical weapons attack in the town outside Damascus, which has killed more than 40 people. “I want to know who did it. If there is proof the regime did it, they must be held responsible. If there’s a proof anybody else did it, they must be held responsible,” he said in an interview with Sky News. “I would say very strongly to Russia and the US: ‘Stop blocking each other’s resolutions’.” Russia has repeatedly used its security council veto to block resolutions on Syria, including one on Tuesday that would have established an independent investigation into the suspected use of chemical weapons. Corbyn denied that it was pointless, given Russia’s record, to continue to call for UN investigations. “Anything that brings a cessation of the use of chemical weapons moves us nearer, if not totally, to a ceasefire and a reopening of the Geneva talks which has got to be the right way forward.” The prime minister is likely to face severe criticism from opposition MPs and members of her own party if she does not give MPs a vote in parliament on extending UK military action in Syria, but appears to be prepared to face down any condemnation if allies decide to act over the weekend. Any further delay would put intense pressure on May to hold a vote in parliament, which returns from recess on Monday. If the government does not offer a debate, both Labour and the Scottish National party are planning to demand that the Speaker, John Bercow, grants one on Tuesday. Though Downing Street says no decision has been taken about the sequence of events, it will be argued that under royal prerogative May is not required to seek the permission of MPs, and under the convention that emerged after the Iraq war, she may also act alone in some circumstances, including to preserve the operational security but also to prevent humanitarian catastrophe. The former attorney general Dominic Grieve has said there was no legal basis for a punitive raid to deter the Syrian regime from repeating what he called its “flagrant breach” of the international convention banning chemical weapons – except under the doctrine of humanitarian necessity. That is the UN convention on the responsibility to protect, agreed in 2005, which was the basis of David Cameron’s unsuccessful appeal to parliament over Syrian intervention in 2013. A team of inspectors from the international chemical weapons watchdog is due to start an investigation on Saturday into the attack in Douma."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/13/cold-war-un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres-syria-douma-gas-skripal-salisbury","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T21:00:03Z","webTitle":"Syria crisis has brought cold war back with a vengeance – UN","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/cold-war-un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres-syria-douma-gas-skripal-salisbury","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/13/cold-war-un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres-syria-douma-gas-skripal-salisbury","fields":{"headline":"Syria crisis has brought cold war back with a vengeance – UN","bodyText":"Relations between the west and Russia have deteriorated sharply amid concerns about a US-led military strike in the Middle East, prompting the United Nations secretary general to declare “the cold war is back with a vengeance”. Adding to tensions on an extraordinary day of tit-for-tat exchanges, the UK published previously classified intelligence making fresh claims about the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, including that Russia had tested whether nerve agents could be applied to door handles. Military planners in the US, Britain and France, awaiting a final decision from their respective governments, are preparing plans for airstrikes in Syria in retaliation for an alleged chemical weapons attack by the Russian-backed president, Bashar al-Assad. Although anxious to avoid hitting Russian planes and military personnel based in Syria, the danger is of miscalculation and Russian retaliation. António Guterres, seemingly alarmed by the speed of events, told an emergency meeting of the UN security council that the current volatility could have profound ramifications in the Middle East and beyond. The UN secretary general suggested the danger was even greater than during the cold war because the safeguards that existed then to manage such a crisis “no longer seem to be present”. He added that there was no military solution to the Syrian conflict. On a day of rapid developments that underscored the rationale behind Guterres’ comments: The UK published previously classified intelligence claiming Russian military intelligence had targeted the email accounts of Sergei and Yulia Skripal since 2013 and had tested whether door handles could be used to deliver nerve agents. It said the highest concentration of the nerve agent found in Salisbury had been on the door handle. The Russian ambassador to the UK said it would produce its own dossier setting out an alternative version of what had happened in Salisbury. The Russian defence minister, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, claimed to have direct evidence that Britain had orchestrated the alleged chemical attack at Douma in Syria. The UK, he said, was “directly involved in the provocation”. Although the US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said no decision has yet been taken on military action, the White House said it had “a high level of confidence” that the Syrian regime carried out the chemical weapon attack in Douma. The US, UK and France continued to build up military resources in the eastern Mediterranean. The fresh claims about the Salisbury attack were made in a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK’s national security adviser, to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. It is extremely rare for the UK to make such intelligence public. The decision to go public was prompted by the UK coming off second best over the last few weeks in the war of words with Russia over responsibility for the attack. The surprise move by the intelligence agencies, who usually jealously guard their information, escalates tensions with Russia. In his letter, Sedwill, who has an overview of the work of all the British spy services, said: “I know that Nato will remain seized of the need to confront the increasingly aggressive pattern of Russian behaviour of which the attack in Salisbury was an acute and recent example.” His letter filled in some of the intelligence that Theresa May referred to when she made a House of Commons statement saying Russia was “highly likely to have been behind the attack. In response, the Russian ambassador in London, Alexander Yakovenko, who seemed to be caught on the hop by the Sedwill letter, announced that the embassy would be publishing its own report on the attack. “The British government still hasn’t produced any evidence in support of its position that would confirm their official version,” he told a press conference, at which he showed footage of Tony Blair apologising for intelligence mistakes made in the run-up to the Iraq war. “We get the impression the British government is deliberately pursuing the policy of destroying all possible evidence.” In his Nato letter, Sedwill said the nerve agent novichok had been developed at the Russian research facility in Shikhany as part of an offensive chemical weapons programme with the codename Foliant. Sedwill said Russia regarded at least some of its defectors as “legitimate targets for assassination”, with the suggestion that they could include Skripal, a former member of the GRU, Russian military intelligence, who was convicted by Russia of espionage in 2004 after working for MI6. “We have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals, dating back at least as far as 2013, when email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists,” Sedwill wrote. “During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons. This programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents, including by application to door handles. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same programme.” He said Russia had continued developing small amounts of novichok over the past decade. “Russia’s chemical weapons programme continued after the collapse of the Soviet Union,” he added. “By 1993, when Russia signed the chemical weapons convention (CWC), it is likely that some novichoks had passed acceptance testing, allowing their use by the Russian military. “Russia’s CWC declaration failed to report any work on novichoks. Russia further developed some novichoks after ratifying the convention. In the mid-2000s, President [Vladimir] Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme. It is highly unlikely that any former Soviet republic (other than Russia) pursued an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence. It is unlikely that novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (eg a criminal or terrorist group).” The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is linked to the United Nations, confirmed on Thursday that a novichok nerve agent had been used in the Salisbury attack. Sedwill wrote: “I would like to share with you andallies further information regarding our assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the Salisbury attack. Only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and the motive.” The failure of the UK to release intelligence had left a vacuum that Russia had filled with various alternative explanations and scenarios for the attack. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a British chemical weapons expert, said he was delighted some of the intelligence had finally been made public, expressing regret it had not been done earlier. “I think we had been losing the information battle and we had to get on the front foot,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/13/trinidad-homphobic-laws-win-case-commonwealth","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-13T23:04:05Z","webTitle":"We won in Trinidad.

Now it’s time to end all homophobic laws in the Commonwealth","bodyText":"I am a gay Trinidadian. Until three days ago, making that statement could have landed me in prison. Before Thursday, it was a crime for adults of the same gender to have sex. Our “buggery” law imposed 25 years’ imprisonment. All other intimacy between two women or two men risked five years’ imprisonment under the demeaningly named offence of “serious indecency”. Last year I said enough is enough and sued my country to change the law. My legal team, led by Richard Drabble QC, argued that these laws violate the right to privacy, family life, equality before the law and freedom of expression. On Thursday we won the case – and resoundingly so. Mr Justice Rampersad in the high court of Port of Spain, our capital, handed down judgment agreeing that each of these rights was violated. On a rough count, there are about 100,000 LGBTQ+ people in Trinidad and Tobago. Finally, each of us is free from the fear of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment simply for living our lives. Listening to the judgment, I broke down in tears as I realised that I had won, that my country – for the first time – had accepted me for who I am. I can’t describe how it feels to hear a judge say that as a gay man I have an inherent human dignity with which the state must not interfere. His firmness on this point was commendable – laws that criminalise homosexuality, he ruled, are as heinous as those that allowed apartheid, segregation and the Holocaust. I agree. The judge recognised that when human dignity is stripped away, so as to render one characteristic “superior” to another, society goes awry. After the judgment, as I stood outside the Hall of Justice wrapped in a rainbow flag, I had finally been clothed in dignity. This judgment was the culmination of my 30 years of human rights’ activism. I was born in the 1960s, the decade that Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain. Like other former colonies, we inherited Britain’s anti-gay laws. But our Spanish, French and Dutch-speaking neighbours do not criminalise homosexuality, and never did. As a teenager, it was obvious to others that I was gay. The bullying was incessant and cruel. In the 1980s I left Trinidad for London, unable to cope with the daily homophobia. In 1992 I returned home but the persecution had not changed. In 1996 I was forced away again. I came back between 2011 and 2014 to try to progress this issue through engagement and advocacy but the homophobia remained intolerable. In the end, this saga of suffering won me my case. My having to leave – effectively forced into exile – was submitted as evidence to the court of how vile these laws are. Litigation was a last resort for me, so that I could return home. That is all I have ever wanted to do. It has been the most humbling of experiences, with challenges that I could not have imagined. The religious groups who supported the retention of the laws were polite opponents, as much as we disagreed. The shock to me was that those who should most support decriminalisation most disrupted my challenge. My only support from any NGO – in Trinidad, the UK or internationally – was some funding from an HIV-prevention charity. In December 2015 I approached the Human Dignity Trust, a London-based charity whose sole purpose is to bring about the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It said it would help. I was overjoyed, but then it dropped me without explanation, blocking my remaining routes to funding in the process. Just as upsetting was how my country’s Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) reacted to my challenge. It submitted a document to court supporting the retention of the criminal laws. At that stage, I almost gave up. I ran my case on a shoestring of around £20,000 over two-and-a-half years. That’s a mere 20p per LGBTQ+ person no longer a criminal. I now hope that my lean model becomes the norm, whereby activists are in control, unbeholden to global organisations that often only profit from our suffering. It was only the support of my legal team that kept me going – Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel in Trinidad, and Peter Laverack in London, who in particular has been my rock, and was the architect of the legal arguments that won the day. At the EOC, it turned out that a junior member of staff submitted the document without authority. The day before the trial, thankfully, it was withdrawn. After the many bumps in the road, it was the rule of law that prevailed. For that, all Trinbagonians can rejoice. My dignity is their dignity is our dignity. The words of my country’s national anthem say that its citizens of every kind “find an equal place”. Now, finally, I have. With the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in London from Monday, I am hopeful that our victory offers pause to the 36 of 53 Commonwealth countries that still criminalise homosexuality. Nine are in the Caribbean. The right to dignity that Trinidad and Tobago’s court recognised in me is universal – in lesbians criminalised in Uganda and Tanzania, and in gay men criminalised in India and Singapore. It is imperative that LGBTQ+ is on the agenda in London. The event offers both a safe space for this discussion and an opportunity for the capital of the former empire that bequeathed us these heinous laws to help rid us of them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/apr/13/grand-national-2018-total-recall-talking-horses-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-14T09:57:47Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Total Recall may be the best bet for open Grand National","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/13/grand-national-2018-total-recall-talking-horses-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/apr/13/grand-national-2018-total-recall-talking-horses-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Total Recall may be the best bet for open Grand National","bodyText":"Total Recall (5.15) can prove the answer to a fantastically competitive Grand National at Aintree. Having looked like becoming a hot favourite when the weights were revealed two months ago, he remains a very reasonable price at 12‑1 and can give his trainer, Willie Mullins, a second success in the race he first won with Hedgehunter in 2005. Some will be put off by the fact that he fell when last seen but I can forgive that tumble, at the third-last in a typically hot Cheltenham Gold Cup. Many a good horse has been caught out by that fence and although the National field usually goes a strong pace, it is unlikely to match the Gold Cup for intensity. Timeform published some numbers this week showing that horses who fell last time out have a weak record in the National over the past decade. But those with longer memories will recall Rhyme N Reason falling in the 1988 Gold Cup and then landing the National the following month, while Red Marauder fell at the first fence in his prep run before winning at Aintree in 2001. The owner JP McManus also has a big chance of a second National success, though possibly not with his most obvious contender, Anibale Fly, whose jumping is not to be trusted. His Carlingford Lough is a class horse on a fair weight and has usually shown his best form in the second half of a season. Regal Encore also has each-way possibilities at big odds. Tiger Roll has to be on the short list after his cross-country success at Cheltenham, though he cannot be relied upon for a similarly doughty effort on back-to-back starts. Milansbar only just misses my top four and can keep Bryony Frost in contention for a long way.

The Egypt international maintained his phenomenal strike-rate on Saturday when he scored his 30th Premier League goal of the campaign in the 3-0 home win against Bournemouth. Salah’s exquisite header beyond Asmir Begovic was also his 40th goal in all competitions – a figure previously achieved at Liverpool by only Roger Hunt (1961-62) and Ian Rush (1983-84 and 1986-87). No Liverpool player has reached the milestone faster than Salah, however, who has scored 40 goals in 45 games for Jürgen Klopp’s side. Liverpool’s £36.9m summer signing from Roma is firmly on course to win the Golden Boot and player of the season awards but admits he would swap them all for victory in the Champions League. Salah, who faces his former club in the semi-finals, said: “It means a lot. I try to score every game to help the team and to get the points. That is the most important thing for us, that we play as a team, as 11 players, and so each goal for me is to help the team. It is a great feeling, of course it is a great feeling, but in the end I am just happy to score and help the team. If I had a choice between the Champions League and the Golden Boot, then of course it would be the Champions League, no doubt the Champions League. To win the Champions League is huge for everyone. I don’t care about the rest.” The Liverpool forward is five goals ahead of Tottenham’s Harry Kane in the race to be the Premier League’s leading scorer and, despite targeting the club’s sixth European Cup success, admits the individual honour is a motivation. “It is in my mind,” said Salah. “I cannot lie, it is in my mind. But you can see against Bournemouth that everyone in the team tries to pass the ball to me to help me. I am happy to have this feeling, you feel all the team want to support you and want to help you score goals. I am also sure that Tottenham’s players try to help Harry Kane and also Manchester City’s try to help Sergio Agüero. It’s like that but in the end we play as a team.” Salah tweeted: “Wooooooow really?” after Kane was awarded a goal against Stoke by the Premier League goals accreditation panel but declined to be drawn further into the controversy. “I don’t want to say anything about that!” he said with a laugh. “In the end they said it’s his goal so it’s finished for me. Now we still have four games and they have five or six games so I have to think about my games and we will see. I think the way we play gives us all more chances to score. You can see with Bobby Firmino, he has scored a lot of goals this season. It’s also a different season for him. The way we play helps us to be in front of the goal all the time.” Firmino struck his 25th goal of the season in all competitions to seal a comfortable defeat of Eddie Howe’s team. Bournemouth had fallen behind to an early Sadio Mané goal but settled into the game, with Nathan Aké defending well against Salah, before the Egyptian peeled away from his marker to convert a cross from the excellent Trent Alexander-Arnold. “It was very difficult,” Aké said. “In a split second he [Salah] is gone. If there is no pressure on the ball, then he can make incredible movements in behind you, so it’s really, really difficult.” Virgil van Dijk jokingly called Salah “lucky” as Liverpool’s leading marksman discussed his 40-goal milestone after the game. The 25-year-old admitted he is now targeting Rush’s all-time Liverpool record of 47 goals in a season. Salah added: “It is very close, just seven goals. But let’s see! I don’t know how many games there is to go but we have the Premier League and semi-finals of the Champions League to play. I will try my best to score again and help the team.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/apr/16/enoch-powell-rivers-of-blood-speech-brexit-right","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T04:59:10Z","webTitle":"Enoch Powell is gone, but his hateful tricks are still with us | Matthew d’Ancona","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/enoch-powell-rivers-of-blood-speech-brexit-right","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/16/enoch-powell-rivers-of-blood-speech-brexit-right","fields":{"headline":"Enoch Powell is gone, but his hateful tricks are still with us","bodyText":"I was the last person to interview Enoch Powell. In October 1996, only 16 months before his death, he was frail and softly spoken, though still formidably articulate. Our conversation ranged from John Major’s politics, to St John’s Gospel, to the poet AE Housman. But what most exercised him was Europe. “I have lived into an age in which my ideas are now part of common intuition, part of a common fashion,” he said. “It has been a great experience, having given up so much, to find that there is now this range of opinion in all classes, that an agreement with the EEC is totally incompatible with normal parliamentary government.” Why was this so? “The nation has returned to haunt us.” Twenty years later, in the Brexit referendum, his mystical claim was made all too real. In a later exchange, Powell insisted that he had never delivered a speech on “race”, only “immigration”. But this was a distinction without a difference – as was made admirably clear in Amol Rajan’s excellent Radio 4 programme on Saturday marking the 50th anniversary of Powell’s infamous “rivers of blood” speech. Hearing the text reread in its entirety – broken up into sections and interspersed with critical analysis – I was forcefully struck by how bad it was. For all its artful rhetoric and sonorous phrases, it relied to an appalling extent upon dubious anecdotage, ludicrous assertions (white Britons would become “strangers in their own country”), and – most disgracefully – a leap from an argument about specific legislative proposals to a totally unsupported prophecy of bloodshed and immolation. Yet it is idle to deny the speech’s significance at the time and in the intervening half century. History, properly practised, requires a constant readiness to remember infamy with as much clarity as progress. To shirk this task is to reduce it to a heritage industry, a gallery of approved nostalgia. The present should never be a safe space sealed off and insulated from the past.Indeed, it is precisely when our sense of history falters that populism and autocracy flourish. As David Andress argues in his recent book, Cultural Dementia, societies are most vulnerable to injustice and bigotry when they lose their “anchorage in the past … Anger, bitterness and horror coexist with fond illusion and placid self-absorption.” Powell was wrong about so much. Yet Powellism found its purest expression in the 2016 EU referendum result, which enshrined the convergence of two of his greatest fixations: hostility to immigration and opposition to Britain’s membership of the EU. Nigel Farage’s disgusting “breaking point” poster was the clearest expression of this fusion. But it would be a mistake to imagine that neo-Powellism is confined to the dwindling ranks of Ukip. Since the referendum, we have heard Tory ministers suggesting that companies should keep lists of foreign workers, that doctors born overseas were elbowing aside British teenagers who might otherwise read medicine, that foreign students should not aspire to settle here. As Ken Clarke warned in January 2017, Powell himself “would probably find it amazing to believe that his party had become Eurosceptic and rather mildly anti-immigrant in a strange way”. It is a grave mistake to imagine that hard-right populism is the preserve of philistines such as Donald Trump and music-hall acts such as Farage. Powell, the professor and poet, knew precisely what he was doing, and the emotions he was stirring. “I deliberately include at least one startling assertion in every speech,” he said in April 1968, “in order to attract enough attention to give me a power base within the Conservative party.” Dismayed by the retreat of the empire, he believed a Tory politician could become prime minister by opposing the European project, demonising immigrants and posturing as the protector of an embattled nativism. In this personal endeavour he failed utterly, standing only once for his party’s leadership (in 1965) and securing the votes of a mere 15 MPs. Nor did his Virgilian forecast of “the River Tiber foaming with much blood” come to pass. Britain is, has long been, and will endure as a pluralist nation of multiple identities and communities. But the Powellite toolkit remains in place, and will be deployed again when those who voted leave in the hope that net immigration would be dramatically reduced realise they were misled. How long before a charismatic young rhetorician of the right declares that the “spirit of Brexit has been betrayed”? It has never been more important to recall this terrible speech, to be reminded of its trickery and its rhetorical tradecraft, and to grasp how such methods might be used again. Recollection is the foundation of vigilance. To confront the ugliness of the past is not just a right: it is a duty. • Matthew d’Ancona is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"technology/2018/apr/15/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-security-spending","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T14:39:14Z","webTitle":"Facebook paid $7.3m for Mark Zuckerberg's security last year","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/15/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-security-spending","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/apr/15/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-security-spending","fields":{"headline":"Facebook paid $7.3m for Mark Zuckerberg's security last year","bodyText":"Facebook increased its spending on security for Mark Zuckerberg by 50% last year, the company has disclosed, paying more than $7.3m (£5.1m) to protect its top executive. The security funds were required “due to specific threats to his safety arising directly as a result of his position as our founder, chairman, and CEO”, the under-fire social media company said in a new filing to US regulators. Facebook also said it spent more than $1.5m (£1m) on Zuckerberg’s travel aboard private jets in 2017, meaning that in all the company has spent about $20m on security and private planes for Zuckerberg since 2015. Security measures at Zuckerberg’s home in California are paid for by the company, according to the filing, as well as bodyguards who accompany the 33-year-old on his travels outside Facebook’s headquarters. “We require these security measures for the company’s benefit because of the importance of Mr Zuckerberg to Facebook, and we believe that the costs of this overall security program are appropriate and necessary,” the company said. Zuckerberg has come under sharp criticism for his company’s role in the spread of disinformation and political propaganda online. Last week he faced 10 hours of questions from US congressional committees but escaped largely unscathed. The hearings were prompted by the disclosure by the Observer that tens of millions of Facebook users had their data harvested by a researcher working with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. The filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that Zuckerberg continued to take a token $1 (70p) annual salary for his work at Facebook, which he founded as a student at Harvard University. Zuckerberg’s fortune, which fluctuates with Facebook’s stock price, has recently totalled about $70bn (£49bn). He consistently appears in lists of the world’s top 10 richest people. About $2.7m (£1.9m) was spent in 2017 on security for Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, according to the company. That total was only slightly higher than Sandberg’s security bill in 2016. Sandberg, who has assisted Zuckerberg on an apology tour since news broke of the exploitation of users’ data, received a total pay package last year of more than $22.5m (£15.8m) in salary, bonuses and company stock. Facebook said in the filing that the spending totals cited for Zuckerberg’s use of private planes “include passenger fees, fuel, crew, and catering costs”. Zuckerberg raised alarms last week by stating during the congressional hearings that Facebook collects “data of people who have not signed up for Facebook”, apparently for security reasons. No further information was offered on this disclosure, prompting calls from privacy campaigners for Facebook to explain how it gathers data on non-users and what information is retained by the company. Zuckerberg also warned last week of an online propaganda “arms race” with Russia and said that fighting interference in elections around the world was now his top priority as Facebook’s boss. Earlier this month the company said it had discovered and removed 273 accounts and pages that were being run on its platforms by the so-called Internet Research Agency (IRA), a notorious Russian government “troll farm”. “The IRA has repeatedly used complex networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate people who use Facebook, including before, during and after the 2016 US presidential elections,” Alex Stamos, Facebook’s chief security officer, said in a blogpost announcing the action. Prosecutors working for Robert Mueller, the special counsel, have charged Russian operatives with using social media platforms including Facebook to pose as American activists and sow political discord during the 2016 campaign."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/apr/15/hedge-funds-pressure-whitbread-to-spin-off-costa-coffee","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T15:02:57Z","webTitle":"Hedge funds pressure Whitbread to spin off Costa Coffee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/15/hedge-funds-pressure-whitbread-to-spin-off-costa-coffee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/apr/15/hedge-funds-pressure-whitbread-to-spin-off-costa-coffee","fields":{"headline":"Hedge funds pressure Whitbread to spin off Costa Coffee","bodyText":"Whitbread is under mounting pressure from hedge funds to break up its business by spinning off the Costa Coffee chain, after activist investor Elliott Advisors built up a stake of more than 6%. The US hedge fund said in a statement on Saturday that it has become the largest investor in Whitbread, which started out as a brewing business but now owns Costa, Britain’s biggest coffee outlet, and Premier Inn, the country’s biggest budget hotel company. Elliott joins Sachem Head, another US hedge fund, which owns 3.4% of the FTSE 100 company, in pushing for a demerger of Costa. Elliott believes the 2,400-strong coffee shop chain and Premier Inn are two very distinct businesses with little overlap and that £3bn of value could be created by splitting off Costa. Whitbread shares have underperformed the wider stock market in recent years. However, unlike Sachem Head, Elliott is not pushing for a sale and leaseback deal on the hotel properties and more share buybacks. Its sole strategic aim is to split off Costa. Whitbread declined to comment. Alison Brittain, Whitbread’s chief executive, has said the group is open-minded about its structure but has also warned against moving too quickly to break up the company. The idea is not new, because other investors and City analysts have repeatedly suggested that Whitbread should spin off its popular Costa chain. But Elliott has a reputation for pursuing its goals more aggressively than other investors. Whitbread’s history dates back to 1742, and it listed on the London Stock Exchange on 1948. The company grew into a sprawling leisure empire that included Beefeater, TGI Fridays and Pizza Hut restaurants along with David Lloyd Leisure gyms and Marriott Hotels. Most of these brands and the brewing operations have been sold, leaving Whitbread to focus on Costa and Premier Inn as well as the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains. Today, the company has a market value of £7.2bn and employs 50,000 people. Costa was acquired in 1995 from Sergio and Bruno Costa, who founded the chain in London in 1971. Costa has about 2,400 stores and 7,100 Express machines in the UK. The chain is being rolled out in China, while Premier Inn is expanding in Germany. The budget hotel chain is attracting increasing numbers of business travellers, who now make up half its customers. In its latest update, Whitbread unveiled a 1.5% fall in like-for-like sales at its Costa high street outlets and warned consumer demand would remain subdued – but Brittain insisted this did not spell the end of the coffee shop boom."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/apr/15/western-allies-launch-diplomatic-offensive-in-wake-of-syria-strikes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T07:07:50Z","webTitle":"Syria: western allies launch diplomatic offensive in wake of strikes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/15/western-allies-launch-diplomatic-offensive-in-wake-of-syria-strikes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/apr/15/western-allies-launch-diplomatic-offensive-in-wake-of-syria-strikes","fields":{"headline":"Syria: western allies launch diplomatic offensive in wake of strikes","bodyText":"Western powers are to attempt to inject diplomatic momentum behind the military strikes against Syrian government chemical weapon sites by calling for the UN to launch a broad investigation into Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles. The UN security council’s 15 members will meet on Monday to discuss a call for a wider push to eliminate the covert Syrian government stockpiles, placing pressure on Russia to stop protecting Bashar al-Assad’s regime from a UN inquiry into its use of chemical weapons. The draft resolution will call on the UN to try to reinvigorate the stalled peace talks, accept a ceasefire and restore humanitarian access to besieged areas. The aim is to show that the western military intervention is part of a wider political and diplomatic strategy to drive chemical weapons from Syria once and for all. The draft UN resolution, produced by the US, UK and France, includes proposals for an independent investigation into alleged toxic gas attacks in Syria to identify perpetrators. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) would be instructed to report within 30 days whether Assad’s government The security council has been deadlocked since November over establishing an investigatory mechanism to identify responsibility for a chemical attacks, as opposed to determining whether an attack has occurred. The draft resolution calls for medical evacuations and the safe passage for aid convoys to all areas of Syria. A ceasefire resolution that was adopted in February but never materialised should also be enforced, it adds. The document “demands” that the Assad regime engage in peace talks “in good faith, constructively and without pre-conditions”. The western initiative at the UN came as the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, said US troops – numbering about 2,000 – would be staying in Syria until their mission was complete. Last month, Trump surprised his military by announcing they would be coming home soon. French president Emmanuel Macron has claimed that he convinced Trump to keep troops in Syria for the long term and limit Saturday’s joint strikes to chemical weapons facilities. Haley told Fox News Sunday the troops would stay until Islamic State was defeated, Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile could not be used to harm US interests, and until there was a good vantage point to watch what Iran was doing inside Syria. “We are not going to leave until we have accomplished those things,” she said. She announced fresh US sanctions would be applied on Monday against companies linked to the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. She summed up the crisis by saying: “Assad knew that Russia had its back, Assad knew that Russia would cover for them at the United Nations, and Assad got reckless, and he used it in a way that was far more aggressive. We have to be conscious of the fact that we can’t allow even the smallest use of chemical weapons.” Haley has claimed Syria has used chemical weapons 50 times since the civil war started eight years ago. On Sunday night French president Emmanuel Macron claimed credit for keeping the US engaged in Syria. He told French TV: “Ten days ago President Trump wanted the United States of America to withdraw from Syria. We convinced him to remain.” Macron said France now wants to involve western powers, Russia and Turkey in a new diplomatic initiative to find a sustainable political solution for Syria. France in particular wants to follow up the airstrikes with a fresh effort to examine whether Russia recognises that it must restrain the reckless methods of Assad’s regime. Syria’s air force was continuing to carry out air raids on Sunday using conventional weapons. The OPCW is in Damascus to certify whether a chemical attack occurred on 7 April, which prompted Saturday’s airstrikes, but it has no wider terms of reference. EU foreign minsters are expected to back the call at a meeting on Monday in Brussels. The proposal is also likely to be discussed at an Arab League summit hosted by Saudi Arabia. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, called for urgent action to avoid a further humanitarian disaster by forestalling an expected Syrian assault on the last major opposition-held province of Idlib in north-eastern Syria. Le Drian called for the jihadist groups that dominate the area to be disarmed and for Russia to order Syria to hold back from further assaults. He said Russia “should join our efforts to promote a political process in Syria that would allow a way out of the crisis”. The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said on Sunday it would be “an extra” if the airstrikes led to Russia putting pressure on Assad to negotiate, but he said the action had been designed to deter and degrade Syria’s ability to use chemical weapons rather than change the course of the civil war. Russia and Syria both continued to denounce the air assault as an illegal act of aggression. But Russia has failed to lever any major European country into opposing the strikes; at an emergency security council meeting on Saturday, only three countries backed a Russian resolution denouncing the airstrikes as an illegal act of aggression. Vladimir Putin said in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani on Sunday: “If such actions, carried out in violation of the United Nations charter, are repeated, that would inevitably provoke chaos in international relations.” The two leaders found “this illegal action seriously damaged the prospects of a political settlement in Syria,” the Kremlin said. Haley told the security council on Saturday that US forces were “ready, locked and loaded” to mount further strikes if there were signs that Assad was planning to use chemical weapons again. The narrowly targeted pre-dawn military operation on Saturday took aim at three alleged chemical weapons facilities. The allies believe they have a further set of targets established and a system of coordination in place that will prevent the delays in the assault that reduced the impact of Saturday morning’s strikes."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/apr/15/isaiah-haastrup-autopsy-before-burial-lanre","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-15T11:45:40Z","webTitle":"Isaiah Haastrup's father forced to wait for autopsy before burying son","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/15/isaiah-haastrup-autopsy-before-burial-lanre","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/apr/15/isaiah-haastrup-autopsy-before-burial-lanre","fields":{"headline":"Isaiah Haastrup's father forced to wait for autopsy before burying son","bodyText":"The father of Isaiah Haastrup has spoken of his anguish that he has not yet been able to bury his son, who died after doctors won a court battle to remove life support from the profoundly brain-damaged one-year-old. Five weeks after Isaiah died, a coroner is investigating the cause of death and an autopsy is to be conducted. Medical experts had told the high court that Isaiah, who suffered catastrophic brain injury at birth and was being treated at King’s College hospital in south London, was unable to breathe independently, and was likely to die within a few minutes of being removed from the ventilator that he had been on since birth. He managed to breathe for eight hours on his own before dying on 7 March after his parents had exhausted all legal means to prevent life support being removed. Isaiah’s father, Lanre Haastrup, said the manner of his son’s death raised questions about his medical treatment. “It is just further anguish for us,” said Haastrup, who, with Isaiah’s mother, Takesha Thomas, was refused permission to appeal against the court judgment and failed to get the case heard before the European court of human rights. “We want to go ahead and just bury Isaiah now. We hope he will be released for burial next week after the autopsy.” He said the south London coroner, Andrew Harris, was investigating the couple’s concerns that Isaiah had managed to breathe independently for so long, despite what doctors had told the court. “He breathed for eight hours by himself. He started breathing normally, by himself, without any support,” said Haastrup. Haastrup said he now questioned Isaiah’s treatment during his short life, believing it was possible his son could have been weaned off the ventilator. “Isaiah was restricted from breathing by himself. That is what it is. Basically he was stopped breathing by himself. With all these tubes inside him from the very beginning. And he could have breathed, he could have been weaned off.” This would have allowed the couple to take him home and care for him in the community, which has been their wish, he said. “[Isaiah] didn’t just breathe – he breathed smoothly,” Haastrup said. “In the last moments of his life you see him breathing constantly. And medical notes support that.” He also questioned if tubes attaching Isaiah to the ventilator could have prevented him learning to breathe independently by causing damage to his lungs and trachea. Haastrup had reluctantly agreed to the autopsy though the family were distressed at its invasive nature. “We are going through all of this again. Having battled during his life we are now battling in death,” he said. Judge Mr Justice MacDonald ruled on 29 January it was in Isaiah’s best interests for treatment to be withdrawn. Doctors said he could not move or breathe independently and had profoundly depressed consciousness after suffering catastrophic brain damage through being deprived of oxygen at birth. At the time of Isaiah’s death, a spokesman for King’s College hospital trust said it recognised how difficult a time it had been for the family, and said Isaiah had suffered an irreversible brain injury following a rare and life-threatening obstetric emergency during his mother’s labour. “Since birth he had been fully dependent on life support with no prospect of improvement, and throughout we actively sought to engage and involve Isaiah’s parents in his care,” the spokesman said. He had added that the trust “always provided Isaiah with the very best care, and the decision to apply to the court to withdraw treatment was only made after careful consideration and after consultation with the family”. King’s College hospital said:”The medical evidence in court was clear that once ventilation was withdrawn it would be impossible to predict how long Isaiah would breathe unaided. “This was reinforced by a doctor in court who said it could be minutes, hours or days. The fact remained that Isaiah’s brain injury prevented him from breathing indefinitely, and he only lived for a short time after ventilation was withdrawn. During this time, our priority was to ensure Isaiah was comfortable and his family was supported.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/apr/14/is-it-time-for-a-lasting-power-of-attorney","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-04-16T14:49:34Z","webTitle":"Is it time for a Lasting Power of Attorney?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/14/is-it-time-for-a-lasting-power-of-attorney","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/apr/14/is-it-time-for-a-lasting-power-of-attorney","fields":{"headline":"Is it time for a Lasting Power of Attorney?","bodyText":"Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.
