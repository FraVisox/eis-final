Jon Thompson, the chief executive of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, told MPs that crashing out of the EU without a deal would be similar in costs to the £17bn-20bn price tag of the “max-fac” border arrangements preferred by Brexiters, which would require customs declarations for all imports and exports. Thompson told the Treasury select committee on Tuesday that the number of customs declarations would increase four-fold, from 55m a year to 205m a year. He cited three reports, including one commissioned by the Dutch government, on the costs of Brexit. MPs were told that an estimated £6.5bn of the total would be borne by EU businesses, but this could be passed on to UK consumers because it was a Brexit cost. The bosses of Eurotunnel and Calais Ports repeated warnings that any delays to just-in-time supply chains would disrupt business and ultimately cost the British consumer. John Keefe, the director of public affairs for Getlink, the owner of Eurotunnel, told MPs: “Warehousing has disappeared in manufacturing chains,” not just because of just-in-time delivery of spare parts but also because of “just-in-sequence” requirements on production lines. “For example, in the car manufacturing industry, the red car is followed by the blue car is followed by the green car – and when the truck arrives the wing mirrors come off in that order – red, blue and green – and they go on to the cars in that order, and if that truck is delayed then the production line is thrown into disruption.” Last week the boss of the UK’s biggest car part suppliers said the cost of closing a production line was £1m an hour. John Neill, the chief executive of Unipart, said Brexiters were in danger of “destroying the British car industry”, whichemploys 800,000 people. “One of the biggest reasons the automotive industry failed in the 1970s is that supply chains were seriously disrupted and completely unpredictable, so costs soared and quality deteriorated,” Neill said. On Tuesday Benoît Rochet, the deputy chief executive of Calais port, told the Treasury committee there was a risk of disruption because the port did not have the “specifications” of how customs would work after Brexit. “We know there is Brexit but we don’t know exactly what Brexit means,” he said, to which the Conservative chair of the committee, Nicky Morgan, responded: “You are not alone.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/can-i-cook-like-anna-wintour","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T06:59:15Z","webTitle":"Can I cook like ...

Anna Wintour?","bodyText":"How does Anna Wintour do it? She’s 68 years old and still incredibly lithe, whereas I am less than half that and increasingly doughy. So I was full of excitement about cooking the Wintour diet, a sensation that lasted for exactly 121 minutes – the two hours it took me to buy the required ingredients and the minute my alarm woke me up at 5.30am. Wintour starts her day early with a brisk game of tennis, which left me with a lot of questions, the first of which was: why am I up at 5.30am? The second was: no, seriously, why am I up at 5.30am? And the third was: tennis is a two-player game, who is the other person willing to get up at sparrowfart to play tennis? I roll over and curse the day that I was born, which I suppose is a form of exercise. The Wintour breakfast is scrambled eggs and smoked salmon on a bagel. There are certain smells that, even if I like them at other times, I cannot deal with in the early hours of the morning. Eggs are one of them. Added to the early start, I am feeling sufficiently groggy that it takes me two goes to actually scramble the damn things. The good news is that between the smell of fresh/burnt eggs and the early start, my appetite is well and truly suppressed until 1pm, when it is time for lunch à la Wintour: steak and green salad, without dressing. After a good hour Googling how Wintour likes her steak, I am none the wiser as to how it should be cooked. I assume part of the aim is to get as many nutrients and as few calories as possible so, in the interests of experimentation, I decide to steam my steak. According to Google, this is a perfectly fine way of cooking steak – but, according to my taste buds, it is not. It smells unpleasantly like a warm shoe and it tastes a lot like one, too. Still, the shoe fills me up until dinner, which is – joy of joys! – yet more protein. If being increasingly rotund is the price I pay for sleeping in past half five, having dressing on my salad and eating more than protein on protein, it’s one I’m willing to pay. Nothing feels as good as flavour tastes, if you ask me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"science/2018/jun/09/asteroid-mining-space-prospectors-precious-resources-fuelling-future-among-stars","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T17:00:28Z","webTitle":"The asteroid rush sending 21st-century prospectors into space","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/09/asteroid-mining-space-prospectors-precious-resources-fuelling-future-among-stars","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/jun/09/asteroid-mining-space-prospectors-precious-resources-fuelling-future-among-stars","fields":{"headline":"The asteroid rush sending 21st-century prospectors into space","bodyText":"In an industrial park in San Jose, California, Grant Bonin is holding what looks like the end of a metal water bottle. It is the casing, he jokes, of his company’s “flying steam kettle”: a propulsion system for small spacecraft that uses super-hot water vapour, heated to 1,000C (1,832F), to produce thrust. The company has sold about 40 to date. “It comes right out of the hole,” explains Bonin, who is the chief technology officer of Deep Space Industries (DSI). It is literally rocket science, but the ultimate aim of Bonin’s startup is even more audacious: mining asteroids. No private company has even got close to one. One of the main reasons asteroids will be mined in the future, so the thinking goes, is for the water locked in their clay deposits – and one of the chief uses of that water is likely to be as propellant for spacecraft. Probes and other spacecraft will be able to refuel in space either directly with water, or the hydrogen and oxygen that can be created from it, enabling them to zip around merrily anywhere they want with no end to their useful life. But before the idea of a solar system dotted with gas stations is realised, what is needed are more spacecraft that can actually run on water, which is where selling flying steam kettles comes in. The idea of mining asteroids is more popular than you might think. The oldest and biggest of the companies on the scene is Seattle-based Planetary Resources, established in 2009 by investors including Google cofounder Larry Page and Richard Branson. DSI was formed in 2013. Other smaller companies include Aten Engineering and the TransAstra Corporation, both also based in the US. In Britain, pursuing the idea is the Asteroid Mining Corporation (AMC). Established in 2016, it’s run by 23-year-old Mitch Hunter-Scullion, who set up the company after his Liverpool Hope University dissertation on the topic. As these companies see things, the inevitable next step for our civilisation is to expand into space. The Earth is too small for our increasing population, struggling over finite resources. To survive long term, they argue, we need to become a multi-planet, space-faring species. Human settlement won’t happen without the use of what is already out there, as transporting everything from Earth would be too expensive. Asteroids, says Bonin – with their negligible gravity making it easy to lift things off – are the “low-hanging fruit” of space resources. Unlike the Earth or moon, they’re too small to have any appreciable gravity, so it should be easy to lift material off them. Pickings are potentially getting richer as more asteroids are discovered close to Earth: about 18,000 and counting. Some of them, much closer than the ones in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, also pose a potential hazard to our planet. “The joke is that we’re threatened by giant piles of money,” says Bonin. The revolution in small low-cost satellites is opening up opportunities for these startups to prospect and survey them. Some countries are offering regulatory and financial incentives to encourage the nascent industry. In July 2017, Luxembourg introduced legislation to allow companies with a physical presence in the country to keep any resources they mine from celestial bodies. Similar legislation was introduced in the US in 2015. Luxembourg also offers research and development assistance to space resource companies and invests directly in them through a fund of around €200m established for the purpose. DSI and Planetary Resources have both benefited. Development also takes people: master’s and doctoral degrees in space resources will begin this autumn at the Colorado School of Mines, which is starting the world’s first graduate programme in the subject. And while none of the companies have got near to an asteroid yet, Nasa and other space agencies have missions on the way that will demonstrate capabilities essential for asteroid mining. Nasa’s Osiris-Rex spacecraft is scheduled to rendezvous with the Bennu asteroid – one of Earth’s most “potentially hazardous asteroids”, but also thought to be rich in water-bearing clay minerals – in December 2018. The spacecraft will flit around the half-kilometre diameter object making maps, before retrieving a 150g sample that will be returned to Earth, completing the $1bn project. Before that, in mid-2018, Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft is due to rendezvous with near-Earth asteroid Ryugu, also a sample-return mission. It follows from the Hayabusa mission, which returned 1,500 grains of dust (about one milligram) from another near-Earth asteroid, Itokawa, in 2010 – the only sample of material to be brought back from an asteroid so far. “Osiris-Rex is a proof of concept for any asteroid-mining activity,” says mission leader Dante Lauretta, a planetary scientist based at the University of Arizona. Chris Lewicki, CEO of Planetary Resources, draws a parallel with the way the US Geological Survey mapped the geology of America, helping early mining companies. “It is both public and private activities that move this forward,” he says. To mine asteroids, DSI’s long-term vision is a swarm of small low-cost spacecraft that would go out to many near-Earth asteroids at once, harvest small amounts of raw material and aggregate them at a central depot that would be constructed at a gravitationally useful spot somewhere between the Earth and the moon. “It is like honey bees going out to a lot of different flowers and flying that back to the hive,” says Bonin. The model circumvents the problem that the asteroids, with their heliocentric orbits, only fly past the Earth periodically and are therefore only accessible to mine for relatively short periods of time. From the depot, the company would then sell whatever raw material made the most sense economically. That might be water-derived propellant (which would also fuel DSI’s “swarm”), but it also might be metals such as iron and nickel – for shaping into products by 3D printers – for construction in space. “To some extent we are agnostic about what the first market will be,” says Bonin. “We think it will be propellant for gas stations in space, but we wouldn’t want to bet.” Planetary Resources is betting water will be the first market. One argument goes that there are already gas station customers in the solar system: rocket components that use liquid hydrogen and oxygen floating as space junk. If you could refuel them, you could do anything from servicing satellites to going to the surface of the moon, and that would be worth a lot of money, notes Lauretta, who is also on Planetary Resource’s science advisory board. The UK’s AMC, meanwhile, imagines first mining platinum and similar metals – relatively abundant in asteroids – and sending them back to Earth. Going by the current value of platinum, trillions of dollars’ worth is out there. But, notes Lauretta, with a large supply prices would fall. “You would probably just crash the market and we would all have tons of platinum jewellery,” he says. Hunter-Scullion acknowledges the price would depreciate, but thinks it is possible to make a tidy profit first. Water, he says, would come next. Of course, significant technical challenges abound, and they will probably cost billions to solve. To go from recovering grams to kilograms, or tonnes, is a big technological jump and large infrastructure for refining and processing the asteroid ore will need to be developed. Even things like anchoring and holding on to an asteroid can be tricky. Their surfaces are lumpy and non-spherical and each has its own size, topography and rotation speed. Hayabusa only bought back any material because the spacecraft basically tumbled across the asteroid and some dust got into the equipment. “It is going to be a learning curve and at the moment we are at the bottom of it,” says Ian Crawford, a planetary science professor at the University of Birkbeck. Whether space miners will be legally entitled to possess what they dig up also remains in question. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty (OST) – which governs international space activity – is silent on a private company harvesting space resources. It says nations can use but can’t appropriate either the moon or other celestial bodies. It puts the treaty and the national legislation in potential conflict, says Christopher Newman, a space law expert at the University of Northumbria. He predicts a dispute in the courts: “It is just a question of when.” Hunter-Scullion, meanwhile, would like to see the British government introduce its own space-mining law, like the US and Luxembourg have done, giving private companies greater rights over asteroids. But while it may be technically possible to mine asteroids a generation from now, the question is should we? One set of issues is around justice, according to Tony Milligan and Robert Sparrow, who study space ethics at King’s College London and Monash University, Australia, respectively. If asteroids belong to anyone, it is to everyone, says Sparrow. Should private companies be permitted to profit from resources that are part of our extraterrestrial commons? While the companies can be taxed, it is hard to see it being equitably distributed across humanity, says Milligan. There are also issues around safety and liability. What if mining an asteroid somehow changes its trajectory, putting it on a collision course with Earth? When it comes to the environment, mining lifeless asteroids is not expected to disrupt any ecosystems but there are still some that may be worth protecting, just like the Grand Canyon or Uluru. Ceres and Vesta, the largest asteroids in the asteroid belt, could be considered unique and distinctive, says Milligan. And do we want to live in the middle of a “giant celestial quarry”, or feel a sense that we “belong” to a place? He draws an analogy to the development of the American frontier. It was so quick and got so out of control that a lot was destroyed in the process. “It became very difficult to get people to think in the long term when there were such short-term advantages to be had,” he says. “We have done so badly at looking after our home that the desire to mine asteroids can’t help but appear profoundly arrogant,” says Sparrow. However, Bonin flips that argument on its head. “I actually think of it as an ultimate act of environmental stewardship for Earth,” he says. People need resources, he argues, and mining asteroids could ensure they were obtained without hurting the planet. Yet before any mining, comes prospecting. AMC would like to put a satellite into orbit around Earth in 2020 to spectrally analyse the near-Earth asteroids to learn what they are made of. Most have never been analyzed this way. It is planning to launch a crowdfunding campaign later this month to start raising the £2.3m it anticipates will be needed for the project. Specialised technology to detect clay minerals has been developed by Planetary Resources. It is currently using the Earth for practice (it launched a satellite into orbit in January 2018), but also has aspirations to undertake a $100m mission to the near-Earth asteroids. However, it doesn’t yet have the funds and recently had to scale back after it failed to raise investment. DSI also has ambitions to get to the near-Earth asteroids. In 2020 it intends to demonstrate a small low-cost spacecraft it calls the Xplorer (its fuel will also, in the main, be derived from water). It plans to sell the spacecraft commercially for travel into deep space. Just demonstrating the technology will be enough, believes Bonin, but instruments on board will also hopefully reveal information about asteroids’ composition, “dig-ability” and how they interact with the probes. Asteroid-mining is risky, long term and definitely “out there”. “But our pursuit of it is very pragmatic,” he says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/05/safe-standing-football-government-review-all-seat-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T13:05:37Z","webTitle":"Safe standing at football: government to review all-seat policy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/05/safe-standing-football-government-review-all-seat-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/05/safe-standing-football-government-review-all-seat-policy","fields":{"headline":"Safe standing at football: government to review all-seat policy","bodyText":"The government is poised to make its most significant shift towards allowing safe standing at football matches by commissioning a review of the policy which demands all-seat stadiums. The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, had previously been unmoved by calls to overturn the ban on standing which was introduced following the Hillsborough disaster and has been in place for more than 20 years. Crouch was criticised in some quarters for the government’s decision to reject an application by West Brom to introduce a safe standing section. But it is understood she feels advances in stadium design plus a swell of public enthusiasm for introducing safe standing mean it is time to review the policy. Crouch is due to address a Westminster debate on safe standing on 25 June. A survey by the Football League last month indicated 94% of 33,000 fans asked wanted safe standing to be introduced. It would require an overturning of legislation. Standing in English football’s top two divisions was banned by the Football Spectators’ Act in 1990 after recommendations made in the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough disaster, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Some families of the victims remain opposed to the introduction of safe standing so there are obvious sensitivities around the issue. But a survey by the Liverpool supporters group Spirit of Shankly last year showed 88% were in favour of safe standing. It has proved successful across Europe, particularly in Germany’s Bundesliga and in Scotland, where Celtic have trialled a safe standing section for 2,600 fans for the past two seasons. More than 100,000 people signed a petition calling for Premier League and Championship clubs to allow safe standing, meaning the issue will be discussed in parliament. It will be a welcome boost for campaigners who have presented expert opinion that safe standing will reduce, rather than increase, the danger to fans inside football stadiums. West Brom’s rejected pilot scheme proposed a proposed altering the design of their ground to accommodate 3,600 rail seats, which can be locked in an upright position and which some experts claim reduce the risk to fans falling over while celebrating a goal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/rachel-roddy-recipe-chickpea-spinach-braise","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T11:00:20Z","webTitle":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for chickpea and spinach braise","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/rachel-roddy-recipe-chickpea-spinach-braise","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/11/rachel-roddy-recipe-chickpea-spinach-braise","fields":{"headline":"Rachel Roddy’s recipe for chickpea and spinach braise","bodyText":"Every Wednesday morning, behind the counter of their stall on Testaccio market, Enzo and Lina tip 10kg of dried chickpeas into a tub and cover them with cold water. The tub sits there for just shy of two days – 46 hours later – until Friday morning, when they drain the chickpeas, now butter-yellow and fat, and toss just a little bicarbonate of soda through them. To finish, they funnel 500g portions into small, clear plastic bags, which are knotted and piled on the counter near the soaked salt cod, ready for customers who still observe, or simply like, the Roman habit of eating a meatless, chickpea-centred meal on Fridays. “Two days? That is bonkers,” said a friend when I told her I had discovered the secret of plump chickpeas on the far-side of Testaccio market. “Forget soaking: cover them with boiling water for an hour, drain, cover with cold water, bring to the boil and simmer them for two” was her surefire method. Another friend suggested a four-hour soak and a pressure cooker was the way to go, while my neighbour swore by an eight-hour soak followed by a three-hour simmer, with or without bicarbonate. Trusted books are equally opinionated and disparate, an arc of suggestions from no soaking needed, to a times table of chickpea timings, 2, 4, 8, 48, some categorical that you must change the soaking water before simmering (it is toxic) and others very clear that you mustn’t (it is nectar). Of course, the answer to all this is to stop asking for advice and to figure out a method of my own. And for years I did have one. It may not have been surefire, but it was pretty sure: an overnight soak and then a juddering simmer until done. Then I cooked a few not-so-happy batches, as did a few readers – more than any other ingredient, I have had emails and notes about the curse of the still-hard chickpea. So I decided I would do a Felicity Cloake and test all the various ways, to come up with the perfect one. The thing is, this many possible combinations to test meant cooking more chickpeas than even we could eat, and my experiment quickly unravelled. My default position is to trust in Lina, with a degree of variation: a 24-48 hour soak, a light bicarbonate rub-through and simmering until the chickpeas are soft enough to squish into an almost-hummus between your fingertips (which isn’t very long if you have soaked Lina style). Soaking and cooking gives you that cloudy, slightly viscous cooking liquid, which provides a gently flavoured broth for soups, stews, or today’s dish of chickpeas and spinach, an Armenian dish called nivik from Tess Mallos’s 1979 Complete Middle Eastern Cookbook (in which, by the way, she suggests an overnight soak followed by a two-hour simmer in the soaking water). I knew this recipe would be a favourite the moment I read it (helped, no doubt, by Reg Morrison’s wonderful Technicolor photo). Tess suggests eating this with bread and pickles, and I do, although it is just as good with rice or a grilled lamb chop. Tender chickpeas are crucial for this dish: they need to succumb willingly to the back of a fork, not ping across the room, so I’d suggest cooking them according to Lina’s method (make a double batch). If you’d rather stick to your own method, please leave comments/advice: I agree with Laurie Colwin in believing that, next to eating and cooking, talking and writing about eating and cooking are two of life’s delights. One home cook giving another advice really does make the cooking world go round. Chickpea and spinach braise 300g dried chickpeas 1 pinch bicarbonate of soda 750g spinach 1 large onion, peeled and diced 8 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp tomato paste or 100ml passata Salt and black pepper Sugar, to taste Cover the chickpeas with cold water and leave to sit for 24-48 hours (which is why it is worth soaking a double quantity and keeping half for another dish). Drain and cover the chickpeas with at least 5cm clean water, and an optional small pinch of bicarbonate of soda, bring to a boil, skimming with a slotted spoon until the water is clear, then simmer for one to two, until the chickpeas are very tender. Leave to cool in the cooking liquid. Wash the spinach, discard any tough stems or discoloured leaves, and chop roughly. In a saucepan with a lid, fry the onion gently in the olive oil until translucent and soft. Add the tomato, a pinch of salt, a grind of black pepper and a tablespoon of sugar. Stir, then add the drained chickpeas – retain the cooking liquid. Add the spinach and a little of the chickpea cooking liquid to the frying pan, stir, cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted. Uncover and cook for another 5-10 minutes, adjusting the seasoning to taste. The final dish should be moist, but not wet, so add a little more chickpea cooking water if needed. Serve hot, warm, or cold."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/05/andy-murray-back-on-court-hoping-to-be-fit-wimbledon-tennis","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T21:11:00Z","webTitle":"Andy Murray’s Wimbledon hopes hit after pulling out of Libema Open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/05/andy-murray-back-on-court-hoping-to-be-fit-wimbledon-tennis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/05/andy-murray-back-on-court-hoping-to-be-fit-wimbledon-tennis","fields":{"headline":"Andy Murray’s Wimbledon hopes hit after pulling out of Libema Open","bodyText":"Andy Murray’s efforts to be fit for Wimbledon in a month’s time took another hit on Tuesday when he pulled out of a minor grass court tournament in the Netherlands he had identified as the place to launch a low-key comeback after almost a year out of the game. He will now switch his ambitions from the Libema Open in Rosmalen, ’s-Hertogenbosch, towards the Fever Tree tournament at Queen’s, which starts on 18 June and where he has won five times. If he doesn’t play at Queen’s, he almost certainly will not risk Wimbledon, where he has won two of his three slam titles. “It is with regret that I won’t be ready to play in ’s-Hertogenbosch,” Murray said on Tuesday night. “I was excited to play there for the first time, but I am not quite ready to return. I am still aiming to play in the coming weeks, but I want to be 100% fit when I do return.” A source close to the Murray camp said: “He’ll make a late decision on Queen’s next week, depending on how the next week to 10 days go.” It is the detail of what constitutes ‘100% fit’ that is crucial to Murray’s strategy. For nearly a year, he has wrestled with the conundrum, desperate to return, but reluctant to risk aggravating a weakness that could end his career. He revealed in January his hip had been an underlying problem for him for 10 years. Since limping out of Wimbledon last year, after going five painful sets with Sam Querrey, he withdrew from the US Open two days before the start, pulled out of a projected comeback in Brisbane over the new year and then brought the whole effort to a halt in Melbourne, where he had hip surgery on 8 January. Having agonised for months over his options, he did not have a hip replacement and was satisfied that the operation by a trusted confidant and respected specialist, John O’Donnell, had been worth the gamble. Since then, Murray has taken great care with his recovery, putting in long hours of physio and exercise in the gym, monitored by a team of medical experts, before testing out his on-court movement at Patrick Mouratoglou’s academy in the south of France, then with practice matches at Wimbledon. At one point, he let it be known he was ahead of schedule. However, he ceased practising several weeks ago, unhappy with his reactions on court, and sought further medical assurance about his level of progress. It seemed for a while his stuttering attempts to get fit for the grass season were over. Over the past few days, however, there have been encouraging signs. First his mother, Judy, revealed he had returned to the court and was hopeful of playing at Wimbledon. On Tuesday, in a sponsored video interview released to the media, Murray said he felt reason to be more optimistic. “It’s been very slow,” he admitted. “I’ve been out getting close to a year now which is a lot longer than I think me or any of my team expected at the beginning. But I’m getting closer to playing again. I’ve started training a few days ago and hoping to make my comeback during the grass court season.” Asked about his prospects at Wimbledon, if he does play, he said, “I’m hoping I will be there, but Roger Federer has obviously got a phenomenal record on grass. He’s won eight times at Wimbledon so he’ll definitely be up there as one of the favourites. But, you never know, it depends a little bit on the draw.” If he is in that draw – whatever his ranking – he hopes it will at least end a year of uncertainty and struggle. The former champion – who spent 41 weeks as world No 1 before his injury worsened - will drop outside the top 150 on Monday. If he were to win Queen’s, he would go to Wimbledon ranked in the 60s. Either way, Murray will be on the outside looking in for the first time in many years."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/05/police-chiefs-say-cuts-are-putting-safety-of-public-at-risk-in-england-and-wales","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T13:53:27Z","webTitle":"Police chiefs say cuts are putting safety of public at risk in England and Wales","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/police-chiefs-say-cuts-are-putting-safety-of-public-at-risk-in-england-and-wales","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/05/police-chiefs-say-cuts-are-putting-safety-of-public-at-risk-in-england-and-wales","fields":{"headline":"Police chiefs say cuts are putting safety of public at risk in England and Wales","bodyText":"The three most senior police officers in England and Wales have expressed concerns that funding cuts and pressure on resources are hampering their ability to tackle serious crime. Appearing before the home affairs select committee, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner; Lynne Owens, the director general of the National Crime Agency; and Sara Thornton, the National Police Chiefs’ Council chairwoman, gave examples of how cash shortages were posing a risk to public safety. Dick said it would be “naive” to suggest reductions in police officers was having no impact on rising crime. She added: “It is having a massive strain on our people and it cannot go on. We are in the middle of the largest change programme the Met has ever been through. It cannot go on without hard choices – either more money, smaller mission, greater risk of attack.” Owens said: “The whole system needs a different approach to funding to make sure we are as good as we all want us to be.” Thornton added: “There is undoubtedly a capacity issue in neighbourhood policing ... it does need some extra investment.” Asked to state their biggest concern, all three highlighted the challenge posed by the rise in digital data and cybercrime. The amount of data that Met officers have to deal with doubles every 18 months, Dick said. She admitted that officers were struggling with the extra workload. She said it was not unusual for 18 officers to work 200 hours over a weekend to trawl through Facebook accounts to ensure that a trial was fair with regard to disclosure. Thornton said the reduction in the number of sexual offence cases reaching court in the last two years suggested resources were being overstretched. She said: “There is cause for concern. It is resource-intensive. We are shifting people. I am concerned about how many cases might be caught in the system.” She added: “We are 17% down on the number of detectives we’d like in an ideal world, so we are trying to push resources into an area where we are already short.” The chair of the committee, Yvette Cooper, asked Dick to give a single message to the home secretary, Sajid Javid. Dick said: “Support my people. They need to be well-led, they need to be well-equipped, they do need to be well-resourced and they need to have a public who feel confident. They need to be given the benefit of the doubt when things go wrong and not have point finger of blame.” She also urged the Home Office to show greater trust in police officers. She said: “It sometimes feels like there is not much central push, it’s kind of ‘get on with it, good luck’, but at the same time it has felt a bit parent-child. We are in this together for our public and we would love to work ever more closely with the Home Office so that they feel even more confident in us and they can project that to others.” Dick, Owens and Thornton also claimed the way English and Welsh policing was organised into 43 separate forces was hampering coordination on national crime issues. Thornton said: “If you did a poll of chief constables, most would say for operational reasons it would make sense to have a fewer number of larger forces. But the issue is political. We are constantly trying get people to collaborate to cooperate in the public interest. We are making progress. Sometimes the progress is glacial.” Owens said she was concerned forces were “going to be get left behind” on national issues such as cybercrime, fraud and child sexual abuse, because of the current division of forces. Labour seized on the officers’ concerns over resourcing. Louise Haigh, the shadow policing minister, said: “The most senior police officers in the land have called out the dangerous Tory delusion on police cuts. “In the face of overwhelming evidence from senior officers and their own officials, it appears that the only people in the country who now believe the loss of 21,000 officers hasn’t made the blindest bit of difference to community safety is Theresa May’s government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/05/sky-takeover-murdoch-sky-news-uk-fox-comcast","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T13:20:10Z","webTitle":"Sky takeover: Murdoch must offload Sky News to get green light","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/05/sky-takeover-murdoch-sky-news-uk-fox-comcast","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/05/sky-takeover-murdoch-sky-news-uk-fox-comcast","fields":{"headline":"Sky takeover: Murdoch must offload Sky News to get green light","bodyText":"The UK government has cleared the way for Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox to buy Sky on the condition it sells Sky News to another organisation. It also approved a rival bid for the British broadcaster from US media giant Comcast, setting up a multibillion-pound bidding war. Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own, in a deal valuing the company at £18.5bn, but the bid has been complicated by concerns that it would leave Murdoch with too much control over the UK media. Comcast, which owns US TV network NBC and Universal Studios, made a rival bid earlier this year that valued Sky at £22bn. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon. He also indicated he will also approve the Murdoch deal if Sky News is offloaded to an appropriate buyer, who will guarantee its independence and fund it for 10 years, in order to avoid excessive influence by the the mogul’s family over the UK news business. Disney has already offered to buy Sky News in order to clear competition concerns as part of its broader bid for many of Murdoch’s media assets. Hancock suggested this offer is likely to meet his standards and would allow Murdoch’s bid to be approved later this month, meaning a bidding war for Sky is “on the horizon”. Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox said Hancock’s statement meant it was “confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction”. The deal has left Sky News employees nervous about their futures but in an email to staff channel boss John Ryley noted that both bids contained “commitments to guarantee the funding and editorial independence of Sky News”. “I will update as and when there are further developments but in the meantime, all we can do is to continue the great job we’ve been doing and concentrate on what we do best which is making the best news content for mobile, television and radio,” he said. The Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, said Sky News has “always been a beacon for independent and rigorous journalism” and said his priority is “ensuring Sky News thrives going forward”. He warned that if Sky News is sold to Disney – and Disney’s bid for overall control of Fox is unsuccessful – it would leave the 24-hour news channel “isolated from Sky and owned by a foreign company with few news interests in the UK”. The takeover bids are part of a complex web of global media deals, with giant companies competing to buy smaller businesses in the hope of securing their long-term future in the face of challenges from streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix. The Competition and Markets Authority provisionally blocked Fox’s takeover bid in January due to fears it would raise competition concerns and was therefore not in the public interest. Fox has since been attempting to address the concerns by tabling a series of remedies. Murdoch’s last attempt to take full control of Sky was abandoned in 2011, amid the phone-hacking scandal at his News of the World newspaper. Even if Murdoch’s takeover is successful this time around it is unlikely the 87-year-old will retain control of Sky in the long term, as he is looking to sell most of his broadcast and film assets. Disney has already tabled a £39bn offer to buy assets including Fox’s TV production unit, the 20th Century Fox film studio, and its stake in Sky. To raise the odds further, Comcast recently announced it is planning to outbid Disney for the same Fox assets, as part of its battle with Disney to control the future of the media industry. Under both deals Murdoch would be left owning a much smaller Fox business which would control a TV network and news channels including the rightwing Fox News, in addition to Dow Jones which runs the Wall Street Journal and publisher HarperCollins. In the UK he would be left with his News UK business, which owns the Sun and the Times newspapers."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/02/jeremy-thorpe-scandal-attempted-case-to-reopen","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T11:11:05Z","webTitle":"Jeremy Thorpe scandal: attempted murder case to reopen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/02/jeremy-thorpe-scandal-attempted-case-to-reopen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/02/jeremy-thorpe-scandal-attempted-case-to-reopen","fields":{"headline":"Jeremy Thorpe scandal: attempted murder case to reopen","bodyText":"The BBC drama about the rise and fall of the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe, A Very English Scandal, which concludes on Saturday, may need a sequel. For the extraordinary tale of sex, power and corruption – in which Hugh Grant has been lavished with praise for his portrayal of Thorpe, who was acquitted of plotting to have his gay lover murdered – has taken another tragicomic twist. Yesterday, police confirmed that an investigation into the murky affair will be reopened on the grounds that they had wrongly assumed one of the main suspects was dead. Easily verifiable evidence had emerged to suggest that he was indeed alive. Andrew “Gino” Newton was allegedly the hitman hired to murder Thorpe’s lover, a male model called Norman Scott, on Exmoor in 1975. A pilot from Blackpool, Newton gave evidence for the prosecution of Thorpe and three others at what was described as “the trial of the century”, only to be branded by the judge as a “perjurer” who was “determined to milk the case as hard as he can”. Newton, known as “Snaz” because of his flamboyant style of dress, claimed that he had agreed to murder Scott for between £10,000 and £20,000. After shooting dead Scott’s dog, a great dane called Rinka, he allegedly aimed the gun at Scott, only for it to jam. He was jailed for two years for killing Rinka. Even though Thorpe was acquitted, the 1979 trial ended his career. Lurid speculation about what really happened and why dogged him for the rest of his life. Whether Newton was meant to only frighten Scott and stop him going public about his relationship with Thorpe, or indeed kill him, as he maintained, remains the stuff of conjecture. Hopes for a breakthrough came when a new inquiry was launched by Gwent police in 2015 – the year after Thorpe’s death. But it was dramatically scrapped after the force learned that Newton had died. A quick spot of Googling, however, might have given detectives enough leads to ascertain what became of him. He resurfaces in numerous articles written in 1994, when a coroner ruled out foul play after one Caroline Mayorcas fell 900ft to her death while climbing the Eiger in Switzerland with her partner, Hann Redwin. At the inquest, it emerged that Redwin was, in fact, Newton, and was living in Chiswick, west London. Throughout the first decade of the millennium, the unusually named Redwin (there is speculation he chose his new name as an anagram of “winner hand”) became an avid contributor to a journal, the Geo Quarterly – “the independent amateur quarterly publication for Earth observation and weather satellite enthusiasts”. He surfaced again in a 2015 edition of Pilot magazine, in an article about Redhill airfield near Gatwick. “I get into conversation with Hann Redwin whose Pipistrel motorised glider I spotted in a small hangar near the Tower,” the article recounts. “He’s here with his companion Patsy Frankham to conduct some tests on the Pipistrel.” As an excited press pack beat a path to Redhill, relatives of Frankham broke cover to confirm to MailOnline that he was alive and had moved his plane to a farm in Surrey. The news will do nothing to dissuade Scott from his view that the investigation into what he has always insisted was an attempt to murder him was a stitch-up by the political establishment. “I just don’t think anyone’s tried hard enough to look for him,” Scott tells the makers of a BBC Four documentary, The Jeremy Thorpe Scandal, to be broadcast tonight. “I thought [Gwent police] were doing something at last and soon found out that absolutely they weren’t: they were continuing the cover-up as far as I can see.” Gwent police told the documentary makers: “Inquiries were completed which indicated Mr Newton was deceased. We have now revisited these inquiries and have identified information which indicates that Mr Newton may still be alive.” • This article was corrected on 4 June 2018 because it said an alleged murder attempt on Norman Scott took place on Bodmin Moor."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/06/everyday-racism-in-america-how-to-fix-it","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T10:00:10Z","webTitle":"Oppression in America: 'To root this out we need a movement against racist policies'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/everyday-racism-in-america-how-to-fix-it","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/06/everyday-racism-in-america-how-to-fix-it","fields":{"headline":"Oppression in America: 'To root this out we need a movement against racist policies'","bodyText":"It seems as though every single day, the list grows. Waiting in a coffee shop while black. Selling real estate while black. Moving in while black. Napping while black. Working out while black. Ever since a Starbucks in the Philadelphia area came under national scrutiny for calling the police on two black men waiting for a business associate in one of the company’s coffee shops, new attention has been focused on the long list of mundane activities that black Americans can’t confidently engage in without being treated as suspicious or having the police called. “It’s just part of daily living. It’s what you expect as a person of color when you head out the door in the morning,” said Jeff Chang, the author of Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America. “A moment like this just sort of galvanized folks to be able to express all the different ways in which they’ve been impacted by daily racism.” In many ways the newly energized conversation parallels how Black Lives Matter emerged as an ideological clearinghouse for the problem of racialized police violence several years ago. Neither phenomenon was new, but in both cases a stream of high profile incidents managed to snowball into its own trope, in part thanks to social media and smartphone videos. In this case that’s the trope of “everyday racism”. For experts, the genesis is clear. While the US has ended the formal, legal codes of enslavement and segregation that stood for most of the nation’s history, little has been done to change the minds of too many about the racist ideas that those structures rested on. “There has not been a society-wide and intensive challenge to racist ideas in the US,” said Ibram Kendi, the director of the Antiracist Research &amp; Policy Center at American University. “You’ve had people saying we need to have ‘national conversations’, You’ve have people calling for ‘healing’, because in their minds it’s just that people are hateful and they need to start loving ... But in terms of a national, widespread effort to reorient Americans’ racist ideas – that has never happened before.” And those ideas run deep, said Jamilah Lemieux, a cultural critic and writer. “Non-black people in this country have been fed a steady diet of propaganda from their parents, their schools, their churches, and from the media that tells them that people of color, and particularly black folks and Latinx people are not to be trusted. “They’ve been taught that we are criminals, that we are violent that we are predators and think we need to be monitored.” Hope and change Barack Obama’s 2008 election was seen by much of white America as the dawning of a new, post-racial age. The logic held that, if a black man could attain the highest office in the land, then no goal could be considered out of reach for an individual black person in modern America. This post-racial framing, of course, belies not just the inherited and institutional disadvantages black Americans face in housing, education, wealth, and other socioeconomic concerns, but also the emergence of what some have described as a “newer, slicker” form of racism. After the 2008 election, the anti-racist activist and writer Tim Wise described it as one where whites “hold the larger black community in low regard” but “carve out acceptable space for individuals like Obama who strike them as different”. And insofar as Obama’s eight years in power fueled a renewed sense of purpose and organization among white nationalists, and triggered what the CNN pundit Van Jones famously described as a “whitelash”, some, including Obama himself, have wondered if his presidency actually set the project of racial equality back – at least temporarily. “Maybe we pushed too far,” Obama worried aloud to an aide shortly after the election, according to a forthcoming book. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.” That racial tribalism is part of what propelled Trump’s victory, despite the fact that he would go on to repeatedly describe himself as the “least racist person”. Trump’s popularity with unabashed white supremacists stems from things like his frequent ill-informed tweets and comments about inner city violence, and his reported use of the the phrase “shithole counties” in speaking about immigrants from black and brown nations. ‘Personal racism valet’ After the Starbucks incident, numerous other examples quickly emerged via news reports and social media. In New Jersey, two black men had police called on them by staff at a gym after being falsely accused of working out without proper memberships. Police in California swarmed three black women leaving an Airbnb when a neighbor concluded they were in the midst of a robbery. A woman in Oakland called the police on black residents for barbecuing in a park, and, at Yale University, a white woman called police on a black fellow student for falling asleep in a dorm common area. The presence of police is not the defining factor for everyday racism, or what some call “microaggressions”, but it is one of the harshest escalations. For Phillip Atiba Goff, a leading researcher on racial bias in policing and the president of the Center for Policing Equity, part of this has to do with the fact that black people and white people often share space in places like a university campus or a rapidly gentrifying city such as Oakland, California, but don’t always share bonds. “When you have people living close to each other who are not in community with each other, that breeds fear,” Goff said. He worries about what it means that in cases where officers functionally become “deputized as a kind of personal racism valet” – armed respondents to unfounded suspicions by white Americans. But from the perspective of law enforcement it’s a hard circle to square. “You can’t very well instruct your 911 operators to be like ‘yeah Mrs Smith, I know you said there were gangbangers but we know you’re probably just racist,” Goff said. Police have to respond, and are trained to treat every scenario as though it could become dangerous. “So they’re going to show up, and they’re generally going to be aggressive,” Goff added. “And by the time they figure out that you are not the issue, your dignity has been so assaulted that it really is difficult to have a pleasant conversation. For the cops and for the resident.” Thus, more than anything, what needs to be challenged to make real progress on everyday racism is racial bias, whether conscious or unconscious. “The only way we actually win, is to change the social norms,” Goff said. And for Kendi, like many race scholars, an important part of that is paying closer attention to social, economic and political policies that have a biased impact, rather than case by case negative exchanges individuals have with one another. “Policies are the cradle of the racist ideas circulating in people’s minds that are leading to those interpersonal situations that are negatively affecting people,” Kendi said. “If people are really serious about being able to live freely and black in the United States, then the way really to do that is to be a part of the movement against racist policies.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/02/sportwatch-afl-nrl-netball-super-rugby-and-more-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T12:12:17Z","webTitle":"Sportwatch: AFL, NRL, netball, Super Rugby and more - as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/02/sportwatch-afl-nrl-netball-super-rugby-and-more-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/02/sportwatch-afl-nrl-netball-super-rugby-and-more-live","fields":{"headline":"Sportwatch: AFL, NRL, netball, Super Rugby and more - as it happened","bodyText":"So a few big statements made tonight across the codes. In the Super Rugby Melbourne Rebels ended a three-year hoodoo for Australian rugby, winning a first game on NZ soil in over 1000 days as they downed the Blues. Conference rivals the Waratahs then edged a fifteen-try spectacle against the Reds, as the Crusaders also continued their winning run. In the AFL, Richmond, Melbourne and Geelong all scored big and emphatic wins, while the Hawks shaded an absolute thriller in Tasmania as they pipped the Power by just three points. Sam Stosur crashed out of Roland Garros going down to world No3 Garbine Muguruza, while the Lightning raced up the Super Netball table with a near-virtuoso solo hand from Caitlin Bassett, who like LeBron landed a remarkable 51 points for her side. The Eels doldrums continue in the NRL, but at least it meant a return to the winners circle for the Knights. Thanks as always for your company - we’ll see you next Saturday, when Sportwatch, like Herbie, will ride again. Well. There ends Dreamtime at the ‘G and what a shot in the arm for Tigers fans; not that they’ve needed one, but with a bit of muttering pre-game that Essendon might be half a chance, they’ve definitely sent the rest of the league a warning shot tonight. 71pts the final margin in a game that just continued to get further and further away from the Bombers. Jake Stringer with a team-high 29 disposals but his crucial miss when Essendon were just 13pts behind was as close as the Bombers got. Shane Edwards is awarded the medal for best-on-ground, a deserved moment for a guy who has worked very hard throughout the week promoting the Indigenous round, and even harder on the paddock tonight. So back to the drawing board for the Bombers, as the Tigers purr back to their best. Another late fixture from the West, this time in the Super Netball where it’s 1 v 2, but the home side West Coast Fever have started the brighter. Jamaican Jhaniele Fowler is off to a flyer, shooting 22/22 across the first 20 minutes or so - the poor Giants GK, Sam Poolman, really has her work cut out tonight. Nat Medhurst involved heavily, feeding her shooting partner well. We’re seven minutes into the second quarter, Fever leading 8-7 after an 18-17 opening quarter. Still just four in this. As feared, those early injuries and a sin-binning made for a tough old night for Parramatta, who might have fancied themselves pre-game against a Knights side that despite improving noticeably this season, has found themselves in some pretty rotten form over the past month or so. Five tries to one but Josh Hoffman’s late consolation still quite a decent effort: The headaches continue for Brad Arthur and his men, as they fall to their 11th loss of the season. Over in Perth we have the final AFL game of the night but I’ll be honest, I’ve already chalked that one up as an Eagles win, despite the Western hoodoo being broken by Victorian teams last week (admittedly, against Fremantle and not the high-flying Eagles). West Coast have kicked five each quarter to lead St Kilda 10.1 (61) to 5.3 (33). They let them out to a three-goal lead inside nine minutes, did the Saints, and in fairness, they’ve never really looked like reeling it back. A fifteen try affair, and would you believe, with the Reds still attacking in the 79th minute, if they’d not bombed one there we could have been looking at a 100pt match! New South Wales bring up their highest ever score against Australian opposition. Their stars all stood up, and Melbourne’s short-lived reign at the top of the conference is over (for now). Home fans might be disappointed with the loss, but they’ve still seen their side run in seven tries. What a game! What a quarter from the Tigers - they’ve kicked six goals and limited their opponents to just one. Nankervis grabbing his second and Connor Menadue his first in the last few minutes of action to bring up the triple-figures and blow the lead out to 64. It’s dead as a contest now, but for the neutral there’s some sumptuous stuff on display from Richmond. The Bombers for their part are struggling in transition and their defence appears to be guilty of marking space at times. The tries are continuing to flow after the break in the Super Rugby, where with 20-odd to play it’s the Reds trying to hang in. Nick Phipps keeping the momentum going a minute into the half before a horrendous bounce from a Reds kick-and-chase fell kindly to a rampaging Folau, who scampered through like the thoroughbred he is. A thoroughbred who needs to stay off Instagram, but a finely-muscled nag nevertheless. The Reds then hit back with two of their own through forwards Alex Mafi and Caleb Timu, but just as they looked a sniff the Tahs struck back. 29-47 the score, and we’ve still got fifteen to play! We’re back at the MCG and the Dreamtime marquee match of the Sir Doug Nicholls round is going south in a big way if you’re a Bombers fan. After that deflating 19pt unanswered run at the back of the first half, it’s only got worse after the buzzer: Jack Graham and Dan Butler grabbing their first of the evening before guess who, Josh Caddy, popped up to help himself to a fourth. And the margin is out to 50! Essendon looks to spark something, but the kick misses Stringer. It floats long and McDonald-Tipungwuti nabs it. He lines it up - and would you believe it: after 70-odd minutes of play, the Bombers land their first set shot! And we’re at half-time in the sole NRL offering of the evening, where the Knights are leading comfortably 0-14 through Cogger’s early effort and a try to Sione “Juan” Mata’utia. Kayln Ponga with six points off the boot (two conversions and one penalty). Have they been awful, the Eels? Well, no. But they do trail by almost every conceivable statistical measure. A third minute head-knock to Bevan French ending his night before Mitch Moses also succumbed to injury, with Michael Jennings sent to the bin just before the break. Still, they’ve got through a mountain of defensive work; let’s hope this doesn’t blow out late as they tire. For a quarter that they more-or-less dominated for the first fifteen that was a bit of a kick in the guts for Bombers fans, as the Tigers finished with 19 unanswered points. This from Edwards and Caddy but - phwaor: Love a good ‘soccer’, me. Wowee. A seven-try feast up in Queensland. Michael Wells with a rare try for the Tahs to level out Higginbotham’s effort before man-mountain Taqele Naiyaravoro showed all his strength to evade several tackles down the touchline to score in the corner. Prop Taniela Tupou again responded immediately for the Reds, but after the half-time hooter it was Israel Folau who rose highest to pluck one from the heavens to give the visitors some breathing room. A big forty to come here, you would imagine. Well the intensity has lifted here at the MCG, with the Bombers noticeably moving the ball a lot quicker this quarter. Jayden Laverde kicks their fourth, they lead on goals 3-to-1 for the quarter. And now Jake Stringer rises for a big mark! The Package! But with the hard work done he fluffs the kick. Boo-urns. Inside a minute Shane Edwards goes up the other end and shows how it’s done - the Tigers out to 18 again. Another moment of controversy as Hurley does well to spoil from Martin, but the umpires penalise the Bombers defend, who’s accused of a hold! To a chorus of boos around the ‘G, ol’ Dusty plugs it home. Inside a minute and Caddy’s bagged his third! Eep, eight minutes ago Stringer was lining it up to go potentially seven behind, but now the Bombers trail by 31! It took just 1hr and 2 minutes. Not the third round the veteran Australian would have wanted, but in fairness the world No3 gave her very little to pounce on. Venezuelan-born, Swiss-residing, it’s the Spaniard who progresses as she looks to replicate her 2016 championship win. We’re back in the second quarter in the AFL, and the Bombers have continued a super minute either side of that buzzer, with Zach Merrett kicking their second goal. Richmond’s Shane Edwards with the reply, but it’s Fantasia back off the bench and running freely to get the red &amp; black section of the crowd daring to dream. 18 points the difference - maybe they can make a game of this one the Bombers? So, around the grounds while we pause for quarter-time at Dreamtime at the ‘G. In Queensland the Tahs have hit straight back - only three minutes after that Reds opener through Curtis Rona to tie it up at 7-7. A massive lunge from Scott ‘go-go gadget arms’ Higginbotham though has given the Reds the lead again. He was being swarmed by about three defenders in blue about a metre out from the line, and despite all expectations the periscope’s gone out and slammed it down on the line. Great individual strength! 12-7 to the Reds with 15 played. In the NRL it’s first blood to the Knights, with Jack Coggin crossing. A bit of a scrappy one, but he’s come from the clouds to ground this one, hasn’t he? And on Stosur-watch: a tight fifth game of that second set has gone to Muguruza, and with the break in hand she moves out to a 6-0, 4-2 lead. I think we know how this one ends. Oh dear. Michael Hurley caught in possession as the Tigers players swarm; where were the support runs? Caddy kicks an easy second and Richmond’s fourth. Has the occasion got to the home side? Bit of a dubious free goes the way of the Tigers and Nankervis gets to line one up. Can he finish? Yep, and that’s five for the quarter. When your luck is out, your luck is out. James Stewart flies and grabs a crucial mark for the Bombers. Here’s a chance to arrest the slide; ruh-roh, he’s hooked that for a third behind. Meanwhile Orazia Fantasia has already left the contest through injury, as had David Zaharakis who cuts a forlorn figure with ice on the shoulder. With a minute to play, finally Essendon get it going - great movement on the far side to find Langford and Anthony McDonald-Tiungwuti gets their first just before the buzzer! Suffice to say though, not the start the Bombers were looking for. We’re also underway in our only NRL game of the evening where Parramatta play host to the Knights. A bit of a battle of the cellar dwellers this, but a key 2pts on offer tonight for one of these sides. The all-Australian Super Rugby clash in Queensland has also got underway, and it’s a bright start for the home side who have bagged an intercept try inside three minutes. First blood the Reds, 7-0. To the big one! We’re fifteen played at the MCG in the Dreamtime marquee match, and it’s Richmond making the early running. The Bombers opened with a behind but since then it’s been Tigers on top. Callum Moore, Josh Caddy and Brandon Ellis all firing home majors - it’s 0.1 (1) plays 3.3 (21). They need to steady here Essendon, or all their good work from previous weeks goes out the window. And for those of you hanging out for our ‘Australians remaining at Roland Garros’ watch, well look, it’s all gone a bit Gold Coast Suns in Paris. Sam Stosur is currently on court with the 3rd seed and world no3 Garbine Muguruza, who has just served for the first set 6-0. Ruh-roh. Suffice to say it’s not been our tournament between Kyrgios retiring through injury and Tomic going out in the first round. At least we still have Daria Gavrilova (who has been formally Australian for at least three of her 24 years) to fly the flag. And it’s full-time in the all-NZ clash in the Super Rugby; the Crusaders consolidating their top spot in the NZ conference with an impressive 20-34 win over the Chiefs in Hamilton. The home side gave it a fair shake, and it wasn’t until Luke Romano’s 76th minute try that the defending, and eight-time champions had this one locked down. An injury to Brodie Retallick a slight concern for the Chiefs/All Blacks though; we’ll wait to see how serious that proves. Well, we’re not too far away from the big one - Dreamtime at the ‘G - as two in-form sides, Essendon and Richmond, go head-to-head. First bounce isn’t a million miles away. For those that don’t know too much about this fixture, or indeed the Sir Doug Nicholls round in general, here’s what the AFL website has to say: Round named in honour of Sir Doug Nicholls The AFL’s annual round recognising and celebrating indigenous players and culture is named in honour of Sir Doug Nicholls. Sir Doug, who epitomised the spirit of reconciliation, played 54 games for Fitzroy and was a brilliant all-round athlete. The first Aboriginal person to be knighted, he also served as Governor of South Australia and was devoted to the wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Round 11 of the 2018 season kicks off on Friday, June 1, when the Sydney Swans host Carlton at the SCG. The marquee match of Sir Doug Nicholls round is the Dreamtime at the ‘G clash between Richmond and Essendon on the Saturday night. All 18 clubs will wear special indigenous-themed guernseys during the round. And if you missed any of those lovely jerseys (or guernseys if that’s your poison) do scroll back through our coverage tonight to see some of those in picture form. And look, it’s an absolute shocker for any loyal home fans who made it out to Carrara Stadium today. Their final quarter was almost as bad an their close to the first half, the Suns, with another measly behind their scoring ‘progress’. The Cats almost apologetic in the end, with just the four final quarter goals, but in reality they were better in every category. Gary Ablett jnr making a bit of a statement on his return; 37 disposals, six marks and three goals - one of the best on ground for the Cats. Geelong’s fourth win in five as they entrench their spot in the eight. For the Suns, well, at least there’s the consolation that the Blues, Lions and Saints are having it worse this season. And for those of you salivating with expectation ahead of the forthcoming Fifa World Cup in Russia, here’s a terrific profile of Australia’s Group C rivals, Denmark that’s just dropped: Christian Eriksen, eh? Ooh, I’ve heard of him.. Still, Australia’s preparations have been bubbling along nicely, if last night’s performance in Austria was anything to go by. One swallow does not a summer make, but you’d imagine coach Bert van Marwijk was pretty happy with this showing. And while we’re on the topic of football and the Socceroos - if you missed this from a few days ago, it’s a great little way to while away the wait at the bus stop. Even if I do say so myself. And a slightly better less-bad third quarter for the Suns, but some wobbly kicking hasn’t helped the miraculous comeback too much. They’ve kicked 2.6 to the Cats’ 3.4 - but they still trail heavily. 58 the difference up on the Gold Coast. And as we get underway in the final quarter it’s definitely got ugly here for the Suns. Out of respect perhaps Gary Ablett had stayed off the scorers list during the first half, but he’s just kicked two in three minutes, adding to his first in the third quarter. 4.11 (35) plays 16.15 (111). Ouch. No Australian sides in action in the second Super Rugby game of the day, but some proper rugby going on between the Chiefs and the Crusaders. At half-time it’s the Crusaders edging it 13-20. I tell you what. You kids at home who want to learn how to line-out drive, hunt down the highlights of this try by the South Islanders. I’d link it, but poor old Sanzar’s social media game isn’t quite as flash as AFL/NRL’s. A terrific try but. BTL commenter ‘WinnieofOz’ with a fair request: Would love to see more photos of the Indigenous jumpers, given I’m o/s and won’t be watching any of the matches. As always on the Sportwatch - your wish is our pleasure. Hawthorn and Port Adelaide: Western Bulldogs: Geelong: Melbourne (from last weekend in Alice Springs): Ps there was a nice yarn from Craig Little last weekend discussing some of the initiatives surrounding the Sir Doug Nicholls round and grassroots Indigenous development programs in general if you missed it: And it’s as many feared up on the Gold Coast; look away now if you’re a Suns fan. 2.5 (17) trails 10.11 (71) at half time - which side do you reckon Gary Ablett Jnr is grateful to be playing for today? Tom Hawkins leading the onslaught with 3.1 with the Cats sharing the goals among seven other scorers. One measle behind for the Suns the only interruption to 13 scoring chances for the visitors. Horrorshow. And here’s the stats behind this ‘historic’ Rebels win: It’s more than 1000 days since an Australian Super Rugby side won a game on NZ soil - more than THREE years. And it’s been a run of 32-straight losses. Ja-bless those Blues of Auckland! Heads up any NZ fans following this blog though; I’ve been reliably informed there’s currently a repeat of ‘The Goonies’ on TVNZ 2, so there’s something. Every cloud, eh? Howaaay the lads! Hot on the tail of the Tahs ending NZ’s 40-game winning streak over Australian sides, that other great record (what was it, something like 30-odd games consecutive lost on NZ soil?) has tumbled! And if NZ-based liveblogs are to go off, they’re spitting chups up in Auckland over this one - and the locals are not happy with what Tana Umaga’s chargers have served up tonight. It looked in truth a poor game all-round. Bill Meakes with a double and Dane Haylett-Petty the tryscorers for the visitors, and with that, the Rebels go top of the Australian conference! And in the random fun facts corner; this: There’s a bunch of international football friendlies underway tonight, some with the World Cup in mind, others with perhaps less at stake. Hard to think of one with less on the line than Kenya v New Zealand, but you’ll all leave tonight richer for this. Maybe you can drop this into a dinner conversation later? And speaking of AFL - would you believe there’s more of it! Three more games tonight in fact, and our first stop is Carrara Stadium, where the Suns are trailing the Cats at quarter time. 2.4 (16) plays 3.5 (23) - Callum Ah Chee got the home side off to a seven point lead before goals to Lincoln McCarthy, Tom Hawkins and Tim Kelly put the Cats in front. Gold Coast dominating tackles and hit-outs but its Geelong shading disposals, inside 50s and contested possessions. A missive from Martin out in Sydney’s west: I’m in Granville waiting for a kids’ party to finish. I was hoping to watch the AFL in a pub but all they had on was super rugby, golf from somewhere and, bizarrely, a replay of Man City v Palace from the Premier League. So imagine my satisfaction when the blog fired up! Keep the posts coming! We are, as ever, your humble servant, Martin. I hope there wasn’t fifteen litres of red cordial on the menu. Enjoy the car/train/ferry ride home. And apologies netty fans, we got a wee bit caught up in that down-to-the-wire AFL clash in Tasmania. It’s been an emphatic showing from the C-Bass, Diamonds skipper Caitlin Bassett bagging a remarkable 51/53 goals, at a rate of 96% - the Vixens with no answers. Move over LeBron - here’s how you score 51 of your teams points, but actually also land the win! (Too soon?) An all-important three bonus points as well, as having dropped the opening quarter, the Lightning have won the next three 15-13, 18-13, 16-13, to land a 7-pointer for the ladder. They temporarily move to 2nd - just one point off the Fever. And some awful news filtering in from that early game; it’s feared Jake Lever may have done an ACL. Pray to your household lares Demons fans, make an offering to the old gods and the new, because that’s horrific news for a player who was such a key off-season recruit. And the Launie fans rise as one - what’s wrong with AFL in Tassie, Gillon! Are you not entertained?! An absolute thriller in the end. They may be 9th and 10th on the ladder, but don’t rule out either of these sides from being in the mix come season’s end. Port running out to a flying lead with a five-goal first quarter, but from there it was largely Hawthorn who dug in to level the scores by half-time. They took a seven-point lead into the final quarter, but from there the lead yo-yoed. Captain Roughead with the crucial winning kick - what a nailbiter! Awful moment for Port fans! The Power with the kickout, but they’ve only found Impey! They know he doesn’t play for them any more right? The former Port darling lines it up.. but he shanks it. What a let off, he’s even missed the consolation posts and put it out on the full! They’re still alive, Port Adelaide, about two minutes to play! Okay, let’s take a close look at the Hawks-Power clash - where we’ve just over ten to play and it’s currently a one-point game! Robbie Gray climbs and lands a huge mark; can he top this off with the goal? Can he $%^. Massive kick for the 3x All-Australian, he’s grabbed his fourth of the game, and Port are back in time for the first time since early in the second half! Now it’s the skipper Roughead working hard for the Hawks, what can he manage. Ooh, we’ve a freekick! He lines on up now to lift his side back into lead - and he knocks it home! Hawthorn, back in front by 1! And Luke Breust has come round the back of the pack to jag a mark from 30m out. Here’s the moment to win this game for the Hawks.. he lines up, he hits it... and he’s struck the post! Hawks by 3, after Gunston also fires a behind from near the touch line. And it’s triple figures for a fifth consecutive week for the Dees, as the side that kicked off Sir Doug Nicholls round in Alice Springs last week in style, has continued their emphatic winning run. That’s six on the trot for Melbourne as they comfortably dispose of their cross-town rivals. Five goals to Jesse Hogan and four to Tom McDonald leading the rout, after the Dogs kicked the first three majors of the game. The only blot an injury to defender Jake Lever. Hope the knee’s okay. Afternoon all! I hope this finds you hearty, hale and rugged up for those suffering inclement East Coast weather. As detailed already, we’ve a busy Saturday Sportswatch in store. Let’s whip round the grounds first of to see what live action we have for you: In the AFL, we’ve got a big final quarter in store in Launceston, Taswegia (as opposed to Launceston, Cornwall for those of you covering our coverage from that neck of the woods) where the Hawks are in a ding-dong classic with the Power. About twenty to play there and it’s the ‘home’ side 7.8 (50) playing 7.6 (48). We’re also in the third quarter in the Super Netball where the defending champs the Lighting have a similar battle on their hands, they trail the Vixens 37-38 with each team having won a quarter so far. And in the Super Rugby we’ve just started the second half in Auckland, where the Blues trail the Rebels 10-17. A first win for Aussie teams on NZ soil you say? Back it in 100%, because we’ve never seen any of our lot throw a lead over there in recent times. It’s Saturday, which means it’s sportsday, and have we got the sports for you. Sports! We’ve five games of AFL as Sir Doug Nicholls Indigenous Round continues, Hawks v Power and Bombers v Tigers perhaps the pick of these. There are three big matches in the Super Rugby, including the state-against-stage, mate-against-mate battle as the Tahs take on the Reds. In the Super Netball four of the more fancied teams lock horns as defending champs the Lightning host the Vixens and the Giants get on the road to take on the Fever. And in the State-of-Origin-fixture-reduced round of the NRL its a battlers derby as Eels take on the Knights. We might also cross to Roland Garros to keep an eye on our gal Sam Stosur, run our eye over today’s surfing action, and look, pretty much whatever else takes our fancy. Because you’ve worked hard this week. And you deserve it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/06/all-eyes-on-canada-as-first-g7-nation-prepares-to-make-marijuana-legal","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T06:00:06Z","webTitle":"All eyes on Canada as first G7 nation prepares to make marijuana legal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/all-eyes-on-canada-as-first-g7-nation-prepares-to-make-marijuana-legal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/06/all-eyes-on-canada-as-first-g7-nation-prepares-to-make-marijuana-legal","fields":{"headline":"All eyes on Canada as first G7 nation prepares to make marijuana legal","bodyText":"When Canopy Growth opened its first cannabis factory in an old chocolate plant near Ottawa four years ago, it did so predicting a bright future. Canada had already legalized medical marijuana, and Canopy predicted full legalization for recreational use to be next. What the company hadn’t predicted, however, was the sudden flood of foreign visitors. Politicians and police authorities from Jamaica, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece and Australia have all come knocking, as well as doctors from New Zealand, Brazil and Chile, along with groups of corporate investors and bankers – so many that Canopy now sometimes splits up the groups according to their birthdays. “We knew we’d have to give a lot of tours, so we just cut a window into the wall,” said the company spokesman, Jordan Sinclair. “We put windows in all of the doors.” Canada will be thrust even more directly under the international microscope on Thursday, when a vote in the Senate is expected to ratify Bill C-45, effectively making Canada the first G20 nation to legalize recreational marijuana. “It’s going to be a bit of a science fiction experience for a while,” said Benedikt Fischer, an expert on substance use at Toronto’s biggest psychiatric hospital. “It’s unique in the world, because it’s happening for the first time in a wealthy country. It’s not like in the US, where there are these state experiments. Most people kind of ignore Uruguay. And so the world is really looking at this.” Governments, researchers and business leaders around the world all have their own reasons for keeping tabs. Legalization could affect Canada’s crime patterns, health and countless other factors – but exactly how, no one yet knows. Each Canadian province plans to roll out its newly legalized market in a slightly different way, creating about a dozen mini-laboratories within one massive test case. Even places that have already taken the legalization plunge are hoping Canada will solve some mysteries. After Colorado legalized marijuana five years ago, for example, organized crime reacted by ramping up supplies of “black tar heroin, opiates and harder drugs”, said Dr Larry Wolk, the state’s top public health official. But Wolk says he is interested to watch that process unfold on a bigger scale in Canada, where the new law is expected to deal a much more significant blow to the black market. Any new mix of illicit drugs in the country could have new effects on public health. “What’s the impact of marijuana legalization on the opioid crisis?” he asked as an example. “Does it actually act as a substitute so that people can get off opiates for chronic pain? Is there a positive impact? Or is it a negative impact, because as a result there’s more opiates in the black market? Is [pot] a gateway? We don’t really have an answer.” One delicate balance for Canadian authorities has been guessing at what kind of pricing will be low enough to eradicate illicit sales – yet not so low as to entice new users. Canada’s finance minister, Bill Morneau, recently said the goal is “keeping cannabis out of the hands of kids and out of the black market. That means keeping the taxes low so we can actually get rid of the criminals in the system”. One sign of success will be if Canada not only discourages underground sales, but converts illicit sellers to the new system, said Tim Boekhout van Solinge, a Dutch criminologist. “What I am mainly following … is who will be the new legal growers, and whether authorities manage to get some of the illegal growers to become legal growers,” he said. Each country around the world that has debated whether to relax cannabis laws has had its own priority in mind: from generating revenue to discouraging drug cartels. In Canada, the emphasis has been largely on public health. Cannabis will be sold in fairly plain packaging, and usually through government-run boards that already control liquor sales. “It won’t be like buying Budweiser or branded alcoholic products,” said Steve Rolles of Transform, a UK drug policy thinktank. “It’s going to be more like buying pharmaceuticals from a chemist.” Still, it’s hard to know whether Canada, or any similar western country, will be able to stick to that public-health focus, he said. “We have concerns … that the lessons from alcohol and tobacco wouldn’t be learned, and we might see overcommercialized markets in which profit-making entities would seek to encourage more use and could encourage risky consumption behaviours,” he said. So far, Canada has allowed a few major players to dominate the industry, and their influence remains to be seen, said US marijuana industry expert Mark Kleiman. “You don’t want to build up big vested interests that then resist any change,” he said. “If you have commercial industry in cannabis, they’re going to end up writing the laws.” For epidemiologists, Canada will provide the best-ever data sets on cannabis use. Colorado’s health results have been encouraging, said Wolk. But overall, researchers lack solid data about cannabis use. Some key questions include addiction levels, how cannabis affects mental health, and effects on young people, said Israeli scientist Raphael Mechoulam, often called the “grandfather” of cannabis research. “About 10% of the users may be addicted – less than alcohol or tobacco,” he said. “Some users, who are already prone to schizophrenia, may get the disease earlier.” He said he is also keeping an eye on whether heavy use by young people may affect their central nervous system. Another current Canadian health debate is how many people will be light, casual cannabis users, and how many will be heavy users. The government still must decide how to approach products that are “very potent” in THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, said Mark Ware, a drug researcher and pain specialist who helped lead Canada’s federal taskforce advising the new legislation. Black-market sellers have produced increasingly strong concentrates, he said. “Those have not been the subject of studies up until recently, so the question of whether to regulate those, allow them in whatever context, and then be able to study their impacts on health, that would be very important,” he said. But “once they’re out there, it’s very hard to put them back in the box again”. Canadian police, meanwhile, will grapple with how to crack down on cannabis-impaired driving. That’s already a struggle around the world, regardless of marijuana’s legality, said Rolles. But it’s much more difficult to measure impairment from cannabis than from alcohol, and enforcing a legal limit will prove tricky. Meanwhile, many investors have already made huge profits from cannabis stocks, and a big question for them is whether the bubble bursts – or the value keeps rising. “They’re waiting to see if the sky’s going to fall,” said Sinclair of Canopy. One of about 100 Canadian legal producers of medical cannabis, the company owns a third of the medical market, began trading on the Toronto stock exchange in 2016 and last month became the only cannabis producer on the New York stock exchange. “[Investors] are waiting to see if all the stigma and all the demonization of this product that’s built up in 90 years of prohibition is true,” Sinclair said. “It’s on us to demonstrate that it’s not.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/02/nafessa-williams-black-lightning-thunder-interview--superhero-young-black-girls","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T14:37:54Z","webTitle":"Nafessa Williams: ‘As a young black girl I didn’t have a superhero like me to look up to’","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/02/nafessa-williams-black-lightning-thunder-interview--superhero-young-black-girls","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/02/nafessa-williams-black-lightning-thunder-interview--superhero-young-black-girls","fields":{"headline":"Nafessa Williams: ‘As a young black girl I didn’t have a superhero like me to look up to’","bodyText":"It’s a genre dominated by white, straight males, so American actress Nafessa Williams admits she was moved to tears when she pulled on her costume for the first time to play a black, lesbian superhero. “It was a moment,” she says. “I mean, I’m representing a whole group of people who need to see themselves on TV.” Williams plays Thunder in the hit television series Black Lightning – and is in London this week to promote its second series and hopefully convert more Britons to what she admits is “not your typical superhero show”. “Yes, we’re wearing costumes but we’re not fighting aliens or creatures in an alternative universe,” she says. “We’re fighting real-life issues that are happening within our country, in our inner cities. Police brutality, gang crime, drug crime, social injustice – and we’re shedding light on it.” Set in the fictional city of Freeland, the show, says Williams, is first and foremost about a family trying to save its community. A community overrun by the “100 Gang” – notorious for drug and sex trafficking. “It’s not until you see us in costumes that you realise, oh, this is a superhero show as well,” she says. Williams plays Anissa Pierce, a medical student and black-rights activist who learnt of her superhuman powers in the first series. She is one of three lead characters in the same family. Jefferson Pierce (played by Cress Williams) is her father and, secretly, Black Lightning, the eponymous superhero of the comic strip first published in 1979 by DC Comics – the birthplace of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. In this TV adaptation Pierce is trying to give up his electrically charged powers and change society through peaceful means, as a high-school principal. But his eldest daughter Anissa vows to fight. “I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired,” she says, echoing the words of civil rights hero Fannie Lou Hamer. “Anissa is so bold, and so unapologetic. I’ve found myself being an activist through my character. She’s inspiring the hell out of me,” says Williams. Like all superheroes, Anissa (aka Thunder) has a love interest, but hers is no dweeby college boy. This superwoman is a lesbian with a girlfriend named Grace Choi, a half-Amazonian Asian-American played by Canadian actress Chantal Thuy. It is a throwback, perhaps, to Wonder Woman, who many believe was drawn originally as a gay hero but who has morphed back to heterosexuality over time. In the 2017 film, for example, Wonder Woman’s love interest is an American serviceman. Not Thunder though. Her emotional battle is coming out as a superhero, not as a lesbian. As a gay woman, she is open, happy and comfortable – with supportive parents. A big part of season two, though, will explore her love life further. “I like the idea of continuing that relationship [with Grace], seeing where it goes,” Williams says. “I think it’s very real. and people want to relate to issues that they’re going through themselves.” She tells how a teenager recently approached her and thanked her for playing a strong, black, gay woman. “She said that after seeing Anissa she now feels normal being a lesbian. It’s pretty cool because as a young black girl I didn’t have a superhero to look up to – there was no one who looked like me,” she says. Williams grew up in Philadelphia and briefly pursued a career in law, even working in a homicide department. She got fired though, after going without permission to an audition. Inspired in part, she says, by fellow Philadelphian Will Smith, Williams committed to carving a career in acting. She played Jade in last year’s Twin Peaks reboot, but Thunder has been her breakthrough role. Now that the characters have been developed she hopes the show will “take it up a notch”. Her younger sister in the series, Jennifer (played by China Anne McClain) is the third key character and will have her own coming-of-age superhero story line in season two. “We can hit the streets together and fight crime, that will definitely be cool,” Williams says. But taking on the bad guys is secondary, she believes, to the wider theme of communities struggling to find ways to cope. “I hope it will inspire other families to overcome their issues,” she says. “We all have that superhero inside us, but it’s about tapping into it and embracing it and owning it.” Black Lightning is available on Netflix. Season 2 is expected to air next year"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/jun/01/facebook-teens-leaving-instagram-snapchat-study-user-numbers","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T20:04:21Z","webTitle":"Teens are abandoning Facebook in dramatic numbers, study finds","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jun/01/facebook-teens-leaving-instagram-snapchat-study-user-numbers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/jun/01/facebook-teens-leaving-instagram-snapchat-study-user-numbers","fields":{"headline":"Teens are abandoning Facebook in dramatic numbers, study finds","bodyText":"Teenagers have abandoned Facebook in favour of other social media platforms such as Snapchat and Instagram, according to a study from the Pew Research Center. Just 51% of US individuals aged 13 to 17 say they use Facebook – a dramatic plunge from the 71% who said they used the social network in Pew’s previous study in 2015, when it was the dominant online platform. In this year’s study reported Facebook use was, according to Pew, “notably lower” than the percentage of teens who said they used YouTube (85%), Instagram (72%) or Snapchat (69%). In the previous study, just 52% of teens said they used Instagram, while 41% said they used Snapchat. YouTube was not included in the 2014-2015 survey. Use of Facebook was markedly higher among lower-income teens, with 70% of those living in households earning less than $30,000 a year using the platform, compared with just 36% of those whose annual family income is $75,000 or more. When asked which of the online platforms teens used the most, only 10% said Facebook. Thirty-five percent said Snapchat, 32% said YouTube and 15% said Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook. “Again, lower-income teens are far more likely than those from higher income households to say Facebook is the online platform they use most often (22% v 4%),” states the report, titled Teens, Social Media &amp; Technology 2018. There were also some differences connected to gender and ethnicity. Girls are more likely to identify Snapchat as their most used site (42% v 29%) while boys were more likely to say YouTube (39% v 25%). Black teens are more likely than white teens to identify Facebook as their go-to platform (26% v 7%), while white teens (41%) are more likely to identify Snapchat as their most-used platform compared with Hispanic (29%) or black (23%) teens. This is not the first study to indicate that teens are leaving Facebook. In February this year, an eMarketer study estimated that Facebook’s user base among Americans aged 12-17 declined by 9.9% in 2017 – almost three times greater than the same research firm had predicted in August of 2017. The company predicted that Facebook would lose a further 2.1 million American users under the age of 25 this year. “This is something we have observed anecdotally for a long time,” said the eMarketer analyst Paul Verna, who said his own daughters – aged 17 and 14 – are the perfect representative case study. “When the 17-year-old turned 13, getting a Facebook account was a rite of passage. Not long after she got the account she realised she didn’t have much use for it. When the younger one turned 13 she didn’t even lobby for a Facebook account. It was all about Instagram for her and still is,” he said. “It’s a big plus that Facebook owns Instagram, but this is a problem for their flagship brand and platform that they really need to sink their teeth into.” Teens are highly prized by social platforms for a number of reasons: people tend to take their habits with them as they age, they give platforms the “cool factor” and attract advertisers. In Verna’s view, this demographic shift is a “greater existential threat” to Facebook than the privacy concerns to have emerged following the Cambridge Analytics scandal. Other findings in this year’s Pew study include the fact that 95% of teens now say they have access to a smartphone – up from 73% in the 2015 survey. Some 45% of teens say they use the internet “almost constantly”, around twice as many as the 24% who said this in 2015. Despite the teen exodus, Facebook remains the world’s largest social platform with 2.2 billion monthly users.

Now pop’s bright light is shining again","bodyText":"The The were among the most critically acclaimed and politically engaged bands of the 1980s. Albums such as Soul Mining and Infected are considered among the decade’s finest releases. But for almost 20 years, Matt Johnson, the band’s founder, singer and songwriter, vanished from public view, refusing to write, record or perform. “I intentionally fell off the radar and disappeared from sight,” he says. Now, to the surprise and delight of fans, Johnson and The The are back with a new tour, including three sold-out shows in London venues this week. “It is 18 years since I last toured,” says Johnson, now 56. “You could fit the Beatles’ career two-and-a-half times into that. I am coming back into a world that has changed.” Johnson’s decision to walk away from the music industry was triggered by the sudden death in 1989 of his younger brother, Eugene, at a time when The The were halfway through a world tour. “It hit the family very hard because we were very close,” he says. “I was suffering from undigested grief. I relocated to New York and had a relationship breakdown. I lost faith in the future and the whole music business career thing felt shallow and irrelevant.” There were also physical symptoms, as Johnson was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome. The emotional fallout from Eugene’s death at the age of 24, coupled with a music industry that felt less hospitable to bands that produced albums rather than hit singles, left Johnson struggling to record, and he eventually quit the music business altogether. “I travelled like a man on the run,” he recalls, “rarely sleeping in the same bed for more than two or three nights in a row.” Instead of writing or recording music he took up photography, kept a journal and became involved in fighting property developments in east London. “I had very little connection with the music industry and I was just living out of a suitcase,” Johnson says. “Accountants, lawyers and managers were saying, ‘What are you doing?’ ” When fans would ask when Johnson was going to reform The The, he would tell them he was taking time off. If the death of his younger brother led to the end of The The, it was the death of his older brother, Andrew, in 2016 that prompted Johnson to revive the band. Andrew was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012. “It was in the same week that my younger son was born,” he says. “My brother was supposed to meet the baby but he had a headache and that got worse. I went from one of the happiest days of my life to sitting with my brother when he got the diagnosis [that he had only months to live]. I went to pieces, just sobbing, couldn’t sleep for weeks, and it brought all the stuff with my younger brother back. I was determined I would not repeat what had happened with Eugene.” In fact, Andrew’s death motivated Johnson to start writing songs again, and the song he dedicated to his brother – We Can’t Stop What’s Coming – is featured in a 2017 documentary about Johnson called The Inertia Variations, which was being filmed at the time Andrew died. “When I saw the film for the first time, there is a scene where my older son, Jack, is watching me rehearse,” says Johnson, “and he says, ‘I think it is wonderful my dad is making a comeback on behalf of Andrew.’ ” The comment reminded Johnson that Jack, who is 21, was only three when Johnson last played on tour. “I had disconnected totally from the music industry,” he says, adding that, although he rarely listens to new music, “the music I am hearing, the popular stuff, seems to be very narcissistic, but it is just reflecting the culture it is coming from”. Johnson had been sceptical there would be any interest in the band now. Those doubts were allayed when this week’s shows at the Royal Albert Hall, Brixton Academy and Limehouse Troxy all sold out. Thinking back to The The’s heyday, Johnson remains ambivalent about the decade. “I hated the 80s,” he says. “I didn’t feel comfortable. I didn’t like the fashion or the TV shows or the politics of Thatcherism and Reaganomics.” Those politics led him to write songs such as 1986’s Heartland, including the lyrics: “Let the poor drink the milk while the rich eat the honey, let the bums count their blessings while the rich count the money.” Little has changed, he says. “The gap between rich and poor is even worse now than then.

One woman, Melissa Thompson, accuses Weinstein of sexually harassing her when she went to his office to pitch a business idea, then luring her to a hotel room in New York and raping her. The complaint also details how she initially approached the law firm of Benjamin Brafman last year, and turned over evidence, before realizing that Weinstein was actually a client of Brafman’s. Brafman defended Weinstein on the steps of the court house in New York last Friday after the disgraced producer was taken there in handcuffs to face charges. A second complainant, actress Caitlin Dulany, alleges that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in Cannes in 1996, while a third woman, actress Larissa Gomes, accuses Weinstein of attacking her in a hotel in Toronto in 2000. Weinstein denies any nonconsensual sexual conduct. Weinstein is already the defendant in another class action lawsuit filed by six women in California. Friday’s case was filed in New York. The lawsuit accuses Weinstein of running offices at the movie companies he controlled – Miramax and then the Weinstein Company - and hotel rooms like a “casting couch”, and says this was “a choice facilitated and condoned by Miramax, the Weinstein Company and its board of directors”. The action says the plaintiffs and “hundreds of other females” found themselves with Weinstein in such places, where he “isolated” them “in an attempt to engage in unwanted sexual conduct that took many forms: flashing, groping, fondling, harassing, battering, false imprisonment, sexual assault, attempted rape and/or completed rape”. It adds that “at all times” his victims were at risk of being “threatened or blacklisted” by Weinstein and his companies if they refused his unwanted sexual advances or complained about his behavior. The lawsuit sues Weinstein, a series of companies, including Disney, and named executives and unnamed plaintiffs that he has worked with, many of whom are seen as having enabled his conduct."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/02/frank-lampard-in-derby-county-zinedine-zidane-out-real-madrid","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T13:00:18Z","webTitle":"Lampard in, Zidane out: welcome to the madhouse, Frank | Paul Wilson","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/02/frank-lampard-in-derby-county-zinedine-zidane-out-real-madrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/02/frank-lampard-in-derby-county-zinedine-zidane-out-real-madrid","fields":{"headline":"Lampard in, Zidane out: welcome to the madhouse, Frank","bodyText":"Frank Lampard was minutes into his new job as Derby County manager when the news came through that a vacancy had just cropped up at Real Madrid. “He certainly quit at a good time,” Lampard said, thinking on his feet. “I don’t know Zinedine Zidane’s plans but he will want a holiday, I’m guessing, before he does anything else. You can’t beat that for going out at the top, though. Maybe that’s a lesson to us all.” First you have to reach the top, of course, and not that many managers do. Lampard was careful not to promise promotion to the Premier League in his first season in charge, but it is no secret that is Derby’s fervent desire. The club’s seventh manager in three years knows perfectly well that nothing he has achieved in the game as a player will count for much if his side are off the pace three or four months into the season. Lampard has relatives with experience of management, his father, Frank, and uncle Harry Redknapp. Did they not warn him off this most insecure of careers? “Quite the opposite,” Lampard replied. “Maybe they are the ones who are mad.” All managers are a little bit mad. Even though the job these days is hugely well-rewarded, you still need the combination of drive, megalomania and obsessive attention to detail that you always did to put yourself up for it. The theory used to be that when you reach the top, where you are in charge of a big club with the very best players, things would get slightly easier. Arsène Wenger might dispute that but Zidane’s resignation five days after entering the history books with a third Champions League title in three seasons puts a whole new spotlight on the madness at the top end of the management game. To put what Zidane has just done into perspective, only two other managers have won the European Cup three times, and Bob Paisley did so towards the end of his career while Carlo Ancelotti had been a manager for 10 years by the time he completed his treble. Zidane has been in management for only three years. Each has ended in big silverware (even if this season was not quite as glittering on the domestic front) and he is now saying he has had enough. From the sound of it he has had enough of Real Madrid, not necessarily of football management, though that is hardly the sort of ringing endorsement to make his eventual successor impatient to start work. While the Real Madrid position has famously proved a poisoned chalice for even the best and most established managers – Ancelotti, José Mourinho, Vicente del Bosque and Fabio Capello have all been shown the door after varying degrees of success – the job description at the moment is particularly mind-boggling. To do: catch up with Barcelona in the league; sort out the Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale situations, bringing in high-quality replacements if necessary; pursue Neymar; and reach the Champions League final as an absolute minimum, even if winning it three times in a row is not strictly necessary. No wonder Chelsea’s unhappy Antonio Conte was instantly linked with the task. Mauricio Pochettino might be the more rational, long-sighted solution, but Real are not exactly famous for being rational and long-sighted. The Tottenham manager must think long and hard about whether it would be wise to trade his current stability for the insanely pressurised though undoubtedly alluring role at Madrid, though Conte could much more easily make the jump from one madhouse to another. For a start he seems to be in need of a new job anyway, with Chelsea going so far as haggling over the price of importing Maurizio Sarri from Naples as a replacement, and for another his angry ant persona would fit right in at the Bernabéu, whereas the steady and reliable Pochettino might end up being treated like Rafa Benítez. News that Roman Abramovich has pulled the plug on Chelsea’s proposed £1bn stadium, apparently in protest at off-handed treatment over a visa renewal, is being interpreted as the beginning of the end of the financial muscle the club has enjoyed over the last 15 years. Conte would doubtless argue that the beginning of the end was actually about a year ago, just after Chelsea had won the title, though if Abramovich is suddenly being careful about spending nothing can be taken for granted. Conte might have to see out the last year of his contract, for instance, instead of picking up an expected £9m in compensation, while Abramovich must also be wondering, just like everybody else, how on earth Napoli can demand any sort of compensation for a coach they have already removed and replaced. No wonder Benítez, who has worked for both Real Madrid and Chelsea, is content to keep a low profile at Newcastle. Mike Ashley is no one’s idea of a dream owner, yet in the mad, mad world of top-level management there are plenty worse. One can only wish Lampard the best of luck at the club where a lot of the madness started. “Last of all, bottom of the heap, lowest of the low,” shouts the Derby chairman Sam Longson, giving a rundown on how a club is run just before dismissing the title-winning Brian Clough in David Peace’s The Damned United, “comes the one who in the end we can all do without. The effing manager.” Lampard knows the story, has seen the film. “It’s a high-pressure job,” he said on becoming the newest recruit to the asylum. “That’s the nature of the beast.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/01/stuart-broad-sets-standard-that-was-missing-pakistan-second-test","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T17:34:58Z","webTitle":"Stuart Broad sets a bowling standard that was missing at Lord’s | Ali Martin","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/01/stuart-broad-sets-standard-that-was-missing-pakistan-second-test","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/01/stuart-broad-sets-standard-that-was-missing-pakistan-second-test","fields":{"headline":"Under-fire Stuart Broad sets a bowling standard that was missing at Lord’s","bodyText":"As a wily old pro Stuart Broad has long since learned to deal with the ups and downs that come with being a subject of critique. But after the captain who handed him his Test cap 10 years ago called for him during the week to be dropped he was not going to let it lie. It was Michael Vaughan who used both his Telegraph column and BBC radio show after the dismal defeat at Lord’s to suggest that either Broad or Jimmy Anderson should perhaps miss out at Headingley to “ruffle a few feathers” in what he perceives to be a cosy England team. Broad, speaking after his impressive display of three for 38 led the charge for Joe Root’s side as they gutted Pakistan for 174 on the opening day, admitted the criticism did in fact sting a touch, such that he even called Vaughan to get to the bottom of it. “I like punditry, I find it interesting,” said Broad after stumps. “I respect everyone’s opinion, especially when it’s fair. But this time it did anger me a little bit because I thought it was unfair and targeted. I’m not going to hold a personal grudge. I just didn’t feel like I really deserved that last week and I thought I’d express that opinion to him.” And the charge of the team being too cosy? “It’s a complete shot in the dark, isn’t it? He doesn’t know what the changing room is like. I don’t think he’s got much insight into it at all. “The players don’t talk much to him about cricket or what’s going on. So it’s a wild guess. But then columns and radio shows need ‘likes’ and airtime.” Whatever the reason, Root and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, desperately needed the response that followed. The wickets may have been shared but, as the players left the field at 3.28pm, satisfied with their two sessions of work despite a late rally via Shadab Khan, it was fitting the wide-brimmed sunhat of Broad was front and centre. Perhaps the worm turned for Root when he lost the toss. Sarfraz Ahmed was either unaware of the adage to “look up, not down” here or maybe, like the German tennis player Alexander Zverev, he did not understand a Yorkshire accent (the Pakistan captain had a spell playing Twenty20 for the club last year). Though certainly no howler, given the bare beige pitch laid out, the soupy conditions of cloud and humidity suggested the ball might well swing. While the expectation then is for Anderson to come into his own, it was more the seam-oriented Broad who set the standard with a two-wicket burst up front and, according to CricViz, his greatest amount of movement through the air for nearly three years. True, the delivery that Imam-ul-Haq slashed to Root at third slip in his second over may have been full and wide. But it was a tantalising change from a nagging line that had already meant the opener was reprieved on review second ball after being given out lbw, and one that this bespectacled nephew of the great Inzamam could not resist. Similarly the removal of Azhar Ali was a fine working over, offering the right-hander some width with a succession of balls before the full straight surprise produced the simplest of lbw decisions. A lone Pakistan fan in the stands could be seen wiping Azhar’s name from a chalkboard that he had briefly been holding up, ready for the next batsman to get behind. From there England’s attack scarcely looked back, with Chris Woakes making good use of Broad’s slipstream on his return from the Indian Premier League to gouge out two further strikes before lunch – underlining how useful he might have been a week ago – and Anderson, too easily left in his opening spell, piling in during the afternoon. Three wickets apiece was the final analysis for the senior trio – Broad’s third, Usman Salahuddin lbw, took him level with Wasim Akram on 414 Test wickets – with Sam Curran also opening his account on debut. The 19-year-old will doubtless have his game pored over by the pundits in the coming days and years; he could do worse than speak to Broad about how best to cope with it all."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/01/talking-horses-saxon-warrior-derby-horse-racing-tips","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T23:01:02Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Saxon Warrior can justify favouritism in the Derby","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/01/talking-horses-saxon-warrior-derby-horse-racing-tips","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/01/talking-horses-saxon-warrior-derby-horse-racing-tips","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Saxon Warrior can justify favouritism in the Derby","bodyText":"After all the dithering this week about ground, distance and stalls position, it is time for punters to make up their minds about the longstanding Derby favourite, Saxon Warrior (4.30). Most of us have probably gone back and forth over the same questions more often than is really healthy in the last few days but in the last analysis and without wishing to be reductive about it, he is the standout talent and perfectly capable of rising to the challenge facing him. His draw in stall one is not some distraction to be waved away; repeated experience over the last decade suggests it is the wrong place to start if you want to win over this course and distance. But few of those who have tried can have been in a field one-third of which is made up of their stablemates. The saving grace is that Saxon Warrior does not have to go forward from the off. I expect Ryan Moore to settle him towards the rear and make his ground gradually around the edge of the field, doubtless getting a good tow from one or more of his stablemates. If that is the plan, a bit of juice in the ground will be helpful, since it reduces the chance of some pacesetter building an unassailable advantage while Moore creeps forward. The big question for the favourite is whether he truly has the stamina for a mile and a half and the circumstances of this race mean he will probably face a thorough test on that score. At around even-money, or close to it, I am perfectly happy to take that chance. His pedigree and form suggest 10 furlongs is well within his compass. We shall have to keep our fingers crossed for the last 24 seconds. On fast, summer ground, I would have been sorely tempted by Roaring Lion, who showed such pace at York, but the recent rain has undermined his chance of lasting home. The most interesting alternatives are Delano Roosevelt and Zabriskie, both of whom could improve on all previous form over this distance, on ground with some give. But both are stablemates of Saxon Warrior and it would be easier to fancy their chances if they represented connections determined to cause an upset. Even so, Zabriskie is over-priced at 66-1 and an each-way play on him is very tempting. 2.00 Epsom His winning run came to an end at Ascot last time, when he was outpaced on a fast surface, but Corazon Espinado might be able to go well again in these different circumstances. He won here, at his local track, in April. 2.35 Epsom Fast ground may have been part of the problem for Anna Nerium in the Guineas, when she finished in midfield in a race won by a much less fancied stablemate. Progressive as a juvenile, she was quite an impressive winner of the Free Handicap in April and could resume her upward curve on this more suitable surface. On breeding, she should have plenty of improvement left in her. 3.10 Epsom Arod may be remembered by some as the fourth-placed horse from the 2014 Derby. Having lost his form here and spent time in Australia, he has returned to a new stable and won at Windsor last month. He will be dangerous if allowed an easy lead, though that seems unlikely in this field, so a better bet could be Century Dream. He can be forgiven a reappearance flop on heavy in France and put up a career best when scoring at Ascot last time. 3.45 Epsom The stands’ side has often been the place to be in this, one of the fastest and scariest races of the year, and that seems even more likely to be true after Friday’s races, with the winner of the Coronation Cup finishing hard against the outer rail. Dark Shot is well drawn with that in mind, so long as he is able to hold a respectable position through the early stages. He could not do that last year but finished strongly to be beaten by a short-head. Having changed stables in the winter, he put up a fine comeback effort when second at York a fortnight ago and is surely ready to go close again here. Stalls position has not meant much to Caspian Prince, who won this from a high draw in 2016 and from a low draw last year. His recent form raises doubt as to whether he can do it once more at the age of nine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/02/school-sexual-abuse-support-staff-gmb-union","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T15:05:08Z","webTitle":"Tenth of school staff suffer in ‘epidemic  of abuse’ by pupils","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/02/school-sexual-abuse-support-staff-gmb-union","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/02/school-sexual-abuse-support-staff-gmb-union","fields":{"headline":"Tenth of school staff suffer in ‘epidemic  of abuse’ by pupils","bodyText":"More than one in 10 teaching support staff say they have experienced sexually inappropriate behaviour from pupils, according to a leading union. The finding has triggered calls for schools to adopt “zero tolerance” to a problem that, the GMB says, can leave its members mentally scarred. A survey by the union, which this week holds its 101st annual congress, said 11% of classroom-based staff had encountered such behaviour. The survey, the most comprehensive of its kind, is further evidence of what some are calling an “epidemic of abuse” in Britain’s schools. The NASUWT union recently reported that one in five teachers said they had been sexually harassed at school by a colleague, manager, parent or pupil. In the GMB survey, which focuses specifically on pupil abuse of school employees, staff said abuse took the form of verbal comments, innuendo, inappropriate touching and the taking of inappropriate photographs. “Our members enjoy positive, professional relationships with the vast majority of pupils, and are dedicated to supporting children and young people,” said Karen Leonard, GMB national officer. “However, some tell us that an unacceptable proportion of students use inappropriate language to each other and to staff regularly. No one should have to put up with being sexually abused at work – and that includes our members in schools.” Much of the abuse appears to be facilitated by technology. GMB members said that pupils used their smartphones to take inappropriate pictures of female staff – a practice sometimes known as “upskirting” or “down blousing”. More than 4,600 school support staff responded to the question “Have you experienced sexually inappropriate behaviour from pupils?”. More than 10.5% said they had. The use of inappropriate and sexually suggestive terms by pupils to staff includes calling them “babe”, “beautiful”, “my milf”, “prostitute” and “pervert”. Female staff reported that male pupils urge them to perform sexual acts, smack them on their behinds or touch their breasts. Boys would also expose themselves and masturbate in class. “These testimonies from our dedicated school staff make very tough reading and bring home the difficult situations many of our teaching assistants, school administrators, lunchtime supervisors and others experience every day,” Leonard said. “It’s not surprising many are left stressed, intimidated and even with mental scars. But schools must make sure they have proper policies, guidelines and principles for when these incidents do take place. GMB demands a zero-tolerance approach, with proper, reliable support systems for those who do experience it.” In Scotland, MSPs have discussed banning the use of mobile phones in schools as the only way to tackle the epidemic of boys taking sexual pictures of women teachers and schoolgirls without their knowledge or consent. Some have suggested that the UK introduce a French-style ban, where children are allowed to bring phones, but are barred from using them in school time."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/02/mako-vunipola-england-south-africa-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T21:00:28Z","webTitle":"Mako Vunipola: ‘What has pleased me most is playing so many games‘","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/02/mako-vunipola-england-south-africa-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/02/mako-vunipola-england-south-africa-tour","fields":{"headline":"Mako Vunipola: ‘What has pleased me most is playing so many games‘","bodyText":"A year ago this weekend Mako Vunipola was on the Lions’ bench for the opening match of their New Zealand tour and was pressed into action nine minutes into the second half to head off the prospect of an unthinkable defeat by a side scavenged from the lower reaches of the professional game in the land of the World Cup holders. The England prop has made 35 appearances since then and, in an age when player welfare is talked about constantly, he should be resting his feet somewhere unspoiled by rugby posts. He duly boarded a plane this weekend, on tour but not a tourist. His campaign has another month to run with England, in need of redemption in South Africa for a three-Test series after slumping to fifth in the Six Nations and conceding 63 points to the Barbarians last Sunday. And so Vunipola – who had two rest weekends last season, one at the beginning – trudges on, not that the 27-year-old is complaining. “I did not have the best pre-season and had a slow start with Saracens, understandably, but the year has been OK,” says Vunipola, the man of the match last weekend when Saracens defeated Exeter at Twickenham to reclaim the Premiership title. “What has pleased me the most is being involved and having the opportunity to play so many games. Fortunately I have been injury-free. “The hardest part of the season was midway through the Six Nations. It was not so much that I felt my tank was getting low but the disappointment at losing matches. It was hard to lift myself going back to Saracens and the transition back to club rugby was tough. We talked about it as a group of players and looked on it as an opportunity to get better which, I think, we did.” Vunipola played at the end of the season as if it were the beginning and was named the man of the match in the semi-final victory over Wasps and in the final when, in 30C heat, he lasted 75 minutes and covered more ground with the ball in hand than any other forward and made 18 tackles. His scrummaging, once perceived as a weakness that would stunt his international growth, has improved as the importance of the set piece has diminished. But his value lies in his contribution in the loose, where he acts like an extra back-row forward. “I would have given myself a seven out of 10 in the play-off matches,” he says. “I could have done better in one or two scrums and at times got back into the game quicker but overall it was pretty pleasing.” When it is put to him that he made the game look easy with his perpetual motion and constant involvement, he replies: “It is not. I am fortunate to have great team-mates. I just push hard in the scrum and whatever comes after that is a bonus.” There is likely to be some scrum pushing in South Africa, one of the few countries who still regard the set piece as something more than cosmetic. They have recalled Bismarck du Plessis, who was in South Africa’s World Cup-winning squad in 2007, when Eddie Jones was a consultant for the Springboks, while a survivor from the 2009 series victory over the Lions, Tendai Mtawarira, is approaching 100 caps at loosehead prop. “South Africans pride themselves on how physical they are,” says Vunipola. “That will be the first and foremost challenge for us as a team. They are a very emotional people who wear their hearts on their sleeves and we know we are going to have to be ready in the opening 20 minutes of the first Test when, with a new coach and a new team, they will come out with guns blazing. “I am fortunate at Saracens to have played alongside some great South Africans. They are the nicest people off the field but on it they will do everything to intimidate you and gain the upper hand. Schalk Brits and Schalk Burger have given me a few hints about what to watch out for, and they epitomise how rugby there is played: it is scary some of the things they can do, skilful but first and foremost they want to hurt you with massive tackles.” Vunipola will take his body into the fray for a final month before getting July off but, when he returns, he faces more than 13 months of rugby, with the World Cup in Japan looming in September next year. “When I was younger, I did not realise how much effort you have to put in at the start of a week to get yourself right,” he says. “As I’ve got older, I know my body better and what I need to do. I never go up to the coaches and say I am not quite up to it today because I would feel guilty watching other players work. I just enjoy playing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/01/women-players-player-of-year-awards-jill-scott","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T22:53:02Z","webTitle":"Berger shares WSL award with Scott after return from cancer treatment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/01/women-players-player-of-year-awards-jill-scott","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/01/women-players-player-of-year-awards-jill-scott","fields":{"headline":"Berger shares WSL award with Scott after return from cancer treatment","bodyText":"Ann-Katrin Berger, the Birmingham City goalkeeper who returned from thyroid cancer treatment after just two months, has been named as the joint Women’s Super League Players’ Player of the Year, alongside Manchester City’s Jill Scott.

Now the police are cashing in on it","bodyText":"Over the course of my life, I have been convicted in four separate trials, sentenced to a total of 69 years in prison, and after many appeals served just over 20 of them – the first two in maximum security. I was finally released on parole in 1997. Given the length of time I was incarcerated, you might be thinking that I was involved in hard drugs or violence. After all, some murderers do less time than I did. But my crime? Conspiracy to import, possess and sell cannabis. I brought in tons of hash from the Middle East and tons of pot from Jamaica, Mexico and Colombia. Toronto’s infamous Rochdale College was my home base. After my first trial, I told the judge: “I’m going to do it again” – and I did – but I can assure you I never got involved with any harder drugs, let alone anything violent. I was strictly a pot guy: a hippy capitalist from Belleville, Ontario, who wanted as big a piece of the North American market as he could get. In jail, I saw myself as a prisoner of the war on drugs – one of the thousands of others who lost part of their future in the long, cruel and ultimately futile attempt to stop people from buying, selling and smoking weed. Norman Mailer testified on my behalf at my first trial, Neil Young at my second. Young told the court that he took exception to the prevailing stereotype of deadbeat pot smokers who could never make a positive contribution to society, pointing out that he was a prodigious toker and yet he still likely paid more taxes than everyone else in the court room combined. Now a new day is dawning in Canada – or so it seems. Possession of pot for recreational use is about to be legalized. Canadians will be able to possess up to 30 grams, buy it, share it, put it into edibles and grow a few plants. To be honest, I’ve never considered myself to be a marijuana activist. I wasn’t a campaigner for legalization: I was making big money, and legalization would have been bad for my business. I also don’t trust or respect politicians, especially when it comes to pot. In 1969, the prime minister, Pierre Trudeau, set up the LeDain Commission to study the pot scene in Canada. After hearing from thousands of Canadians, the report recommended cannabis possession be legalized. I was 18 at the time, a pot smoker and hopeful. Nothing happened. Fifty years later, however, the war on pot is finally over, and my side has won. So why am I not celebrating? Let’s start with the movement to grant amnesty to people with past cannabis convictions. I’m glad that the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said he plans to “move forward in a thoughtful way on fixing past wrongs that happened because of this erroneous law”. If the law is so “erroneous”, however, why is his government continuing to bust people for possession? In 2016, more than 17,000 Canadians were charged with a law that will soon disappear. Offering them amnesty would be a nice gesture, but the damage will have already been done. Why charge them in the first place? And how would amnesty work? After legalization in their states, several US cities, including San Francisco, Seattle and San Diego, moved to expunge all records of felony convictions for cannabis possession. Will Canada do the same? If not, amnesty will be a hollow gesture. Even then, Canadians with pot convictions may still not be allowed to travel to the US because American authorities have their conviction records on file. I’m also bothered by the fact that the government’s current plan is to bar people with pot convictions from participating in the huge marijuana economy that is now emerging. We have the expertise. We know how to grow high-quality plants. We have the distribution networks. The government’s policy is unfair, punitive and discriminatory: if it really believed in amnesty, it would let people with non-violent records for possession lead the way. Instead, the government has turned the pot economy over to the people who lost the drug war: the cops and politicians who were responsible for destroying so many lives by turning pot smokers into criminals. They’ve been given the keys to the vault. They’ll be profiting from the same activities they used to prosecute. The hypocrisy is staggering. Look at Julian Fantino, the former chief of the Toronto police service. In 2015, then a Conservative MP, Fantino declared his complete opposition to legalization, likening the decriminalization of marijuana to legalizing murder. Today, he’s on the board of directors of Aleafia, a company that connects patients to medical marijuana. When asked about his change of heart on pot, Fantino replied that he had embarked on a “fact-finding mission” and discovered that marijuana was not the demon drug he once thought it was. Perhaps he should have done some fact-finding before he started tossing people in jail. Also on the Aleafia board is Gary Goodyear, who held several cabinet positions in Stephen Harper’s government – the same government that proposed mandatory minimum sentences for anyone convicted of growing at least six marijuana plants. So is Raf Souccar, a former deputy commissioner of the RCMP whose portfolio included drug and organized crime enforcement. Former deputy Toronto police chief Kim Derry and ex-Ontario premier Ernie Eves are also members of the old law-and-order crowd who have rushed to cash in on the legalization of marijuana. On its website, Aleafia describes Fantino as a “leading expert on drug enforcement”. They’ve got that right. I’ve never had the pleasure of meeting the man, but shortly after joining the Toronto police department in 1969 he became a member of the drug squad, one of the hundreds of Toronto cops who pursued me relentlessly throughout the 1970s. Now he gets to cash in on the legalization of marijuana, while people with criminal records for something that is soon to become legal languish on the sidelines – or, in many cases, still in jail. If I’m a criminal, what word would you use to describe Fantino and all the other ex-cops and politicians who are now looking to get rich by switching to the other side? A simple amnesty is not enough. It should include an apology for ruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of people for no legitimate reason. They should be asking us to forgive them. I sentence them to have to live with themselves for the rest of their lives.

Worried that you’ll be in the red for the rest of your life? Well, why not forget about your spiralling debt by kicking back and watching a movie! This month, banking company Laurel Road announced that if you refinance your student loan with them, they will give you a year’s membership to MoviePass, the movie theater subscription service. The partnership shines a light on the growing market for private student loans. Private lenders currently hold less than 10% of the $1.4tn in outstanding student loan debt but have been aggressively lobbying for legislation that would loosen the government’s monopoly. Republican lawmakers have given them cause for optimism. Last year, congressional Republicans put forward the Prosper Act which would cap the federal loan amounts graduate students can receive. While private lenders often offer lower interest rates than the government, they don’t come with the same consumer protections as federal loans. Some experts worry that federal loan caps would steer students into private loans that aren’t necessarily in their best interests. In an effort to make themselves seem more attractive than federal options, some private lenders are branding themselves more like lifestyle companies. They’re not just loaning you money, they’re your best friend! Social Finance Inc (SoFi), one of the most high-profile private financial startups in the US, has led the charge in this regard. Since it launched in 2011 the company has attempted to differentiate itself by referring to its customers as “members” and inviting them to exclusive events like cocktail parties and cooking classes. In 2017, SoFi held 323 member events across the US (more than 60 cities), serving over 14,000 members. By the end of this year, the company says it will have organized more than 800 member events and hosted over 42,000 members in total. “We don’t think of ourselves as a finance company, we think of ourselves as money, career and relationships,” the then CEO, Mike Cagney, said at a technology conference last May. Cagney stepped down from the company late last year after allegations of sexual harassment. Before the Cagney controversy, SoFi floated the idea of launching a dating app, after seeing romances spring up between members at their events. While this idea was eventually scrapped the SoFi app does allow members who meet at events to message each other. Laurel Road’s partnership with MoviePass is more evidence of private lending companies trying to make student loan debt “fun” – even as student debt per capita has doubled in the past decade and there has been a rise in the number of cases brought against federal lenders illegally harassing their customers. The student loan crisis is now so dire that a new gameshow, Paid Off with Michael Torpey, is giving students the chance to compete on TV to have their debt paid off. The series which premieres in July on TruTV, is aimed at starting a conversation about the student debt crisis, not trivializing it, an executive from TruTV told the Guardian. Still, there is something inherently dystopian in the fact that America has reached a place where the only hope some people have for getting out of debt is winning a gameshow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/01/leeds-leigh-rugby-league-challenge-cup-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T20:57:19Z","webTitle":"Valiant Leigh allow Leeds to run riot after Peter Mata’utia dismissal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/01/leeds-leigh-rugby-league-challenge-cup-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/01/leeds-leigh-rugby-league-challenge-cup-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Valiant Leigh allow Leeds to run riot after Peter Mata’utia dismissal","bodyText":"In the hours leading up to this fiery Challenge Cup quarter-final the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott, had peculiarly called on the officials to adopt the refereeing style of the legendary 1970s whistleblower Fred Lindop and not to stand for any ‘old-school’ nonsense from either his side or Leigh. Whether Chris Kendall ultimately heard those calls is unclear and, while it is not hard to wonder what might have been for Leigh had the night’s defining moment – the eighth-minute sending-off of their full-back, Peter Mata’utia – not occurred, few could argue with Kendall channelling his inner Lindop following the horrendous suplex-style tackle on Matt Parcell. Though the game was in its infancy, the Championship side were already leading 6-0 and playing with the panache which saw them eliminate higher-ranked opposition, Salford, in the previous round, it was not unreasonable to assume Leigh would have at least made it a tiresome work’s evening for Leeds in their battle to reach the semi-finals again. Within 15 minutes of Mata’utia’s dismissal Leeds had scored four tries without reply; by half-time they had crossed for three more to open up a 28-point advantage that, despite the gamely efforts of Leigh, was never likely to be troubled in front of yet another sparse Challenge Cup crowd – though the fact Leeds had to move this game to Featherstone due to the cricket at Headingley played a part in that. Moments like Mata’utia’s dismissal can often split opinion – but even his own coach was accepting of the decision which swung the contest in Leeds’ favour from an early stage. “We saw it the same as you live – and it didn’t look great,” McDermott said. “Yes, it was a sending-off. The manner of victory for Leeds – who have lost their last three Super League games and slipped into mid-table – will be especially pleasing. But with an eight-week gap until the semi-finals in Bolton, arresting their Super League slump will be even tougher following yet more injuries to add to their ever-increasing list. Carl Ablett and Jimmy Keinhorst are set for prolonged spells on the sidelines, McDermott confirmed, but the emergence of young talent such as Mikolaj Oledzki and Jack Walker will at least give comfort to Rhinos fans that the future, as it so often is in Leeds, is bright. Walker in particular was a menacing influence all evening, scoring a try and having a hand in several more which put the hosts 40-12 ahead at half-time. Leigh, much to their credit, fought valiantly throughout – best underlined by the tries to Liam Hood and Ben Crooks in the final quarter. By then, though, Leeds had scored some magnificent tries – including one for Richie Myler, who combined superbly with Walker as Leigh toiled with their numerical disadvantage.

For those of us who lived through it, the three-month drought and associated heatwave conjure up memories of endless summer days, with blue skies and glorious heat. Oddly, perhaps, few temperature records were broken that year – August 1990 and 2003 recorded higher peak readings. One difference, though, was that some of the hottest days were in June and July: 35.6C in Southampton, on 28 June, was the highest ever recorded in the UK for the month of June, while the highest overall temperature in summer 1976 was 35.9C in Cheltenham, on 3 July. What made summer 1976 exceptional was both the relentless heat – it remains the hottest summer, overall, in recorded history – and the lack of rainfall: parts of south-west England saw more than 40 consecutive days without any rain. This led to what the tabloids dubbed a “plague” of ladybirds, as billions of them took to the skies in search of food. But the weather did, eventually, break: and, of course, this happened on August Bank Holiday – just after the Labour government had finally appointed the luckless Denis Howell as “Minister for Drought”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jul/27/weatherwatch-uk-wetland-birds-suffered-in-unusually-wet-2012","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-27T20:30:10Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: wetland birds suffered in unusually wet 2012","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/27/weatherwatch-uk-wetland-birds-suffered-in-unusually-wet-2012","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jul/27/weatherwatch-uk-wetland-birds-suffered-in-unusually-wet-2012","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: wetland birds suffered in unusually wet 2012","bodyText":"Weather-wise, 2012 was a strange year. At the start of spring, conservation organisations were predicting that wading birds such as the lapwing would not be able to find enough food for their chicks, because of a lengthy drought. A few months later, at the end of July, Britain had suffered one of the most prolonged spells of heavy rainfall in recorded history. The spell from April to July 2012 was the wettest period since weather records for England and Wales began in 1766, and for the country as a whole, the summer – defined as the three months from June to August – was the wettest for exactly a century. The effect of this weather on wetland birds was disastrous. In one flooded field in Somerset, a pair of black-winged stilts – rare visitors from mainland Europe – attempted to breed, but their eggs became soaked and did not hatch. Farmers, who had initially welcomed the rain, lost whole fields to flooding, and were unable to cut silage or make hay. The unusually wet weather was the result of a shift in the Atlantic jet stream, which tracked more southerly than usual, bringing low-pressure systems from the Atlantic and dumping vast amounts of rain on southern Britain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/01/england-seamers-pakistan-sarfraz-ahmed-wins-toss","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T17:52:53Z","webTitle":"Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson put England on top against Pakistan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/01/england-seamers-pakistan-sarfraz-ahmed-wins-toss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/01/england-seamers-pakistan-sarfraz-ahmed-wins-toss","fields":{"headline":"Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson put England on top against Pakistan","bodyText":"The International Cricket Council is contemplating the virtues of getting rid of the toss in Test cricket. Well, there are two captains, Joe Root and Sarfraz Ahmed, who might welcome being spared the agony of deciding what to do every time they win the toss. They are also becoming unwitting advocates of abandoning this idea. At Lord’s last week Root, despite a surprisingly green tinge to the playing surface, batted and England subsided to 184 all out on the first day. Here Sarfraz did the obvious thing. The pitch was dry and brown; the sun was trying to creep through hazy cloud, a task it rarely fulfilled; Pakistan batted and were bowled out for 174 and that total was bolstered by a late rally led by the irrepressible Shadab Khan. By the close England sat contentedly at 106 for two. Once again losing the toss had proved to be a wonderful bonus. This was not the Headingley of old when batsmen were constantly tormented by low movement off a treacherous track but the ball swung all day, often late in its flightpath and there was enough pace and bounce there for the majority of the nicks to carry. Batting was a trial whenever the bowlers’ radar was working. The Pakistan wickets were shared by a quartet of seamers, which included Sam Curran, who was given his first Test cap by Graham Thorpe at 10.15am after it was established that Ben Stokes was not fit to play. Curran’s first Test wicket was donated to him five hours later when Shadab, stranded with the last man, swung vigorously only to be caught at deep midwicket by Keaton Jennings. When Curran relates this landmark to his grandchildren (a long time from now – he’s only 19) he might point out that Jennings was England’s regular forward short-leg in this match and that his victim succumbed in the old leg trap. That may be enough detail; in any case it does not matter how you get that first one. The other pacemen took three wickets apiece, which constituted a satisfactory return for Chris Woakes, who was preferred to Mark Wood, partly because, in the absence of Stokes, England were required to rejig the batting line-up. Stuart Broad, no doubt pricked by the observations of the odd former colleague in the media, was the first to get the ball swinging. In his first over Imam-ul-Haq was given lbw by Rod Tucker, only to review successfully with the ball shown to be going over the stumps. No matter; Imam swung wantonly at the last ball of Broad’s over and Root held a neat catch at third slip. It was already apparent that the ball was swinging though in his first spell Jimmy Anderson was not able to exploit this as clinically as usual. Broad remained determined to bowl full while there was movement and he was rewarded with the wicket of Azhar Ali with an lbw that the batsman immediately recognised could not be reviewed. Woakes had not bowled with a red ball since the Melbourne Test – he was using a pink one in Auckland, after which he was dropped – and he bowled a horrible first over; a wide long-hop was followed by a long half-volley and eight runs to the total. But he settled well after that, comforted by the fact that the ball was moving more for England here than it did at Lord’s. Soon Woakes had the key wickets of Haris Sohail and Asad Shafiq, both caught in a slip cordon that functioned better than in the first Test, though there was one inexpensive drop by Dawid Malan, the new second slip, who had been hampered by the sight of Root diving towards him. At lunch Pakistan had sunk to 68 for four and within another half an hour they were 79 for seven as the old firm set to work. Anderson was now on target and he removed Ahmed and Faheem Ashraf, while Broad ensured that Usman Salahuddin’s first day as a Test cricketer would end in disappointment; he was lbw for four. Mohammad Amir opted for valour rather than discretion and was caught behind off Anderson for 13 prompting the Yorkshire crowd to start chanting “Oh Jimmy, Jimmy …” as if he was one of their own. Now Pakistan rallied through Shadab and a belligerent Hasan Ali, who added 43 together. Occasionally, Woakes’s rustiness was evident. As ever a bad ball at Headingley stood up and begged to be hit but a sharp caught and bowled brought the end of Hasan, not long before Curran celebrated his first wicket. By now the sun had obligingly resurfaced, which meant that batting was easier when Alastair Cook and Jennings began England’s reply. Jennings was positive in attack and defence. His ploy of standing almost a foot out of his crease when facing Mohammad Abbas was well conceived and executed; there was even one disdainful cover drive hit with such certainty that he could stand and admire the ball speeding to the boundary. Cook also hinted at fluency with his feet moving nimbly and they posted an opening partnership of 53, which equalled the highest for England since the start of the Ashes tour. Jennings looked to be relishing his return but his departure was limp. He prodded forward to Ashraf and in the last millisecond before playing the ball he may have decided to leave it. The ball feathered his outside edge and a golden opportunity had passed. The same applied to his partner an hour later. After adding 51 with Root with few alarms Cook managed to glove an ugly bouncer from Hasan and was caught behind down the leg side, a disappointing end to a heartening day for England. For the moment, at least, the ship has stopped listing."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jul/11/weatherwatch-weather-gods-confounded-sceptics-in-summer-2013","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-11T20:30:21Z","webTitle":"Weatherwatch: weather gods confounded sceptics in summer 2013","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/11/weatherwatch-weather-gods-confounded-sceptics-in-summer-2013","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jul/11/weatherwatch-weather-gods-confounded-sceptics-in-summer-2013","fields":{"headline":"Weatherwatch: weather gods confounded sceptics in summer 2013","bodyText":"Spring 2013 was one of the coolest and latest on record – March was even colder than during the Big Freeze of 1963 – so few people were expecting a decent summer.

June 2013 saw temperatures returning more or less to normal, and on the last day of that month the mercury rose above 27C at Heathrow airport: a hint of things to come. A few days later, on 3 July, an area of high pressure established itself across the country, remaining in place for the following 20 days. Temperatures gradually began to rise, and the week from 13 to 19 July produced readings of 28C or more across wide swathes of southern and eastern Britain, as far north as the Midlands. The hot weather peaked on 22 July, when Heathrow and Northolt recorded 33.5C – the highest anywhere in the UK for seven years. It couldn’t last, of course.

Trump was speaking to reporters after meeting Kim’s top aide, Kim Yong-chol, in the Oval Office. It had been billed as a brief courtesy visit but it continued for more than an hour and 20 minutes. In a lavish show of hospitality, Trump escorted his visitor, a former spy chief and general who is under US sanctions, outside the White House for more informal talks and to pose for photographs with the North Korean delegation. Trump also appeared to accept the North Korean position that its denuclearisation would be a drawn-out process – not the all-in-one surrender of the regime’s nuclear arsenal that Trump officials had previously demanded. “The big deal will be on June 12,” Trump said. “It’s a process, we’re not go in and sign something on June 12 and we never were. We are going to start a process. And I told them today: take your time. We can go fast, we can go slowly. I think they’d like to see something happen and if we can work something out that will be good.” But in a dramatic downgrading of expectations from the summit, Trump said Singapore meeting would be a “getting-to-know-you meeting, plus”. Such a meeting, the first ever between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, has been a longstanding objective of the Pyongyang regime. To achieve it, it has suspended nuclear and long-range missile tests, but has given no undertakings on the scale or speed of its nuclear disarmament. On Friday night the US defence secretary, James Mattis, hinted at some of the agenda for the 12 June talks, saying the “separate and distinct” issue of America’s troop presence in South Korea would not be on the table and “nor should it be”. If diplomacy with North Korea worked, then troop levels and similar issues could come up, but only in discussions between the US and South Korea. “Our objective remains the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula,” Mattis told the Shangri-La Dialogue, a security summit in Singapore. North Korea has entered agreements several times before in which it has promised to disarm, but those agreements all collapsed. In his remarks on Friday, Trump said that – although existing sanctions would stay in place – no new measures would be added, ditching the slogan that has defined his policy towards North Korea up to now. “I don’t want to use the term maximum pressure any more,” Trump said. “We have hundreds of new sanctions ready to go ... but why would I do that when we’re talking so nicely?” The president said that North Korea’s human rights record was not discussed in the meeting. Kim Yong-chol, the first top North Korean official to visit the White House in 18 years, was met outside the West Wing by the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, and the head of the CIA Korea department, Andrew Kim, who ushered the 72-year-old regime veteran into the Oval Office to meet Trump. Far from being hustled in through the back door of the White House, Kim was welcomed at the south lawn entrance in front of massed ranks of cameras and escorted to the Oval Office, where the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was waiting with Trump. The ceremonial arrival represented a propaganda coup for a regime that has endured decades of isolation. The content of the letter was not immediately apparent. Trump at one point described it as “interesting” and then claimed not to have opened it. “I may be in for a big surprise, folks,” he said. The Wall Street Journal reported it simply expressed Kim’s interest in going ahead with the Singapore summit, and does not change North Korea’s negotiating positions. Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, and Mike Pence, the vice-president – both hawks on North Korea – did not take part in the meeting and were nowhere to be seen before and after. Trump’s agreement to enter into a drawn-out negotiating process with North Korea, puts a question mark over Bolton’s future in the White House. He has insisted that any US agreement with Pyongyang would have to involve the regime’s unilateral and rapid surrender of its nuclear weapons programme, which Bolton referred to as the “Libyan model”. The North Korean leader laid his position out during a visit by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, on Thursday. Quoted by the state news agency, KCNA, Kim said “the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula will be solved on a stage-by-stage basis” in which each party addressed the interests of the other. Vipin Narang, an expert on the North Korean nuclear weapons programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it now appeared that Trump “seems to be ok with a stage-by-stage process”. “It won’t result in disarmament but a lot of good can still happen,” Narang said. The only other senior North Korean official ever to visit the White House was vice-marshal Jo Myong-rok, who delivered a letter to Bill Clinton from Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il. That peace effort collapsed with the election weeks later of George W Bush, who cut off contacts with Pyongyang."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/01/kanye-west-ye-new-album-cancelled","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T19:59:07Z","webTitle":"Why hasn't Kanye West been 'cancelled'?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/kanye-west-ye-new-album-cancelled","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/01/kanye-west-ye-new-album-cancelled","fields":{"headline":"Why hasn't Kanye West been 'cancelled'?","bodyText":"Just one month after he re-affirmed his support for Trump and said slavery “was a choice”, Kanye West has released a new album. While many are discussing the quality of the record’s seven tracks, few are debating whether West should be releasing new music in the first place. West first made his support for Donald Trump known in November 2016, 10 days after Trump won the election. He climbed atop a stage floating over San Jose’s SAP Center. Much to ticket-holders’ surprise, he spent an inordinate amount of the time between songs expressing support for the president-elect. For those shocked by the election’s outcome, West’s full-throated endorsement only compounded their frustration. Less than two months later, the rapper arrived at Trump Tower in midtown Manhattan, bleached-blonde and smiling widely for a photo op with the incoming Potus. At the end of April 2018, he doubled down on that support, tweeting the president was “his brother” and that they both had “dragon energy”. The optics of the public pairing proved too much to bear for some. West was endearing himself to so-called deplorables and the burgeoning alt-right at the expense of alienating a significant swath of his broad fanbase, not least African Americans. The noted public intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates framed West’s Trumpian ignorance as “dangerous” in a sweeping piece for the Atlantic that read like a fan’s eulogy. Many others agreed that Kanye was, to borrow a phrase from social media parlance, cancelled. The release of Ye, the artist’s first new album since cozying up to Trump and other public figures on the vocal fringes of American conservatism, serves as the first true test of his listenership’s socio-political convictions. And despite the apparent online grandstanding of a vocal handful, it seems that people are unable to resist tuning in. The arrival of new West material historically comes with great fanfare. Rogue video installations in urban centers preceded Yeezus, while a fashion-centric Madison Square Garden gathering for The Life Of Pablo left a lasting impression. The rollout of Ye followed that tradition. Influencers, industry insiders, and press were whisked away by private jets this Thursday to a scenic Wyoming listening event with the artist. Once Kanye was embedded with a who’s who of hip-hop, the hype machine was in full swing. The proceedings were livestreamed online with fans across the world discussing each second on Twitter and Reddit. Many critics of the seven-song Ye dropped their defenses upon discovering how light the record was on political content. West drops a few nods here and there to his controversial commentary, but his superficial references to the likes of Stormy Daniels are less significant than personal songs like Wouldn’t Leave. The album artwork depicts a Jackson Hole setting scrawled with a self-deprecating one-liner about being bipolar. Not unlike Trump, West opts here to talk about mental health rather than gun control, even on the confessional I Thought About Killing You. A full year since Kathy Griffin’s graphic Trump beheading photo reveal and mere days after Roseanne Barr and Samantha Bee struggled with their own waves of internet backlash, West’s shocking TMZ appearance mere weeks ago, in which he delivered a galling gaffe about slavery having been a choice, hasn’t quite led to the sort of repercussions it arguably warranted. Despite prompting some headlines and op-eds, it never led to a proper apology, even as it abutted Spotify’s failed implementation of a hateful content policy intended to penalize the alleged abusers R Kelly and XXXtentacion. Twitter essentially buried a New York lawyer the other day for intimidating hate speech, and Drake had to issue a formal statement after authentic blackface photos of himself emerged, yet West gets off with a slap on the wrist for his MAGA sins. Our capacity to hold people accountable for their statements has been compromised in the social media age of apology. Fatigue sets in quickly as factions dig in their heels to debate the case of a given day’s offender. Though the #MeToo movement’s laser focus on abusers has resulted in real world consequences for the likes of Mario Batali, Bill Cosby, and Harvey Weinstein, the anti-Trump #Resistance leaps between targets at an untenable pace. Proof of West’s popularity came with the release last week of Pusha T’s latest album, Daytona. Produced by West, it’s projected to make the Billboard 200 album charts’ top 10 based on sales and streams in the US. Whether people choose to listen to West’s work in support or in spite of his behavior, it all adds to his bank account and clout. While West could easily end up right back in the crosshairs with his next hastily tapped tweet, it’s unlikely to take him down like Roseanne’s did. Perhaps that’s because his Trump support appears superficial compared to her ceaseless crackpot conspiracy theorising. Fans have convinced themselves that West doesn’t actually espouse the same uncomfortable values as Trump’s base, but rather that he admires his fellow megalomaniac.

Visa users are experiencing widespread problems with card payments. The problems appear to mainly be with chip and pin transactions. ATM transactions are not affected, so you can still take cash out. Mastercard and American Express are not affected. Difficulties with payment do not indicate that you have been robbed or your card has been hacked. The problems appear to have begun shortly after 2.30pm on Friday. What is causing the problem? Visa says it is investigating and will update people as soon as possible. An Asda spokesman suggested the problem was with the authorisation that is supposed to be sent to a chip and pin machine when you make a transaction. “When you try and pay something, it sends a message to Visa and then Visa have to send a message back to the chip and pin machine to say this is OK and then the banks are in between at some point. The message that is coming back to the chip and pin, that is where the fault is,” he said. Where are people being affected? Across the UK and the rest of Europe – although the problems do not appear to be consistent. Many companies in the UK have reported problems, including Sainsbury’s, rail operator GWR and pub chain Wetherspoons. How long will the problem last? Visa said it was working to resolve the issue “as quickly as possible” but did not say how long that would take. Shortly before 6pm on Friday HSBC’s UK Twitter account said “there are still intermittent issues but services are slowly recovering”. What effect is the payment failure having? Many Visa users are complaining of difficulties as a result of the outage, reporting they have been stranded while travelling, are unable to pay for groceries, or are facing large queues at cash machines. But there were no early reports of panic, or evidence that the wider card payment system was under threat."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/02/grenfell-inquiry-brings-painful-memories-of-fight-for-justice-for-my-son-stephen-lawrence","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T16:59:23Z","webTitle":"Grenfell inquiry brings painful memories of the fight for justice for my son, Stephen Lawrence | Doreen Lawrence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/02/grenfell-inquiry-brings-painful-memories-of-fight-for-justice-for-my-son-stephen-lawrence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/02/grenfell-inquiry-brings-painful-memories-of-fight-for-justice-for-my-son-stephen-lawrence","fields":{"headline":"Grenfell inquiry brings painful memories of the fight for justice for my son, Stephen Lawrence","bodyText":"Many years ago, I lived in social housing in London before my family saved up to buy our first property. Those years have been on my mind as, like many others, I have listened intently to the heartbreaking stories of those who lived and died in Grenfell Tower, as the public inquiry finally has got under way. I understand acutely the pain of those speaking out about their loss. Sitting in a public inquiry day after day, talking about your own grief while the world watches, is a very difficult thing to do. I know it really took its toll on me. But these people are doing something essential – they are finally putting the names, faces, hopes and dreams to the 72 victims who, until now, have otherwise been a number. For that bravery and truth, we are all grateful. In return, I believe we owe these families a proper debate about what must change. They have harnessed their anger and used it to push for an inquiry to take place. And then they have pushed again to make it more representative of the community. It was the same for me when I was fighting for justice for my son, Stephen, after he was murdered. My anger became my motivation; it kept me driving forwards for years. But there is another striking parallel between the Grenfell inquiry and that of my son – race and class play an undeniable part. We like to think that we have moved on since Stephen was killed, and that race is no longer an issue, but of course it is. It is the elephant in the room inside the inquiry, and playing out via the Windrush scandal outside the inquiry. Many of the people in Grenfell Tower were immigrants or refugees whom the authorities thought they could ignore. In fact, even worse than ignoring them, it felt to me that because of their race and background these tenants were met with an attitude from authorities of “you should be grateful that you have somewhere to live at all, so stop making a fuss”. This institutional indifference meant they had no right to safety and no right to be heard. Very few people in positions of power understand what this experience is like. I doubt they have ever had to live in poor housing or know what it is like to feel invisible, like no one cares. And while the public inquiry will look just at Grenfell, I don’t believe that institutional indifference is limited to that community. It’s the same indifference that too often sees dismissive landlords protected by a system that allows them to ignore social tenants’ fears and concerns. We owe it to all those affected to have a proper debate about changing this. That’s why I’m so glad to be part of the housing charity Shelter’s Big Conversation on social housing. The commission is looking nationally at what has gone wrong and how we can fix it, right across the country. We all need to face facts. The stigma associated with being a social tenant is still very much alive and well and it’s the main reason such tenants end up being ignored. The perpetual myth is that everyone in social housing is uneducated and in low-paid jobs. But as we have heard so far in the inquiry, Grenfell was home to a diverse mix of people, from NHS staff to artists and architects. Not only is the myth not true but even if it were, it doesn’t mean that these people deserve to be ignored or less safe than others. And yet social housing and those who live in it don’t have to be treated this way. If social tenants’ concerns were listened to and their housing made safe and decent, social housing could be the foundation for the strongest of British communities, as my experience proves. It’s clear that change is needed to make social housing this strong again, but that won’t happen if we rely on the government alone. The commission I’m serving on, with the housing charity Shelter, is going to try to make sure change happens. Not only will it be an exercise in listening to these tenants, but it will take seriously their thoughts and draw up recommendations that will then be shared with our political leaders. We can’t know yet just what the commission will conclude but we know what we are trying to change. We need to get rid of indifference and replace it with the requirement to listen. Landlords must become genuinely accountable to their tenants, whatever their race and background. We need to challenge the stigma that surrounds social housing especially in our media and in our communities. We need to look again at the basic deal that those who need social housing are offered. A social home should be a home and an opportunity to get on – as I did – yet somehow we have lost sight of that. We owe this to all those who have suffered for the failures we see today. Together, I believe we can bring about change. • Baroness Lawrence is a commissioner of Shelter’s Big Conversation into social housing"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/live/2018/jun/01/visa-outage-payment-chaos-after-card-network-crashes-live-updates","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T21:53:25Z","webTitle":"Visa outage: payment chaos after card network crashes – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/jun/01/visa-outage-payment-chaos-after-card-network-crashes-live-updates","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/live/2018/jun/01/visa-outage-payment-chaos-after-card-network-crashes-live-updates","fields":{"headline":"Visa outage: payment chaos after card network crashes – as it happened","bodyText":"Visa says the widespread outage which affected customers in the UK, Europe and abroad was caused by a “hardware failure” and was not the result of unauthorised access. Cardholders can now use their Visa cards, with services now operating at “close to normal levels”. Chip and pin transactions were affected, but ATM withdrawals were not. American Express and Mastercard were running a normal service throughout. The outage is believed to have started at around 2:30pm Disgruntled customers at supermarkets, petrol stations and abroad vented their frustrations on social media when there was little information from the financial services firm. Bank transactions were also hit. Experts have advised consumers to carry backup payment options, while Which? warned consumers to be “extra wary” of calls and emails relating to the network failure. Visa said the outage was caused by a hardware failure and was not a result of “unauthorised access or malicious event”. Five hours after an initial statement, the company said its payment systems were almost back to normal. The firm apologised to its customers after it admitted it fell “well short” of its reliability targets today. Here is their latest statement: Earlier today, Visa had a system failure that impacted customers across Europe. Our goal is to ensure all Visa cards work reliably 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We fell well short of this goal today and we apologise to all of our partners, and most especially, to Visa cardholders. Visa cardholders can now use their Visa cards as we are currently operating at close to normal levels. The issue was the result of a hardware failure. We have no reason to believe this was associated with any unauthorised access or malicious event. UK Finance, a trade association which represents leading firms in the payments industry, said: Visa is currently experiencing a service disruption which is preventing some Visa transactions in Europe from being processed. It is investigating the cause and acting as quickly as possible to resolve the situation. Visa is working with banks, building societies, merchant acquirers and card providers to return to a normal service and will provide regular updates. Customers should check their bank, building society or card provider website or contact them with any queries. Which? has warned that the widespread network failure could attract scammers and advised people to be “extra wary” of calls or emails related to the outage. Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: Clearly this issue will be a huge inconvenience to customers and it must be resolved urgently. Visa and the banks need to ensure no-one is left out of pocket due to this outage. We strongly advise people to keep any evidence of extra expenses they’ve incurred in order to claim them back.” Guardian Money’s Miles Brignall has just returned from the Morrisons supermarket in Letchworth. It’s cash only signs up. Plenty of shoppers have abandoned their baskets. Others are queuing up outside the ATMs outside the building. Everyone’s pretty good natured considering. He says he was able to pay using a MasterCard and had no problems. Amex was also being taken but no Visa cards. Readers have been getting in touch with their experiences. Although the outage appears to have struck at around 2:30pm, one reader said she was unable to use her Visa debit at lunchtime. Rebecca Rapport said: My Visa debit was declined in M&amp;S in the City at about 13:15 today. The sales assistant thought it was the card machine so I used Apple Pay. Sounds like this has been happening earlier than reported. Rich Dunning, an administrator at the University of Liverpool who is currently working in the US with a colleague, had his card declined. We’re currently in the US for work and all our Visa work cards were declined, so it looks like the outage seems to be affecting cards being used outside Europe, too. Luckily I had some dollars in cash from earlier and a colleague has a MasterCard so we’re not totally stuck! Amid a lack of information at a the supermarket till, reader Fiona Hillhouse had to make various enquiries at Asda and her bank before being told about the problem. My husband and I had nipped to Asda earlier to get some shopping. My husband used his card to pay and checkout assistant declared it was declined. They tried three times, so I ran out to the car to get my card which I’d used just before to pay the hygienist. We have a joint account so I used my card - declined too. The none-to-helpful checkout assistant told us to take it up with the bank. How could both cards not be working? And how were we going to pay for our shopping? My husband used his credit card. Got home. Phoned the bank, waited half an hour to speak to someone. Account was fine it must be Asda’s machines. Phoned Asda. Was advised it was a problem with Visa. Could they not have told us that instead of making us feel mortified as if we didn’t have money in our bank account in front of a queue of customers. I’m just relieved someone hasn’t emptied our bank account! Guy Anker, the deputy editor of consumer website MoneySavingExpert.com, criticised the network failure in an age when we “rely so heavily on technology” for basic purchases. After TSB’s IT meltdown, this is yet another big banking or payment systems problem for people to have to deal with. It’s simply not good enough in this day and age when we rely so heavily on technology to conduct what are pretty basic things such as buying a drink or a meal. If you’re going out or making a payment online over the weekend, have a look at what’s in your wallet and ensure if you’ve a MasterCard or Amex you take that out or use it. And until this is fixed cash is king if you’re spending out and about, so ensure you’ve enough to get by on in case your cards don’t work. As this is about processing credit or debit card transactions it shouldn’t affect standing orders, direct debits or bank transfers. Peter Hahn, the professor of banking at the London Institute of Banking and Finance, said consumers should be prepared for the possibility of “cyber risks” at all times by having backup payment options. He told Sky News: In today’s world, with cyber risks, everyone really needs to always be carrying two means to make a payment. That almost means you should have two bank accounts. Cyber risks can happen really anywhere. Visa - we tend to think of it as a bank, but for most of us what it means is that it’s a communications network. We have a bank that we’re going to have a credit card from, stores have their banks, and Visa is really the connection between those banks. And it’s got lots of entry points that can be challenged so hopefully they’ve got the expertise to fix those systems quickly. There have been no further updates from Visa since an initial statement sent more than two hours ago. Here is what we know so far. Labour MP Angela Rayner appears to have been affected during a visit to her local garage: Business owners and shoppers out in Broomhill in west Sheffield seemed intensely relaxed about the Visa machine difficulties. “I usually just pay by cash anyway,” said Mandy Stevens, as she came out of Morrisons with her shopping. The store had problems taking card payments all afternoon, with customers going outside and waiting patiently to take money out of a cash point, before returning. Stevens, who runs the SM Hair hairdressers across the road, said the first thing she knew of the troubles had been when a client asked if her machine was working because he had read the news. Her salon’s machine was working fine on Friday. “Maybe it’s just certain types of machines or certain places that are having trouble,” she said. Most businesses on Broomhill’s high street reported having some problems taking card payments on Friday afternoon. Richard Stacey from the Record Collector record shop said it had been a quiet day anyway, so the difficulties had not damaged business. A barista at Costa Coffee said he had heard that nearby cash machines were running out of money, which could cause difficulties if the problems persisted. “We’ll see what tomorrow brings”, he said. Remo Sineone, who runs Remo’s, a cafe and deli, said he had been having particular trouble taking contactless payments on Friday afternoon. “Short term, I can’t really see it being much of a problem to be honest,” he said. Hello, I’ll be on the liveblog this evening. Do get in touch with your Visa outage stories here: isabel.togoh.casual@guardian.co.uk. One British traveller in Sicily has tweeted Visa for help because they cannot pay for train tickets to Palermo to get their flights. Twitter user Oscar Pratelli also stated that he was stranded. Broadcaster Jay Curtis tweeted that he had two Visa payments declined and was put on hold for 40 minutes, only to be told there was a Europe-wide problem. Staff in John Lewis in St Pancras station said Visa payments had been going down sporadically since about 4pm. “Sometimes it works, but a lot of transactions have been failing,” Pedro Rodriguez, a sales assistant, said. “More than 10 transactions have failed. One lady had to call her bank and was quite upset, but most people have a MasterCard as well or cash so it’s ok.” Boots staff said the problem only appeared to effect PIN-number transactions and people were still able to pay for purchases below £30. Thameslink and East Midlands Trains staff said they were not aware of people having difficulties buying tickets. Lisa Eagleton-Muir, 44, had come to London to audition for the Great British Sewing Bee, but could not buy any food at Kings Cross station for the train back to Newcastle. “I’ve only got two cards and they’re both Visa. I tried to buy my tea in M&amp;S and a cafe but they were both rejected. I don’t know what I’m going to do. It’s a long journey home with no food.” Luckily she was able to withdraw cash from the a cash machine. Paperchase in the station said it had stopped taking any card payments following repeated cancellations. “I tried all my cards and none of them work, I’m going to be really late for my train,” said Alison Merritt Smith, 31, an arts producer. “The queues are intense in M&amp;S. But the are dealing with it fantastically.” A range of companies have issued statements saying they are having problems with payments: Sainsbury’s said: This seems to be affecting different customers cards in different ways but we are not experiencing significant issues currently. Train operator GWR said its ticket booths and vending machines were not able to accept Visa cards. A spokesman said that onboard train staff were aware of the issue and it was possible for passengers to buy tickets on the train with cash. We encourage passengers to use cash to buy tickets at ticket offices or the machines before they travel. We are taking steps to make ticket buying as easy as possible for passengers at this time. Wetherspoons confirmed it was suffering from “intermittent Visa card issues” which were affecting all cards processed by chip and pin or its mobile app. The pub group is asking customers to use an alternative card provider or cash. A TfL spokesperson said: Customers using contactless payment cards should be able to carry on using our Tube, bus and rail services as normal. We are monitoring the situation in close collaboration with our payments providers. In Spain, the guardia civil sent a tweet aimed at reassuring those affected by the system failure. Beneath a picture of Johnny Depp as a shocked Captain Jack Sparrow, the force said: “Stay calm. If you can’t pay it’s not because you’ve been robbed or hacked. Visa is suffering a service crash in Europe that’s stopping payments going through in its cards. A spokesman for supermarket chain Asda said problems with payments had been happening in stores across the country sporadically since 3pm on Friday. Some payments were going through but some were not, he said. Customers are being told that cash is the best way to pay. “When you try and pay something, it sends a message to Visa and then Visa have to send a message back to the chip and pin machine to say this is OK and then the banks are in between at some point. The message that is coming back to the chip and pin, that is where the fault is. “We are advising customers that cash is the best way to buy your shopping because you can still get cash out with [a] debit card. In Scotland, some supermarkets say Visa is working sporadically and they are opening cash-only tills. Frances, a check out manager at Morrison’s in Anniesland, Glasgow, has been giving out old-style hand-held card machines and paper authentication slips to check out staff, as well as opening more cash-only tills. She says that the outage has been coming in waves, so it is hard to know whether the cards will work or not. Customers are still getting served reasonably quickly though, despite the added delay of calling up to authenticate individual cards. Not quickly enough for Shelley, who was shopping with her two nephews having run out of milk during a babysitting session. She was flustered trying to pay her bill and then add the extra value points to her loyalty card at the customer service desk. The visa outage seems to be by no means uniform, and other stores across the shopping precinct reported no problems at all this afternoon. Banks have been apologising to irate customers for ongoing payment issues. A spokesperson for Royal Bank of Scotland said: We are aware that some customers are experiencing issues using their debit cards. We apologies to customers for the inconvenience and we are working with our suppliers to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Customers are still able to access cash through the ATM network. Some payments were being processed through RBS but it was not clear how many and how many were encountering problems. Lloyds Bank said: We are aware of an industry wide issue effecting Visa payments which is under investigation. ATM and Mastercard transactions are not impacted. We are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment on the matter and directed calls to Visa. We are leaving it to Visa to explain what the issue is. There has been no update from Visa since it posted this tweet just before 5pm on Friday Visa card users are experiencing widespread problems making online payments across the UK and in Europe. Visa said some card payments were failing and itwas investigating the cause of the disruption. Many customers have used Twitter to express their frustration and concern that their card payments are being denied. “We are investigating the cause and working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation,” Visa said in a statement. It is understood that the problem to be limited to Visa card payments only. Several banks have used Twitter to tell customers that they are having some issues processing Visa payments. HSBC said they were “slowly recovering” while First Bank told customers there weren’t “any timescales for resolution at the moment”.

He may soon find out whether he was right. On Thursday his administration launched a multi-front assault on allies and renewed its threatened offensive against China. What constitutes “winning” is hard to say when the aims are so muddled and diffuse. But it may prove good for him, playing well to his base. The imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports upholds a campaign promise, as well as his inaugural pledge that “it’s going to be only America first”. All US presidents think first of the interests of Americans; they would not gain or retain the office otherwise. Yet rarely have these been construed so crudely. Most have realised that the country gains from international cooperation and a rules-based order which it did most to shape. Not so Mr Trump. But since he seems to regard his position as a performance instead of a job, outcomes are almost irrelevant. That his message has resonated so strongly reflects the profound failure of the existing economic system to deliver for ordinary Americans. Globalisation made some rich and many enjoyed cheap consumer goods. Others saw their jobs and communities disappear. Free trade comes at a cost – as the Chinese clearly agree, given some of their own practices. Yet Mr Trump’s medicine will not cure the patient, and may well cause further damage. He is a snake oil salesman, not a physician. The tariffs on Mexico and Canada are probably in part regarded as leverage in Nafta talks, although they seem more likely to derail a deal than achieve one. Like those on the EU, they may also be a warning to China: if we play this tough with our allies, expect us to be much more brutal with you. Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross arrives in Beijing on Saturday to press his counterparts to narrow the $375bn trade deficit. Beneath the economic row lies a broad and mounting antagonism across the US political class to China’s growing might and its challenge to US hegemony – fuelled by Beijing’s increasing authoritarianism at home and forcefulness in international relations. Yet it is hard to be certain what Mr Trump wants when bilateral relations have seen such abrupt reversals. A fortnight ago, the treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the trade war was “on hold”. This week, trade adviser Peter Navarro called that an “unfortunate soundbite”. These divisions within the administration (though hardliners are in the ascendant) and concerns about the effects of tariffs on domestic manufacturers and possible retaliation explain some of the shifts. But Mr Trump’s impatience also prompts rash actions, sometimes unwound later. The glory of cutting a deal with North Korea has at times seemed the priority. A watchdog group notes that Ivanka Trump won approval for Chinese trademarks days before her father reversed a decision to ban Chinese telecoms firm ZTE – which broke US sanctions on Iran and North Korea – from buying US components. Mr Trump believes that his business persona is the key to international success as well as domestic support: go in hard, see where you end up. But beating down a small supplier is one thing. Negotiating a complex world of overlapping rivalries and shared interests, from security to economics, is another. If protecting the US economy and encouraging China to play fair are his true priority, he needs a strategy and all the help he can get. Plenty in the EU and Asia share US concerns about unfair competition from China and its actions in the international realm. Alienating allies, as he has done repeatedly, can only be counterproductive. And if the US turns its back on the international system, why should anyone else abide by the rules? Canada and Mexico have already announced counter-tariffs. A more cautious EU has opened a case at the World Trade Organization, but warns that American goods could yet face the pinch. China has threatened to target products including soybeans: it takes almost a third of the US harvest, mostly from Trump-supporting states. The risks of a full-scale global trade war between the world’s three largest economies are real. Any win that Mr Trump proclaims is likely to prove illusory for his voters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/01/magnus-carlsen-return-to-form-stavanger","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T18:10:57Z","webTitle":"Chess: Magnus Carlsen returns to form with bright start in Stavanger","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/01/magnus-carlsen-return-to-form-stavanger","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/01/magnus-carlsen-return-to-form-stavanger","fields":{"headline":"Chess: Magnus Carlsen returns to form with bright start in Stavanger","bodyText":"Magnus Carlsen has got off to a flying start at Stavanger this week, as the world champion won in rounds one and three of the Altibox elite tournament while the other 13 games were all halved. Following Thursday’s rest day, Carlsen already led the field by a full point going into the three weekend rounds. He consolidated his lead with a routine two-hour, 33-move draw against Hikaru Nakamura of the US in round four. Games can be viewed free and live with grandmaster and computer commentaries at chess24.com and on the official site, starting at 3.30pm. China’s world No 4, Ding Liren, broke a hip on the rest day when the 25-year-old fell off his bike making a turn at high speed. Ding had surgery on Friday morning and his fourth-round game was postponed. A decision will be taken at the end of the day on whether he will withdraw and his three played games are cancelled. Carlsen’s opening surge has raised his Fide world rating to 2851, his highest for 18 months. His lead over his nearest rival a year ago was just 6.4 points – or one game – away from losing top spot. Now it is up to 40. Vintage Magnus is back. The Norwegian naturally likes to score on home soil, but although he won Altibox 2016 he was down the field in two of the past three years. So Carlsen looked ready for the fight, starting with the opening blitz event which decides which five players will receive an extra white in the tournament proper. Last year he used up too much energy there, so this time he coasted along with several draws. All went well until his pawn endgame with Levon Aronian in the penultimate blitz round. A white pawn pair at f3 and h3 faced a black trio at g5, h5 and g7, with both kings distant. Aronian tried g5-g4 and was rewarded by the horrific blunder h3xg4? h5-h4 and queens. Carlsen still qualified for the extra white and a first round pairing in the tournament proper against his title challenger, Fabiano Caruana. This went smoothly for the champion, whose pawn sacrifice created an enduring initiative and too many defensive problems for the American GM. Carlsen apart, the early draw epidemic at Stavanger repeats some other recent elite events. Agreed draws are forbidden, but the rule is easily bypassed via move repetition or wholesale exchanges if both sides want it. Part of the problem may be that the players are all friendly acquaintances so that there are few offboard tensions. In round two, all five games were drawn in two and a half hours, which one observer noted is less time than it takes for a Saturday afternoon county match. Long ago at another classic event, Avro 1938 in the Netherlands, it was different. Alexander Alekhine and José Raúl Capablanca were not on speaking terms, and Alekhine walked out of his Cuban rival’s 50th birthday party. The Americans Reuben Fine and Samuel Reshevsky loathed each other. The younger GMs Mikhail Botvinnik, Paul Keres, Fine and Reshevsky all thought that they were better than the three world champions Alekhine, Capablanca and Max Euwe. This mix of strong personalities led to a memorable tournament with Fine’s 5.5/6 start, an all-time classic game Botvinnik v Capablanca, and Keres finally winning on tie-break from Fine. His prize at the end from the sponsoring Avro radio company was backing for a world title challenge, but Alekhine kept him waiting for nearly an hour and then secretly met his preferred opponent Botvinnik in his room. Avro is still widely remembered where many current elite tournaments are not. In round three, Carlsen avoided the main line of the Berlin 3…Nf6 with its early queen exchange. He has played the system in the game before, and his novelty was 14 Nd2 in place of 14 Nc3 used in a postal game. Aronian immediately went wrong with 14...Bg5?

Now Donald Trump’s focus has switched to the real target for his trade war: China. Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, is in Beijing for talks aimed at reducing America’s $30bn-a month-deficit. Exports of Chinese high-tech manufactured goods are top of Ross’s list. Make no mistake: Trump’s strategy is a sign of weakness not strength. Countries that resort to protectionism normally do so for one of two reasons: to assist the development process when they are on the way up and to slow the pace of decline when they are in relative decline. In America’s case, it is certainly the latter. Hefty tariffs of 40% on imported manufactured goods helped the US to build up its industrial power in the second half of the 19th century. By 1945, the US was by far the most powerful economy in the world, and supported trade liberalisation because it needed to find overseas markets for its goods. Protectionist tendencies never really went away. They resurfaced in the 1980s, when there was a panic about the threat posed by Japan. And behind the Trumpian bombast is a deep-seated fear that America’s hegemony is threatened by China’s rapid economic transformation over the past 40 years. If the struggle between the US and China merely leads to a trade war, the world can consider itself lucky. Historically, when a rising power challenges the existing top dog it has more often than not led to bloodshed. That’s not remotely in prospect currently. In terms of the measures that count – technological sophistication, military clout and income per head of population – the US remains streets ahead. But China has been catching up fast. The first phase of its development, moving people out of the fields and into low-cost manufacturing, is over. A second phase, in which investment in higher education allows the economy to compete in sectors hitherto the preserve of the developed west, is well under way. China is not remotely interested in an international division of labour where the west does the clever stuff and it is left with the cheap end of the market. Trump’s action sums up what Rebecca and Jack Harding are talking about in their new book, The Weaponisation of Trade (London Publishing Partnership). They argue that trade is a strategic concern; it is not just a matter that governments are happy to leave to market forces, decisions made in the boardrooms of multi-national corporations and by technocrats hammering out trade liberalisation deals at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. “Trade is more than an economic concept; and trade wars are not just protectionism,” the two Hardings say. “Strategic trade is one way in which countries can build their influence and power globally, and trade can be used in part as a substitute for direct military intervention.” This marks a shift from the dominant political ethos in the decade that followed the collapse of communism, when the global economy boomed and protectionist pressures waned. Yet the notion that the world would be a better place if it were run in accordance with the free-trade beliefs of Adam Smith and David Riccardo did not survive the financial crisis of a decade ago. Even before the arrival of Trump, trade barriers were quietly going up, with 7,000 protectionist measures introduced since the financial crisis. Simultaneously, higher transport costs and security fears post 9/11 have made companies less keen on having long supply chains. There has been a tendency to localise rather than globalise production, which has chimed with a political mood that has prioritised national action over multilateral co-operation. Trump’s America First approach is just one expression of the new mood and he will be confident that his tough-guy stance will go down well in the rust belt states that helped to elect him in 2016. That looks possible, even though the idea that the size of the US trade deficit is simply due to China abusing international trade laws is nonsense. To be sure, Beijing has been able to grow its exports by keeping its currency competitive. No question, there has been theft of US intellectual property rights. But the prime reason why the US is running such a sizeable trade trade deficit is that the opening of the global economy has allowed US corporations to outsource production to where it is cheaper, which is why the rust belt has been hollowed out. Low-cost imports from China led to lower inflation, which in turn meant interest rates were lower than they otherwise would have been. American households could load up on cheap credit to buy cheap Chinese imports. The US consumed more than it produced and spent more than it saved. China has funded America’s spending habits by investing in US companies, US property and US Treasury bonds. The fear that Beijing could pull the plug on the US economy at any time by dumping its US holdings made previous administrations nervous. Trump has decided that the time for dithering is over, although his solutions seem somewhat bizarre. Tax cuts will encourage consumer spending while tariffs will raise the cost of domestic production. Higher inflation will mean a more rapid policy tightening from the Federal Reserve, which will slow the economy. A recession would would certainly bring down the trade deficit. The communities that saw their guts ripped out by de-industrialisation will welcome anything that offers hope of revival, but have been sold a lie. “They’re closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks,” Bruce Springsteen sang in My Hometown more than 30 years ago. “Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain’t coming back.” Sadly, he was right."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/01/theresa-may-attacks-donald-trump-unjustified-steel-tariffs-eu","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T17:02:13Z","webTitle":"Theresa May attacks Donald Trump's 'unjustified' steel tariffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/01/theresa-may-attacks-donald-trump-unjustified-steel-tariffs-eu","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/01/theresa-may-attacks-donald-trump-unjustified-steel-tariffs-eu","fields":{"headline":"Theresa May attacks Donald Trump's 'unjustified' steel tariffs","bodyText":"Theresa May has hit back at Donald Trump’s “unjustified” decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium producers, which has pushed the EU to the brink of a trade war with the US. In her first direct intervention, more than 24 hours after the US announced the tariffs would be imposed on the EU, Canada and Mexico, May said the US should immediately rethink its decision, warning it would have ramifications for US defence projects. “I am deeply disappointed at the unjustified decision by the US to apply tariffs to EU steel and aluminium imports,” she said. “The US, EU and UK are close allies and have always promoted values of open and fair trade across the world. “Our steel and aluminium industries are hugely important to the UK, but they also contribute to US industry including in defence projects which bolster US national security.” May said the EU and UK “should be permanently exempted from tariffs” and Britain would work with the bloc to protect and safeguard workers and industries. The EU has opened a case at the World Trade Organization after the US imposed a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium on Friday. “We are not in a trade war, but we are in a very difficult situation caused by the United States,” said Cecilia Malmström, the EU trade commissioner. “The US is playing a dangerous game here.” Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, said insufficient progress had been made in talks with the EU, Canada and Mexico, since the US had agreed a temporary reprieve from the tariffs for the three close US allies after they were unveiled by Trump two months ago. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, issued an immediate tit-for-tat response, announcing tariffs of up to 25% on US imports equivalent to C$16.6bn, the total value of Canadian steel exports last year. The tariffs will cover steel and aluminium as well as orange juice, whiskey and other food products. The EU is yet to announce its plans for retaliatory measures, although the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, has promised imminent action. Targets are likely to be classic US products such as peanut butter, whiskey and Levi’s jeans, though under WTO rules, EU retaliatory measures cannot come into force until 20 June. The tariffs are particularly damaging to the UK’s hopes of a trade liberalisation deal with the US after Brexit. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, said the tariffs were “patently absurd” and that it would be “ a great pity if we ended up in a tit-for-tat trade dispute with our closest allies”. May is expected to raise the tariffs directly with Trump when the pair meet at the G7 in Canada next week, where the issue is likely to dominate, though Downing Street has not ruled out the possibility of an earlier discussion."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/04/russia-killing-stray-dogs-world-cup-fifa","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T07:00:10Z","webTitle":"Russia is killing stray dogs.

World Cup stars must help stop the slaughter","bodyText":"With two weeks to go until the World Cup kicks off in Russia, death squads are targeting undesirables in the street. In what local authorities describe as an attempt to make Russia more media- and visitor-friendly, horrifying executions are taking place. However, the great purge is aimed not at man but at man’s best friend – they are coming for the dogs. Russia’s street dogs are perhaps more lovable than most. They have drawn admiration for their intelligence and resilience. Many of them commute into the cities each morning on the trains. They know to get on the train’s front or back carriage for the least crowded journey, and they know where to get off for the best food. When they beg for food as a pack, they move their youngest and cutest member to the front, knowing this will melt the hearts of passers-by. On busy streets, they’ve even learned to obey traffic lights and cross when it’s safe, trotting alongside pedestrians. These are the sweet, abandoned creatures who are being exterminated in the name of the beautiful game. Many are killed with poisoned food. This sneaky form of violence condemns the animals to slow and painful deaths, usually with convulsions as they choke on their own vomit before eventually collapsing. Other hunters use poisoned darts or blowguns for their killings. Lives silently snuffed out because they don’t fit the image the authorities want to present. Officials deny that euthanasia is their official policy, claiming the focus is to move dogs into shelters. But Open Cages and local campaign groups insist the slaughter is continuing. Social media in Russia has become awash with photos and videos of convulsing or dead dogs. It all feels horribly reminiscent of 2014, when stray dogs were rounded up and killed in Sochi ahead of Russia’s Winter Olympics. The private pest control company hired for the mass slaughter there referred to dogs as “biological trash”. An animal rights group described scenes of “mass poisonings and shootings”. Ahead of the World Cup, Russian parliament member Vladimir Burmatov visited a shelter in Yekaterinburg and discovered a “very painful” scene, with “malnourished dogs and conditions that you couldn’t even call satisfactory”. He said a “large quantity” of the shelter’s dogs were being unnecessarily put to sleep. There is a £1.20 budget for each killing, which suggests how compassionate the process is likely to be. After all, the shelter is run not by animal welfare experts, but a rubbish collection and disposal firm. Stray dogs are certainly a big issue in Russia. There are approximately 2m strays in the country’s 11 World Cup host cities. But killing them is surely not the answer. The most effective solution to the problem might be a long-term policy of spay and neuter. A more immediate approach for dogs currently on Russian streets would be proper investment in suitable shelters for them. God knows, the World Cup brings in enough cash to football’s governing body, Fifa, that they could chip in a few million. As well as pressing Russian authorities to immediately halt the killings, Fifa should insert an animal welfare clause into the host contract for all future tournaments, including the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, a country with its own strays. Perhaps some World Cup stars will step up to the plate, too? Lionel Messi, Mesut Ozil and Harry Kane often post photos of them posing with their dogs. In this money-spinning game, the influence of these superstars is immense. Here’s their chance to show they really love dogs. • Chas Newkey-Burden is an author and journalist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/01/brussels-change-calamity-italy-eu-austerity","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T11:32:16Z","webTitle":"If Brussels doesn’t budge, calamity beckons for Italy – and the EU | Owen Jones","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/brussels-change-calamity-italy-eu-austerity","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/brussels-change-calamity-italy-eu-austerity","fields":{"headline":"If Brussels doesn’t budge, calamity beckons for Italy – and the EU","bodyText":"A few months ago, a leading politician in Portugal’s ruling Socialist party explained to me the eurozone dilemma. Membership of the currency meant the public investment they desired was impossible. “It’s like social democracy was forbidden,” he explains. But exiting the euro could be even worse, because of the resulting economic trauma, and the political party held responsible would incur such public wrath that it would surely vanish. Italy’s new government is certainly not social democratic, or remotely left of centre. It is a stitch-up between the Five Star Movement’s (M5S) peculiar brand of centrist populism and the League’s xenophobic nationalism. It does not offer the answers to Italy’s profound ailments. The left in Italy has largely vacated the political stage: the sort of disillusioned young voters who flocked to Spain’s radical Podemos party or Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour have instead opted for M5S. But the Italian populists’ assumption of power is, in part, the consequence of the devastating economic consequences of the current incarnation of the eurozone. If the eurozone – perhaps even the European Union – is to survive, radical change is desperately needed. Backlash against the refugee crisis has played its part, too. But Italy is a nation in economic and social crisis. Both economic output and living standards have stagnated for two decades. Almost one in three young Italians are without work. Since the financial crash a decade ago, the number of Italians at risk of poverty has soared by more than 3 million. From the beginning, the currency has suited Germany because a weak euro is good for its exports. Italy’s problems cannot be blamed exclusively on the eurozone: but its strict fiscal rules have tied the nation’s hands. The ousted Democratic party was hardly leftwing either – despite its origins in the old Communist party, it is a thoroughly neoliberal outfit – but even its former prime minister Matteo Renzi called unsuccessfully for the rules to be changed to enable him to invest. In Italy, it is the young who are most disillusioned with the EU. One poll found that more than half of those under 45 would vote to leave, while 46% would opt for remain: for over 45-year-olds, 68% would plump for remain, just 26% for leave. A timebomb is ticking: a collapse of the EU, however implausible that may seem at present, would have potentially devastating consequences, which is why drastic change is necessary. The new Italian government may find itself on a collision course with eurozone rules. Germany’s Angela Merkel – who bears chief responsibility for the disaster of eurozone austerity – has said that while she will work with any government, they must abide by those rules. That is not good enough. When Greece’s Syriza suffered its punishment beating, the European council president Donald Tusk said it was “ideological or political contagion” that he feared, not “financial contagion”. Greece had to be taught a lesson, in other words, to discourage Spain, Portugal and Italy from electing their own anti-austerity challenges to the eurozone. The continuation of this approach spells disaster, not just for millions who have suffered because of austerity, but the future of the eurozone and the EU. A new Socialist government has come to power in Spain: it must now try to build a coalition of change within the EU. If the EU does not budge, then calamity beckons. • Owen Jones is a regular Guardian contributor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/01/mauricio-pochettino-real-madrid-call-listen-tottenham-manager-contract","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T10:46:14Z","webTitle":"Mauricio Pochettino ‘happy’ at Spurs but keeps Real Madrid door open","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/01/mauricio-pochettino-real-madrid-call-listen-tottenham-manager-contract","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/01/mauricio-pochettino-real-madrid-call-listen-tottenham-manager-contract","fields":{"headline":"Mauricio Pochettino ‘happy’ at Spurs but keeps Real Madrid door open","bodyText":"Mauricio Pochettino has said he will not force a move away from Tottenham but has not ruled out joining Real Madrid in the future. Pochettino is Real’s preferred candidate to replace Zinedine Zidane, despite the Spurs manager having signed a five-year contract only last week. Speaking at an event to promote to his book A Brave New World in Barcelona on Friday, Pochettino reaffirmed his commitment to Tottenham, although appeared to keep the door open to a potential switch, depending on the chairman, Daniel Levy. Pochettino said: “It would be disrespectful to Daniel for me to force a move. I’ve just renewed with Tottenham and I am happy. I live in the present – there is nothing more important than that. I enjoy what is happening and what has to be will be. The link now with Madrid is normal and I take it with all normality. I’m committed to Spurs and still have a long contract with them I just signed.” Pochettino was asked if he was “ready for a challenge like Real Madrid” to which he responded: “Right now I am ready to go to lunch. I’m looking forward to going back to London.” Asked if saying no to Real was impossible, he replied: “For you maybe. Not for me.” He added: “I’m so happy and proud with the faith Spurs and Levy have shown to me. That’s the most important thing for me.” The 46-year-old had earlier been ambiguous over his future, telling the Spanish newspaper El Confidencial: “When Real Madrid call you, you have to listen to them. Although in this case it doesn’t depend on me. I have just signed a long contract with Tottenham and I am very happy here. “I am happy at Tottenham because they let me work and we are growing together. Right now I want to focus on planning for next season and keep out of all the things that are being said. There will be lots of rumours, lots of things said, but I have no news from Real Madrid. “I’m working very comfortably at Tottenham and it’s my obligation to focus on that. I do not want, nor can I, comment on Zidane going but what he has done is undoubtedly very big: no one has won three Champions Leagues in a row recently.” Tottenham insist there is no clause in Pochettino’s contract that allows him to leave, nor a verbal agreement he can join Real."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/03/french-open-2018-day-eight-zverev-thiem-and-djokovic-in-action-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T19:26:54Z","webTitle":"French Open 2018 day eight: Djokovic and Zverev through, Wozniacki stutters – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/03/french-open-2018-day-eight-zverev-thiem-and-djokovic-in-action-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/03/french-open-2018-day-eight-zverev-thiem-and-djokovic-in-action-live","fields":{"headline":"French Open 2018 day eight: Djokovic and Zverev through, Wozniacki stutters – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for your company. Do check back in tomorrow for day nine coverage from all of the action at Roland Garros. Phillipe-Chatrier draws to a climax, with Wozniacki moaning she cannot see Kasatkina’s returns properly. The Russian agrees that it’s not ideal and the supervisor intervenes, with the PA system confirming that’s game over – for now. They will resume tomorrow at 7-6, 3-2 in Kasatkina’s favour. Whatever happens now, this will be the final set tonight. Since returning to court, we’ve seen a super rally, capped with a magical forehand by Wozniacki. Kasatkina leads 3-2 now in the fifth game of this second set, with Wozniacki walloping long at 40-30. Eventually, they go to resume, after seven or eight minutes of chit-chat. That’s time wasted too. Kasatkina and Wozniacki are at 1-1 in the second set. Will they just slink back into it or require time to get grooving? Well, they respond with a hefty rally. Kasatkina and Wozniacki convene at the umpire’s chair, questioning the light conditions. Both are arguing, and in agreement, that its too dark to carry on slogging away. It’s all about nonsensical, with Chatrier raising the decibel levels, with the court supervisor looking a little sheepish. This is all very bizarre – astonishing stuff. It’s 9pm in Paris. Will they call it off or be told, in no uncertain terms, to just get on with it? A wonderful backhand drop shot propels Kasatkina to 5-4 in the tie-break. It was looking so good but a double fault – the Russian’s fourth of the match – almost handed stuttering Wozniacki a route back in at 2-1 down in the tie-break. Wozniacki rallied to pull level before Kasatkina showed an inner steel to fight her way back in front. Then Wozniacki wobbles at the optimum moment – lashing wide after a sluggish serve – and that’s that. The world No 2 has it all to do on Chatrier – Kasatkina’s going nowhere. We are in for a tie-break in the first set between Kasatkina and Wozniacki. The latter appears to drop a F-bomb after a wild high forehand into the sky. The Russian has stood firm, with Wozniacki wobbling just as she appears to get a grip on the game. Who prevails remains to be seen. And now Kasatkina, perhaps more relaxed, is dishing it out to Wozniacki, who struggles to match the Russian’s movement. She powers her way to advantage and held her nerve to release a forehand firecracker to level the score up at 5-5 in a frenetic first set. She’s been relentless. Wozniacki is on top now. She’s 5-3 up in the first and she will serve for the set after 33 rather convoluted minutes. She looks in a rush to get this one put to bed, presumably so she can sit back, relax and watch day nine tomorrow. Kasatkina and Wozniacki continue to duel 3-3 in the first on Chatrier. In the meantime, recap Sloane Stephens’s routine straight sets win on there earlier today: And fellow American, Madison Keys, entering the realms of fun: Kasatkina is 3-1 to the good against Wozniacki. Nevertheless, the Russian looks pretty petrified out there on Chatrier, which is rapidly filling up. Almost 10,000 are witnessing Wozniacki flatter to deceive. She’s struggling to do the basics, while Kasatkina is growing into her stride, slowly shaking the nerves off as she goes. She’s played a sumptuous drop shot that left Wozniacki stumped on the baseline. ... and now a truly miserable game for the Russian. A nightmare on serve gifts Wozniacki a game to pull level at 1-1. Early days, mind. Kasatkina 1-0 Wozniacki. An aggressive early start by Wozniacki but she was a little sloppy after a smarting backhand. A wayward Wozniacki double fault says it all, really. This is the furthest Daria Kasatkina has ever got in this competition, while Wozniacki is a two-time quarter-finalist, most recently last year when she came undone against Jeļena Ostapenko ... Daria Kasatkina and Caroline Wozniacki trot out on to Phillipe-Chatrier. The stands have emptied a little but this should be no damp squib; the Russian has a better head-to-head record against Wozniacki, including that win at Indian Wells, and this could yet serve-up another classic. The unseeded Italian has upset the world No 9. He’s delighted, and a little shellshocked. Goffin was troubled by a shoulder injury but take nothing away from Marco Cecchinato, who produced a superb display. In the last eight, he faces a tie with none other than Mr Djokovic. “For me it is a dream,” Cecchinato says. “It will be a pleasure to play against Novak.” Djokovic will play the winner of Goffin/Cecchinato in the quarter-finals, with the pair still going strong on Suzanne-Lenglen. The Italian is 4-3 up in the fourth set, with two already in the bag. Can he close it out? Next up on Chatrier is the final singles match of day eight; Kasatkina v Wozniacki. Djokovic is into the last eight once more, he’s into the second week after dropping just one set at Roland Garros to date this year. This is his 200th career win on clay. Down and out, Verdasco trudges off totally dejected. “Verdasco only has himself to blame today,” emails Luke. “He won’t have an opportunity like this again, against one of the game’s greats.” After the marathon came the sprint for Djokovic. His class eventually told; his forehand too cute, his power piercing through a vulnerable and creaking Verdasco. The Spaniard, too often a nearly man at grand slams, failed to make any real in-roads and struggled to repel the Serb on serve, a serve with which he ultimately polished off the match. It was a game with unforced errors aplenty and few glimpses of quality. Nevertheless, Djokovic is through. A double break has given Djokovic a healthy cushion, paving the way for Djokovic to steamroller his way to racking up this victory. He’s now 4-1 up, and, barring a miracle, Fernando Verdasco looks to be heading out. Verdasco uses some spicy Spanish to bemoan Djokovic continually hitting the baseline, much to his frustration. He’s getting redder and redder. Djokovic is coasting here, with his serve – and Verdasco’s inconsistencies – holding fort for him. Djokovic leads 6-3, 6-4, 3-1 ... Djokovic is 2-0 up and bumbling his way through the third set and, also in the third, Marco Cecchinato has thrashed David Goffin 6-0. The Belgian is struggling with a shoulder injury. After that, only Caroline Wozniacki is still to come – she faces Daria Kasatskina later this evening. And that’s that, in readiness of the big one tomorrow afternoon; Williams v Sharapova: Thunder and lightning are expected to light up Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, and that’s only the weather forecast. After the deluge of words that accompanied the most anticipated collision of this French Open there is a gathering conviction here that Maria Sharapova will emerge from her fourth-round match on Monday celebrating her first win over Serena Williams in 19 matches, leavened only by the obligatory nod of consolation. The best double-act of 2018? Hamburg’s Alexander Zverev and Yorkshire’s Jonathan Pinfield: The Phillipe-Chatrier court is being watered, no doubt with Djokovic’s words of complaint still ringing in their ears. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Marco Cecchinato is storming towards taking the third set. He’s 4-0 up there. Djokovic storms to clinch the all-important game and set. Five times Verdasco has rallied from two sets down to win, can he do it again? In the crowd, a small mob of Spanish supporters sing Rafa Nadal a happy birthday. He’s 32 today. Verdasco has the trainer on, with a sole full of blisters in need of attention. That looks pretty uncomfortable. He needs a layer of Vaseline and a bit of TLC. As for Djokovic, plenty of time to ponder how he’s going to put the finishing touches to this second set. He leads 5-4, with the Spaniard edging his way back into it until this medical timeout. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, the third set is getting under way after David Goffin cancelled out Marco Cecchinato scooping the first. It’s 5-7, 6-4, 0-1 ... Djokovic 6-3, 5-3 Verdasco. He races through to 40-0 with some trademark, thudding serves. Eight points in a row help him to within a game of two sets. And, frankly, his play has been pretty stodgy – by his standards at least. It’s neck and neck, with Djokovic poking his head in front to 4-3. It’s not spectacular, though. Elsewhere, the Williams sisters have come unstuck. They won’t be adding to their 14 grand slam women’s doubles titles Venus and Serena Williams after slipping to defeat to third seeds Klepac/Sanchez. “Allez Djoko!” comes the cry from one local. He’s not having a blast out there, despite taking the first set and leading the second. He’s just been pegged back a little by Verdasco, with the Spaniard putting a spring in his step after prospering in another scrappy game. Djokovic 3-2 Verdasco. Djokovic is having a moan about the clay surface on Chatrier, just a few seconds after breaking Verdasco’s serve to go 1-0 in the second. He urges the umpire and court staff to “use some common sense”. He’s not a happy bunny and asks if only they will act if somebody breaks their ankle out there. Djokovic is adamant it’s too slippery and slithery on court. It’s been a bit of a slog but that’s part one done. The Serb seals it with a dastardly approach to the net that flummoxes Verdasco. That first set was 55 minutes, 60 seconds longer than it took for Stephens to beat Kontaveit in straight sets ... Djokovic ekes out a couple more games to find himself at 4-2 in the first. His crashing serve has been crucial in helping him to this point because he’s struggled to find his groove. He’ll be happy nevertheless. Elsewhere, Marco Cecchinato, who has never gone beyond the fourth round in Paris, has just taken the first set against David Goffin 7-5. Super tennis by the Italian. Another marathon game climaxes with a mini-battle at deuce. The word égalité will be ringing in the ears of Djokovic and Verdasco tonight, after this erratic start between the pair of them. After more than 11 minutes, Djokovic makes it 2-1 after half-an-hour of painful play. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Cecchinato is 3-2 to the good in the first against Goffin. Down on court 1, the Williams sisters trail Klepac and Sanchez 4-6, 3-4 in the doubles third round. Maybe Serena’s just saving herself for the big one tomorrow, circa 3pm on Chatrier. Verdasco holds after a 22-point game. 1-1. This could be the longest day. Djokovic making unenforced errors is not a good sign for him or his racquets. Another lengthy game. Djokovic gets three break points on Verdasco’s first service game, but is pulled back to deuce each time. He then goes for a winner but misses his target. Verdasco is similarly wasteful when he has a chance to win the game. Deuce after deuce after deuce. On Suzanne-Lenglen, David Goffin and Marco Cecchinato are getting under way. The Italian won the first game. Will Djokovic smash his racquet this time? He really wasn’t very happy during his game with Bautista-Agut. Djokovic wins the first game and holds serve but it took a while. That was a battle of wits, just as the whole match is expected to be. Djokovic is employing a skidding serve to his left-hander opponent, and getting some real purchase on it. Verdasco hits long three times in succession to take it to game point, but then foxes Djokovic with a thrashing drive. After that he middles a failed Djok sdrop shot to take it to deuce. Djokovic will serve first after a jaunty, friendly knock-up between him and Verdasco. Djokovic and Verdasco take to the court in the baking hot sunshine to very warm applause from the home crowd. Verdasco, the Spanish veteran, is a slippery customer. Putintseva is in her second successive quarter-final at Roland Garros. She puts her success down to playing in Paris, the “beautiful city”. As we wait for Djok to rock, an update from Suzanne-Lenglen where 26th seed Barbora Strycova has exited at the hands of Yulia Putintseva. A scream of joy as she celebrates, too. She enjoyed that. Strycova was under par but beaten by an inspired opponent. Next up on Chatrier? Djokovic v Verdasco. My esteemed colleague John Brewin will guide you through the beginnings of that one. The American records a straight sets win over the No 25 seed inside 53 minutes. That was as easy as it gets. Stephens racked up 11 games in a row to finish in style. Kontaveit had been playing well coming into this but that was pretty chastening. It’s a similar state of affairs over on Suzanne-Lenglen, where Putintseva is putting Strýcová to the sword. She’s 4-2 up in the second. “I was really pleased to get out there and play some good tennis,” Stephens says, before dipping into some GCSE French. Stephens is eating up the ground on Chatrier, she’s making it look like a real doddle out there. Kontaveit’s decision-making has left a little to be desired at times but she’s more than capable of the spectacular. But after a fourth double fault puts the game on a plate for Stephens, the Estonian goes long at the end of a healthy rally. Stephens leads 2-6, 0-3, having gobbled up eight games in a row. Over on Suzanne-Lenglen, Putintseva is 3-1 up in the second after taking the first 6-4. That was all very routine for the US Open champion. The Kazakh has made a barnstorming start against the No 26. Meanwhile, Stephens has just broken Kontaveit; she’s looking good at 5-2 up in the first. She has not really had to get out of first gear to get this point, on the verge of the first set. David Goffin, the No 8 seed, meets Marco Cecchinato on court once Putintseva/ Strýcová are done and dusted. The France footballer Kylian Mbappé, born to the northeast of Paris, is among the spectators at a roasting Chatrier, where it’s around 26C. None other than Mike Tyson is taking in Stephens’ duel with Kontaveit too – how the latter could do with finding some fight. On Suzanne-Lenglen, Barbora Strýcová trails the unseeded Yulia Putintseva, of Kazakhstan, 4-2 in the first set. Putintseva knocked out Johanna Konta in the round of 128 en route to here and the 23-year-old is making another fine impression this afternoon. Both Stephens and Kontaveit were in action yesterday, the former recording a marathon 8-6 third-set win. As for Kontaveit, she ousted Petra Kvitová, the No 8 seed, in straight sets – both tie-breaks. In the early stages on Chatrier here, they’re level-pegging at 1-1, with Stephens sending an angling, effortless forehand straight down the line. Lovely stuff. What’s coming up? Sloane Stephens, the US open champion and No 10 seed, will duel with Anett Kontaveit, of Estonia, on Chatrier. After that, Djokovic will take on Verdasco. If that doesn’t get the pulse racing, then we’ll be dipping in and out of Strycova v Putintseva. If Mahut and Herbert can seal a straight sets win on court 1 in the men’s doubles, then the Williams sisters will take centre stage there against Klepac/Sanchez. Dominic Thiem is in good spirits. “I love the clay here,” he says. “It was my first time on Phillipe-Chatrier not playing against Rafa so I could enjoy the court a little bit more. The first two sets but he raised his level after that. It was a 50-50 match then, but my advantage was I had already two sets.” The No 7 seed gets the job done in two-and-a-half hours. The adrenaline got to him at 40-30, with an overzealous easy forehand. But he hits back to establish advantage and clinches victory second time round, when Nishikori – who again struggled with that niggling wrist injury of his – strikes his return wildly long. The Austrian is into the quarter-finals – where he’ll play Alexander Zverev. For a while, it was a cakewalk but Thiem was made to work to get through in the end, in an ultimately nervy finish. Over on Chatrier, Thiem has poked his nose in front of Nishikori in the fourth set. He leads 4-3, with two sets already in the bag. Presumably Zverev might pop over to take a look, because he will meet the winner in the last eight. The way he’s talking though, Zverev won’t fear anyone. Sascha speaks: “I’m young, so I might as well stay on court and practice a little bit ... It’s the best, a five-set match. I’ve been down 2-1 every single time but I’m unbelievably happy to be into the quarter-finals. The draw doesn’t get any easier and I have to see how it goes in the next few days.” Alexander Zverev, for the third straight match, wins in five sets. They embrace at the net but its the 21-year-old German who reaches his first grand slam quarter-final. He’s into the last eight in Paris. Zverev leads Khachanov 5-3 in the fifth set. He makes it 10 points in a row on serve before Khachanov, at last, manages to breakthrough. But once he pulls level at 15-15, he’s unable to repel the No 2 from the tennis equivalent of opening up his legs and sprinting hard. The German is one game away one from clinching victory ... A roaring “Come on!” from Khachanov, only seconds after he’s a little guilty of overplaying, screwing up a high forehand volley with the court gaping. But, he’s off the hook and edges to 3-4 in the fifth set. Away from Suzanne-Lenglen, Nishikori has nudged himself in front in the fourth against Thiem on Chatrier. A thirsty Khachanov moves to within touching distance of Zverev once more, pummeling an ace beyond the German to get to 2-3. Without going all dramatic on you, this one’s surely going to go down to the wire. Nishikori and Thiem, meanwhile, are level-pegging at 1-1 in the fourth. After shipping the last four, Khachanov wins his first game of this fifth and final set, in which Zverev’s 2-1 up. Whoever prospers here, you have to feel they are capable of doing some damage in the tail end of this tournament. On Chatrier, Nishikori has just won the third set 7-5 after almost two hours, that’s after losing the first two. Zverev looks to the heavens after toasting another supersonic rally, with a slamming backhand down the line. That tees him up at advantage, at which point he prospers. He’s back in front at 1-0 in the fifth and he’s straight back around the other side of Suzanne-Lenglen for more. For giant athletes, both at 6ft6in, they are shifting around court like gazelles. We are in for a stunning finale ... This is a corking match – with only a Zverev medical time out delaying the fifth set on Suzanne-Lenglen. He’s getting a bit of work done his left foot, a troublesome toe it seems (we’ve all been there). Elsewhere, Nishikori is having a good go at fighting back at Thiem. He’s 5-4 up in the third. A third five-setter in a row for the German. He has a knack for doing things the hard way and, on that evidence, he seems to have more left in the tank. Khachanov was a little sloppy doing the basics and he’s been punished. He’ll need to dig deep – and dip into the energy reserves – to edge himself back in front here. Zverev’s huffing and puffing, cursing and yelling. Yet a coaching warning revs him up to prosper at deuce and to a third straight game over Khachanov. The German punches the air in delight, with a nod to Alexander Zverev Sr to boot. It looks as though we are heading for another helter-skelter five-setter. He’s another game away from taking us there ... Over on Phillipe-Chatrier, Dominic Thiem is ripping his way through his meeting with Kei Nishikori. He won the first 6-2, the second was a 6-0 whitewash and though he trails in the third, he’s now back on serve. The Austrian was semi-finalist in Paris in 2017 and 2016. ... but Zverev ups the ante to keep his nose in front in the fourth set. A flurry of hard-hitting serves and then a cute volley at the net plunge Khachanov into trouble and the 21-year-old German comes out the other end of a challenging game. He trails 2-1 but leads 2-3 in a seesawing fourth set. Who will win it? Karen Khachanov has just pulled level at 2-2 in the fourth set. The Russian’s body language is very low-key, while Zverev is looking agitated. Zverev’s serving is beginning to look a little wobbly and Khachanov can take advantage here at 40-15 to break and go 3-2 ... A reminder that Madison Keys breezed through to her first quarter-final at Roland Garros a little earlier. She sealed a straight sets win over Romania’s Mihaela Buzarnescu with an ace on her third match point. “Hopefully big things can happen here,” Keys said. She will pit her wits against the winner of Barbora Strycova or Yulia Putintseva – who meet on Suzanne-Lenglen after Khachanov/Zverev – in the last eight. Caroline Wozniacki, the No 2 seed and US Open champion Sloane Stephens are also vying for a spot in the last eight, against Kasatkina and Kontaveit respectively. He races to 40-0 and wraps up the third in a little over half an hour. The wheels have seemingly come off for Zverev, who has it all to do again. So, we’re 6-4, 6-7, 6-2 ... who will come out on top? Another player who is up against it at the moment is Kei Nishikori, who trails Dominic Thiem 3-0 in the second after a demolition job in the first. A double break for Khachanov over Zverev, whose clean and crisp backhand down the line is the only thing troubling the Russian at present. Khachanov leads 5-1 in the third ... Things are looking dandy for the No 7 seed on Chatrier. Khachanov has just broken Zverev again. He’s 2-1 up on Suzanne-Lenglen in the third. The German could do with sticking around at Roland Garros – given they’ve just closed Hamburg airport owing to a power failure. Force has not been a problem for Zverev here, though – just erratic. Elsewhere, Dominic Thiem is out on court and in the groove against Kei Nishikori on Phillipe-Chatrier. He’s 4-2 up in the first. Khachanov has just cancelled out Zverev taking the first game of the third set. Zverev needed that last set, given he’s never come from two sets down to win. As for later, the Williams sisters are in doubles action, while Novak Djokovic will take centre stage against Verdasco. A drawn out puff of the cheeks at the end of a marathon tie-break says it all. He gets through 7-4 in the end, after an impressive show of stamina. His movement, particularly impressive for a 6ft6in athlete outwits Khachanov and his power is ultimately too hot for the Russian to handle. A walloping 200km/h ace helps him up to 4-2 before setting the seal – Zverev is a real animal on court. That fascinating set has whipped up the crowd on Suzanne-Lenglen. Khachanov and Zverev go to a tie-break. We’ve just had a preposterous rally, with the German’s ridiculous forehand almost finding its way in. They’re level-pegging at 6-6 (1-1) ... Another game, another clenched Khachanov fist. He’s won three games on the trot to move to within touching distance of taking the second set. He’s at 6-5 but 0-30. To do so, he’ll have to break Zverev. Khachanov breaks Zverev to move to 5-5 in the second. After eight long minutes, in which Zverev squandered three set-points, Khachanov toils with the 21-year-old, hitting a rasping forehand to tee up another knockout blow. Zverev’s decision-making has been questionable – he’s allowed Khachanov to stay in games he should have wrapped up – but kudos to the Russian, who has kept a cool head amid the chaos. Zverev’s tail is up again; he’s ploughing through the second set. He’s won 12 points in a row, out of nowhere really. He’s 3-5 in the second after falling to Khachanov in the first. The Russian is serving ... The American hit a brick wall halfway through the second but she’s through to the last eight – her first quarter-final at Roland Garros – after dispatching the Romanian in 64 minutes. Zverev has been effing and blinding out on court; het up at his performance so far. A sloppy backhand gifts Khachanov a way back in and then a sticky drop shot helps the Russian to deuce. His shot selection seems a little erratic and Khachanov prospers, with Zverev failing to seize two break points. He’s 3-2 up in the second. Madison Keys, the 13th seed, is cruising through to the last eight at Roland Garros. She’s 6-1, 5-1 up against Mihaela Buzărnescu on Phillipe-Chatrier. The US Open finalist ought to have that one done and dusted inside around an hour. Light work. Straight to Suzanne-Lenglen, where Alexander Zverev eventually came unstuck in the first against Khachanov. He had already survived two set points at 5-4 down to limp to deuce but eventually a sloppy forehand plays into the Russian’s hands and Zverev has work to do if he’s to prosper. Another stonking day of tennis is already under way in Paris, where a couple of heavyweights are in action; grand slam-loving Novak Djokovic and Yorkshire-loving Alexander Zverev, no longer the new kid on the block. Zverev is already out on court against Karen Khachanov on Suzanne-Lenglen, while Madison Keys is a set up against Mihaela Buzărnescu. Yesterday’s action was jolly good fun; Serena Williams made light work of Julia Görges, not long after Rafa Nadal did likewise with Richard Gasquet. Here’s Kevin Mitchell’s verdict on day seven: Court Philippe Chatrier Madison Keys (13) v Mihaela Buzarnescu (31) Dominic Thiem (7) v Kei Nishikori (19) Anett Kontaveit (25) v Sloane Stephens (10) Novak Djokovic (20) v Fernando Verdasco (30) Court Suzanne Lenglen Karen Khachanov v Alexander Zverev (2) Barbora Strycova (26) v Yulia Putinsteva David Goffin (8) v Marco Cecchinato Daria Kasatkina (14) v Caroline Wozniacki (2)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/02/its-the-sids-2018-the-complete-review-of-the-2017-18-la-liga-season","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T12:00:17Z","webTitle":"It's the Sids 2018!

The complete review of the 2017-18 La Liga season","bodyText":"All that and in the end it came down to this … nothing. There were tears and plenty of emotion, Fernando Torres serenaded off and Andrés Iniesta sitting alone on the Camp Nou turf long into the night, lights out for the last time, but for the first time in history there was no dramatic ending and nothing to play for on the final day of the Spanish season. Not the title, not Europe, not relegation, not the Pichichi, not the Zamora either – and not even a first-ever unbeaten league campaign. Barcelona had lost that record seven days earlier, finally defeated 37 games in, without Leo Messi. Still, they did win a friendly in South Africa three days later, so that’s okay. They also won the league of course, which they were always going to. Only, they weren’t – not really. This was the season in which not much changed and no one really moved, in which the top four were in place from week seven and in which only Real Betis’s late surge broke up fifth and sixth – where Sevilla and Villarreal had sat for over twenty weeks. “It’s not possible,” Vincenzo Montella said when he was asked if Betis might finish above Sevilla, but it happened. Sevilla did reach the quarter-final of the European Cup for the first time in 60 years, winning at Old Trafford, and made it to the Copa del Rey final. At the bottom, only Alavés pulled out of the relegation zone, sacking Luis Zubeldía and his unfeasibly tight trousers, bringing in Abelardo Fernández and beginning an incredible run towards salvation – and they did that relatively early. Levante, the one team in danger of being dragged into it, instead pulled away, finishing 17 points clear of Las Palmas, Deportivo and Málaga – teams that had resided in the bottom three for 22 weeks. Las Palmas sacked Manolo Márquez, turning the page to find Pako, Paquito and Paco but they never got beyond P, or the relegation zone. Up at Deportivo, they had five goalkeepers and not much hope. As for Málaga, well, they had Sheik Al-Thani. That doesn’t mean the season lacked drama, and it doesn’t mean that the outcome was inevitable. By the end, Barcelona were 17 points clear of Madrid, 14 ahead of Atlético, and they had been clear from the beginning. “It starts in August, you go through the autumn, the harsh winter, and now it’s spring, and we got here with a certain cushion,” the manager Ernesto Valverde said. Valencia, resuscitated by Marcelino García Toral, had been the first to challenge them and then came Atlético, closing in as spring came. Ultimately neither could stop a team that didn’t lose until it was done, Atlético’s challenge effectively undone with another Messi free kick in March. As for Real Madrid, they fell behind early and never recovered. Barcelona were four points ahead of them after just three weeks, seven points ahead by week five, and by week 12 the lead was 10. By the time the second clásico came, Barcelona were already champions. “It looks simple,” Valverde said, but it may have been their most unexpected title in a decade. He arrived at a club in trouble, and politics added to its problems. He later admitted: “in August the atmosphere wasn’t the best.” Somehow, he postponed the crisis for an entire season. So Barcelona won the league and Cup double but Gareth Bale scored that goal and Madrid made history, winning a third Champions League in a row, a fourth in five years. As Madrid manager, the now-departed Zinedine Zidane won the European Cup with every attempt. During celebrations at Cibeles, Theo Hernández noted: “We’ve just been past Neptune [where Atlético celebrate titles] and there was nobody there.” Perhaps he should have gone 10 days before, when there were thousands of fans – including his brother – celebrating winning the Europa League at the end of their first season at their new home 20km from the Calderón – a season in which they finished ahead of Madrid. Still, what would he care? He was celebrating the biggest prize of all. Or was it? As Madrid got closer to another European Cup, so the debate started: which title mattered most? The answer is simple: these ones, of course … Most disciplined club At the end of the Seville derby , Betis captain Joaquín warned: “Anyone who gets home before five in the morning gets fined.” Everyone did exactly as they were told. Most careful club Barcelona. “If we appeared with two players for €270m, we’d have to resign for irresponsibility,” director Albert Soler said. It’s lucky Ousmane Dembélé and Philippe Coutinho cost €300m, then. Best prediction Another award for Barcelona, whose director Jordi Mestre was “200% sure” that Neymar was staying. Best reporter Gerard Piqué, the man who (not entirely unreasonably) decided that he can do journalism better that all those journalists, with his first big exclusive: “He stays,” Piqué wrote. He didn’t. Coldest club Sevilla, who sacked Eduardo Berizzo a few days before Christmas, after he had returned from prostate cancer surgery. Most surreal sight Camp Nou: 98,000 seats, 98 people in them. Best sales pitch For the first time in history, two Japanese players were on opposing teams in La Liga as Eibar played Getafe. The league decided that this was the chance they needed to get a little love from the land of the rising sun. At each end there was a huge Japan flag with “Hello Japan” written across it, while the same message was flashed up on the advertising boards. Before the game there was an honorary kick-off involving Eibar’s Inui and Getafe’s Gaku and the match was shifted to prime time in Tokyo. Most cunning plan Iago Aspas, unimpressed with referee Munuera Montero again, had a brilliant idea. “Next time we’ll play in our third kit so that he doesn’t know it’s Celta,” he said. Best protest One night an unhappy fan spray-painted his feelings all over the wall of Lucas Pérez’s house. There was just one flaw: the next day a note had been taped over the graffiti accusing the Deportivo striker of being a “money-grabber” and telling him to “go now!”, which read: “Lucas doesn’t live here any more, dickhead.” Best put down Before the Galician derby, after Luisinho claimed that Dépor were the “big team” in the region and that Celta were nothing. “It’s true that Deportivo were big once,” Aspas responded. “But they’re not any more. If they were, Luisinho wouldn’t be playing for them.” Best signing Nine Saudi players were signed and handed out to managers that didn’t know who they were – they played 13 minutes between them. Best dad Mr Maffeo, father of Girona man-marker Pablo, asked what he made of his son following Messi round everywhere, replied: “And what makes you think it wasn’t Messi following him?” Best partnership This sadly short-lived pairing. Most creative player Luka Modric. Most dangerous player Ruben Semedo. Signed by Villarreal, he racked up as many arrests as starts in Spain. He was accused of pulling out a pistol at a brothel and later sent to jail without bail on suspicion of attempted murder, kidnap, armed robbery and assault. Most melodramatic player Deportivo defender Juanfran, tears in his eyes, describing the “worst day of my life”, a day that’s “fucked up for me, my wife, my daughter, and my parents”. A terrible day in which he got a red card. Oh, the pain! Most realistic player “After two years I said I would jump off a bridge for Luis Enrique; I’d jump off a ladder for Valverde, it’s still very early.” Ivan Rakitic, not getting carried away just yet. Dirtiest player Sergio Ramos, of course – the man who, as Zidane put it, “crapped himself a bit” at Eibar. Best touch This. It’s just a pity Clarence Seedorf is a manager now, and not a midfielder. Best shot During Athletic Bilbao’s 1-1 draw at Espanyol, goalkeeper Iago Herrerín hit the Spider Cam. Sadly, it was fine. Best goal Nolito’s against Eibar was tasty, so was the touch on this from Aritz Aduriz, and this was as delicate as it was deadly from José Campaña – the goal that saw Levante survive and effectively sent Las Palmas down. Team-mate Chema Rodríguez scored this absurd volley while Morales did this at San Mamés. Over at the Coliseum, the ball was flying in from everywhere: here’s Gaku, Damián Suárez, and Iñaki Williams. “I’ve told him, if anyone asks, say you meant it,” Athletic keeper Herrerín laughed but Williams admitted that his cross-shot was “a bit of both.” Then there are those overhead-kicks of course: first Ronaldo and then Bale. But this season’s best goal came from the second division, an unstoppable 65-metre shot hit first time that flew right into the corner, from Lugo’s Juan Carlos. Lugo’s goalkeeper Juan Carlos. Best goal celebration Valencia’s Rodrigo Moreno and his orange wig. Best game Three 2-2s, three 3-2s, two 5-3s, a 6-3, a 4-0, two 5-0s, a 4-4 and a 1-0 win at the Bernabéu. If there was one rule to follow this season it was: always watch Betis. The best might just have been their 6-3 defeat to Valencia, a match that had nine different goal scorers and might have had 10 but for a penalty save from Neto. Yes, it was all about Betis. But then, suddenly, it was about Barcelona, just when it seemed to be all over. “We couldn’t believe it; we were a bit stunned,” Levante’s José Luis Morales said after his team defeated the team that had not lost all season. 5-1 down, Barcelona made it 5-2, then 5-3, and then 5-4. There were 20 twenty minutes left, but it wasn’t to be. Nine times they had come from behind this season; the 10th was beyond them. On the penultimate weekend of the season, they were Invictus no more. Best manager “This is the worst team I have ever coached.” Somehow, motivational genius Paco Jémez, with his fat pink ties and testicular talk, never managed to get the best from his players, so best to go elsewhere for this award. Seville, say? “I’ve looked at the players’ eyes and at their bollocks, which are red and white,” Joaquín Caparrós said, which kind of suggests that Sevilla’s squad might have been better off seeing a doctor than a new manager. Zinedine Zidane won the Champions League again – making him the club’s most successful European manager ever– and Ernesto Valverde took Barcelona to the double, giving them a collective mission albeit one led by Messi. Asked what he did, he replied: “Tried not to get in the way”, which was typical of him but not entirely accurate. Marcelino brought Valencia back, a welcome return for a genuinely huge club. The winner though is Quique Setien, the man who said his Betis team had done in one year what they hoped to do in three and who just makes football fun. Player of the year “If we took the Barcelona shirt off Messi and put him in an Atlético shirt, we might have won,” Diego Simeone said, pretty much speaking for everyone. “It is clearly visible just how decisive Messi is in this competition,” Atletico’s coach added. Among the many moments this season there was one against Betis when he did something so silly, even for him, that you could hear the intake of breath all around the stadium, then a roar, then baffled applause. Afterwards, Joaquín stood analysing the match. “When you’re up against Messi, who ... well, there’s nothing you can say about him any more.” Betis goalkeeper Antonio Adan put it more neatly: “he makes this sport better.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/05/rachel-de-souza-vomit-school-controversy-ofsted","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T06:15:37Z","webTitle":"Rachel de Souza: on Ofsted rumours and backing for ‘vomit school’ head","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/05/rachel-de-souza-vomit-school-controversy-ofsted","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/05/rachel-de-souza-vomit-school-controversy-ofsted","fields":{"headline":"Rachel de Souza: on Ofsted rumours and backing for ‘vomit school’ head","bodyText":"The newspapers couldn’t believe their luck. Last autumn, Barry Smith, headteacher of the new Great Yarmouth Charter Academy, issued policies on behaviour to parents and children. The predecessor school, he wrote, was riddled with indiscipline, bullying and truancy. He would not allow such things. Mobile phones, if seen or heard, would be confiscated for weeks. Pupils must “only ever look at your teacher or where your teacher has directed you to look”. Smith specified “unacceptable” boys’ haircuts including “variations on the style often known as ‘Meet me at McDonald’s’”, a tousled mop with short sides. Most remarkably, he told children not to feign illness to avoid work. “If you feel sick we will give you a bucket. If you vomit – no problem! … that’s probably all your body wanted.” After press headlines and angry parents’ protests, Smith modified his “behaviour guide”, parts of which were “tongue in cheek”, with the sick buckets being just “a colourful turn of phrase”. For Dame Rachel de Souza, founder and chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, the chain that runs the academy, the storm was just a routine day’s work. For a small (14 schools) chain, founded in 2013, the trust attracts disproportionate publicity. Some of it is positive. Though several schools required improvement or were in special measures before they joined, the Department for Education puts Inspiration second only to a chain that includes two grammar schools in a league table of multi-academy trusts’ Progress 8 scores. A study by the Education Policy Institute rates its key stage 4 results ahead of every other secondary provider in England, including local authorities. Michael Gove, the former education secretary, was so impressed with De Souza, a steelworker’s daughter from Scunthorpe, that he said he would like to clone her “23,000 times”. Yet she or her schools are always in trouble. Allegations emerged in 2014 and 2015 that two of the trust’s schools, and a third where De Souza was headteacher from 2010 to 2013, had several days’ advance warning of Ofsted inspections which were supposed to take place at half-a-day’s notice. Though two inquiries declared the allegations unsubstantiated, the second found some of her emails “troubling”. Earlier this year, Ofsted apparently agreed to a second inspectors’ visit to an Inspiration primary school – which is in the country’s bottom 10% for key stage 2 reading and maths – after a first visit led to a highly critical draft report. A kinder amended report duly followed, strengthening the critics’ view that, with the trust’s former chairman, Theodore Agnew, now an education minister (and, controversially, still a trustee), De Souza gets special treatment. The National Education Union claimed the school was “given a rehearsal before the real deal”. De Souza points out that it’s normal for schools to be shown draft Ofsted reports and for inspectors to make second visits after representations. Ministers, in any case, have no power to influence school inspections. So why does she attract so much controversy? “Probably because I think change is necessary and do things wholeheartedly,” she ventures. But several hostile stories, I observe, are based on leaked emails, which suggests she makes enemies among her colleagues. “There were a number of difficult relationships. Perhaps some people’s noses were put out of joint.” De Souza talks at 100mph; sentences begin but never finish, as she interrupts herself with new thoughts and anecdotes. “I’m jumping all over the place,” she says. She taught at comprehensives in Oxford, east London and Luton before, at 36, landing her first academy headship, also in Luton. The school, replacing two local authority schools deemed to be “underperforming”, was so difficult that she told her senior team it would probably continue to fail and, at the end of the year, “we could all walk away and get on with our lives”. But for that one year, they should give it everything. “We went totally over the top on every little thing. We would tell them to do their revision and then have a banana. Revise, eat a banana, revise, eat a banana. Year 11 had never had a qualified maths teacher. So I found one and put them all in the hall with him and a stereo mic for two hours each night.” She ordered new uniforms, sent teachers to get children out of bed in the mornings, and introduced assemblies with classical music. Exam results soared. After four years, she moved to a Norfolk school that was controlled by an academy chain based in Birmingham. “It was as if I was working for a local authority in Birmingham. They top-sliced 5% for services, money I never saw. I really didn’t like it.” She thought of returning to London but the chair of her governing body introduced her to Agnew, who sponsored a small academy in the county. “We agreed that we should create a local trust so that Norfolk could provide its own answers for Norfolk children.” Wasn’t that the local authority’s job? “It was a bit lacklustre. It had only a small number of failing schools but a massive number requiring improvement.” Inspiration Trust was born. All of its schools are in Norfolk except for one in Lowestoft, which is just inside Suffolk. “The DfE asked me to go and look at it. It was awful: the corridors were long and smelled of cats’ pee. I told my board [of trustees] ‘I have to do it’. When I see a failing school, I cannot walk away.” She describes the trust as “a family” with “a feeling of community”, exemplified by an annual “great day” in early September “where we get all the staff together”. Inspiration Trust, like several other academy chains, has a central team of “brilliant subject specialists” hammering out rigorous curriculum content. If a local authority were doing it, it would be described as dictatorial, particularly since there is a heavy emphasis on “core knowledge”, the latest curriculum fashion, which De Souza embraced after visiting ED Hirsch, its guru, in the US. But de Souza insists that the team works closely with teachers and that “we see ourselves as a scholarly community generating new knowledge”. Born in 1968, she had a “wonderful, colourful, interesting childhood”. Her father was Irish, her mother, half-Austrian, half-Hungarian. A Ukrainian step-grandfather encouraged her to learn the language at a Saturday school. At her Catholic school, she was a “very good” student up to 14 but became “quite sociable and not that interested in studying” until the second year at sixth form college. Her religious studies teacher had a degree from London University’s tiny Heythrop College, and De Souza decided to follow him. She met her future husband, now in the probation service, on her first day. “I thought: yes, that’s it.” With a degree in theology and philosophy, “I was advised to shake off my northern help-the-world thing and go and make some money.” She became a trainee accountant. “I thought it was the end of life.” After two weeks, she left to take a teaching certificate at King ’s College, London. Her career – five jobs in the past 15 years – suggests a certain restlessness. There were rumours in 2016 that she would succeed Michael Wilshaw as chief inspector. She laughs and denies that she applied. So what about the “vomit school”? More laughter. “What Barry’s done there is unbelievable,” she tells me. “It’s one of the best examples of sorting out behaviour I’ve ever seen. The guy is super-talented.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/03/gvc-agm-investor-shareholder-vote-revolt-executive-pay","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:59:39Z","webTitle":"GVC investors voting down executive pay are likely to be backing a loser","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/03/gvc-agm-investor-shareholder-vote-revolt-executive-pay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/03/gvc-agm-investor-shareholder-vote-revolt-executive-pay","fields":{"headline":"GVC investors voting down executive pay are likely to be backing a loser","bodyText":"It’s deja vu all over again. When the shareholders of gambling company GVC meet in Gibraltar for the firm’s AGM this week, there is expected to be a rebellion over bloated executive pay packets. Chief executive Kenny Alexander has been awarded £45m in share options since 2016 while chairman Larry Feldman has picked up share options worth £22.5m, thanks to a scheme linked to the firm’s share price, which recently hit an all-time high. The pay levels have prompted outrage from a section of shareholders who have been advised to vote against the pay report of the FTSE 250 company, which owns Ladbrokes Coral and Foxy Bingo and has its headquarters on the Isle of Man. But will it make a difference? Voting against executive pay has become something of a given at AGMs this year, as has the failure of such efforts. Last month, AstraZeneca faced the wrath of investors when over a third of them failed to back the pharmaceuticals giant’s remuneration report. The rebellion opposed a £9.4m pay package for chief executive Pascal Soriot, even though this was a reduction from £14.3m a year earlier. One of the biggest rebellions of the year came at turnaround specialists Melrose when almost 27% of shareholders who voted at its annual meeting in May failed to back its pay report, with leading City institution and top-20 shareholder Standard Life Aberdeen among the rebels. That vote came amid disgruntlement over a decision to pay a £42m incentive scheme payout to each of four directors, but failed to stop the payments as they have already been made and shareholders are powerless to stop payments because the votes are only advisory. However, it was seen as a rap on the knuckles for a decision to hand out £167m to just four men – the executive chairman, Christopher Miller, the executive vice-chairman, David Roper, the chief executive, Simon Peckham, and the group finance director, Geoffrey Martin – and the company said it would review the existing remuneration arrangements. At the beginning of May, insurance group Direct Line had a shareholder rebellion when 23% voted against directors’ pay. That focus was on the £657,000 basic pay awarded to new finance director Penny James, whose pay is 38% more than her predecessor’s. At about the same time, 37.6% of shareholders voted against the Bovis remuneration report after a controversy over the pay package it awarded its interim chief executive. But, again, the revolt failed to stop the report, which was passed with the backing of 62.4% of the voters. Shortly before that, shareholders in housebuilder Persimmon had revolted against what was described as the excessive and unjustifiable £75m bonus paid to chief executive Jeff Fairburn. The company’s annual meeting saw shareholders get to their feet to show their outrage at the sums paid to him and other senior managers. In a vote, 64% of shareholders failed to support the payout. However, despite the investor anger, the pay policy was approved, as almost a third of shareholders abstained from the vote, and of those who voted, 51.5% cast in favour and 48.5% against. The annual meeting in Gibraltar this week will be the second time that executive pay has been questioned by GVC shareholders. Last year, 45% of investors failed to support the pay policy. Judging by the experience of other AGMs so far this year, Alexander and Feldman may not be too concerned about their wages. •This article was amended on 4 June 2018 to clarify that the £42m payment t0 Melrose directors was under an incentive scheme"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/01/world-football-cup-alternative-fifa-lesson-geopolitics","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T15:28:36Z","webTitle":"World Football Cup an alternative to Fifa and a lesson in geopolitics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/01/world-football-cup-alternative-fifa-lesson-geopolitics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/01/world-football-cup-alternative-fifa-lesson-geopolitics","fields":{"headline":"World Football Cup an alternative to Fifa and a lesson in geopolitics","bodyText":"The World Football Cup began in London this week with a match at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium. This statement is true but may need clarification: it might sound like a report from a parallel universe in which the Fifa nobs sent their 2018 tournament to England not Russia. The World Football Cup is not quite the actual World Cup. It is not even a consolation event for the countries temporarily locked out of the World Cup, those obscure places such as Italy, the Netherlands and the United States, who failed to qualify. It is more of a consolation prize in life. It is for those places locked out of Fifa and, in almost every case, the international community as a whole: the world’s outcasts, the dispossessed, the not-quite nations, the once-were nations and in many cases never-will-be nations. Some are not geographical entities at all, such as Japan’s Korean minority. Some are intermittently, and almost always unhappily, in the news: like the Romany people and the Rohingya of Myanmar (neither of whom qualified). There is also an undercurrent of humour and satire. Among the 47 members of the Confederation of International Football Associations (Conifa) are Yorkshire, admitted too late for this tournament, and Cascadia, a greenish, libertarian, un-Trumpian confection with a slight whiff of dope, covering British Columbia and the north-western states of the US. But the overwhelming theme is tragedy. The opening match at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium was between the reigning champions, Abkhazia (a breakaway from former Soviet Georgia), and Tibet. Hardly any of the Tibetan players or supporters have even been there. Their parents and grandparents were forced into exile after China invaded their country in 1951. “These players live all over the world,” says Tenzin Kunga from the unofficial Tibetan embassy in London. “But they are all Tibetans. I have never been there myself. But I dream of Tibet, always.” The stadium was not quite as grand as the royal name suggests. This was the home ground of non-league Enfield Town, less pretentiously known as Donkey Lane. About 300 people turned up to watch, first, Tibet bravely restrict Abkhazia to three goals and then Northern Cyprus, the Cypriot Turks, take on Karpatalya in a skilful and combative match that ended in a sending-off, a punch-up and a 1-1 draw. The Turkish half of Cyprus, unrecognised by the world, has 32 teams in two leagues (“Not professional,” I was told, “but the players are well-paid”). They cannot even play against anyone from their protectors, Turkey, because even President Erdoğan quails before Fifa’s rules. Karpatalya, or Carpathian Ruthenia, is a Hungarian-speaking enclave, known to historians as the shortest-lived state in history. It declared itself independent from Czechoslovakia on 15 March 1939 and was annexed by Hungary the next day. It is now in Ukraine, which tries to stop the people speaking their own language. Or so their only visible supporters, two passing Hungarians, told the locals on the terraces, who were themselves the kind of affable, mildly eccentric types that somehow gravitate towards non-league grounds. They went to a football match and a geopolitics lesson broke out. The World Football Cup is like that. It is a biennial event and this is its third rendition. There had been a predecessor body to Conifa but it collapsed in 2010. The leading lights in its revival were Per-Anders Blind, a referee (he makes the joke first – “I’m the blind ref”) who is a Sami from Swedish Lapland, and Sascha Düerkop, a German football shirt collector who, having completed the Fifa set, was working his way through the non-Fifa teams and thus had the best contacts. Conifa has 47 members, 16 of whom qualified for this tournament which, in a strange, very Conifa way, is theoretically not taking place in London at all. The official host is Barawa, a small port in southern Somalia with its own culture and language – closer to Swahili than Somali. But Somalia’s troubles mean the Barawa FA is now based in London. At Bromley on Thursday evening, after the official opening ceremony, the Barawans played and mashed Tamil Eelam, representing Sri Lanka’s Tamil minority, who struggled on the unfamiliar artificial turf. But the parade beforehand was competitive, if haphazard. The Matabeles, who crowdfunded their journey, were notably joyful. There was a lone flagbearer from Western Sahara, which does not actually have a team here, but hey, this is Conifa. Cascadia marched behind a flagbearer wearing a bow tie and boater. “Who’s oppressing the Cascadians?” I asked him. “Anyone who harms the planet,” he replied. There was the team from Tuvalu, the tiny Pacific island group that would be eligible for Fifa except, according to the Tuvalu FA president, Soseala Tinilau, that they do not have enough stadium or hotel capacity. Fifa membership brings money. But they need money to qualify for membership. Milo Minderbinder would understand. But the Tibetans marched first and a plangent Tibetan band provided the pre-match entertainment. Tragedy is never far from the surface at Conifa. Tamil Eelam suffered a long and bloody civil war, as did Matabeleland. The tournament generates opposition too. A few Georgians turned up at Enfield to object to the separatist Abkhazians; the (Greek) Cypriot government wrote to Enfield council to try to thwart their Turkish neighbours. The Chinese work more subtly to suppress Tibetan nationalism. There is one main sponsor for the tournament, the bookmakers Paddy Power, a firm that relishes the original. There would have been others, says the organiser, Paul Watson. “We were talking to several firms about sponsorship that would have totalled six figures. But at quite a late stage they each came to us and said: ‘Um, yes, but you have to take Tibet out.’ We’d underestimated the difficulty of coming up against China and the Fifa network.” “So what did you do?” I asked. “Obviously we refused to comply,” said Watson. “Obviously?” “If we haven’t got our principles, what are we?” The same as everyone else in football, one might say. Beforehand, the Tibetans found that potential practice games in Germany suddenly dematerialised. And their UK visas, though they came through in the end, were held up for two months. This tournament makes one think hard about what we mean by nationality as a concept, as Britain has had to do twice in the past four years, over the Scottish referendum and then Brexit. If Yorkshire really wanted independence then, in the end, it would have to have it. The same is true for Catalonia (not members of Conifa) and the Québécois (who are). But elsewhere in the world it does not work that way. “We don’t refer to teams as countries,” says Watson. “We call them members. They are effectively identities. What links them is that their identity is expressed by their own labels and not the countries they belong to. “Countries are often just historic flukes. One broad stroke on a map and a peace treaty a hundred years ago. Does that make a country? We don’t claim to have the answer but it’s worth asking the question.” Blind, now Conifa’s president, admits these matters are becoming problematic. Some frivolous applications are being rejected: the North Sea fort of Sealand, once a pirate radio station, was brushed aside. “We have stopped chasing new members because we are getting applicants every month,” he says. “The latest are the Albanians living in Greece. “Maybe we will have to change, have different categories of membership. But we are one human race and here we have a global platform for the people of the world. Football is a tool for people to express themselves because it’s a universal language.” Conifa also offers a testbed for footballing ideas. The referees are armed with green cards as well as red and yellow ones. These are derived from black cards, as used in Gaelic sport as a halfway house: the player is sent off but can be replaced, so the team as a whole is not punished. Mark Clattenburg, the former Premier League referee, who puts himself about and will handle the final next Saturday, agreed the experiment with Paddy Power. If top-level referees do need a third option, I would vote for summary execution myself. But perhaps it is the right course here where proximity could breed a sense of collegiality unknown to modern professionals. These players are staying together in a four-to-a-room hostel in north London. Improbable friendships may arise. Those at the most put-upon end of the spectrum may discover young men from very different places whose experiences and cultural yearnings and sense of displacement match their own. I hope they have fun too. The presence of Paddy Power means there is even a betting market. Ellan Vannin – the Isle of Man – have been made 13-8 favourites. I quite fancy the Carpathians as a longshot. Maybe their day will come. For the second time. Maybe, though, the world does not work that way. Ragesh Nambiar, the UK-based Tamil Eelam coach, has a sideline giving talks to schools on behalf of Amnesty. One of his riffs is to stage a mock football match where he plays the role of the most biased referee imaginable. The aim is to teach kids about the unfairness of life."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/01/justine-greening-tipped-as-tory-candidate-for-london-mayor","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T12:17:58Z","webTitle":"Justine Greening tipped as Tory candidate for London mayor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/01/justine-greening-tipped-as-tory-candidate-for-london-mayor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/01/justine-greening-tipped-as-tory-candidate-for-london-mayor","fields":{"headline":"Justine Greening tipped as Tory candidate for London mayor","bodyText":"Justine Greening has been tipped as the next Tory candidate for mayor of London, after one of her rumoured rivals said he would not run and endorsed the former education secretary. Greening, the MP for Putney, has not yet announced a bid to take on Labour’s Sadiq Khan for City Hall’s top job in 2020. However, her chances were boosted on Friday when former culture minister Ed Vaizey told the Huffington Post he had ruled himself out and was backing Greening. “I was never really planning to run,” he told the website. The Conservatives are due to begin the process of selecting their candidate in June, giving them a two-year campaign to unseat Khan, who is still likely to be the favourite in 2020. The timetable for the selection, according to ConservativeHome, will mean that nominations open this month, with a summer campaign culminating in a final vote in September. The Conservatives are understood to feel that Zac Goldsmith, who took on Khan in the 2016 election, wasn’t given enough time to establish his campaign, having only been selected in September before the vote in May. His campaign was also dogged by allegations of dog-whistle xenophobic tactics against Khan. Since leaving the cabinet in January, Greening, who was a vocal remain campaigner, has been outspoken about the need for the Tories to broaden their appeal to younger, socially liberal voters. Her majority was slashed at the last general election, from more than 10,000 to just 1,554. Labour are polling ahead in London, although the Conservatives have been buoyed by better than expected local election results, in which Labour failed to take target councils including Barnet and Wandsworth. Other candidates who have been tipped to run for Londonmayor include MEP Syed Kamall, who was defeated by Goldsmith to be the Tory candidate in 2016."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/01/london-bridge-attack-wayne-marques-police-officer-planning-to-return-to-work","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T12:20:35Z","webTitle":"London Bridge attack: police officer planning return to work next month","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/01/london-bridge-attack-wayne-marques-police-officer-planning-to-return-to-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/01/london-bridge-attack-wayne-marques-police-officer-planning-to-return-to-work","fields":{"headline":"London Bridge attack: police officer planning return to work next month","bodyText":"A police officer who was stabbed in the head while fighting off the three London Bridge attackers with a baton has said he hopes to return to work next month. Speaking ahead of Sunday’s one-year anniversary of the terrorist attack, Wayne Marques said he had made significant progress and was able to walk by himself again. The British Transport Police (BTP) officer suffered major injuries during the attack after also being stabbed in the leg and hand. The knife wound to his head left him temporarily blinded in one eye but he has previously said the adrenaline prevented him from realising how badly he had been injured. Marques said he still had some way to go in his recovery but hoped to return to work next month. “I’ve made significant progress obviously since that night,” he said. “I’m much more independent, much more able. I’m standing, I’m walking, I’m talking. I’m able to socialise again, see family and friends.” He said his family had concerns about his return to work but said: “It’s a job that I enjoy. It’s who I am, to be honest.” Marques had to undergo a series of operations and spent almost three weeks in hospital after the attack. He said that messages of support from the public had helped him stay positive. He described the public response as overwhelming. “You go through these stages where you’re stuck in a bed and you’ve got this time to keep thinking about things,” he said in a video interview released by BTP. “Then you get these messages from people who have just heard about you. You’ve never met them and you never will, in most cases. But just genuine, heartfelt, caring messages.” Marques said he felt the longer he was away from work, the harder it would be to go back but that he had to be realistic about what he could do. He said he was currently trying to build up the left side of his body and increase his running ability. He referred to setbacks, including a loss of muscle power and endurance and grip strength caused by the cold weather in March and said he was learning what he could and could not do. “I am just trying to get as much of me back as possible,” said Marques. “I’ve still got far to go but I am on my way.” Youssef Zaghba, Khuram Butt and Rachid Redouane killed eight people during the attack. They deliberately drove a van into people on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market, where all three were shot dead by police. The Guardian has learned that BTP are reviewing the number of armed officers they have and where they should be deployed, following the experience of their officer facing terrorists unarmed and suffering extensive injuries. BTP are setting up two new armed counter-terrorism centres in Birmingham and Manchester, with officers already armed at stations in London. One option, among several being examined, is making them the first British police force that directly protects the public to become fully armed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/01/fall-of-mariano-rajoy-gurtel-spain","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T13:47:24Z","webTitle":"The fall of Rajoy: how Gürtel affair defeated Spain's great survivor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/fall-of-mariano-rajoy-gurtel-spain","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/01/fall-of-mariano-rajoy-gurtel-spain","fields":{"headline":"The fall of Rajoy: how Gürtel affair defeated Spain's great survivor","bodyText":"In January 2012, Mariano Rajoy texted a friend who was going through a rough patch. “Luis, stay strong,” he wrote. “Luis, we are doing what we can.” Luis was Luis Bárcenas, a former treasurer in Rajoy’s People’s party (PP) and the focus of persistent allegations that Spain’s ruling party was receiving illegal funding. Rajoy’s soothing words would come back to haunt him – as would Bárcenas and his business dealings. Last week, Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, found Bárcenas guilty of crimes including fraud and money laundering, jailing him for 33 years and fining him €44m (£38.5m). Not for nothing was the Gürtel case, as it came to be known, billed as the trial of the year. As well as juicy details ranging from Swiss bank accounts to the hiring of clowns for children’s birthday parties, the case involved several former senior PP members, including Bárcenas. The proceedings centred on Francisco Correa, an executive with close ties to the PP who was accused of paying bribes to party officials between 1999 and 2006 in return for contracts to carry out public works and organise events. The police investigation was codenamed Gürtel, the German word for correa (“belt” in Spanish). Bárcenas and Correa – who was handed a 51-year sentence – were among the 29 defendants convicted and jailed last week. Eight others were acquitted. But far more damning was the court’s ruling that the PP had profited, albeit unknowingly, from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. Not only did the judges order the party to pay a €240,000 fine, they also expressed doubts over the credibility of the testimony Rajoy had given last July when he became the first serving Spanish prime minister to give evidence in a criminal trial. Rajoy, who was the PP’s vice-secretary general between 1990 and 2003, told the court that his duties during the period in question were exclusively political and not financial. He also dismissed suggestions that a slush fund was used to pay illegal bonuses to senior party officials as “absolutely false”. However, in their ruling, the Audiencia Nacional judges confirmed the existence of a slush fund known as “box B”, describing it as “an accounting and finance structure that ran in parallel with the official one and which had been in use since at least 1989”. Even for a party as steeped in corruption allegations as Rajoy’s, the reputational damage was disastrous. The prime minister, a man famed for his powers of survival and inveterate tendency to sit back and let others make the first move, suddenly looked vulnerable. For perhaps the first time in his long political career, the 63-year-old Galician had begun to bleed. His opponents were quick to pick up the scent. The day after the Gürtel sentences were handed down, the Spanish socialist party announced it had filed a motion of no confidence in Rajoy. The verdict in the case, said the PSOE leader, Pedro Sánchez, had “seriously damaged the health of our democracy”. The aim of the motion, he said, was “to bring normality back to our public life and to do away with this corruption thriller into which the People’s party has plunged our politics, so that we can talk about the things that matter to our citizens”. Rajoy’s response was blunt. He said: “This motion is bad for Spain, bad for Spaniards, brings with it too much uncertainty and is damaging to all citizens.” For most of the past week, things appeared to be going Rajoy’s way. The centre-right Ciudadanos party refused to have anything to do with the motion, calling instead for a snap election. But then rumours began to circulate that the small Basque Nationalist party was on the verge of supporting Sánchez’s motion, even though Rajoy had offered the region increased investment to win its backing for his recent budget. Its backing proved crucial, helping the PSOE eject Rajoy from office in Friday morning’s vote. “It has been an honour to be the prime minister of Spain,” Rajoy told parliament as he waited for the axe to fall. “It has been an honour to leave a better Spain than the one I found.” Even Rajoy’s critics would not deny the role he played in bringing Spain back from the brink of economic ruin. But he is likely to be remembered more for his handling of the Catalan independence crisis and for his stubborn and ultimately fatal refusal to deal with the festering issue of corruption within the PP. Rajoy took his own advice, staying strong right up to the vote. But in the end, there was nothing he, or anyone else, could do."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/01/trumps-tariffs-spell-it-out-brexit-britain-cant-rely-on-the-us","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T11:43:25Z","webTitle":"Trump’s tariffs spell it out: Brexit Britain can’t rely on the US | Adam Marshall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/trumps-tariffs-spell-it-out-brexit-britain-cant-rely-on-the-us","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/trumps-tariffs-spell-it-out-brexit-britain-cant-rely-on-the-us","fields":{"headline":"Trump’s tariffs spell it out: Brexit Britain can’t rely on the US","bodyText":"As punitive tariffs hit UK steel and aluminium exports to the US, the extent of the impact on British firms and communities will be revealed in time. In many respects, British steelmakers and their supply chain firms are collateral damage in Donald Trump’s protectionist push, which has gained momentum in recent weeks. So too are the communities across the UK that depend on the well-paid jobs these companies create. Businesses most exposed to the US market, with key customers and order books on the other side of the Atlantic, now find themselves at the very sharp end. There may be a fair amount of pain ahead, albeit localised, at a time when many trading businesses in the UK are already grappling with the uncertainties surrounding Brexit. So it’s vital the government moves swiftly to demonstrate its support and backing for those caught up in a political conflagration not of their own making. British ministers and officials have spent months trying to avoid this outcome, working with their counterparts in both Brussels and Washington to try to broker a compromise. Now they must do their utmost to take the heat out of the situation – and avoid further escalation into an out-and-out trade war. Tit-for-tat measures, including those already proposed by the EU, would spread the impact from our industrial estates and factories to our supermarkets, high streets and the wider economy. A return to dialogue and negotiation, with cool heads on all sides, must be prioritised. Yet the tariffs announced by the Trump administration are also a timely reminder that national self-interest lies at the heart of every trade negotiation. The US president has made no secret of his desire to put “America first”, nor his willingness to take populist decisions that have negative impacts on business interests in his own country and across the world. His latest move once again shows that the US plays tough in trade negotiations – and plays to win. Trump’s protectionist turn must serve as a wake-up call to those in Westminster keen on a swift free trade agreement with the US once the UK leaves the European Union. The “global Britain” the government seeks to create and the “America first” approach are the unlikeliest of bedfellows. Despite the special relationship between the UK and the US and the deep business and political ties between our two countries, it is unfathomable that the Washington would compromise in negotiations with Westminster if that brought competition that threatened US jobs or investment. Trade with the US is hugely important to Britain and British companies. Around 15% of UK goods exports already go to the US, the biggest percentage for any single country. As I have written before, while we should seek ways to grow that trade further, a comprehensive free trade agreement between the two should not be a priority unless there is a sea change in the US government’s approach to its partners and friends. Instead, British ministers must join forces with their colleagues in the EU – while the UK still remains a member – both to de-escalate trade tensions with the US, and to ensure that those firms hurt by its new tariffs are not further undercut as competitors shift away from American markets. The UK has long been a bridge between America and the continent, and must try to use that position to good effect over the coming weeks to avert a trade war that would hit business confidence and investment both here at home and around the world. While the immediate British casualties of Trump’s steel tariffs may be found in South Yorkshire or South Wales, it is global trade – and the system of rules that underpin it – that could suffer over the longer term. Over the coming weeks, businesses across Britain will want reassurance that their government and its allies will do everything in their power to prevent a global slide into protectionism that would make all of us poorer. • Adam Marshall is director general of the British Chambers of Commerce"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/should-we-trust-people-whose-politics-differ-oliver-burkeman","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-15T13:59:18Z","webTitle":"Should we trust people whose politics differ from ours? | Oliver Burkeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/should-we-trust-people-whose-politics-differ-oliver-burkeman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/15/should-we-trust-people-whose-politics-differ-oliver-burkeman","fields":{"headline":"Should we trust people whose politics differ from ours?","bodyText":"A while back, in this column, I made a plea for more escapism. I’d been driven round the bend by the impossibility of having a single conversation with anyone without the subject turning to politics – Trump or Brexit, mainly – and by the mystifying popularity of TV shows and novels with something to say about “the current climate”, when clearly what’s required is a break from that climate. Read swashbuckling adventures or watch period romances instead! When politics is everything, it’s unhealthy; indeed, as the philosopher Robert Talisse argues, it’s unhealthy for politics itself. (Constructive political disagreement requires that we start from some shared, non-political common ground, otherwise it’s just a fight to the death.) So did you heed my advice? You did not. Though to be fair, neither did I. And neither, apparently, did the participants in a new study by the neuroscientist Tali Sharot and others, on the troubling phenomenon they label “epistemic spillover”. The experiment was complex, but the findings were stark: once you know someone’s political leanings, it distorts your ability to judge their expertise in domains unrelated to politics. People would rather hear from experts who agree with them politically, and are more influenced by their advice – even if the topic is dentistry, or saving for retirement, or building an extension to your kitchen, or something else entirely non-political. Surely it shouldn’t matter if your dentist or builder disagrees with you on Brexit, or the merits of Jeremy Corbyn? Addressing a US audience, the researchers gave the example of discovering your dermatologist was Republican: “Knowing a person’s political leanings should not affect your assessment of how good a doctor she is.” Yet it does. Hold on, though. Is it true you should trust a Republican doctor? (Let’s assume this is a context where moral issues such as abortion don’t arise.) Much of me wants to think so. But part of me can’t help recalling the surveys suggesting most Republicans don’t think humans cause climate change, and believe guns make homes safer. If you’ve swallowed those notions, what might that say about your grasp of other scientific data, or your susceptibility to believing whatever you like when it comes to, say, psoriasis, or skin cancer? The more general point here is that politics, in colonising everything, has come to colonise our perception of the facts, too. And even if you disagree with me on climate change or guns, by the way, the problem remains: perhaps I’m the one labouring under delusions, but either way, we’re arguing not about opinions, but reality itself. In that situation, it’s not necessarily irrational to distrust one’s political opponents on pretty much everything. It’s a vicious circle: it would be better if politics weren’t so tribal, but given that it is – and that this now extends to basic facts – there’s an incentive to start behaving more tribally yourself. After all, if the other side is out of touch with reality, engaging sanely with reality means rejecting their whole worldview, not just their politics. Is it possible to do that without rejecting them as human beings, thereby turning politics into all-out war? I suppose we’ll soon find out.

Won here in October and also at Goodwood last year, so undulating tracks hold no fears for him, and both those wins came on rain-softened ground, which he gets again. “Never nearer” third in a trial here in April, then kept on into second in the Chester Vase. No great surprise if he keeps plugging away for a place once more but makes little appeal for the outright win. Delano Roosevelt (16-1) Won a Leopardstown maiden on his debut in July but beaten all four starts since, albeit while showing promise. Comfortably held by Saxon Warrior when two and a half lengths behind him at Naas in September. Second in two long-established Derby trials this spring, notably when “never nearer” behind Hazapour at Leopardstown last time. Hardly showed lightning acceleration that day but this son of Galileo ought to appreciate the extra quarter-mile here. One of five for Aidan O’Brien. Hazapour (9-1) Product of the Aga Khan breeding that has sometimes done well here, including two years ago with Harzand, whose half-sister is this one’s mother. Won a Galway maiden on soft from three starts last year. Odds of 16-1 suggested little was expected when he reappeared in the Leopardstown trial last month but he travelled well, led when asked to do so and held off Delano Roosevelt and The Pentagon. Could improve again and an obvious contender, especially with Dettori booked to guide him through the race. Kew Gardens (40-1) Perhaps the least likely of Aidan O’Brien’s five, although such talk is dangerous after the trainer’s 50-1 winner 12 months ago. Won a Killarney maiden and a Newmarket Listed race, beating Dee Ex Bee, last year but trailed Saxon Warrior by three lengths at Naas. Looks short of pace and vulnerable once more. Knight To Behold (20-1) Sprang into contention when landing the Lingfield trial by daylight last month, when he took a keen hold, was allowed to stride on from an early stage and was never reeled in by his rivals, headed by Kew Gardens. The stated plan is to settle him behind a lead this time, though he looks a strong stayer and aggressive tactics could actually play well once more. Bred to do the job and any improvement for his reappearance run would make him dangerous. Masar (25-1) Godolphin runner was not quite good enough for Saxon Warrior in the Guineas, coming up short by a length and three-quarters and hard to think he can improve much on that form. Last five starts came at a mile and it’s not clear that an extra half-mile will help him, though his pedigree offers some hope. Needs the ground to dry up. Roaring Lion (9-1) Came closer than anything else has done to beating Saxon Warrior when held by just a neck at Doncaster in October, when he quickened to take the lead before being outbattled. Was two and a half lengths behind that rival when only fifth in the Guineas but excuses could be made and he was much more impressive when storming home in the Dante a fortnight later. Blistering speed he showed off a steady pace that day suggests an extra quarter-mile may not play to his strengths, especially on rain-softened ground. Looks a hard ride and has trouble keeping straight in the closing stages. Bundles of ability and a worthy second-favourite if the ground proves drier than expected. Saxon Warrior (11-10 fav) Unbeaten in four and unquestionably the right favourite, he is the only Group One winner in this field, having won two such races. Outbattled Roaring Lion at Doncaster in the autumn. Was thought to be vulnerable on his first start back and was not favourite when winning the Guineas, travelling smoothly and scoring with some authority. Any improvement on that would make him very hard to beat, short of trouble in running. Must prove his stamina for the extra half-mile, which can’t be taken for granted on his pedigree or his run-style. Draw in stall one is often a problem over this course and distance but he has the tactical pace to minimise that. Four stablemates will surely not be getting in his way. An immensely valuable stallion prospect if he can win this. Sevenna Star (33-1) Form and pedigree give this one plenty to prove and Dettori, who could have ridden, has gone for Hazapour instead. Beaten in both starts as a juvenile but had a wind operation in the winter and better this year though the bare form isn’t good enough. The Pentagon (33-1) Another of O’Brien’s five, this one is starting to look exposed as not good enough after six starts. Won a Curragh maiden and a Group Three at Leopardstown but the most recent of those was in July. Neither the rain nor the extra distance are necessarily a help. Young Rascal (8-1) Finished strongly to win the Chester Vase last month, having been brave to take a gap between rivals at the crucial moment. On the face of it, a half-length defeat of Dee Ex Bee is not enough to scare fans of Saxon Warrior and this colt may have plenty of running to do from the home turn, as he looked a bit short of early speed that day. But his stamina is not in question, the recent rain helps and he will surely be there to make a challenge if more fancied rivals falter. Zabriskie (66-1) One of the best bred in the field but yet to show that level of class on the track. Has more to offer and the recent rain gives him a chance to outrun his big odds. To be ridden by Padraig Beggy, who sprang such a surprise in this race last year but has hardly had a winner since."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/04/jennifer-jason-leigh-tarantino-woody-allen-family-patrick-melrose","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T05:00:06Z","webTitle":"‘I have countless stories’: Jennifer Jason Leigh on lucky breaks, lotharios and late motherhood","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/04/jennifer-jason-leigh-tarantino-woody-allen-family-patrick-melrose","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/04/jennifer-jason-leigh-tarantino-woody-allen-family-patrick-melrose","fields":{"headline":"‘I have countless stories’: Jennifer Jason Leigh on lucky breaks, lotharios and late motherhood","bodyText":"In the corner of an almost empty British-themed pub in Hollywood, a woman sits with a fringe concealing half her face. At the age of 56, Jennifer Jason Leigh remains an enigma. A chameleon who can do ethereal and gritty, ravishing and repellent, fragile and fierce, she was Tralala, the doomed prostitute in Last Exit to Brooklyn; Hedy, the stalker flatmate in Single White Female; and Daisy, the homicidal fugitive in The Hateful Eight. A child actor turned 90s film-noir queen, she veered from mainstream stardom into indie projects, then the Hollywood wilderness, before roaring back in recent years. All the while, she has kept a veil over her private life. “There was a time, when I was dating in my early 30s or late 20s, where people would meet me and think that I was going to be a wild or risk-taking dramatic young woman,” she says softly, pouring milk into her tea. “I’ve always avoided drama in my life. I just like it on screen.” But during the next hour Jason Leigh does something dramatic: she opens up. After telling me she is selfconscious, that she will leave the interview feeling uneasy if she suspects she has said the wrong thing, she ends up talking so much her tea goes untouched. She is here to discuss Patrick Melrose, the acclaimed television adaptation of Edward St Aubyn’s autobiographical novels. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Patrick, Jason Leigh plays his mother, Eleanor, and Hugo Weaving plays his father, David, a vile tyrant who traumatises son and wife, driving one to heroin, the other to booze and pills. “I couldn’t even look at Hugo while we were shooting, even when we were in the makeup trailer together, because he was playing David,” she says. “He couldn’t be a lovelier man, but I couldn’t look at him. But that was a good sign – it meant I was locked in in a way that I need to be.” She says Cumberbatch’s transformation into a junkie toff, blending physical comedy with harrowing suffering, is seamless. “They should show that at acting school.” To be locked into a story about a family’s awful dysfunction sounds grim, but Jason Leigh, famous for deep research and immersion, would have it no other way. She read the books years ago and credits David Nicholls with a masterly screen adaptation. “I reread the novels and would get confused between what was in the screenplay and the book. They got melded in my brain. If ever you got lost in a scene, you could go back and find in the book every sensory detail. They tell you about the taste of Eleanor’s mouth in the mornings – the vomit and the toothpaste and the headache and the sweating.” Jason Leigh defends the sozzled, overwhelmed Eleanor. “What she does as a mother is obviously monstrous, because she’s drinking to dull every nerve in her body and drugging herself with pills to be obliterated, to go into a space of denial. She can’t save her son. She has been trampled on by David.” Jason Leigh’s gaze drifts to a bowl of smoked nuts. Her hand traces an invisible pattern over the table’s surface. Then she segues. “My father was very difficult.” Her parents – Vic Morrow, an actor and director, and Barbara Turner, an actor and screenwriter – separated when she was two. Her father died in a helicopter accident in 1982, while filming a movie version of The Twilight Zone. “We were not close. It’s hard. I don’t really talk about my father publicly, because there are a lot of people that really love him very, very much – his work as an actor. I don’t want to disabuse them [of] their admiration.” Jason Leigh goes on to talk about her relationship with her sister, Carrie Ann Morrow, who died in 2016, aged 58. “She was a drug addict. I saw a lot of that behaviour growing up and decided at a very young age I didn’t want that. But a part of me obviously wanted to understand and know what it was like, but from a very safe distance. A lot of my pull towards acting was trying to understand my sister – and my father, for that matter.” She resumes eye contact. “I don’t really like being around people that are drunk. I like playing people that are drunk. You have to lose yourself in acting. That’s why I was drawn to a lot of the roles that I play – they were roles that were very similar to my sister and very far away from me. But it also probably did give me a certain freedom and release, but in a very safe way. Because it’s pretend. That’s what actors do.” Jason Leigh’s career choices suddenly take on a new light. There have been few romantic or comedy roles, but plenty of grit and torment, notably in Georgia, a 1995 drama written by her mother in which she played a drug-addicted rocker overshadowed by a successful sister. Carrie Ann was credited as a technical adviser. Meryl Streep, among others, said Jason Leigh deserved an Oscar for Georgia. It did not happen. There were other awards and mainstream appearances in The Hudsucker Proxy, Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle and Road to Perdition, and artsier roles in Existenz, Palindromes and Synecdoche, New York. But her career did not scale the giddiest heights. Hollywood did not know how to use her properly, said some critics. Here is another explanation: she recoiled from the hustle – the pitching, networking and chasing. “I’m not really a careerist. I don’t go out a lot or call my agent a lot. I don’t actively pursue jobs maybe in the way I should. I wish I was less introverted. I wish I could enjoy a party. I’m not good at small talk and don’t enjoy it.” She sighs, then laughs. “This is great, this is me getting myself uninvited to every single party. But that’s OK.” It does not help that Hollywood is infested with creeps. “I have countless stories,” she says. “Not of rape, but of very uncomfortable and awkward situations. Directors keeping you in a meeting for four hours, then saying they wanted to have dinner and were hungry. You’re forced into this situation where you want the job, but ... it feels off.” As a young actor, she lost roles by rebuffing what were then known as lotharios, she says, declining to name names. Her tone is matter-of-fact, not bitter. She cheers Harvey Weinstein’s downfall and the rise of the #MeToo movement. “It’s obviously not just the film business. It starts with the president of the United States. It’s in every facet of society. People won’t be able to get away with it. The status quo is changing like a hurricane.” Would she work with Woody Allen? There is a long pause. Her nose crinkles. “No. A lot of my favourite films are Woody Allen films, but I wouldn’t work with him.” The tea is stone cold. Jason Leigh’s wilderness phase was not planned. She did some plays and had a baby and the job offers slowed. “There was a period of time when it was very hard for me.” That changed in 2015. She voiced a key character in Anomalisa, a stop-motion animation that won awards and broke hearts. Then Quentin Tarantino, who has a knack for rediscovering neglected talent, cast her in his western The Hateful Eight. “That really turned my life around.” Uma Thurman and Rose McGowan have accused Tarantino respectively of bullying and fetishising them, but Jason Leigh lauds him. “I love Quentin, so all I can tell you is that he loves and is so respectful of everyone that he works with. When you get on the set, it feels like a family. He knew more about my career than I did – he was quoting things that I’d done for ever ago as if they were yesterday.” Jason Leigh also has a soft spot for Daisy, her ruthless desperado character in The Hateful Eight. “She’s a bit of a monster. But I couldn’t feel like that when I was playing her. I felt she was like a family gal. Her family is her gang.” She won an Oscar nomination for the role and has been busy since, with roles in the Netflix comedy Atypical and David Lynch’s revived Twin Peaks, plus big-screen outings as Lady Bird Johnson in LBJ, a scientist in Annihilation and an FBI agent in the upcoming White Boy Rick, opposite Matthew McConaughey. She plays Patrick Melrose’s mother as a rounded, complex character. “I got really lucky getting Eleanor, because there are not that many great parts for women past the age of 40.” Viewers may condemn Eleanor’s maternal neglect, but Jason Leigh defends her. “She has so much yearning to love Patrick and take care of him, but she’s completely incapable. I’m lucky I’m not in that situation.” Jason Leigh has one child, Rohmer, a son born in 2010, when she was 48. “They say you have no idea what love is like until you have a child. It supersedes romantic love by such magnitude it’s insane.” Late motherhood suits her. “It’s been ideal, in a certain way. You’re ready to be selfless. You’ve had enough time for yourself.” Her marriage to Noah Baumbach, a director and a screen collaborator, ended soon after the birth, but they share parenting. “He has a good father. It’s all very easy for me.” In depicting Eleanor’s melancholic end, Jason Leigh drew on what she experienced with her own mother, who moved into her Los Angeles home before she died of cancer in 2016. “You see her in the end phases of her life and I lived through that period with my mom. I really wanted to be faithful to her. To be able to portray that time in someone’s life in a very honest way was cathartic for me.” The interview has overrun. Jason Leigh looks down at my phone, recording all, and winces. Has she said too much? She smiles uncertainly. “I’m always a bit trepidatious.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/02/small-firms-face-extermination-due-to-network-rail-asset-sale","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T06:00:11Z","webTitle":"Small firms face 'extermination' due to Network Rail asset sale","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/02/small-firms-face-extermination-due-to-network-rail-asset-sale","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/02/small-firms-face-extermination-due-to-network-rail-asset-sale","fields":{"headline":"Small firms face 'extermination' due to Network Rail asset sale","bodyText":"Thousands of small businesses based in railway arches across the UK are facing “extermination” as Network Rail seeks to push through a billion-pound asset sale. From bakers to bike shops, mechanics to restaurants, many of the 5,500 arches across the UK’s major cities are home to traders and shop owners. But since announcing they would be selling their commercial property business, Network Rail has been accused of trying to strong-arm many of them out of their arches with threats of eviction if rent increases of between 300% and 500% are not met. There are also fears about what will happen to the businesses when the sale goes through, with a number of private equity firms interested in acquiring the vast block of real estate. An action group called Guardians of the Arches has been set up in response and is being backed by Big Issue founder Lord John Bird. George Grant, 56, who owns Clapham North MOT in London and co-founded the action group, said Network Rail told him his rent would be increased fivefold. He took on the business from his 93-year-old father Ronnie, a second world war D-day veteran who set it up in an arch 60 years ago. “At the time Network Rail couldn’t get rid of the arches, they just wanted people to come in and look after them,” Grant said. “When my father moved in there were three light bulbs and that was it, so he set about renovating it and they said do what you want as long as you pay your rent. “They have absolutely never looked after us. We have built a business in those arches to serve the community. “These businesses are the lifeblood of the communities of this country but Network Rail don’t understand this. They are basically exterminating the small business entrepreneurs in this country. “With this sale of the assets nobody has been consulted. The government just said we are going to sell the arches. There was no consultation with the tenants or the general public. And the public don’t want their local businesses to be exterminated, because they use them.” This story is being repeated across the country, leaving business owners facing an uncertain future. Dipak Patel, 39, runs a cafe and repair shop called Popup Bikes in Manchester with his brother Prakash, but is facing the threat of having to pack up and leave if his three-month rolling lease ends. He said: “It’s how big business works. It’s what they do, in search of profits the little guy gets shoved to the side. “The important thing here is the public know this is going on and how it will affect them in the future. What will it leave them with in their cities and towns? What will happen if the nice independent coffee shop that used to be there will get replaced by a multinational chain? “We are a hub for the community. Before we came in six years ago there were just smackheads hanging around. People couldn’t even park their cars here but now they can as the whole area has improved. But all that will go out the window if we are forced to leave. “What we will end up with is a monoculture where there are no Popup Bikes, no great MOT places, just the same big chains everywhere. There will be no choice and we just have to buy the same stuff that everyone else buys.” According to reports, there are said to be around 20 parties interested in the £1.2bn rail property arm, including private equity firms Terra Firma and Blackstone. But Guardians of the Arches says momentum is starting to build and they have gained 3,500 signatures in just one week on a letter addressed to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, which they plan to deliver to Downing Street this month. Leni Jones, 38, whose husband Marcus established Rosso Corse, a Ducati specialist based in Bethnal Green, said they feel like they are being held to ransom by Network Rail. Jones acts as a director of Guardians of the Arches after being told Rosso Corse’s rent would increase almost fourfold. “We feel we are being held to ransom, they’ve given us zero time to relocate and they’ve removed all our security by taking away our security of tenure. And they own all the arches so they control the entire market,” she said. “We’re not opposed to rent reviews, but what they are proposing is not comparable to what is charged locally. The business is our baby and what it represents to us is the culmination of my husband’s journey and all the love we’ve put into it. “When we received the letter we felt very alone and so started talking to our neighbours to find out their situations and found out a number of the arches on our road are in the same situation, all given rent increases in excess of 300%, with the threat of eviction. “This is where the concept came from, we shouldn’t be facing Network Rail alone, we should pool this knowledge and speak as a group. We’ll happily sit down and negotiate.” Network Rail refused to comment on why certain tenants were facing rent increases of between 300% and 500% but said they aim to make rents competitive. A spokesman said: “The sale of Network Rail’s arches will enable the company to raise funds to reinvest in much-needed railway projects to expand and improve the railway network for the benefits of millions of daily users. “Rent reviews happen as tenancies expire, which can be as long as seven years. We benchmark against similar commercial premises in the local area and aim our rents at the lower end to make them competitive. “Some areas have seen marked regeneration in recent years, which can lead to increased rents but we will always do our best to stagger any increase.” • This article was amended on 4 June 2018.

They may take bigger forms, such as your career and relationships - but they will also crop up in day-to-day life. Julie Leitz has an impressive number of titles under her belt (she’s a coach, mediator, psychologist and neuroscientist), and this summer she is launching the School of Conflict. Not so much a karate studio as a place with a mission to help people fall in love with having difficult conversations, Julie’s school will be a springboard for many of us who struggle to tackle head-on the things we would rather avoid. She tells us about the importance of embracing conflict ahead of her Guardian masterclass. What is a “difficult conversation” and why should we be having more of them? Difficult conversations are the day-to-day conversations that affect your life. When you think about the implications of that, it becomes really easy to understand why it’s essential we learn the skills to master and feel comfortable having them. They’re often conversations with high stakes, that matter because of the impact of the outcome on your life. Emotions may be running high and opinions differing. Nothing that matters in life happens without a conversation. We shape our life, our relationships and ultimately our identity with every difficult conversation. Trying to escape them and dealing with the consequences of having avoided them is more energy-draining than finding the courage to have those conversations in the first place. In fact, more often than not, avoiding them also engenders negative consequences - think not getting that pay rise, staying in an unhappy relationship, having to face an unhelpful colleague day after day, or continuing to dread your mother-in-law’s visits - forever! These things are major stressors that can dramatically affect the quality of your life. The good news is that you can get to a place where you actually look forward to having a difficult conversation because of the opportunity for change they provide, along with the clarity and feeling of integrity that comes with them. They’re a great gift, both to yourself and to the person or people you’re having the conversation with. We’re all guilty of slumping into unhappy situations because we’re afraid of the consequences of a difficult conversation. As humans, we tend to avoid confrontation rather than face it. Why do you think that is? The neuroscience of conflict tells us that we are wired to deal with it in ways that used to be essential when we risked being eating alive by lions, but which are unhelpful in today’s home and workplace situations. Some people tend to avoid conflict at all costs; others go straight in without thinking and react too strongly - and pretty much everyone who hasn’t learned how to deal with conflict is run by their emotions in some way throughout the process. You may have heard of the “reptilian brain” construct - those brain areas responsible for regulating unconscious body functions, such as breathing, heart rate or digestion - as well as self-preservation behaviours like eating or defending ourselves and enacting the “fight, flight or freeze” response. The “reptilian brain” has allowed us to survive over the millennia and for that reason we have given it a prime seat in our functioning. It has also been around for much longer than the brain areas responsible for functions like mediating conflicting thoughts, choosing between right or wrong, predicting outcomes of actions, or controlling urges. It may thus take a few more thousands of years of evolution for the reptilian brain to take a back seat and higher cognitive functions to become the default processes engaged during conflict. Humans are social by nature: we need others to survive and are wired to connect. A growing body of research in social cognitive neuroscience tells us that the need to connect with others is as important to our wellbeing as our need for food and shelter. The pain that we feel when we are rejected or experience other “social pain” is akin to physical pain. So, on the one hand we’re wired to react in unhelpful ways during conflict, and on the other hand we’re wired to be in relationships with others. It’s no wonder then that having difficult conversations can feel daunting - but while it’s tempting to avoid conflict to preserve relationships, it’s important to realise that, over time, it actually has the opposite effect and damages relationships and also comes at a high personal cost. Take the all too common scenario where you’ve exceeded all your targets at work and know you deserve a raise but your boss finds ways to suggest the time isn’t right yet again, yet some of your colleagues are getting raises. It becomes a matter of self-respect, among other things, to have a conversation to understand why and make your case. Importantly, it’s not necessarily about getting to the outcome of being given a raise - there may be good reasons of which you aren’t aware - but it’s about getting to a place of mutual understanding. To what extent do you think the ability to have awkward or difficult conversations makes a stronger leader? Self-awareness, relationship agility and the ability to foster constructive conflict are non-negotiable leadership competencies. Without all three of them it’s very difficult to create a culture that is conducive to engagement, employee retention, innovation and performance. When a leader isn’t able to have difficult conversations and instead engages in controlling or avoidant behaviours, they are ultimately setting the standard for how things are done in that team. This engenders a culture of false harmony and comes at the great cost of job dissatisfaction and underperformance. In an article I wrote in 2016, I give an example of the importance of creating a culture that fosters open dialogue and conflict. As a leader you have an extra challenge and responsibility: not only do you have to be able to have difficult conversations and be agile in them, but knowing how to take part in them isn’t enough. You also have to be able to actively create an environment in which awkward or difficult conversations are normalised for everyone and take place frequently. This is no easy task but the good news is that it can be learned. Like the CIO of a leading telecommunications company whose team I worked with on this topic put it: “Team dynamics cannot be handed over to chance and hope. It’s an expertise that needs to be trained.” Can you tell me a bit about your previous work? What led you to want to help people plunge into difficult situations with confidence and assurance? In 2014 I started running workshops specifically aimed at helping teams communicate and ultimately perform better. A pattern quickly started to emerge: there are crucial, difficult conversations that every team absolutely needs to have but is avoiding out of fear that conflict of ideas might escalate into interpersonal conflict. Over and over, I was observing the fact that it’s the conversations people weren’t having that were getting in the way of success. From there, my work naturally evolved to focus on the topic of difficult conversations, relationship agility and constructive conflict. I bring my background in psychology and neuroscience to my coaching to offer a wide range of tools and frameworks to support my clients. I work with my clients both on the mindset needed to approach difficult conversation and the tools required to navigate them. Every time, I am blown away by the results they are able to achieve and the amount of personal transformation that goes on in the process. I’m launching the School of Conflict this summer because I believe it’s essential we all learn how to be great at conflict. Our personal integrity, relationships and success in all areas of life depend on it. You will be leading a masterclass with us in July - a how-to for having difficult conversations. What will you be showing the participants, and what do you hope they will take away from the course? Participants will learn powerful tools to master difficult conversations as well as the mindset required to use those tools in a way that gets results. More specifically, I’ve chosen three essential tools that can be learned in one evening and that have the potential to transform difficult conversations. My hope is that after the three hours participants will not only feel more comfortable having difficult conversations but actually look forward to making them happen. Finally, could you give us a few quick tips for having difficult conversations that can be tried at home? When thinking about a difficult conversation, people tend to worry a lot about what they are going to say. Of course this is essential, but how they are going to say it is at least as important. How you say something determines how likely the other person is to actually listen to you and it also determines the quality and productivity of the dialogue that unfolds. Actually initiating the conversation is something people are often concerned about. Not only does it usually require stretching into the uncomfortable but you may have noticed that your opening line will have a huge impact on everything that happens next. As a rule of thumb, a difficult conversation tends to end on the same tone it has started, so it is much more strategic to soften the way you start the conversation. With that in mind, here are three quick tips: Use “I” statements. Imagine a scenario where you’ve been feeling stressed at work and you wish your partner would take your struggle more seriously. Consider the difference between saying “You clearly don’t understand what I’m going through” and “I’d like to tell you more about what’s going on for me so you can understand it better”. In the first sentence, it might sound like you’re blaming the other person for not understanding. In the second sentence, the focus is on you and your need to be understood. Start with facts. You arrive home and your partner mumbles “hello” without looking up from their computer screen. It’s all too tempting to start making up a story in your head around why your partner hasn’t greeted you instead of starting with the facts. It might sound something like: “You never pay any attention to me!” Instead, try: “When I arrived home from work and said hello, you didn’t look up from your computer screen to greet me.” Starting with this objective observation and refraining from adding an interpretation makes it more likely the other person will ultimately understand the way you feel. Share how you feel. Building on this, one of the easiest ways to help the other person understand you from your frame of reference rather than their own is to actually share how you feel with them. It seems obvious but it’s where I often see people stumble. It’s trickier than it seems because when we’re running high on emotions, we tend to try to express our feelings by saying things like: “I’m sick of being treated like this!” or “I can’t stand this anymore!” rather than actually sharing how we feel. Start by asking yourself how “being treated like this” or “not standing it anymore” actually makes you feel. Does “being treated like this” make you feel sad? Does “not standing it anymore” make you feel angry? Or perhaps you’re feeling frustrated, anxious or confused? Sharing your feelings will help the other person empathise with you and create mutual understanding."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"business/2018/jun/01/eu-starts-retaliation-against-donald-trumps-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T10:54:16Z","webTitle":"EU opens WTO case against Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/01/eu-starts-retaliation-against-donald-trumps-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/01/eu-starts-retaliation-against-donald-trumps-steel-and-aluminium-tariffs","fields":{"headline":"EU opens WTO case against Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs","bodyText":"The European Union is pressing ahead with countermeasures in response to what it said was Donald Trump’s “pure protectionist” and “illegal” decision to impose trade tariffs on steel and aluminium. The EU has opened a case at the World Trade Organisation after the US imposed a 25% duty on European steel and a 10% duty on European aluminium on Friday morning. “We are not in a trade war, but we are in a very difficult situation caused by the United States,” said Cecilia Malmström, the EU trade commissioner. “I would not use the term ‘trade war’ because it has a psychological effect.” But she added: “The US is playing a dangerous game here.” She said the US claim that the tariffs were needed for national security was unjustified and no more than “pure protectionism”. The EU has not yet made final decisions on tit-for-tat measures on US products, although it has a list of goods it could hit with retaliatory tariffs, including classic American products such as Levi’s jeans, bourbon whiskey, cranberries and peanut butter. The European commission said it needed to consult with member state diplomats before announcing the goods that will be targeted. “We have not made final decisions on it, but we will use that list of course,” Malmström said. That final decision is expected within weeks, as officials insisted all EU member states backed Brussels. “All of them feel that at this point in time it is very important to maintain credibility,” said one EU source. Under WTO rules, EU retaliatory measures cannot come into force until 20 June at the earliest, but the list may take a little longer to go through the EU law-making process. In a two-pronged move, Malmström also announced that the EU was taking legal action against China in the WTO for “forcing” European companies seeking to do business there to disclose their technological secrets. Trump has also accused China of stealing US intellectual property. “If players in the world do not stick to the rule book the system might collapse and that is why we are challenging today both the US and China at the WTO,” said Malmstrom. It demonstrates that we are not choosing any sides, we stand for the mutilateral system, for rule-based global trade.” The EU measures were part of a swift reaction to Trump’s decision, described by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, as a mistake and the UK’s international trade secretary, Liam Fox, as “patently absurd”. The US imports €3.5bn (£3.06bn) of EU steel and aluminium and officials fear jobs are at stake, with worse to follow if the standoff intensifies. Markets shrugged off worries about trade war, with the main stockmarket indices in the UK, France and Germany rising, as Italy’s anti-EU parties succeeded in forming a government, avoiding a swift return to the polls that investors had feared. US stocks were also up, on better-than-expected jobs figures. Germany’s economy minister Peter Altmaier said on Friday: “We hope that the European response will result in a process of reflection in the USA.” He told the German broadcaster ARD that the EU may consider workingwith Mexico and Canada, which were also hit by the US tariffs. Bernd Lange, the German socialist MEP who chairs the European parliament’s international trade committee, said the tariffs were illegal and insisted the EU would put countermeasures in place, on “symbolic products like Harley-Davidson to make clear here is a red card.” Seeking to dial down the rhetoric, the EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said: “The European Union is not at war with anyone. We don’t want to be; for us this is out of the question … The European Union is a peace project, including on trade.” The EU recently announced the formal launch of trade talks with Australia and last year completed negotiations with Japan. She was speaking alongside China’s foreign affairs minister, Wang Yi, who said China and the EU were committed to a rules-based, multilateral global system. The pair were also discussing Iran and North Korea ahead of an EU-China summit in Beijing next month. Beyond the warm words, however, Brussels and Beijing remain at odds over the heavily subsidised Chinese steel that has depressed global prices. Mogherini acknowledged that “we have some issues” and the EU would continue to address the problem of overcapacity with China. Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House communications director, said there was always room to negotiate with Trump, but he was unlikely to be flattered into changing his mind. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Scaramucci, a personal friend of Trump, said the tariffs were a measure to correct the “uneven and unbalanced” trade system. “I am sure that there are chips on both sides that can get traded to make the problem go away,” he said. “There’s always room in a negotiation with him, but he’s also the type of person that will walk from a negotiation.” PA contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/jun/01/former-mobster-may-hold-clue-to-recovery-of-stolen-caravaggio","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T15:47:50Z","webTitle":"Former mobster may hold clue to recovery of stolen Caravaggio","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/01/former-mobster-may-hold-clue-to-recovery-of-stolen-caravaggio","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/01/former-mobster-may-hold-clue-to-recovery-of-stolen-caravaggio","fields":{"headline":"Former mobster may hold clue to recovery of stolen Caravaggio","bodyText":"Hopes of solving one of the worst art crimes in history have been reignited after Italian investigators announced they had received new information. Nativity with St Francis and St Lawrence, a Caravaggio masterpiece stolen in 1969, could have been hidden in Switzerland after it fell into the hands of organised crime, the head of Italy’s anti-mafia commission said on Thursday. The new lead on the whereabouts of the 17th-century painting – a depiction of the newborn Christ on a bed of straw, painted in the chiaroscuro technique – came from a former mobster-turned-informant, who revealed to Italian investigators that it had once been held by Gaetano Badalamenti, a Sicilian “boss of bosses” who was known as one of the ringleaders of an infamous heroin trafficking network in the US called the Pizza Operation. Investigators announced this week that Gaetano Grado, the mafia informant, said Badalamenti had been put in touch with an art dealer in Switzerland after obtaining the work – also known as The Adoration – from another mafia boss. Badalamenti was arrested in 1984 under the leadership of the then US attorney in New York, Rudolph Giuliani, and was accused and convicted of helping to bring $1.65bn worth of heroin into the US. He died in a Massachusetts hospital in 2004. The fate of The Nativity has been a subject of speculation for nearly half a century, ever since two criminals stole the painting from the Oratory of San Lorenzo in Palermo, where they used razors to cut the painting out of its frame. Among theories that have captured the imagination of art history buffs is that the painting – long believed to have been stolen by elements of the Sicilian mafia – may have been eaten by rats after being left to rot in a barn. But this week’s news suggested it could yet be recovered. Rosy Bindi, the head of Italy’s anti-mafia commission, said new evidence suggested The Nativity was intact and could be in Switzerland, after being sold to art traffickers there. “We have collected enough evidence to launch a new investigation and ask the collaboration of foreign authorities, especially to the Swiss ones,” said Bindi. “We hope to find it and bring it back to its home in Palermo.” The mafia has long been known to have an interest in stealing precious artwork and using it as a form of collateral. Caravaggio’s masterpiece was thought to have been painted by the old master in Rome and later moved to Sicily. Leoluca Orlando, the mayor of Palermo, who has helped transform the Sicilian capital from a mafia stronghold to a European capital of culture, said the theft of the painting had dealt a blow to the city at a time – in 1969 – when it was dominated by mobsters and godfathers. “Today this city has changed and is demanding back everything the mafia took away from it,” he said. “Even getting back a small piece of it would be considered a victory.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/blog/2018/jun/01/talking-horses-oaks-horse-racing-tips-and-reports-from-fillies-classic-day-at-epsom","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T16:10:20Z","webTitle":"Talking Horses: Forever Together victorious in Oaks for O'Brien clan","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/01/talking-horses-oaks-horse-racing-tips-and-reports-from-fillies-classic-day-at-epsom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/01/talking-horses-oaks-horse-racing-tips-and-reports-from-fillies-classic-day-at-epsom","fields":{"headline":"Talking Horses: Forever Together victorious in Oaks for O'Brien clan","bodyText":"5pm Forever Together lifts the Oaks for O’Brien family Chris Cook: Aidan O’Brien and his son Donnacha combined for Classic glory in Britain for the second time this year when Forever Together powered clear in the Oaks on Friday. The filly seemed to be the second-string from her stable behind Magic Wand, who beat her at Chester three weeks ago, but got comprehensive revenge for what now looks an unlucky defeat that day. The 19-year-old Donnacha O’Brien, who won the 2,000 Guineas on Saxon Warrior last month, lauded his father’s training skills. “When you’re riding one of his, you have a chance, it doesn’t matter what it is,” the jockey said. “He’s an absolute genius, he’s able to do things with these horses that I don’t understand. He tweaks little things with them and brings out massive improvement. I don’t know how he does it but I’m trying to learn as much as I can.” Beaten in all three starts before this race, Forever Together becomes the first maiden to win the Epsom contest since Sun Princess 35 years ago. Returned at 7-1, she had four and a half lengths in hand over the favourite, Godolphin’s Wild Illusion. The runner-up’s rider, William Buick, suggested she had not been comfortable on the downhill stretch of the course. On this rain-softened ground, the runners in both the Oaks and the Coronation Cup finished against the stands’ rail. However, the field for Saturday’s Derby is likely to stick to the far rail, after a false inside rail is taken down overnight. Cracksman delivered for favourite-backers at odds of 2-7 in the Coronation Cup but was made to work for it by the 33-1 rag Salouen, who pinched a big lead off the home turn under Silvestre de Sousa. It was only in the final strides that Cracksman poked his nose in front, Frankie Dettori having been hard at work for the previous two furlongs. “Cracksman was a bit sleepy today,” said Dettori, “but he does not enjoy galloping downhill and when I wanted to close the gap, I couldn’t. He felt lethargic, like he did in the Derby last year. “Silvestre got five lengths on me and, God, he made it hard work for me, but once we flattened out, the turbo kicked in. Then he started to motor and I thought I might still run out of time, but we got there.” Friday’s best bets Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course at Epsom, reported a “misty, dewy” start at the track earlier on Friday morning after a dry night, so the going report that is expected shortly could well be edging towards good-to-soft ground for the Oaks at 4.30 this afternoon. Nine fillies are due to go to post for the fillies’ Classic, where the unbeaten Perfect Clarity (4.30) looks like the value bet at around 7-1, while Cracksman, last year’s Champion Stakes winner, will be one of the shortest-priced favourites of the season as he attempts to see off five opponents in the Coronation Cup at 3.10. Elsewhere on the card, Donncha (2.35) is finally starting to slip down the weights and may repay his long-suffering supporters with an overdue victory, though his habit of finding all the trouble going is unlikely to make it an easy race for his backers to watch. Ajman King (3.45) and Kings Shield (5.15) should also go close, while True Belief (2.00) may have the edge in a competitive Woodcote Stakes at the top of the card."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/01/disabled-people-assisted-dying-safeguards-pressure","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T10:49:00Z","webTitle":"We’re told we are a burden.

No wonder disabled people fear assisted suicide","bodyText":"Opposition to assisted suicide – also called assisted dying – is characterised as being the preserve of the religious, stuffy and outdated, like religious opposition to gay marriage and abortion. In reality, some of the loudest voices opposing it are those of people with disabilities – because we have the most to fear. A poll done by Scope (a disability charity) showed that the majority of disabled people (64%) were concerned about moves to legalise assisted suicide. Arguments around the legality of suicide and the right to refuse treatment are often conflated with assisted suicide. Suicide is legal, and there is already a right to refuse treatment. People with mental capacity can also create an advance directive to ensure their wish to refuse treatment is respected in future. This leaves people often able to die on their own terms. What assisted dying advocates are requesting is to create a system in which it is legally and morally permissible for people to engage in a deliberate action designed to end someone else’s life. There are two main models for assisted suicide legislation: the American (Oregon), and the European (Belgium and the Netherlands). The laws in Oregon restrict assisted suicide to those who are terminally ill, with less than six months to live. The number of people dying this way has increased from 15 in 1998 to 143 in 2017. There is no obligation to establish whether the petitioner has a treatable mental health problem underlying their desire to die. Nor is there one to ensure that they are not under pressure from another person. It is difficult to even establish life expectancy. Jane Campbell – the former commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission – has spoken about fluctuations in her life expectancy and when it affects eligibility for assisted suicide, the stakes would be high. Some 5% of people in Oregon dying by assisted suicide cited financial pressures as a cause. Meanwhile, the number citing being a “burden on family/friends/caregivers” increased from 13% in 1998 to 55% in 2017. This tallies with Scope’s research that the majority of people with disabilities are concerned that legalising assisted suicide might lead to disabled people choosing it in order not to be a burden on others. Under austerity people who are disabled, ill or elderly are constantly taught that funding our health and social care is a burden – that we are inherently a burden. I am given so little of the social care I need that I am forced to rely on unpaid care from friends to survive – and more than 10% of the population are providing unpaid care. Legalising assisted suicide may cover these cracks but only by ending our lives. In the US, insurance companies are refusing to cover the costs of treatments, while offering to pay for assisted suicide – which quickly becomes a useful cost-saving measure. In Belgium euthanasia for “unbearable psychological suffering” is legal. Psychiatrists are tasked both with preventing suicide, and acting as the gatekeepers to euthanasia. Even the architect of Belgium’s assisted suicide legislation, Wim Distelmans, is concerned that people are being offered assisted suicide under this legislation too liberally while treatment options remain. As I know, mental illness can feel controlling, pervasive and hopeless – yet now the clouds have lifted, I am happy still to be alive. Advocates for assisted suicide argue for the existence of an advance directive so people, with dementia for example, could decide to have their life ended were they to lose mental capacity. In the Netherlands, a doctor was cleared after having the family of a woman with dementia hold her down so he could give her the lethal injection. Her refusal of euthanasia in the present day was weighed against her historical desires, and she died. Society’s priority should be to assist us to live, not to die. Provide a free social care system funded by progressive taxation that allows us to be productive, active community members. Increase NHS funding. Cut waiting lists – there are currently 4 million people awaiting treatment. Fund wheelchairs and assistive technology. Root out the disableism that leads two-thirds of people with disabilities to think that we’re seen as a burden on society. Only then can you come back to me and tell me that assisted suicide is no risk to disabled people. I can envisage no safeguards that would prevent people being pressured into ending their lives, by interpersonal, financial or social means. All I see is a system which divides lives, offering suicide prevention to some, and euthanasia to others. When I am low and feel I cannot go on with life as a disabled adult, those around me support me, affirm that my life has meaning, and help me continue to survive. Yes, my suffering is sometimes unbearable, but the faith my loved ones have in me makes me able to bear it. Don’t take that away, by legitimising assisted suicide as the right, and gracious choice. • Jamie Hale is a UK-based poet and artist, and an activist with groups such as Disabled People Against Cuts, and Not Dead Yet UK"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/01/boom-in-small-music-festivals-put-punters-at-risk-experts-say","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T21:51:13Z","webTitle":"Boom in small music festivals put punters at risk, experts say","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/boom-in-small-music-festivals-put-punters-at-risk-experts-say","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/01/boom-in-small-music-festivals-put-punters-at-risk-experts-say","fields":{"headline":"Boom in small music festivals put punters at risk, experts say","bodyText":"The boom in the number of small music festivals with inexperienced, cost-cutting organisers could be putting festivalgoers at risk, experts have warned. Last-minute cancellations which leave punters stranded, inadequate health and safety measures and an inability to cope with the British weather befalls some of the hundreds of festivals put on in the UK every year. Michael Baker, events coordinator of the UK festival awards and editor of Festival Insights said “greed and poor planning” can be a problem among some of the smaller festivals, where “overcrowding .....can lead to bigger problems”. Organisers have to have robust contingency plans in place for things going wrong but not all organisers take health and safety seriously enough, he said. The festival sector has exploded in the last 15 years. It is dominated by big promoters such as Live Nation, which puts on Download, Wireless, and has a stake in Festival Republic – the owner of Leeds and Reading, Latitude and Electric Picnic. But there are now hundreds of small and medium sized festivals, not all of which are well run, experts have said. “Some people try to circumvent some of that or cut corners and even sell too many tickets or not communicate as well as they should on the day. That leads to festivals getting cancelled and all manner of different disasters. There’s always a few high-profile cases a year,” said Barker. This year’s music festival season got off to a tragic start when Tommy Cowan, 20, and Georgia Jones, 18, died after attending the Mutiny festival in Portsmouth last week, amid warnings about a high-strength or bad batch of drugs. While attendees at Mutiny criticised the festival’s security and raised concerns about poor access to water, Luke Betts, the festival organiser vehemently denied this, saying his team went “above and beyond” the requirements set by the event’s licence. He later told The Portsmouth News that he and his team were devastated that two people had lost their lives at their event. Ralph Broadbent – who founded the Y Not festival when he was 18, and went on to run several other small to medium sized festivals, including Truck and Brownstock, before selling his company in 2016 to Broadwick Live – said it was a feeling he knew all too well. In 2013 at the Brownstock festival in Essex, Jonathan Graham, 33, consumed a substance known as 5-EAPB, also named Benzo Fury, which at the time was legal although still banned from the festival site. He later died in hospital. “People were physically sick when we heard the news,” Broadbent said. “It was the hardest thing that ever happened to us. It was just horrific, mostly for the family and friends of the man obviously, but it was horrible for our team too.” “There is nothing worse than putting on a festival and someone hurting themselves or worse. It’s every festival organiser’s worst nightmare and obviously you do everything you can to make it safe. Even at the most well-run festival in the world, there’s still a chance that someone will hurt themselves.” He said no organiser wants drugs on their site but there was no way to prevent this as people go to extraordinary lengths to smuggle drugs in. Some festivals invariably attract more drugs than others, which is often down to the music, but poor organisation can also play a part. Tony Graves, who leads the arts and festivals degree at De Montfort University, said the rise in popularity of festivals has meant there is a crowded market and tight margins, which could lead to potentially dangerous cost cutting. “Festivals cost a lot to put on because there are so many risks and the overheads are huge so some may struggle with getting health and safety right if they are struggling with budgets,” he said. “Margins also aren’t as big as people expect so people are really in it for the love and the passion but perhaps don’t realise the level of professionalism required.” Smaller festivals can fail if they “get too big for their boots” by attempting to grow too fast, he said. But, he added, even the most well organised festivals were not immune to problems. One festival on the southern coast of England suffered a huge fire in 2016 and the following year people fainted and had panic attacks while stuck in a nine-hour queue outside the festival grounds. A freelance festival producer, who asked not to be named, was working at the festival both years. She said: “The fire spread extremely quickly because of the wind and because the site was so hot and dry but the event control team handled the fire really well. Afterwards, they worked really hard to get information out to festivalgoers whose cars were destroyed and helped them all get home.” But it wasn’t the same the following year when increased security slowed things down at the entrance gate, although that wasn’t the only reason for the problems. “The bad weather that week pushed the schedule back a lot for setting up the festival. They weren’t ready to open the gates in my opinion but they went ahead and did it anyway,” the producer said. Drug testing is one way to help make all festivals safer, Baker said. The Loop, the UK’s only drug-testing charity, provides a service where qualified chemists test the potency of drugs a festivalgoer wishes to take and offers them hard reduction advice. Bestival, one of the UK’s biggest festivals, has announced it will introduce optional drug-testing this year for anyone who attends, after facing criticism last year when Louella Michie, 25, died after taking recreational drugs. Baker said: “People have a lot of knee-jerk reactions to drugs and how no one should take them and those who do get what they deserve, but I consider what the Loop do as being pretty undeniable in terms of its positive effect. I would like to see that rolled out to all festivals.” • This article was amended on 2 June 2018 to remove a statement that Live Nation has a stake in Glastonbury. It does not. Further amendments were made on 15 June 2018 in relation to Michael Baker’s quotations: to augment them to add additional context and to correct an earlier version which referred to smaller festivals “getting too big for their boots” by attempting to grow too fast. This was said by Tony Graves but misattributed to Baker."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/matt-leblanc-exits-top-gear-time-to-be-sent-to-the-scrapheap","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T09:51:08Z","webTitle":"No host, no hope: is it time for Top Gear to be sent to the scrapheap?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/matt-leblanc-exits-top-gear-time-to-be-sent-to-the-scrapheap","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/01/matt-leblanc-exits-top-gear-time-to-be-sent-to-the-scrapheap","fields":{"headline":"No host, no hope: is it time for Top Gear to be sent to the scrapheap?","bodyText":"Well, here we are again. For the third time in four years, Top Gear has found itself without its lead host. If you’re feeling optimistic, at least you can say that Matt LeBlanc resigned in a largely professional way. At least it was delivered through the proper channels, and sounded grateful. Given the way the last two Top Gear hosts ducked out – Chris Evans tweeted his resignation under a swirl of low ratings and digs from the tabloids, and Jeremy Clarkson effectively punched his way to a sacking – LeBlanc’s exit is a Debrett’s level masterclass in etiquette. In fairness to LeBlanc, his stay was never likely to be a long one. His appointment had the ring of novelty, like the BBC was overstretching to show that it still has muscle. Here was a legitimately famous man – admittedly most famous for a 20-year-old television programme, but still – who lives in America and spends six months of every year earning $4m a season on his CBS sitcom, Man With a Plan. Was he ever going to give that up in order to interview Jason Manford in an abandoned paint factory in Dunsfold? Would you? Of course you wouldn’t. But let’s not focus too hard on the exit. Let’s focus on the hole that has been left behind. Losing so many hosts in such a short time is not ideal. The appeal of Top Gear was that it always looked more fun to make than to watch. So if the people who make it can’t be bothered any more, then why should we? As far as I can tell, the BBC now has four options. The first is to replace LeBlanc with another celebrity. Maybe it can lure in Adam Sandler or Vin Diesel or Jay Leno with the promise of driving around the Alps in a supercar a few times a year. Maybe it will. But I’d argue that it shouldn’t. Big American stars are flighty and expensive, and they wouldn’t necessarily enjoy the grunt-work of putting together a weekly magazine show for BBC Two. Or maybe Top Gear could introduce a rotating panel of big-name guest hosts. But, again, I wouldn’t recommend this option. This is partly because star quality is never what the show has been about. Some of the filmed segments might enjoy a bit of razzle-dazzle, but it is always juxtaposed with the slapdash make-do-and-mend nature of the studio segments. The heart of Top Gear isn’t the car reviews, it’s the knowledge that the everyone on camera has just been drinking crap tea from a polystyrene cup while hiding from drizzle in a caravan. Sacrificing that for a succession of tentpole names would be a mistake. Also, Have I Got News For You has guests hosts, and Have I Got News For You is terrible. Alternatively, they could just let the existing hosts get on with it. Over the past couple of years, Chris Harris and Rory Reid have developed a nice little chemistry of their own, with Harris as the bone-deep car nerd and Reid as the excitable child. Perhaps they have what it takes to shoulder the series alone? After all, don’t forget that it took a few years for Clarkson, Hammond and May to properly bed in. The BBC has always been much better at developing talent than shipping it in, so it would make sense to just hand Top Gear to them to see what happens. Sure, it might not initially be the ratings smash of old, but the pair could take their time and build it back into something that fits their respective skillsets. The result of this would be a newer, better, more authentic Top Gear that might well regain some of the show’s former glory. Or they could just ditch it altogether. Top Gear has become a liability, so they could just bin it and move on. In fact, yes, let’s just go with that one. Great. Decision made. Thanks Top Gear. The door’s that way."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/01/bill-browder-interview-i-found-way-take-on-putin-hes-really-sore","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T14:35:26Z","webTitle":"Bill Browder: I found a way to challenge Putin.

He's really sore about it","bodyText":"The knock on the door of his Madrid hotel room came at 9.40am on Wednesday morning. Two Spanish national police officers and the hotel’s general manager stood apologetic in the corridor: “Mr Browder, I’m afraid you’re under arrest.” Ten minutes later Bill Browder, an American-born financier and arguably the Kremlin’s No 1 foreign enemy, was in the squad car tweeting furiously on the way to the police station. He was being detained on an arrest warrant issued by Russia, plainly intended as the first step in his eventual extradition to Moscow. “The Russian government doesn’t like me; Vladimir Putin doesn’t like me,” says Browder, now safely back in his adopted home city of London. “Why? Because I came up with a new way to deal with his abusive behaviour that seems to have a disproportionate effect on him. He’s really, really sore about it.” For a decade, until he was deported in 2005, Browder lived in Moscow and ran Russia’s most successful investment fund. Soon afterwards, a small group of corrupt officials effectively hijacked his fund, Hermitage Capital Management, and used it to perpetrate a massive tax fraud, stealing $230m. Three years later, Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer hired by Browder, uncovered the money trail. He was thrown into jail, denied medical treatment – he suffered from gallstones and pancreatitis – and in 2009 was beaten to death by guards in his cell. Aged 37, he left a wife and two young sons. Browder was horrified. Since those responsible were high-ranking officials in the interior ministry and FSB security services, there was zero chance of obtaining justice in Russia. Instead, he launched an ambitious campaign to persuade first the US, then a lengthening list of other countries, to hit where it hurts. “It’s a kleptocracy,” he says. “And stealing lots and lots of money, they have to keep it safe somewhere and go spend it somewhere. By coming up with the idea of imposing visa bans, freezing assets, denying access to banks ... It puts that whole model at risk.” The US Magnitsky Act, naming 18 corrupt officials, became law in 2012, and similar legislation has been passed in Canada, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Gibraltar and, early last month, in the UK. Seven more countries – Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Australia, South Africa, Ukraine – are on course to follow. “But Putin is a man who always has to retaliate when he feels slighted,” says Browder, sipping mineral water in a north London cafe. “So ... he’s tried a number of things against me.” Far worse things than arrest tend to happen to Russians who annoy Putin’s Kremlin. Britain “woke up to the dangers of Russia” in March, Browder said, when Sergei and Julia Skripal fell victim to a brazen assassination attempt in Salisbury using a military grade nerve agent. “But look ... Alexander Perepilichnyy, who was a whistleblower in the Magnitisky case, ‘mysteriously’ dropped dead in Surrey in 2012 – except there was nothing mysterious about it: he was murdered. Alexander Litvinenko, poisoned in 2006 ... There are more.” With foreigners, however, it’s more complicated. “If I’m killed, it would create a massive international political scandal, almost an act of war, and they know that,” says Browder. “So they would like to kill me in a way they can get away with. “If I die in a prison in Russia, they they can say: ‘Oh, he slipped in the shower.’ That’s their goal, and their main method is to abuse the mechanisms of international law. That’s what this Madrid business was about.” Browder – who was in Madrid to meet José Grinda, an anti-corruption prosecutor, in connection with a money-laundering investigation – was released barely two hours after his arrest. “They looked a bit disappointed,” he said. “But they contacted Interpol, and Interpol said sorry, you have to let the guy go.” Nonetheless, the warrant executed in Spain on Wednesday was Russia’s sixth targeting Browder in as many years, despite a 2013 Interpol decision that they were “predominantly political” so should not be acted upon by the international police organisation’s member countries. Interpol said on Friday that the latest non-compliant Russian request for cooperation in detaining Browder was deleted from its central databases in October 2017, and should also have been deleted from those of its members - suggesting the error was the Spanish police’s. But the system, Browder says, needs reform: “Interpol was set up to catch fugitives, not act like the long arm of Putin going after his enemies.” A German MEP has written to Interpol demanding it deny Russia access to its network if it continues to abuse it by unilaterally circulating requests relating to the campaigner, and a broader campaign is being organised. Browder is heartened, though, that attitudes to Russia appear to be hardening, at least in Britain, after the Skripal case. Parliament is clearly “seething”, he said, and Theresa May’s speech on the incident was “extremely tough. But now she needs to follow up with action.” The Chelsea football club owner, Roman Abramovich, may have taken up Israeli citizenship this week because of his UK visa problems, but “even assuming that’s policy, does ‘not renewing a visa’ measure up against a chemical weapons attack?” Having himself faced death threats, Browder finds western agonising over the “niceties” of whether or not the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko should have gone along with the Ukrainian secret service’s plan to fake his own death this week to be absurd. “Far too many people have been killed by Putin already,” he says. “If you ask me whether I prefer a purist approach towards the information war or having Mr Babchenko dead, I know my answer. Russia is going to make stuff up no matter what. We should just save lives where we can and debunk their nonsense.” Browder says he was initially a fan of Putin, who “came in promising to get rid of the 22 oligarchs who had stolen 40% of Russia, impoverishing everybody so they could buy their villas and yachts and jets and so on. But then it became clear what his goal really was.” And so Browder finds himself a hedge fund CEO turned human rights activist, campaigning against the man he calls “the biggest oligarch of all”. Magnitsky’s widow, Natasha, collaborates with him, and Browder is working on US college applications for his late lawyer’s son. “He had such integrity,” Browder says of Magnitsky. “He could easily have done what everybody else does: cut a deal. But he didn’t. A good man who died, because he worked for me. You don’t forget that.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/01/justice-secretary-said-he-would-get-macho-if-parole-boss-didnt-resign","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T12:40:30Z","webTitle":"Parole boss quit after justice secretary 'threatened to get macho'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/01/justice-secretary-said-he-would-get-macho-if-parole-boss-didnt-resign","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/01/justice-secretary-said-he-would-get-macho-if-parole-boss-didnt-resign","fields":{"headline":"Parole boss quit after justice secretary 'threatened to get macho'","bodyText":"The former Parole Board chief Nick Hardwick has accused the justice secretary of chasing headlines and compromising the integrity of the justice system over his handling of the case of the serial sex attacker John Worboys. In an interview with the Guardian, Hardwick recounted the tense moment David Gauke leaned on him to vacate his role as chair of the Parole Board, warning he did not want to have to “get macho about it”. Hardwick suggested Gauke had been “weak” during his short time as justice secretary – having only taken on the post in January – and “wobbled” over a decision to mount a judicial review against a now overturned decision to release Worboys from prison. There initially had been calls for Gauke to launch a judicial review but he declined. “Well, I think it is true to say that he wobbled quite a lot in all of this. He was thinking about the next day’s headlines a lot,” Hardwick said of Gauke’s procrastination. “The justice system has more to fear from a weak justice secretary than from a strong one.” Former black-cab driver Worboys, 60, who now goes by the name John Radford, was jailed indefinitely in 2009 with a minimum term of eight years after being found guilty of 19 offences, including rape, sexual assault and drugging late-night passengers, committed against 12 victims. It emerged in January he was to be released after spending 10 years in jail – a decision immediately met with outrage by his former victims among others. But in March, after two of Worboys’ alleged victims forced a judicial review, the high court quashed the decision and ordered a fresh Parole Board hearing. On the same day, Hardwick’s “resignation” was confirmed. Recounting the moment Gauke urged him to resign, Hardwick said the two men went repeatedly back and forth – the justice secretary insisting Hardwick should go, Hardwick denying it was necessary. “He then said, ‘I don’t want to get macho about it.’ Actually, he said it twice,” Hardwick said. “It’s not a phrase that strikes terror into your heart. I think it would have meant him flapping at me. In the end, it was not possible to remain if the justice secretary is saying you’ve got to go. So I said, all right then.” Hardwick said there was a stronger case for Gauke to resign than him but stopped short of saying that was what should have happened. “I don’t particularly think either of us should have gone,” he said. “The last thing the MoJ needs is a new justice secretary. There have been six since 2010.” The most controversial ruling the judges made in the review was that the Parole Board panel should have considered all the cases left on file – the alleged crimes with which Worboys had not been charged. Hardwick said he now accepted that the board should have taken the allegations into account, but he insisted that neither he nor the panel believed they were allowed to do so. But he also urged caution over this approach. “People ought to be more questioning about some of the issues in the Worboys case. “OK, he’s a horrible bloke, but what do we really think about this business of going into these offences of which he hasn’t been convicted? That ought to be a matter for a very anxious discussion if you care about justice. “And are the circumstances in this case exceptional enough to warrant it? We aren’t anxious enough about preserving some of these basic principles.” Ultimately, Hardwick said, his sacking has compromised the integrity of the justice system. “The Parole Board is a court and there is a real problem if the executive, as in the government, gets rid of the head of that body because they have made an unpopular decision. I don’t think I was got rid of because we made the wrong decision – which I accept that we did. I was got rid of because we made an unpopular decision.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/01/brenda-the-civil-disobedience-penguin-is-back-the-great-barrier-reef-isnt","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T07:24:42Z","webTitle":"Brenda the Civil Disobedience Penguin is back.

Her daughter, 11-year-old Denishar Woods, is due to return home from Perth Children’s hospital on Saturday night. It has been almost three months since Denishar, buoyed with the promise of McDonald’s ice cream, volunteered to turn off the metal garden tap at Harrison’s public housing home in the Perth suburb of Beldon on 3 March and received an electric shock that stopped her heart. In that time, she has regained the ability to say one word — “mum” — and communicates through blinking. “Maybe one day she might be able to say a few words other than ‘mum’ … it takes so much energy that it’s been three weeks since I have heard her speak at all,” Harrison said. On Wednesday, Harrison met the state’s housing minister, Peter Tinley, who told her he “fully supported” her attempt to get an ex-gratia payment from the state to cover some of the cost of providing appropriate care for Denishar. “I repeated my assurance that the department of communities and I will do all we can to support and assist Ms Harrison and her family, as one of our tenants, within the constraints that we operate under,” Tilney said in a statement. It was a positive meeting, Harrison said, but one that does not lessen the task at hand. With the exception of three days a week of respite care, she faces being a full-time carer for Denishar on top of looking after her seven other children, six of whom live at home. And while she’s grateful the department was able to provide her with a new house, it has one fewer bedroom and bathroom than their previous home and the loss of space, particularly when manoeuvring the bulky equipment needed to provide Denishar with a reasonable quality of life, is felt. Denishar has made a miraculous recovery, considering the original prognosis. She was shocked with up to 230 volts of electricity that flowed through the metal tap to the wet pavement, causing a catastrophic brain injury. She was medically dead, revived, and not expected to survive. Harrison was told that if the year six student did survive, she would remain a vegetable. Instead she is able to begin the slow, hard process of rehabilitation. “I feel like Denishar is being looked at like she has gotten better,” Harrison told Guardian Australia. “She has beaten life support, so that means she is OK, she is a normal girl. And Denishar is not normal, she is not OK. She is not walking, she is not talking, she is not eating, everything in her life is gone. Now she is just lying there in her shell trying to find a way to communicate with us.” EnergySafety is still investigating the electrical fault that caused Harrison’s house to suddenly become electrified. Harrison said she had gone outside to hose off her front pavers, and called inside for her oldest daughter to turn the kettle on. That caused the power to go out, so Harrison put down the hose and went to the metal electricity meter box, assuming the safety switch had been tripped and she could flip it back on. Instead she got a mild electric shock and heard a constant crackling “like power lines when they get wet”. She called the Western Australian housing authority to request for an electrician to be sent out and, after being told to expect one later that day or the next morning, decided to take her family to wait in a nearby McDonald’s until the house had been declared safe. “I said, ‘Can one of you turn the tap off?’ and Denishar went, I think because she was excited about getting an ice cream,” Harrison said. Then Denishar screamed, and Harrison ran to help. “Her little body was pulsing on to the tap, like gripped on to it,” she said. “And then I have ended up on the pavement myself for 15 minutes … the next thing I knew the cops were lifting me up. I had passed out. That’s when my daughters were screaming to me: ‘mum, Denishar’s dead, Denishar is dead’.” For now, Harrison’s priority is making sure Denishar is given the best available support, even if paying for that means suing the state. Her lawyer, Stewart Levitt, has begun compiling a suit. “To get this little girl home, I can’t do it on Centrelink payments,” she said. “She deserves to have anything she needs to have the best chance at rehabilitation.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/quiptic/968","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T23:00:01Z","webTitle":"Quiptic crossword No 968","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/quiptic/968","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/quiptic/968","fields":{"headline":"Quiptic crossword No 968","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/01/japan-charges-dropped-cronyism-scandal-threateningshinzo-abe","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T05:13:10Z","webTitle":"Japan: charges dropped in cronyism scandal threatening to bring down Shinzo Abe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/01/japan-charges-dropped-cronyism-scandal-threateningshinzo-abe","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/01/japan-charges-dropped-cronyism-scandal-threateningshinzo-abe","fields":{"headline":"Japan: charges dropped in cronyism scandal threatening to bring down Shinzo Abe","bodyText":"Dozens of Japanese officials have escaped charges over a cronyism scandal that threatened prime minister Shinzo Abe’s grip on power. The scandal relates to the finance ministry’s sale of public land at a huge discount to a nationalistic school operator with links to the prime minister’s wife, Akie, and subsequent tampering with official records about the arrangement. Prosecutors in Osaka considered criminal complaints against 38 people amid accusations of breach of trust and document falsification. However, prosecutors said on Thursday they would not indict the officials, including former tax agency chief Nobuhisa Sagawa, who testified to parliament that Abe did not order the document changes. The decision will come as a relief to Abe, who has previously promised to resign if he or his wife were shown to be connected to the 85% land discount, which the government has argued reflected the cost of removing waste from the site. Abe also faces a party leadership vote in September. However, the decision is unlikely to mark the end of the scandal. A finance ministry investigative report is due to be released early next week and opposition parties are promising to continue pursuing suspicions of cronyism. Despite the lack of action against officials, prosecutors have previously indicted the private school operators at the centre of the controversy. Yasunori Kagoike, who headed the nationalistic school group known as Moritomo Gakuen, and his wife are accused of fraudulently claiming public subsidies. Moritomo Gakuen’s existing kindergarten attracted attention for requiring its young pupils to bow before portraits of the imperial family, sing the national anthem daily, and learn the 1890 imperial rescript on education, which emphasises sacrifice for country. Akie Abe was set to serve as honorary principal for the proposed new primary school, but stepped down in February last year when questions were raised about the land deal. The government suffered a big hit to its popularity in the wake of the scandal, but Abe led his centre-right coalition to victory in a snap election he called late last year amid growing security threats from North Korea and a fragmented opposition. The issue returned to the headlines in March this year when the finance ministry admitted that it had removed references to Shinzo and Akie Abe before submitting records to lawmakers investigating the sale. One document originally quoted Moritomo Gakuen as saying the first lady had recommended the primary school project “move forward because it is a good plot of land”. Prosecutors judged the changes had not substantially altered the character of the documents, local media reported."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/01/cat-power-moon-pix-live-review-finally-calibrated-nostalgia","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T05:41:16Z","webTitle":"Cat Power: Moon Pix live review – finely calibrated nostalgia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/cat-power-moon-pix-live-review-finally-calibrated-nostalgia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/01/cat-power-moon-pix-live-review-finally-calibrated-nostalgia","fields":{"headline":"Cat Power: Moon Pix live review – finely calibrated nostalgia","bodyText":"Cat Power’s Sydney Opera House concert is both an anniversary and a reunion. Moon Pix was released 20 years ago and Power (Chan Marshall) is here to play it with original collaborators Mick Turner (guitar) and Jim White (drums) of The Dirty Three. Presumably in full, in order, as is customary for such anniversary gigs. Yet that is an awful lot of rules for a woman with a punk-rock penchant for binning the rulebook. The Moon Pix recording trio played some fabled small-venue gigs in Australia in 1999, but none since. Add to this Marshall’s connection to our country – “I found joy I had never felt [in Australia]” – and you get a room of already ardent fans feeling very much like the chosen ones. The thrill is laced with a little incredulity and a lot of pride that “our” Moon Pix is now officially atop the “very important album” plinth. Because if a string section-enhanced Opera House concert hall celebration doesn’t formalise its classic album status, what could? Moon Pix is a perfect storm of the intensely idiosyncratic styles of Marshall, White and Turner. Its longevity is due to a purity at its source that has never dried up, and never will, bottled and corked for eternity by a part-time recording engineer at Sing Sing studio in the Melbourne suburb of Cremorne. Even now, all grown up, its songs radiate the frailty and will to survive of a baby giraffe’s first faltering steps. Joining the original trio tonight is Belinda Woods, who played flute on He Turns Down in 1998, and three string players (Judith Hamann, Lizzy Welsh and Erkki Veltheim). They’re performing the arrangements of Berlin-based Australian Ned Collette who himself alternates between piano and guitar. Leaving Marshall to just sing. A long minute ticks by, however, after she about-turns and walks offstage, having only just come out, leaving the band to marinate longer than the recipe called for in the looped sample that opens American Flag. Yet it’s time well spent. The pause lets us lower ourselves more cautiously into “the type of memories that turn your bones to glass” (thanks, Bill Callahan). Judging by the median age here of around 40, we became obsessed with this album deep in our messy years. There’s a fair bit to process. Though we share the experience of nostalgia only; the togetherness stops there. Even if we could turn to hear the “Moon Pix saved me” utterance of the stranger by our side, it would seem at worst confected and at best dreary, because memories only come in colour if they’re our own. Marshall returns, sheet music in hand. The first four songs are overwhelming– as in remind-yourself-to-breathe kind of overwhelming. Turner and White play so empathically and their sound, via The Dirty Three but also hundreds of Moon Pix listens, has weathered into something utterly iconic. Playing together, it’s as if they’re in possession of a finely calibrated heat dial, which, although they play with more grace and nuance than fire, can be spun from cool to hot in a flash. With just a music stand to shield her from view, Marshall clutches at the fabric of her black velvet dress. Her relationship with the microphone appears to be love, hate and all the complexities in between. She pulls back or sings into it sideways; holds her hands either side of her mouth – as if shouting – or just one hand up, as if whispering a secret. The microphone, of course, is impervious to the gestures but we are not. Her evident anxiety is contained, though, where once it spilt everywhere. When Say begins – my “Moon Pix saved me” song if you must know – White brings the weather, summoning the thunderstorm sample with muted drum rolls, and Turner plays its lullaby loop with requisite tenderness. Here, as in other songs, Collette leaves ample stark space in the arrangement, aware the mood would be bankrupted by lushness. During Metal Heart she wanders off – physically and mentally. Her delivery is distracted and we remember it’s impossible for her to fake it. The cheap seats lead the charge in yelling nice things. “We love you Chan,” says a woman, mispronouncing her name. It hurts when she skips lines from Colors And The Kids – hesitant to look its sadness dead in the eye? – and trails off forlornly with “you are such a funny bear” – but Marshall can’t merely perform her songs; she must crawl inside and sing from within to make them alive, and who here knows what that song’s skin feels like on hers? If some lines she wrote a lifetime ago don’t feel right, or if she has to press emergency eject earlier than the composition demands, well OK. At this point in the Cat Power journey of fandom you know that swallowing, not wallowing in, your frustration that your “moment” has not precisely plunged the bullseye you circled out for it before you arrived will get you nowhere. You must move on, stay open and let yourself be cracked apart by other songs instead, which tonight are Say, No Sense, Moonshiner and Back Of Your Head. She returns solo, a tea label pirouetting from a mug and, amid a lot of throat-clearing, plays Maybe Not and I Don’t Blame You, her shot-with-air voice as astonishing as ever. The band returns for The Dirty Three song Great Waves, Good Woman and The Greatest. Now she’s relaxed, mimicking an Australian accent and outsourcing band introductions to the crowd, chuffed to yell out each one. “I am so honoured to have been invited to play with Jim White and Mick Turner again,” she says. “I don’t know how many of y’all knew me when I was crazy … I hope that you find the same blessings coming to you. It’s a moment to take notice that we are doing well. Keep trucking.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/02/after-a-week-of-political-theatrics-the-energy-wars-remind-us-this-drama-costs","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T20:00:01Z","webTitle":"After a week of political theatrics, the energy wars remind us this drama costs | Katharine Murphy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/02/after-a-week-of-political-theatrics-the-energy-wars-remind-us-this-drama-costs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/02/after-a-week-of-political-theatrics-the-energy-wars-remind-us-this-drama-costs","fields":{"headline":"After a week of political theatrics, the energy wars remind us this drama costs","bodyText":"Some political weeks careen – this past one being a case in point. By week’s end, all eyes were on One Nation. As blow-ups go, a live-action fracture playing out on evening subscription television was a solid A-plus for spectacle. When it comes to Pauline Hanson, we’ve seen this trajectory before – a tearful but plucky leader of a self-styled righteous political insurgency let down by the blokes who are only in public life for the perks. So hard to get good help these days. Don’t cry for me, Argentina, I will survive. Moving stuff. Of course this latest implosion is serious for One Nation and the Coalition. One Nation loses leverage in the Senate, and the government is again hostage to chaos from populist forces in the upper house. Poor old Mathias Cormann. What a time. But frankly, the government would have been relieved over the past 48 hours to play second fiddle to a more epic foot-stamping, hair-tossing, door-slamming soap opera, after a week where it suffered its own bout of internal fracture and free-range chaos. The week began promisingly when the government gained a Senate number, Steve Martin, in Tasmania, but then things got choppy. Barnaby Joyce was dispatched on medical leave after all hell broke loose when it was revealed he’d been paid $150,000 for a tell-all TV interview. Michaelia Cash was subpoenaed to give evidence in court, and Greg Hunt washed up on the front page of the tabloids after an expletive-ridden confrontational tirade against a local mayor. For the record, bad Greg was very sorry. Spectacle also gave way to fractures. The government had to pull its own legislation imposing more regulation on the live sheep trade because it wasn’t sure it could keep its own numbers together, given several Liberals now favour a phase-out and ban, and Sussan Ley made it known to colleagues that she was of a mind to cross the floor. Then there was energy, bubbling away in the background. We’ve been circling around the crux of this debate for months, and after a long period of suspended animation, we are now moving towards a crunch point. Tony Abbott made two incursions this week, and his forays cross over. Abbott confronted the energy minister in the Coalition party room on Tuesday, making it clear he wanted the national energy guarantee to come back to the party room before Josh Frydenberg meets with state energy ministers in August. Internal critics say Frydenberg does not currently have a settled mandate from colleagues to deal with the states. They say the party room has not yet agreed to an emissions reduction target for electricity of 26% on 2005 levels by 2030 – at least not one with a linear trajectory. They want another discussion. Frydenberg doesn’t, given talk can only mean trouble. He insists he got the required sign-off last October, and will have another party room discussion on the enabling legislation for the policy after he’s reached a deal with the states. The second Abbott fly-by concerned the future of his factional ally, the outspoken conservative MP Craig Kelly. Kelly and Abbott have led the internal pushback on climate and energy policy. Kelly is now facing a preselection challenge in his Sydney seat of Hughes. Moderates want the seat, and right now, they seem determined to take it. With Kelly’s future in peril, the former prime minister used his regular radio spot on 2GB this week to deliver a public warning to Malcolm Turnbull and moderates in the NSW Liberal party: come after old mate Craig and there will be war. Now this could be all just a bit of quaint rhetoric, a bit of sound and fury from the usual suspects signalling nothing terribly much, except it’s dangerous, and difficult when their common obsession – energy policy – is hanging around unresolved. Two parliamentary sitting weeks remain between now and when Frydenberg will meet his state colleagues and try to get a deal on the national energy guarantee, and Kelly is very clear about what he wants to happen in energy policy. He told me this week he wants Frydenberg to agree to a national energy guarantee where emissions reduction doesn’t happen until the back part of the decade to 2030. Kelly wants to hit pause on meaningful emissions reduction for the immediate future, and lock his preferred “hockey stick” trajectory in for a decade. That’s right: 10 years. “That would be peace,” Kelly told me this week on my podcast. There’s a significant problem with Kelly’s version of peace – it’s winner take all. It would blow up bipartisanship on the policy. Given the states are already concerned about the weak emissions target, Frydenberg going to his colleagues in the Coag energy council in August with Kelly’s proposition would risk scuttling the deal at the first hurdle. Labor federally is signalling it wants a deal on the national energy guarantee if there’s a deal to be had, but I cannot in any universe see Labor copping one that locks in a lowball target and trajectory for a decade. Doing a deal with the Coalition at 26% with a mechanism to ratchet up the level of ambition in emissions reduction is already difficult for Labor. Politically that’s a complicated message to sell: we support the mechanism but not the target. It leaves them vulnerable to attack from the left. So where does this leave us? If the rebels insist on Frydenberg locking in behind their preferred peace model, he risks killing the policy at Coag or in the parliament. If he stares down the rebels, does the deal with Coag and with Labor on terms they can accept, then the government might fracture. In our conversation this week Kelly was clear that crossing the floor was an option – for him and for others. He says what separates the Liberals from Labor is the “right” to cross the floor. “There will be no member of the Coalition that rules out crossing the floor.” He’s aware a bunch of important players are calling for certainty in energy policy, but says, “I’m not as wedded to certainty as others.” Add the extra piquancy that the person frontrunning the energy rebellion is currently facing a preselection challenge that he seems likely to lose unless there is some very high-level intervention. It’s possible that set of circumstances might make a person a little less concerned about consequences. Out in the real world, it’s blindingly obvious that Frydenberg should ignore the internal naysayers and just push for the settlement with the states and with Labor. Pretty much every stakeholder in the country is crying out for that settlement. The government has significant political cover to get this done. But imagine if you will – in our combat-addled and punch-drunk political culture, where protagonists look for every cheap point they can score, where tribalism routinely trumps sense – the level of courage it would take for Frydenberg and, more pertinently, the prime minister to say to the naysayers in their own ranks: we are not going to manufacture conflict, we are going to put the national interest first, and to do that, we need bipartisan agreement. Frydenberg has thus far attempted to manage the complicated internal dynamics with charm and by attrition, avoiding all direct confrontation to keep the process moving. But if his own dissidents follow up the talk with action and bring the fight before the winter break, it can’t be avoided. Over the next few months a number of people are going to have to make choices that determine Australia’s energy future.

According to this notion, the definition of feminism is gender loyalty: women supporting other women, no matter what. Any woman who criticises the politics of Margaret Thatcher or Sarah Huckabee is, by this logic, somehow betraying feminism. What this fails to take into account is that women can be the fiercest upholders of gendered oppressions. Thatcher’s victories were no wins for womankind: she had no interest at all, as she often declared, in fighting for her sex. She was, rather, the exceptional woman, the woman who did patriarchy better than men did. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Spanish poet and playwright Federico García Lorca witnessed the rise of the fascists and the devastating civil war in his country. In a homophobic world, his homosexuality was a scandal and a shame. In 1936, Lorca was tortured and executed by fascist troops. According to the book Federico García Lorca and the Culture of Male Homosexuality, one of his executioners boasted: “We left him in a ditch and I fired two bullets into his arse for being a queer.” Even before his death, Lorca was well aware of the murderousness of patriarchy. It’s unsurprising that, like Tennessee Williams, he often wrote about the oppression of women: his tortured relationship with his own sexuality gave him a unique insight into the mutilations that patriarchy inflicts on the feminine psyche. In The House of Bernarda Alba, Lorca looks squarely at the tyranny of the patriarchal woman. Bernarda, the newly bereaved widow of a wealthy man and the mother of five daughters, declares eight years of mourning, effectively imprisoning her daughters in the house. There are no men in this play, nor are there in Patricia Cornelius’s ingenious and powerful adaptation. In their absence, the wounds that men inflict move to centre stage. Cornelius has moved the action from a rural Spanish village to the outback of Western Australia, where the family of a wealthy mining magnate have returned from his funeral. Cornelius’s story, like Lorca’s, is a compelling parable about the horrors of sexual repression. With her director and collaborator Leticia Cáceres, Cornelius has done the seemingly impossible: rendered Lorca’s story in a contemporary Australian context, remaining true to its molten core, while at the same time avoiding the pitfalls that must have beset the whole project. The text is poetic and resonant in ways that parallel Lorca, without being confined by the original play. This production is notable for both its boldness and restraint. Cáceres has concentrated on Lorca’s austerity, creating a stark frame that heightens the volatile emotions that drive the action. Bernarda here is Bernadette, played with a steely focus by Melita Jurisic. There are four daughters instead of five – Marti (Candy Bowers), Angela (Peta Brady), Magda (Bessie Holland) and Adele (Emily Milledge). The final two players are Bernadette’s senile mother, Maria (Sue Jones), who is kept locked up in the back of the house, and the housekeeper, Penelope (Julie Forsyth). This is by any measure a first-class cast, and their performances don’t disappoint. Jurisic and Forsyth together on stage are alone worth the price of admission. Cáceres’s direction is almost geometric: she creates a formal movement of bodies across the space that seems to grow organically out of the action. The cast is supported by a production that melds a hieratic, formal aesthetic with tropes of outback Australia. Marg Horwell’s witty set uses air conditioning units and mosquito zappers as bling – the zappers become a kind of chandelier – and it is sumptuously lit by Rachel Burke. Irene Vela’s solemn, elegiac music and Jethro Woodward’s sound design are deeply textured, summoning the world beyond the claustrophobic house. The result is remarkably beautiful theatre that looks squarely at the murderous silence at the core of oppression. • Melbourne Theatre Company’s production of The House of Bernarda Alba is showing at the Fairfax Theatre, Arts Centre Melbourne, until 7 July"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/02/why-adam-giles-threw-his-phone-in-the-pool-former-police-chiefs-trial-reveals-all","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T01:43:10Z","webTitle":"Why Adam Giles threw his phone in the pool: former police chief's trial reveals all","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/02/why-adam-giles-threw-his-phone-in-the-pool-former-police-chiefs-trial-reveals-all","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/02/why-adam-giles-threw-his-phone-in-the-pool-former-police-chiefs-trial-reveals-all","fields":{"headline":"Why Adam Giles threw his phone in the pool: former police chief's trial reveals all","bodyText":"At the height of Australia’s most bizarre political crisis, when the Northern Territory chief minister Adam Giles was rolled by his colleagues and refused to leave, the besieged leader stood in his living room and said senior police were behind it all. “The allegations that have been coming out about senior members of the police force actively running a coup, or a campaign, in cahoots with some alleged politicians is a significant problem,” Giles said. He thought his phone was tapped. He had thrown it in the pool. Giles never publicly explained what – or who – he was talking about. Over the past 40 days, the trial of the former NT police commissioner John McRoberts has heard evidence that shed new light on certain pivotal events in the months before the botched coup. McRoberts was on Thursday found guilty of perverting the course of justice and faces a likely jail term for deflecting and frustrating a fraud case against travel agent Xana Kamitsis. Two events, more than any other, fuelled the political drama in late 2014 and early 2015. The first was the arrest of Kamitsis. The second was the discovery that McRoberts was her secret lover. Delicate timing One morning in November 2014, police raided the office of Latitude Travel, a quiet suburban shopfront next to a Chinese takeaway. The arrest of Kamitsis was quick, calculated and humiliating, splashed all ever the news. And it took place without the commissioner’s knowledge. In the months prior, the NT supreme court heard, McRoberts had repeatedly interfered with a fraud investigation. Kamitsis was the test case, one of 27 travel agents suspected of rorting a government pensioner concession travel scheme, by invoicing the health department for expensive flight costs then buying cheaper fares and pocketing the difference – to the tune of about $5m. When McRoberts learned Kamitsis was a target, he admitted he knew her, but not the extent of the relationship. The court heard that, when told she would likely go to jail, McRoberts responded: “If she has to be charged, she has to be charged.” And then he went about protecting her. There were a number of extraordinary aspects to McRoberts’s involvement in the case. One was that he became involved in a hands-on way in the first place. Another was that he told Giles and other senior figures there was not enough evidence to lay charges, instead pushing for a civil resolution, which would allow the agents to repay the money without the need for lengthy court cases. The strategy upset members of the fraud squad, who had taken their brief of evidence to a prosecutor for advice, and been told the case was solid. McRoberts also blocked the execution of a search warrant that had been approved by a judge. Delays bred frustration. The case was whispered about in out-of-the-way Darwin cafes, where politicians, lawyers and cops in the small-town city were unlikely to overhear the gossip. “Have you heard of Xana Kamitsis?” one source asked. All anyone knew was she was a socialite and the chair of community watch group CrimeStoppers. They figured that must be why progress on the case had been slow. When Kamitsis was raided, television crews were waiting for the money shot, the prominent party host in handcuffs. The police media unit later supplied unblurred photographs of the arrest to the NT News. When the raid began, McRoberts was on a plane. Mark Payne, one of three rotating deputy commissioners, gave the authorisation while his boss was in the air and out of contact. A member of the Country Liberal party emailed Giles to complain about the over-the-top treatment of Kamitsis, and Giles passed the complaint on to McRoberts, who responded that the arrest had been “a very poor decision”. “I have expressed my anger to Mark Payne who is overseeing the police side of the multiagency task force,” McRoberts wrote back to the chief minister, in an email revealed at the trial. “I’m meeting with a number of individuals first thing tomorrow to decide what action will be taken.” Come Monday, though, it was McRoberts under pressure. Text messages Four days after Kamitsis was arrested, Payne was shown thousands of text messages between the travel agent and McRoberts, dating back several years, which indicated they had a clandestine sexual relationship. “The whole reason I fell in love with you was because my heart skipped a beat when I saw you,” said one from Kamitsis. Payne showed Reece Kershaw, the acting second-in-charge. They then confronted McRoberts, who was still fuming about the raid. “Body-language wise he did rock back and say words to the effect of: it’s not true, that’s not true,” Kershaw told the court. “He went a little bit pale.” As two months passed, it seemed like McRoberts might manage to wriggle free of any consequences of his association with Kamitsis. Payne had to take emergency personal leave for a fortnight to care for his sick wife, and when he returned he found himself on the outer, his office shifted from the sixth-floor nerve centre of Darwin police headquarters to the fourth. Senior members of the government, still unaware of the sexual relationship and upset at the treatment of Kamitsis, were offered Payne as a scapegoat. McRoberts told them, falsely, that Payne had taken stress leave because he couldn’t cope with the criticism. Police politics It took two months before a whistleblower came forward and gave details of the McRoberts-Kamitsis tryst to the then police minister, Peter Chandler. The timing of the disclosure was critical. It merged the police leadership crisis with an unfolding political power struggle. The same day, Giles had signed a letter leaving Chandler, the deputy leader, as acting chief minister. Giles was hours away from stepping on to a plane for two weeks’ holiday when he was told about the unfolding situation. A spokesman for Chandler said at the time he had confronted McRoberts with evidence from a criminal investigation. “His reaction was to resign.” It’s believed by some that the whistleblower’s approach to Chandler was deliberately timed to sideline Giles. The politics of the police and the politics of the cabinet room were linked, and Giles was considered close to the commissioner, who often was willing to toe the political line. Three out of eight cabinet members – Peter Styles, John Elferink and Willem Westra van Holthe – were former Northern Territory cops, each bringing into politics friendships and alliances made during careers on the beat. Those alliances were laid bare in mid-2014 when it came time to renew McRoberts’s contract and decide on a new deputy commissioner. The new deputy would be front-runner for the top job four years down the track. Some ministers, most notably Elferink, Westra van Holthe and Robyn Lambley, pushed hard for Payne to become deputy commissioner. Giles had long-term ambitions for Jamie Chalker, who had been in charge in Alice Springs, but who was a step further down the chain of command. Between them, Giles and McRoberts designed a system to keep everyone happy, to an extent, one that would also have the effect of consolidating the commissioner’s power. Payne, Chalker and Kershaw were given the job of deputy on a rotating basis. A dark and stormy night Giles returned from his holiday in late January to a political storm. McRoberts had been removed. And the chief minister quickly discovered his own position was being eroded. From his point of view, at that time, Giles could see plenty of shadows. The timing of the disclosure to Chandler played on his mind. Why had the whistleblower waited two months to come forward, and only done so to Chandler, the day Giles had gone on leave? Why had the police also waited until McRoberts was on a plane to launch the Kamitsis raid? He had been told about Payne’s involvement in the Kamitsis raid. And he recalled how three of the key coup plotters had been pushing for Payne to become deputy commissioner. At 1am on 3 February two former police officers walked into Parliament House under the cover of darkness and announced they were now in charge of the Northern Territory government. Westra van Holthe told reporters he was the “chief minister apparent” with Elferink as his deputy. Giles, in a fit of paranoia and believing his phone had been tapped, threw it from his 12th floor balcony and into the pool below. Giles managed, somehow, to cling to power. A hastily scheduled swearing-in ceremony for the new team was called at the eleventh hour when Giles simply refused to go. No one knew what to do. His government lasted another 18 months before being turfed out in a brutal election loss after a series of scandals, including a corruption scandal involving a Kamitsis and a ministerial staffer. She spent 11 months in jail for fraud and official corruption. McRoberts now also faces a likely lengthy jail term."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/01/golden-state-warriors-cleveland-cavaliers-nba-finals-game-1","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T04:04:59Z","webTitle":"NBA finals: LeBron's 51 points in vain as Cavaliers blow late chances against Warriors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/01/golden-state-warriors-cleveland-cavaliers-nba-finals-game-1","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/01/golden-state-warriors-cleveland-cavaliers-nba-finals-game-1","fields":{"headline":"NBA finals: LeBron's 51 points in vain as Cavaliers blow late chances against Warriors","bodyText":"Overtime. A controversial reversed call. An ejection. Fifty-one points from an all-time great who still lost. And we thought round four of the Warriors-Cavaliers finals dynasty was going to be boring. The Golden State Warriors topped the Cleveland Cavaliers 124-114 in overtime in Game 1 at Oracle Arena in Oakland, setting the stage for what looks to be an intense series. The Cavaliers gained an early lead and had the game tied at 56-56 going into half-time. They then held the normally explosive third-quarter Warriors to a mere six-point lead and levelled the score in the fourth quarter. But the refs reversed a controversial blocking call in the final minute of regulation – sending Kevin Durant to the free-throw line instead of LeBron James. Officials are permitted to go to replay in the final two minutes of a gameto decide if a defender was in a legal blocking position. However the Cleveland coach, Tyronn Lue, was outraged with the decision to reverse a call in such a crucial game. “It’s never been done, ever in the history of the game,” he said. “It was great, it was epic and [James] did enough to carry this team to a victory ... To do what he did tonight and to come up robbed, it’s just not right.” Cleveland would not be beaten though and George Hill missed a free throw with seconds left that would have put the Cavaliers one point up. If that wasn’t enough, JR Smith bungled an opportunity to win the game in the final seconds. The veteran failed to take a shot because it appeared he thought the Cavs had the lead when they were merely tied, sending the game into overtime. Smith later denied he had mixed up the score and said he was waiting for his team to call a timeout. When James was pressed repeatedly on the issue in the post-game press conference he simply got up from his seat and walked out. “He thought we were up one,” said Lue after the game. “He thought it was over.” And then we were back to our regularly scheduled programming: the Warriors exploded for 17 points in overtime, and the shaken Cavs were toast. As tempers flared with seconds to go, Tristan Thompson was ejected after the referees said he had elbowed Shaun Livingston in the head. Other players scuffled in the background with James and Stephen Curry exchanging words. James carried the Cavaliers on both sides of the court, recording the first 50-point game in the finals since Michael Jordan in 1993 and adding eight assists and eight rebounds. Leading the Warriors’ effort was Curry, who is an early favorite for finals MVP. Curry had 29 points with six rebounds and came through when the team needed him most, scoring their first five points and lobbing a three-pointer to tie it up at half-time. Kevin Durant added 26 points, and the pair teamed up for several highlight-worthy shots, with 15 assists between them. Klay Thompson left for the locker room in the first quarter after colliding with Smith. He was taped up and reentered the game early in the second quarter with seemingly no serious injury, adding 24 points. But it wasn’t just offense that decided the game. The Warriors limited turnovers by passing the ball instead of driving to the lane. Green racked up 11 rebounds, his sixth consecutive game grabbing 10 or more. And Warriors rookie Jordan Bell played tough defense and added two rebounds. Kevin Love provided James with much needed support, adding 21 points and 13 rebounds. But the rest of the team struggled. Not only did Smith get a lot of heat for seemingly squandering the Cavs’ chance of winning, but he shot only 30% and missed all six of his attempts in the fourth quarter. Jordan Clarkson struggled on the floor, adding only four points. “The journey’s not over,” said Lue. “Going through the long season and injuries and guys in and out and trades and all the different situations, to end up at the end of the season being one of the two teams left playing, is a big accomplishment.” The Warriors will spend the next few days preparing for and anticipating any adjustments the Cavaliers make to their game. “They’re really sharp, their staff is sharp, they’ve made a lot of adjustments against us over the years, as we have against them,” the Warriors coach, Steve Kerr, said. “It’s a staff that really understands how to change tactics on the fly, in between games, during games – they’re really good at what they do.” The Cavaliers return to Oracle Arena to face the Warriors in Game 2 on Sunday. Whether Thursday’s events inspire the Cavaliers or destroy them remains to be seen."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/01/one-nation-launches-internal-inquiry-into-claims-brian-burston-tried-to-defect","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T07:23:15Z","webTitle":"Brian Burston responds to Pauline Hanson: 'She has had a massive dummy spit'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/01/one-nation-launches-internal-inquiry-into-claims-brian-burston-tried-to-defect","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/01/one-nation-launches-internal-inquiry-into-claims-brian-burston-tried-to-defect","fields":{"headline":"Brian Burston responds to Pauline Hanson: 'She has had a massive dummy spit'","bodyText":"A defiant Brian Burston has told Pauline Hanson she will have to sack him to be rid of him from One Nation after learning on live radio his leader had called on him to resign. The New South Wales senator accused his party leader of having “a massive dummy spit” and running a “dictatorship”. During a scheduled afternoon interview on Sydney radio 2GB, Burston was read a letter Hanson had sent him earlier in the afternoon, asking him to resign from the party and the Senate in order for One Nation to take back his seat. The interview had originally been set up for Burston to explain his side of his relationship breakdown with Hanson. The letter had been released on social media, but Burston, in a live exchange with host Ben Fordham, said he had not seen it. “I am guessing you have seen that letter from Pauline Hanson,” Fordham said. “No, I haven’t,” Burston replied. “You haven’t seen it?” “No.” “It was sent to you this afternoon.” “Oh. OK. I’ll have to have a look for it.” “It was sent to your office this afternoon, via your chief of staff, I believe. They haven’t shown it to you?” “No, my chief of staff is out of the office in northern New South Wales at the moment. He may not have picked it up either.” “Do you want me to read it to you?” “Yes please.” After hearing that Hanson “no longer had confidence” in him and had removed him as the deputy registered officer both in NSW and federally, while imploring him to resign from the Senate as the “honourable thing to do”, Burston responded “well, that’s disappointing”. “She is saying she’s no longer got the confidence I’ll agree with every single decision she makes, as president for life,” he said. “I thought I joined One Nation as a democractic political party, not a dictatorship. “I am very disappointed with that letter, however I shall inform – over radio 2GB – senator Hanson I will not be vacating my senator position in the house and I shall not be resigning from One Nation. “If she wants to remove me from One Nation, she is entitled to cancel my membership and that will make me an independent, but that is her call.” Burston said he had shown Hanson “loyalty for 22 years”. “Unfortunately because I said I was going to cross the floor, which hasn’t happened yet, she has had a massive dummy spit and I am very disappointed with her immature and childish reaction to it,” he said. “The crocodile tears last night I believe were genuine, but that was mainly in response to the allegations I was trying to join another political party, which was false. So, I will not be resigning from One Nation and I certainly will not ever resign from my Senate position.” One Nation launched an internal investigation into allegations Burston had looked to join the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party on Thursday. A furious Hanson, who had learned Burston had reportedly made an approach to join another party just moments before going on air with Sky News on Thursday night, declared Burston would not “finish her” and that she would “win”. Burston said the approach to the Shooter’s party was made by a constituent of his, without his knowledge. He maintained he had not made any approach himself. “I’ll be one of the other 23 people who have either walked or been sacked,” Burston said of Hanson’s record as party leader. “I’ll be 24 out of 30, not a good record.” At the same time, Hanson and James Ashby were canvassing for what has been described as a “conservative crossbench super bloc” party with allied senators. Mark Latham was reportedly the party’s No 1 pick. On Friday afternoon the Daily Telegraph confirmed he had joined the Liberal Democrats and was expected to run for the party at the NSW state election. DAvid Leyonhjelm said he had not been approached, and Cory Bernardi told Guardian Australia, he would “not confirm or deny” any appoach having been made and that “private conversations would remain private”. “I have zero interest in joining any other political party,” he said. Bob Katter, who at one stage flirted with the idea of joining his party with Hanson’s in Queensland, also ruled out a merger, while his son Robbie, who leads the party in the Katters’ home state, said he had not been “formally approached” but discussions with other parties “happened all the time”. “We are pretty confident within ourselves as a party,” he told Guardian Australia. “We’ll always try and work constructively with other crossbenchers to try and reduce the influence of the major parties, but we’re pretty happy with what we are doing.” Some crossbenchers reported a “real turn-around” in One Nation’s attitude after Hanson’s April trip to Afghanistan failed to create the predicted media storm. “I think that is when they began to think ‘hang on, what’s happening here?’ because a year ago, you’d be seeing photos of her on that base for weeks. Even her home paper has cooled.” The breakdown in the relationship between Hanson and Burston was traced back to February, when Hanson announced former senator Malcolm Roberts would be the party’s lead Senate candidate in Queensland. Burston and WA senator Peter Georgiou were told they would have to “submit their papers like all the other candidates”. “Brian was very affronted by that,” one source close to the senator said. “He felt that was very unfair, he took offence at the whole thing, that Malcolm was anointed for Queensland, but he, who was still in the Senate representing the party, would have to apply, with the idea they were looking for someone better.” Hanson was understood to also be weighing up Burston’s future, after the “preference whisperer”, Glenn Druery, who has long stiched up deals with minor parties, ensuring their electoral future, told her the other parties would not work with Burston. Burston and Hanson fell out following the disintegration of One Nation in the late 1990s, with Burston sacked from the party in 2000 following “internal disputes”. The pair mended their relationship in the following years, and Burston has said it was his idea for Hanson to take back the One Nation name before her 2016 election win, which, after years of false starts, successfully catapulted her back into parliament. Arriving with another three senators, Hanson held a decisive bloc, which was weakened following a fallout with Rod Culleton, who was later found to have been ineligible for election. A second blow was dealt after her Queensland stablemate Roberts was found to have been a dual citizen, and also ineligible to sit in parliament, and his replacement, Fraser Anning, left the party moments after being sworn into the Senate. Hanson is due to fly to the UK on Saturday as part of a parliamentary delegation. She has said she will try to visit Tommy Robinson, founder of the far-right English Defence League, who was jailed last week for contempt of court after broadcasting live video from outside a court in Leeds that threatened to cause a trial to collapse. The case of Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has become a touchstone for the international extreme right. Burston did not return multiple requests for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/02/deadly-questions-ask-aboriginal-champions-anything-about-being-indigenous","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T22:46:38Z","webTitle":"Deadly Questions: ask Aboriginal champions anything about being Indigenous","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/02/deadly-questions-ask-aboriginal-champions-anything-about-being-indigenous","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/02/deadly-questions-ask-aboriginal-champions-anything-about-being-indigenous","fields":{"headline":"Deadly Questions: ask Aboriginal champions anything about being Indigenous","bodyText":"The Victorian government has launched a new website that will allow non-Indigenous people to ask questions of and about Aboriginal people in an attempt to build understanding as part of a push towards signing a treaty. Called Deadly Questions, the website allows users to write in questions and receive a personal response from one or more “champions”. It is intended to help breach the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Victorians ahead of negotiations of a treaty or treaties, preparation for which is slated to begin in earnest this year if legislation establishing the framework for the process passes parliament. The legislation is due to be debated on Tuesday. It was pushed back two weeks and faces a series of amendments proposed by Greens MP Lidia Thorpe, most of which were opposed by the government. The Deadly Questions “champions” are all Aboriginal Victorians and include musician and Yorta Yorta man Adam Briggs, Gunditjmara film-maker and academic Richard Frankland, senior Wurundjeri elder Aunty Joy Murphy and Yorta Yorta Richmond Tigers AFLW player Natarsha Bamblett. Frankland said no question would be out of bounds. “This is an opportunity for any Australian to ask that question and say the thing that they are too scared to ask, or too afraid to ask,” he told Guardian Australia. “Not every Aboriginal person will agree with this and neither should they have to, because we are all different.” Offensive and racist language will be screened out, but questions that have at their base a racist assumption will not. Rebutting those assumptions is part of the aim of the project, Frankland said. Questions already listed on the site include: “Is being Aboriginal just the colour of your skin?” and “Why don’t we see many Aboriginal people around the city?” Frankland directed video responses to many of the questions. He also answered a number, including “Why can’t Aboriginal people get over the past?” He responded: “I often get asked: ‘why don’t you people get over it?’ I can’t be healed, I can’t get over it, until my non-Aboriginal colleagues get over it, until we stop living with the nursery version of history.” Other questions include: “Why should I be sorry for something I didn’t do?” and “Can you get more welfare if you’re Aboriginal?”, both of which were answered by Briggs. In response to the former, he said: “I don’t need every whitefella with dreadlocks to come up and tell me he’s sorry. I need true acknowledgement and that comes from the top down, from the government.” Wemba Wemba actor and academic Carissa Lee said she was initially apprehensive about taking part, but also saw it as a way to help her community by correcting harmful assumptions. Lee said reconciliation was the work of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, but “we have a lot more at stake about how we approach it”. “There’s this power imbalance of people that are having to sacrifice bits of themselves to white people as a consequence of having to answer questions … We don’t get to just exist in the world,” she said. “In Deadly Questions, I feel as though there’s been a priority to make sure that the questions that get through are safe, that they are not hurtful.” Yorta Yorta elder Aunty Pam Pederson said educating non-Indigenous people was a way to continue the work of her parents: footballer, leader and Aborigines Advancement League co-founder Sir Douglas Nicholls and Lady Gladys Nicholls. She has observed similar conversations with some fairly prominent players. “I met the Queen a few times and Prince Philip; back in the old days, [prime ministers] Robert Menzies and Harold Holt,” she said. “Mum and Dad raised me to step into their shoes, and this is what I am doing.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/01/minimum-wage-increased-by-35-to-1893-an-hour","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T01:30:36Z","webTitle":"Minimum wage increased by 3.5% to $18.93 an hour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/01/minimum-wage-increased-by-35-to-1893-an-hour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/01/minimum-wage-increased-by-35-to-1893-an-hour","fields":{"headline":"Minimum wage increased by 3.5% to $18.93 an hour","bodyText":"The stronger economic forecast has allowed an increase of the national minimum wage by 3.5%, taking it to $18.93 per hour. But the increase decided upon by the Fair Work Commission on Friday is well below the 7.2% called for by unions. The FWC decision sets the new minimum wage at $719.20 a week. That will mean wages will rise by $24.30 a week for about two million workers. The commission pointed to stronger economic indicators and forecasts from the federal government, the International Monetary Fund and the Reserve Bank. “The prevailing economic circumstances provide an opportunity to improve the relative living standards of the low-paid and to enable them to better meet their needs,” the commission president, Iain Ross, said. “The economic indicators now point more unequivocally to a healthy national economy and labour market. “The circumstances are such that it is appropriate to provide a real wage increase to those employees who have their wages set by the national minimum wage or by a national minimum award.” The 3.5% increase is well above the 1.9% rate of inflation, meaning a real rise in wages of 1.6% for Australia’s lowest paid workers. The Australian Council of Trade Unions had earlier made an ambitious push to more than double last year’s $22-a-week increase by calling for a rise of 7.2%. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, welcomed the decision as a step in the right direction. She described it as the largest percentage increase ever awarded by the commission. But she warned it was not enough to guarantee workers a living wage. “It is a step forward towards a living wage, but it’s not a living wage,” McManus said. “We need in our country, for no full-time worker to live in poverty.” Workers who appeared alongside McManus in Melbourne on Friday were less impressed by the decision. One woman, a cleaner who works in a Melbourne shopping centre, said it did little to help her buy a house or have children. “Because of the minimum wage and such a petty rise of 3.5%, I can’t even think of buying a house. All of my income goes to either paying bills or paying rent,” she said. The commission said an increase of the size called for by unions risked reducing employment prospects for low-skilled workers. “We have, however, decided not to grant an increase of the size proposed by the ACTU and the Australian Catholic Council for Employment Relations,” the commission ruled. “In our view, an increase of the size that they propose is likely to run a substantial risk of adverse employment effects. “Such adverse effects will impact on those groups who are already marginalised in the labour market and on households vulnerable to poverty due to loss of employment or hours.” The Australian Industry Group slammed the decision. The group’s chief executive, Innes Willox, said the increase had the potential “to be a major disincentive to employment”. “It is out of step with wage movements across the economy, with inflation and with the pressures that many businesses are under,” he said. The group had called for a modest increase of 1.8%, or $12.50 a week, for those on the minimum wage and $14.60 for the lowest award rates. “Australia already had the second-highest national minimum wage in the world [just behind France] and today’s decision runs the risk of further harming the competitiveness of Australian businesses,” Willox said. The shadow employment minister, Brendan O’Connor, welcomed the decision, and said he was pleased the commission had rejected a bid by retailers to have the minimum wage frozen. O’Connor said Labor’s submission to the commission had argued inequality and household debt were at record highs, while wages had flatlined. “Well, this goes some way to responding to that,” O’Connor said. “Labor was still very, very clear that we need to see better tax relief for working-class and middle-class families, and we call on the government to support Labor’s tax relief, which is almost double that for middle-class and working-class families.” The Greens have pledged to press ahead with a bill to lift minimum wage. Employment spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the commission’s decision left many workers in poverty. “Almost one in four people in poverty is working full-time and even though the economy is apparently strong, this decision will still leave many full-time workers living in poverty,” he said. “Until we enshrine in law a minimum wage above poverty level, inequality will continue to grow in Australia.” The commission also decided to increase all modern award minimum wages by 3.5%. The ruling will come into effect on 1 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/04/the-big-con-how-neoliberals-convinced-us-there-wasnt-enough-to-go-around","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T18:00:55Z","webTitle":"The big con: how neoliberals convinced us there wasn't enough to go around | Richard Denniss","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/04/the-big-con-how-neoliberals-convinced-us-there-wasnt-enough-to-go-around","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/04/the-big-con-how-neoliberals-convinced-us-there-wasnt-enough-to-go-around","fields":{"headline":"The big con: how neoliberals convinced us there wasn't enough to go around","bodyText":"Australia just experienced one of the biggest mining booms in world history. But even at the peak of that boom, there was no talk of the wonderful opportunity we finally had to invest in world-class mental health or domestic violence crisis services. Nor was there much talk from either major party about how the wealth of the mining boom gave us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in remote Indigenous communities. Nope, the peak of the mining boom was not the time to help those who had missed out in decades past, but the Howard government thought it was a great time to introduce permanent tax cuts for high-income earners. These, of course, are the tax cuts that caused the budget deficits we have today. Millions of tonnes of explosives were used during the mining boom to build more than 100 new mines, but it wasn’t just prime farmland that was blasted away in the boom, it was access to the middle class. At the same time that Gina Rinehart was becoming the world’s richest woman on the back of rising iron ore prices, those on the minimum wage were falling further and further behind their fellow Australians. Like Joe Hockey, Rinehart saw the problem of inequality as having more to do with the character of the poor than with the rules of the game: “If you’re jealous of those with more money, don’t just sit there and complain. Do something to make more money yourself – spend less time drinking or smoking and socialising, and more time working.” Australia isn’t poor; it is rich beyond the imagining of anyone living in the 1970s or 80s. But so much of that new wealth has been vacuumed up by a few, and so little of that new wealth has been paid in tax, that the public has been convinced that ours is a country struggling to pay its bills. Convincing Australians that our nation is poor and that our governments “can’t afford” to provide the level of services they provided in the past has not just helped to lower our expectations of our public services and infrastructure, it has helped to lower our expectations of democracy itself. A public school in Sydney has had to ban kids from running in the playground because it was so overcrowded. Trains have become so crowded at peak hours that many people, especially the frail and the disabled, are reluctant to use them. And those who have lost their jobs now wait for hours on the phone when they reach out to Centrelink for help. Although people with low expectations are easier to con, fomenting cynicism about democracy comes at a long-term cost. Indeed, as the current crop of politicians is beginning to discover, people with low expectations feel they have nothing to lose. As more and more people live with the poverty and job insecurity that flow directly from neoliberal welfare and industrial relations policies, the scare campaigns run so successfully by the likes of the Business Council of Australia have lost their sting. Scary stories about the economy become like car alarms: once they attracted attention, but now they simply annoy those forced to listen. After decades of hearing conservative politicians say that government is the problem, a growing number of conservative voters no longer care which major party forms government. If governments can’t make a difference and all politicians are corrupt, why not vote for outsiders like Jacqui Lambie or Clive Palmer? There is perhaps no clearer evidence of the short-termism of the Liberal and National parties today than their willingness to fan the flames of anti-politician rhetoric without considering that it is their own voters who are most likely to heed the message. Back when he was leading the campaign against Australia becoming a republic, Tony Abbott famously argued that you couldn’t trust politicians to choose our head of state. And more recently, in campaigning against marriage equality, Minister Matt Canavan was featured in a television advertisement laughing at the thought that we could trust politicians. Convincing Australians that the country was broke also helped convince us that we have no choice but to sell the family silver. But of course we have a choice. Just as there is no right answer as to whether it’s better to rent a home or buy one, there is no right answer to whether it’s better for governments to own the electricity supply, the postal service or the water supply, or none of these things. Different governments in different countries make different decisions at different points in time. While much of neoliberalism’s rhetorical power comes from the assertion that “there is no alternative,” the simple fact is that the world is full of alternatives. Indeed, even the so-called free marketeers in Australia can see alternatives. Consider stadiums, for example. The NSW Liberal government has a long track record of being pro-privatisation. It has sold off billions of dollars’ worth of electricity, water and health infrastructure. But when it comes to football stadiums, it has no ideological problem with public ownership, nor any fiscal inhibition about spending billions of taxpayers’ dollars. In 2016 the NSW Liberal government spent $220m buying back ANZ Stadium, built in the 1990s with taxpayer funds at a cost of $690m and subsequently sold to Stadium Australia Group. Having bought back the stadium, the NSW government plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars refurbishing it. That same money could build a lot of school science labs, domestic violence crisis centres or skate parks for the bored kids the shopping malls don’t want scratching up their marble stairs. For the past 30 years, Australians have been told that we can’t afford high-quality public services, that public ownership of assets is inefficient, and that the pursuit of free markets through deregulation would create wealth and prosperity for all. But none of this is true. While the policy agenda of neoliberalism has never been broadly applied in Australia, for 30 years the language of neoliberalism has been applied to everything from environmental protection to care of the disabled. The result of the partial application of policy and the broad application of language is not just a yawning gap between those with the greatest wealth and those with the greatest need, but a country that is now riven by demographic, geographic and racial divides. Cutting the budget deficit is very important – except when it isn’t Australian politics isn’t about ideology, it’s about interests. The clearest proof of that claim is that neoliberal ideas such as deregulation were never aimed at powerful interest groups like the pharmacists or the gambling industry. And savage spending cuts were never aimed at subsidies for the fossil-fuel industry or private health insurers. Just as conservative Christian theology provides an excuse for sexism and homophobia, neoliberal language allows powerful groups to package their personal preferences as national interests – systematically cutting spending on their enemies and giving money to their friends. Here are some examples: John Howard said he was obsessed with deregulating the labour market, but introduced 762 pages of labour-market regulation, which he entitled WorkChoices. He didn’t deregulate the labour market; he re-regulated it in his preferred form. He knew that government decisions matter. Similarly, the Abbott government declared it was waging a war on red tape, yet the Turnbull government is determined to pass new laws restricting unions and NGOs. If there is one thing that neoliberals really seem to believe, it is that reducing the budget deficit is very, very important. Except when it isn’t. The political and business leaders who said we needed to slash welfare spending because we had a “budget emergency” are currently advocating a $65bn tax cut for business – even though the deficit is bigger now than it was at the time of the alleged emergency. The Productivity Commission and state treasuries spent years advocating the deregulation and privatisation of the electricity industry – and succeeded in creating a “free market” system governed by 5,000 pages of electricity market rules. Electricity is too dangerous and too important to be deregulated, and those pushing for deregulation always knew that. They didn’t want a free market; they simply wanted a market, one in which the government played a smaller role and the private sector made large profits selling an essential service for much higher prices than the government ever charged. The NSW government requires NGOs and disability service providers to compete with each other but, when it sold Port Botany and the Port of Newcastle, it structured the sales to ensure that Newcastle could not compete with Port Botany for the landing of the millions of containers that arrive by ship each year. While “competition policy” is applied to the vulnerable, those buying billion-dollar assets are protected from those same forces of competition. To be clear, there has been no obsession among the political elite with the neoliberal goals of reducing government spending, regulation or tax collection in Australia over the past three decades. None. They didn’t mean a word of it. While there may have been economists, commentators and even business leaders who sincerely believed in those goals, it is clear from their actions, as distinct from their words, that John Howard, Tony Abbott and even the former head of the Business Council of Australia Tony Shepherd, the man tasked with running Abbott’s National Commission of Audit, had no principled objection to spending large amounts of public money on things they liked spending large amounts of public money on. Indeed, in his speakers’ agency profile, Tony Shepherd brags about his ability to get public money for private ventures: It is no mean feat to convince governments to support private sector proposals, but as former prime minister, the honourable Paul Keating, said, “Tony managed to get more money out of my government than any other person I can recall.” Hundreds of new pages of regulation now govern the conduct of charities. Billions of taxpayers’ dollars have been spent by “small government” politicians on everything from television ads for innovation to subsidies for marriage counselling. And Tony Abbott, who claimed to have a philosophical problem with carbon taxing, once proposed a 20% increase in the tobacco excise. The political strategy behind these contradictions is simple: it is difficult to criticise government spending on health and education, or popular regulations like consumer protection and limits on executive pay. So why not just criticise all government spending and all red tape in general? Once you have convinced the public that all government spending is inefficient, you can set about cutting spending on your enemies and retaining it for your friends. And once you convince people that all regulation is bad, you can set about removing consumer protections while retaining the laws that protect the TV industry, the gambling industry, the pharmaceutical industry and all your other friends. When powerful groups want subsidies, we are told they will create jobs. When powerless groups want better funding for domestic violence shelters or after-school reading groups, they are told of the need to reduce the budget deficit. When powerful groups demand new regulations, we are told it will provide business with certainty, but when powerless groups demand new regulations, they are told it will create sovereign risk. Ideology has a bad name these days, but it simply means a “system of ideas and ideals.” By that definition, it is possible to think of neoliberalism as an ideology focused on the idea that market forces are superior to government decision-making. But while large segments of Australian politics and business have draped themselves, and their policy preferences, in the cloak of neoliberal ideas and ideals, in reality to call them “ideologues” is to flatter them. They lack the consistency and strength of principle to warrant the title.

Over 700,000 ethnic Rohingya Muslims have fled to squalid camps in neighbouring Bangladesh since last August, when Myanmar’s army led a brutal crackdown, which saw tens of thousands tortured and killed, villages razed to the ground and women raped, following insurgent attacks on security posts. The memorandum is a key step forward in the slow and halting process of repatriation. Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in November to begin repatriating the Rohingya, but the refugees expressed concern that they would be forced to return and would face unsafe conditions in Myanmar if the process was not monitored by aid groups. This was a view echoed by the international community. The UN has been denied access to Rakhine since August last year, but UNHCR and UNDP staff will be able to enter the region and properly assess the conditions. Knut Ostby, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar, said there were “hundreds of thousands of people living in totally unsustainable conditions on the Bangladesh side. They cannot stay where they are and so it’s important we try to do our best to bring them back home, but in a way that is voluntary, dignified and safe and gives them a chance to rebuild their lives.” In a statement, the Myanmar government said they had made the agreement with the UN so that verified displaced people “can return voluntarily in safety and dignity”. However, the details of the memorandum were sparse and left many concerned that it would not address some of the key issues of repatriation, such as whether the UN supported the Myanmar government’s plans to temporarily house those Rohingya who have been accepted back to Myanmar in a 124-acre “transit camp” in Hla Po Khaung, northern Rakhine, before they are sent to one of 11 designated settlement areas to live. Many Rohingya believe these settlements will simply be “open air prisons”. Bangladesh-based Rohingya political activist Ko Ko Linn alleged that incidents of violence were still being carried out against Rohingya in Myanmar, making safe repatriation seem impossible at this stage. “While the situation for the Rohingya still remains so hostile, we cannot believe that Myanmar has been sincere in the process to repatriate them,” he said. Another issue is that while the Myanmar government statement specified that the memorandum applied to Rohingya who had been “duly verified”, many lack the necessary paperwork and documentation having fled the violence with few, if any, possessions. The memorandum also does not spell out the UN’s role in Rakhine post-repatriation, and the role the UN agencies would play in ensuring the Rohingya community were not subject to the same violence, which was described by the US and the UN as ethnic cleansing. Mohammad Umor, a 48-year-old Rohingya refugee who lives in Balukhali camp since he fled Myanmar in August, told the Guardian that the Rohingya wanted the UN to promise to keep peacekeepers in Rakhine after repatriation. “They must facilitate our return to our original villages and our confiscated lands and other properties must be returned to us,” said Umor. “We cannot live with those police and soldiers – who raped and killed so many Rohingya people – around us. The UN and Burma [Myanmar] government must keep UN peacekeeping forces for our safety in Rakhine.” However, Ostby emphasised that “once the conditions are in place for the return, then we will deal with protection issues when that repatriation happens”. The UN said in a separate statement that conditions in Myanmar were still not yet appropriate for the return, but that they would be working with the government to make progress. Ostby said the two key conditions that the Myanmar government had to demonstrate for the UN to green light repatriation were assured citizenship for the Rohingya – ensuring they were “able to have an identity, to be able to exist as normal persons in society” – and also an assurance that they would not be at risk of being attacked or subject to any local violence. Rohingya Muslims face official and social discrimination in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, which denies most of them citizenship and basic rights by not recognising them as one of the country’s indigenous ethnic groups. Ensuring that the Rohingya are no longer considered a “stateless people” is a key condition of the memorandum, though so far the Myanmar government has not shown any willingness to accept the Rohingya as citizens, and in official statements often still refers to them derogatorily as “Bengalis”. The official timeline given for repatriation by the Bangladesh government is two years but Ostby admitted that was optimistic. “It’s more important to make sure we are not bringing people back into an unstable situation,” he said. “It’s an enormous job and obviously this is not a final agreement where everybody will magically be returned. It’s now that the work starts.” Shaikh Azizur Rahman contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/07/trump-presidential-pardons-mueller-investigation","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-07-10T20:37:00Z","webTitle":"What can we learn from the people Trump has pardoned so far?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/trump-presidential-pardons-mueller-investigation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/07/trump-presidential-pardons-mueller-investigation","fields":{"headline":"What can we learn from the people Trump has pardoned so far?","bodyText":"Trump has pardoned father and son cattle-ranchers who are currently imprisoned for arson on public lands. Like many of Trump’s pardons, this one was heavily politicised. Their initial arrest ignited a protest movement against government overreach and they became emblematic of a movement for public lands to be returned to the states. Following their initial arrest and imprisonment in 2012, the justice department successfully appealed to impose longer sentences for the Hammonds. In a statement on Tuesday the White House said that appeal was “overzealous” and the length of the sentence was “unjust”. The presidential pardon has never been a particularly fair or impartial instrument of government – it’s effectively circumventing the judicial system at the whim of whoever is in office. Democratic and Republican presidents have offered pardons to those on their side of key issues, and in some cases (Bill Clinton’s pardon of former Democratic congressman Mel Reynolds on federal fraud charges, for example) pardons have been given to political allies with little wider moral justification. Trump has pardoned slightly fewer people than most recent presidents at this stage of a presidency, but there is a theme to those he has deemed worthy of clemency. Most were considered by Trump as being unfairly persecuted by the “deep state”. They have been found, by FBI and DoJ investigations, to have obstructed justice, given false statements to investigators, or broken campaign finance rules. Many have suggested that Trump is using his pardons as a tool in the Mueller investigation. One of his greatest political threats is that Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort will cooperate with the FBI to minimise their legal vulnerability. Trump’s pardons could signal to those considering working with the Mueller investigation that if they remain loyal he will reward them down the line. Even this latest pardon – which, according to the Washington Post, has disturbed many of Trump’s advisers – demonstrates Trump’s willingness to use pardons for any cause, without wider consultation. As well as the late boxer Jack Johnson, Trump has pardoned six living people, commuted two sentences and has raised the possibility of pardoning two more. Here’s who’s on his list: Alice Johnson The crime Drug trafficking. The punishment Life imprisonment. Trump response Sentence commuted. Johnson was involved in a Memphis-based drug trafficking operation in the mid-90s. She claims she never sold drugs herself, or set up deals, but relayed coded messages over the phone. She has been serving life in prison. It was her first offence. Kim Kardashian went to the White House in May to persuade Trump to release her. She also agreed to pose for photos with the president. Many in the White House are reportedly dismayed that a pardon was made in this manner, particularly one that flies in the face of the general government policy on drug offenders, which has been to maintain punitive sentences. Dinesh D’Souza The crime He pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance laws in 2014 by making illegal contributions to a United States Senate campaign in the names of others. The punishment Five years of probation, eight months of which he served in a community confinement center in California. Trump response Pardoned. D’Souza briefly served as an adviser in the Reagan administration and worked for a number of conservative thinktanks. After Obama’s election, he became better known as a documentarian whose films made Trump-like attacks on liberals and gleeful promotion of conspiracy theories. His 2012 documentary about Obama was widely criticised for, as Entertainment Weekly put it, “giving intellectual cover to the worst in subterranean conspiracy theories and false, partisan attacks”. It is the fifth best-performing documentary at the American box office ever. D’Souza was convicted and fined, and served eight months in a community probation facility. Trump pardoned him last week saying he was “treated very unfairly” by the government. Martha Stewart The crime Obstruction of justice, making false statements and conspiracy for lying to investigators during an investigation into insider trading. The punishment Stewart served five months in prison. Trump response Considering a pardon. Stewart is one of two former Apprentice contestants who Trump said he is considering for a pardon. Previously Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has used Stewart as an example of why Trump shouldn’t testify in the Mueller investigation. “Martha Stewart never would have gone to jail if she hadn’t lied during her testimony,” he told CNN. Rod Blagojevich The crime Corruption charges relating to his attempt to sell the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when he became president. The punishment Currently serving a 14-year sentence. Trump response Considering commuting the sentence. Blagojevich, a Democrat and former governor of Illinois, was involved in one of the strangest cases of political corruption in US history. He was found guilty of seeking financial benefit for the Senate seat left vacant by Barack Obama, essentially auctioning it off to the highest bidder (in Illinois, Senate vacancies are filled by gubernatorial appointment). Trump told reporters in May: “Rod Blagojevich … 18 [sic] years in jail for being stupid and saying things that every other politician, you know that many other politicians say.” In May Blagojevich wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal which many believe was written to appeal to Trump’s sense of persecution. He wrote: “Some in the DoJ and FBI are abusing their power to criminalize the routine practices of politics and government.” In June, Blagojevich directly asked Trump to pardon him and filed an official application for clemency. Sholom Rubashkin The crime Eighty-six counts of federal bank fraud, mostly related to a complex scheme of loans created to pay illegal labour off the books. The punishment A 27-year prison sentence. Trump response Sentence commuted. Rubashkin was once the executive of America’s largest kosher meatpacking business, but after immigration raids in 2008, federal prosecutors charged him with financial fraud. He was convicted on 86 counts, but many felt his 27-year sentence was too severe, especially when considering Enron’s Jeff Skilling received a shorter sentence. This was one of Trump’s more traditional pardons. He decided to commute Rubashkin’s sentence after a bipartisan group of more than 100 former law enforcement and justice department officials, including former attorneys general, petitioned him. Joe Arpaio The crime Failing to follow a court order to stop profiling Latinos. The punishment Up to six months in prison. Trump response Pardoned before sentencing. Joe Arpaio claimed to be “America’s toughest sheriff” and boasted that he would confine inmates in such unbearable conditions that they amounted to a “concentration camp”. His racial profiling of Latinos led to a court order banning him from targeting Latino drivers. Arpaio ignored the order and was found to have committed civil contempt. He could have served prison time but Trump pardoned Arpaio before he could be sentenced. Arpaio has been extremely loyal to Trump, with whom he shares almost identical political views. He has previously arrested journalists for writing negative stories about him, and claimed that Barack Obama was born in Kenya. When Trump suggested pardoning Arpaio at rallies it prompted huge cheers from the crowd. Kristian Saucier The crime Retaining photographs he had taken of classified areas inside a nuclear submarine. The punishment Twelve months in prison. Trump response Pardoned. Kristian Saucier was a navy sailor who took photos – he claims as personal mementoes – of a nuclear submarine, using his personal phone. Trump became obsessed with Saucier’s case because he said it demonstrated legal hypocrisy relating to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. He argued at rallies and on Twitter that Saucier had faced jail for storing classified data on his phone but Clinton had not. Somewhat undermining his own argument, he pardoned Saucier for his crime, from which one might assume he doesn’t think Clinton should be charged either. However confusing the logic, Saucier is returning the favour and this week announced he plans to sue Obama and James Comey, saying he was subject to unequal protection under the law. Scooter Libby The crime Felony counts of perjury, lying to the FBI, and obstruction of justice. The punishment Thirty-month prison sentence, commuted by George W Bush. Trump’s response Full pardon. Libby was Vice-President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff and top national security adviser between 2001 and 2005. He was found guilty of lying to the FBI in an investigation into the leaking of information about the undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame. Libby’s sentence had already been commuted by Bush and Trump’s pardon made little practical difference. But the symbolism of pardoning Libby was considerable – it was James Comey, then deputy attorney general, who chose the special prosecutor who would bring action against Libby. Adam Schiff, a Democratic congressman and persistent Trump critic, was quick to draw the parallels. “On the day the president wrongly attacks Comey for being a ‘leaker and liar’ he considers pardoning a convicted leaker and liar, Scooter Libby. This is the president’s way of sending a message to those implicated in the Russia investigation: you have my back and I’ll have yours,” he tweeted. Dwight Hammond Jr and Steven Hammond The crime: Arson on public lands, convicted under anti-terror legislation. The punishment: A three-month and one-year sentence, later increased to five years each. Trump’s response Full pardon. The Hammonds are father and son farmers in Oregon who started a fire on their own land. They claimed the fire was to control alien plant species on their land although the prosecution argued it was to hide evidence of poaching. Either way, the fire spread to federally owned land and the pair were jailed on arson charges in 2012. Dwight served a three-month sentence while his son spent a year in jail. But in 2015, the pair were resentenced following a petition by the justice department, who argued that arson on federal land carried a mandatory minimum of five years which should have been enforced. Their imprisonment sparked outrage among ranchers and a number of militia groups, who travelled to Oregon and occupied a federal nature reserve in protest. One rancher was killed in the resulting stand-off."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/05/st-johns-university-new-york-racism-allegations-protest","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T11:00:43Z","webTitle":"How racism allegations shook a New York university known for diversity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/05/st-johns-university-new-york-racism-allegations-protest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/05/st-johns-university-new-york-racism-allegations-protest","fields":{"headline":"How racism allegations shook a New York university known for diversity","bodyText":"A university praised as one of the most diverse colleges in the country has come under scrutiny after students alleged a series of racist incidents on campus. A series of students have lodged complaints with St John’s University, in New York City, over the past year, the latest coming after a protest over a student’s “blackface” Instagram post ended with white students allegedly shouting the n-word at black students at a university event. The accusations have led to the NAACP and a local councilwoman demanding the university – a private, Catholic college – take action, while students have criticized the university’s response. It comes against a backdrop of racially charged incidents across the US, which included Starbucks closing 8,000 stores for racial bias training last week. The furore at St John’s began in April, when a female student posted an image on Instagram of five white women whose faces had been replaced by faces of black men. The photo was captioned: “Buzz buzz” followed by the n-word. Myrakel Baker, a legal studies and government and politics student at St John’s, complained to the university, which launched an investigation. In the meantime, black students from the university’s Staten Island and Queens campuses held a silent protest at a university event, where they say they were taunted by white students. “We all wore black to show solidarity with what’s going on and stand up to the administration, saying: ‘You have to do something,’” Baker told the Guardian. “And I saw flashing lights in my face and people saying: ‘Go back to where you came from... It was a lot going on.” Claire Robinson, a 19-year-old communications student at St John’s, also attended the protest, along with about 25 other black students. “They called us the n-word a few times in a few different ways,” Robinson said. She said “at least 10” white students were involved. “I wouldn’t say it was a welcoming environment at all. It was pretty tense.” St John’s responded to the racist Instagram post by sending an email to students describing the behavior as unacceptable. Brian Browne, a spokesman for the university, said the student who shared the image was no longer enrolled at the university. After the protest where black students said they were taunted, St John’s commissioned an investigation by an outside counsel, Browne said. He would not share the results of that investigation, citing privacy laws. Both incidents occurred on the Staten Island campus, which Baker criticized for a lack of diversity. The campus, made up of just under 2,000 students, is 72% white. Only 4% of students are black; 10% are Latino and 4% Asian. Browne, the college spokesman, said that the Staten Island campus was not representative of the St John’s as a whole. The Queens campus was less than 50% white, he said. “We are the one of the most diverse campuses in the country,” Browne said. “The makeup of that small campus looks like Staten Island. So our student population just mirrors the population of the borough in which it is housed. In Queens, a very diverse borough, our campus looks a lot like Queens.” Staten Island is the least diverse of New York City’s five boroughs. According to the 2010 census, 71% of the population is white, 9% is black, 6% is Asian and 12% is Hispanic. Schaddai Sosa, a 20-year-old psychology and English student who also attended the talent show protest – said she was told to “get the fuck out of here” by white students – and added that the Staten Island campus’s lack of diversity contributed to her feeling unwelcome. “You feel very small on that campus,” she said. “And very underrepresented in the students and the staff they have, so you don’t necessarily feel comfortable, and it never really feels safe.” Sosa’s sister, Paola Sosa, a marketing major, said she had heard of students not wanting to attend university at the Staten Island campus due to a lack of diversity. Other students say the St John’s problems with race are not restricted to the Staten Island campus. “These are not isolated events,” Robinson said. “The Queens campus has erupted in protest three times in the last academic year over incidents of institutional racism – once in the fall semester and twice in the spring semester.” In 2015, US News and World Report named St John’s as the second-most diverse university in the US in terms of the proportion of minority students. It was named the fifth most diverse in 2016, and in 2018 the 20th most diverse. The group Students of Consciousness – St John’s University has repeatedly complained of racial bias at the college. In November 2017 it issued a statement saying that black students had been treated dismissively at a faculty meeting, and in February of the same year more than a hundred black students held a protest after three black women were threatened by a white student. “What St John’s gives you is classes where the professors are white, where for example when you take a philosophy class the only philosophers they teach you about are old white ones,” said Kenneth Shelton, an organiser with Students of Consciousness. “If I went to school in Iowa, you’d expect this from a school there. You’d still fight it, but you’d expect it. But St John’s markets itself as this sort of racial utopia.” Students held a silent protest at St John’s on 7 May, which was attended by the NAACP and the New York City councilwoman Debi Rose. “There is no place for bigotry in our society, and incidents like these must be addressed with vigor,” Rose told the Guardian. “I walked in solidarity with St John’s students to show them they are not alone, and to demand the university address these incidents immediately.” Rose said she had since met with the university “with a list of demands, beginning with the hiring of a diversity officer and an infusion of diversity across the staff and all curriculum”. Browne said the university started a task force to look into diversity in 2016, whose work is continuing. “We’re looking at issues of diversity, inclusion, in all of our campuses. We do a lot of training for employees and faculty members and students,” Browne said. “So we’re doing a lot and we’ve been doing a lot.” In the meantime, Baker, along with other students, has come up with her own list of demands, including courses on diversity and inclusion being “built into the curriculum” and that St John’s Staten Island campus create a quota system for the number of minority students admitted. “So the university can show me and other people that they care about minorities,” she said. “So this won’t happen again.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/31/facebook-shareholder-meeting-mark-zuckerberg","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T22:27:21Z","webTitle":"Angry Facebook shareholders challenge Zuckerberg over 'corporate dictatorship'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/31/facebook-shareholder-meeting-mark-zuckerberg","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/31/facebook-shareholder-meeting-mark-zuckerberg","fields":{"headline":"Angry Facebook shareholders challenge Zuckerberg over 'corporate dictatorship'","bodyText":"In the months since Facebook faced one of the greatest crises in its 14-year history over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has faced tough questioning and increased scrutiny from his users, the media and governments around the world. On Thursday, the billionaire executive faced another challenge: from angry shareholders at the company’s annual meeting, where activist investors had forced votes on six proposals to change the company’s governance or institute other reforms. And while Zuckerberg and his board of directors escaped the election unscathed – a foregone conclusion thanks to the company’s unequal voting structure – the event provided a platform for stinging rebukes of their leadership. The tone was set just minutes into the meeting, when an attendee interrupted the meeting chair to complain that the shareholders would not be able to speak until after voting was over. “Shareholder democracy is already lacking at Facebook,” the woman argued, before her microphone was turned off. Another attendee, Christine Jantz of Northstar Asset Management, said: “If privacy is a human right, as stated by Microsoft’s CEO, then we contend that Facebook’s poor stewardship of customer data is tantamount to a human rights violation.” Jantz was speaking in favor of a proposal to reform Facebook’s stockholder voting structure. Under Facebook’s current structure, Zuckerberg controls the majority of voting shares despite not owning a majority of the company, because his shares have 10 times the voting power of the shares available to regular investors. Jantz blamed that structure for enabling problems like the Cambridge Analytica scandal, calling it an “egregious example of when a board is formed by a CEO to meet his needs” rather than those of investors. Will Lana of Trillium Asset Management said that his firm had identified “at least 15 distinct controversies” facing the company as he spoke in favor of a proposal to change the board’s approach to risk management. “The proof of the current structure’s inadequacies is on display in the current headlines,” Lana said. James McRitchie, a shareholder activist, spoke in favor of a proposal to change the voting structure from what he called a “corporate dictatorship”. “Mr Zuckerberg, take a page from history,” he said. “Emulate George Washington, not Vladimir Putin.” In his own remarks, Zuckerberg sounded familiar notes from the recent apology tour that has seen him appear before the US Congress and European parliament as he discussed the various challenges the company faces. “The big theme we’re focused on is making sure we take a broader view of our responsibility to everyone we serve,” Zuckerberg said, before discussing the company’s various initiatives to increase advertising transparency, improve content moderation, and prevent interference in elections. During a question and answer session, Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, made one new announcement – that the company would adopt a “diverse slate approach” when it comes to choosing members of its board of directors. The approach, akin to the NFL’s “Rooney Rule”, requires hiring managers to consider candidates from underrepresented groups when filling an open position. Facebook added the first non-white member, the American Express CEO, Kenneth Chenault, to its board in January. In May, the company announced that Jeff Zients, former director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council, would replace the WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum on the board."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/31/trump-santa-fe-shooting-families-texas","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T20:11:25Z","webTitle":"Trump meets with families of Texas school shooting victims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/31/trump-santa-fe-shooting-families-texas","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/31/trump-santa-fe-shooting-families-texas","fields":{"headline":"Trump meets families of Santa Fe school shooting victims","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Thursday privately met families of some of the 10 people killed in the Santa Fe school shooting in Texas earlier this month. The meeting came at the start of the US president’s visit to Texas. A White House spokesman said Trump was “moved” by the 18 May shooting at Santa Fe high school, which left eight students and two substitute teachers dead. A student faces murder charges over the attack. “These events are very tragic, whenever they happen. And you know, the president wants to extend his condolences and talk about the issue of school safety,” Raj Shah told Fox News Channel. Trump spent more than an hour with families and local leaders at a coast guard station just outside Houston. The White House did not immediately identify the people with whom Trump met or what they discussed. Reporters were not permitted to witness the meeting. Before Thursday, Trump was most recently in Texas on 4 May, when he attended the annual NRA convention and pledged that the attendees’ second amendment rights “will never, ever be under siege as long as I am your president”. He also touted the administration’s “aggressive strategy on community safety” and mentioned armed guards, armed teachers, mental health and metal detectors but did not mention assault rifles like the one used in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting. The NRA spent millions backing Trump’s campaign. He has broadly backed the gun owner lobby group’s positions on gun reform, straying only briefly from it after the Parkland shooting, but quickly backpedaled. Earlier Thursday, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, and the US senator Ted Cruz, both Republicans, greeted Trump on the tarmac after he stepped off of Air Force One at a Houston military base. Abbott joined Trump for the short ride in the presidential limousine to a coast guard hangar where the meeting with Santa Fe families was taking place. Trump was then scheduled to attend several political events in Houston and Dallas. A White House official did not immediately respond to requests for details about how much money was to be raised, and who was benefiting, from the fundraising events."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/03/austerity-eu-problem-same-as-britain-brexit-tories-thatcher","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T06:00:39Z","webTitle":"The EU’s problem is the same as Britain’s: austerity","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/03/austerity-eu-problem-same-as-britain-brexit-tories-thatcher","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/03/austerity-eu-problem-same-as-britain-brexit-tories-thatcher","fields":{"headline":"The EU’s problem is the same as Britain’s: austerity","bodyText":"George Soros is right: Europe faces an existential crisis, not least because of an addiction to austerity that has certainly contributed to Italy’s summer of discontent. This makes it all the more urgent that the time-and resource-consuming wastefulness of Brexit be brought to an end, and the sooner the better. There are huge problems facing Europe: in addition to the domestic damage the prospect of Brexit is causing, it constitutes a huge distraction from the reforms the EU requires. It is no use waiting several years. The damage to our economy is manifest already, and the Treasury, Bank of England and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are not employing empty threats in concluding that things are set to go from bad to worse, as the investment so vital for productivity is postponed and the public and private sectors suffer recruitment problems. The follies of Brexit are impressively outlined in a new book, Saving Britain, by my colleague Will Hutton and my former colleague Andrew Adonis. They link the outcome of the referendum less to concerns about immigration (although there is no denying that was a factor) than to the cumulative impact of austerity – yet note that prominent Brexiter Lord Lawson is on record as saying that Brexit would help to complete the “Thatcher revolution”. They provide us with a gripping account of how, through his influence on the public debate, “Mr Farage became leader of the Conservative party” in all but name, adding: “The genius of the Eurosceptic right was to take none of the blame for its own domestic policies, but to offload it instead onto the EU and immigration.” Sometimes it takes outside observers to add that extra insight into the social damage successive British governments have inflicted on areas of this country. Occasionally this service is provided by the New York Times, which did it last week in a report on a northern English town that exemplifies the ills identified by Soros. It was a front-page story – a piece of reporting that, despite objections to it from some quarters, brought home the impact of the drastic cuts in public spending, especially in central government grants to local authorities, since 2010. Its message could be summarised thus: after eight years of budget-cutting, Britain is looking less like the rest of Europe and more like the US, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty. Notwithstanding the travails of Italy – not least the terribly high unemployment in the south of the country – European values still matter. Given the appalling state of so many of our public services, we as a nation need to take note of the way Scandinavian countries recognise that good public services have to be paid for by realistic levels of taxation. Alas, leaving the EU would only compound our problems. David Cameron made a potentially fatal commitment in his notorious Bloomberg speech of 2013: bowing to relentless pressure from Ukip and Eurosceptic MPs, he promised a referendum, in the hope of appealing directly to the people and overcoming the obstacles posed by the Tories’ internecine strife. Harold Wilson did this in 1975 over Labour party divisions on Europe and succeeded. Cameron failed lamentably. Then came two serious mistakes by the government: first, they did not get across to the public the degree to which the smooth running of our economy depends on the results of 45 years of integrating into the EU. Second, having messed up the referendum, they did not take nearly seriously enough the advice from our former ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, about how Brussels actually works, and how our negotiating strategy was based on an unfortunate blend of ignorance and fantasy. Of course, being a good – indeed outstanding – civil servant, Rogers did not put it quite like that. But that was the gravamen of his message. These “negotiations” are getting nowhere, slowly. There is a train crash coming, probably in Northern Ireland, which to my mind poses an insoluble dilemma for Theresa May’s “Brexit means Brexit” strategy. Bespoke “have your cake and eat it” arrangements? As Rogers said in a lecture in Glasgow recently: “There is no legal status of being a third country, which used to be a member, and therefore can be treated radically better than other third countries.” In the first John le Carré novel in which George Smiley appears, the great man remarks of one character: “He was one of those world-builders who seem to do nothing but destroy.” For me, that sums up the typical Brexiter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/31/italys-populist-leaders-strike-deal-resurrect-coalition","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T16:45:16Z","webTitle":"Italy: populist government sworn in as political deadlock ends","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/31/italys-populist-leaders-strike-deal-resurrect-coalition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/31/italys-populist-leaders-strike-deal-resurrect-coalition","fields":{"headline":"Italy: populist government sworn in as political deadlock ends","bodyText":"Italy’s new populist government has been sworn in to power after the president, Sergio Mattarella, agreed to a revised slate of ministers – just days after a bitter row over the incoming leaders’ stance on the euro ended their initial bid to assume power. Giuseppe Conte was sworn in as prime minister on Friday after a last-ditch coalition deal ended months of political deadlock and narrowly avoided snap elections in the eurozone’s third largest economy. Conte, an academic and political novice, will head a government of ministers from the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League party. The first populist coalition in a founding EU member has raised concerns in some European quarters. The 53-year-old was sworn in alongside his cabinet, which will see the M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, and League chief, Matteo Salvini, in key ministerial posts. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, congratulated Conte on Friday, saying the bloc would be attentive to his reform plans. The deal will bring at least temporary calm to a political crisis that has embroiled Italy for weeks. The tumult raised questions – in Brussels and among investors around the world – about whether the rise in Italian populism and the collapse of traditional parties posed a fundamental threat to the country’s future in the eurozone. The formation of the new government will at least temporarily allay those concerns, because it will remove for now the threat that snap elections will be called later this summer, a prospect that worried investors because it could have bolstered support for anti-EU parties. The populist leaders stepped back from their insistence that Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old Eurosceptic, should serve as finance minister. The choice had been vetoed by Mattarella, prompting the M5S and the League to call off their deal. Savona will now serve as EU minister instead. But there are still many unknowns about how the new administration – an uneasy alliance between two former political opponents, both jockeying for power – will govern Italy. Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic leader of the League , who rose in recent years on the back of incendiary and racist statements about migrants and Roma, will take on the role of interior minister. Salvini has campaigned on the promise of mass deportations of migrants and said a new government would build detention centres around Italy. He is also a fierce critic of Brussels and has called for closer ties to Russia. Di Maio will take on a powerful new post that will combine labour and industry portfolios in a move that could mark big changes to labour and environmental policies, given the M5S’s stated opposition to big industry. Giovanni Tria, a little known economics professor, was named to lead the finance ministry. While Tria has been critical of the EU, he is not been seen as an advocate for an exit from the eurozone. The new deal was blessed by Mattarella, who earlier this week nominated a technocrat, Carlo Cottarelli, to serve as prime minister. Those plans were put on hold after Mattarella opted to give the populists more time to reach a new agreement. The new government is expected to take a far more antagonistic stance against Brussels than the previous government, headed by the centre-left Democratic party. But the alliance between the M5S and the League will have only a relatively narrow majority in the Italian senate, easing concerns among investors and officials in Brussels over the its decision-making. While both parties are populist in nature, and have railed against Brussels and Italian “elites”, they have long been natural opponents in politics. Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence in London, said: “They are both led by young and ambitious leaders who share prime-ministerial ambitions. Due to mutual distrust, it has taken both parties over 70 days to reach a deal and choose an unknown third figure as prime minister.” Their shared agenda includes plans to cut taxes, scrap a previously agreed pension plan and institute a “universal basic income”. While many officials in Brussels sought to ease tensions with Rome this week, Juncker had issued a tough critique of Italy on Thursday. He said Italians needed to work harder, be less corrupt and stop looking to the EU to rescue the country’s poor regions. “Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness,” Juncker said. “We will help them as we always did. But don’t play this game of loading with responsibility the EU. A country is a country, a nation is a nation. Countries first, Europe second.” Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/31/the-guardian-view-on-a-journalists-return-the-death-was-fake-the-damage-was-not","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T17:38:00Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on a journalist’s return: the death was fake, the damage was not | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/the-guardian-view-on-a-journalists-return-the-death-was-fake-the-damage-was-not","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/31/the-guardian-view-on-a-journalists-return-the-death-was-fake-the-damage-was-not","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on a journalist’s return: the death was fake, the damage was not","bodyText":"Arkady Babchenko rose from the dead on Wednesday, to the joy of those who know and love him. The truth, long a casualty of the war that began in Ukraine four years ago, will not recover so easily. The announcement that the “murder” of the exiled Russian journalist had been staged provoked shock and anger as well as relief. The emotion of his sympathisers was mirrored by evident glee on the part of pro-Russian social media users, quick to exploit its wider potential by renewing attacks on the “Skripal fairytale” and warning: “Next time you show me photos from Syria by ‘White Helmets’ I will show photo of ‘dead Arkady Babchenko killed by Putin’.” The “death” was concocted by the SBU, Ukraine’s security service. The fear Mr Babchenko has lived with, as an outspoken critic of the Kremlin, was not. He fled Russia in February 2017, writing that it was “a country I no longer feel safe in”. Many other journalists from his newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, have been killed, including Anna Politkovskaya, gunned down in the stairwell of her apartment block. Critics and opponents of the Russian government have died well beyond its borders: a British public inquiry into Alexander Litvinenko’s 2006 death in London concluded that he was probably murdered on the orders of Vladimir Putin. Ukraine never looked like the safest home; in 2016, the journalist Pavel Sheremet – a friend of the assassinated Russian politician Boris Nemtsov and a critic of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents as well as the leader of his own Belarus – died in a car blast in Kiev. Mr Babchenko participated in this sting not as a reporter but as a potential victim. (He wanted first to disappear to the north pole – but “[Sergei] Skripal also tried to hide”, he told reporters; “You are thinking about how to survive.”) Unfortunately, that will not prevent the unscrupulous from exploiting his involvement to cast doubt upon media independence and portray journalists as complicit with security services and willing to bend the truth more generally. That insults not only Russian journalists under intense pressure, but all those risking their lives to report: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 18 have been murdered worldwide since the year began. The real questions are about the decisions made by Ukrainian authorities. The SBU has argued, so far not convincingly, that faking Mr Babchenko’s death was the only way to prevent his assassination, arrest the man who commissioned the hit and capture evidence of its organisers. The plan’s elaborate nature is all the more striking set against their failure to find the killer of Sheremet, and the considerable questions surrounding his death: last year a documentary alleged that an agent working for the SBU witnessed the planting of the car bomb. Worse still was the stagey delight with which officials revealed their plot, evidently feeling that they had got one over on Moscow. The president, Petro Poroshenko, lauded a “brilliant operation” – though diplomats are now sounding a more defensive note. At best, the importance of the ends blinded the service to the danger of the means. Far from damaging Moscow’s narrative, they have handed its propagandists a gift. Even if they produce apparently cast-iron evidence of high-level Russian involvement – and so far there has been nothing approaching that – how many will take heed? If it is possible to fake a murder, why not audio recordings or documents? The sting has rebounded upon them. Many will be inclined not only to treat Ukrainian statements with rightful scepticism in future, but perhaps to dismiss them outright. Unfortunately, Kiev’s actions have not only damaged the already very limited trust in the Ukrainian government, but risk hurting trust more broadly. At a time of cynicism and deliberate manipulation, when “fake news” is the rallying cry of those seeking to bury facts, and when lies are proven to spread faster than the truth, such injuries are more serious than ever. One Ukrainian MP compared the plot to Sherlock Holmes faking his own death “to effectively investigate difficult and complicated crimes”. Apparently he, like the SBU, is hazy about the importance of the line between fact and fiction. But when they are so careless, others pay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/01/conservatives-islamophobia-muslim-council-britain","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T16:39:22Z","webTitle":"The Tories have an Islamophobia problem.

Will they tackle it?","bodyText":"This week, the Muslim Council of Britain – of which I am assistant secretary general – wrote to the Conservative chair, Brandon Lewis, detailing the many incidents of unchecked Islamophobia within his party. The MCB chose its words carefully, explicitly refraining from calling the party inherently Islamophobic. But the letter did call for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia so that the Conservatives could acknowledge the problem and find ways to fix it. As chairman, Lewis is the person who could make a difference. But in recent weeks, he and the party’s deputy chair, James Cleverly, have played down Islamophobia among Conservatives despite the wealth of evidence to the contrary. Take Zac Goldsmith’s campaign for London mayor. The way devout Muslims were depicted in that campaign was described by Andrew Boff, the most senior Conservative in the London assembly, as “outrageous”. Yet, senior figures within the party appeared to take an active role in the strategy. Theresa May, home secretary at the time, declared Khan unsafe to run London because of an alleged history of defending extremists; and David Cameron and the then defence secretary, Michael Fallon, falsely accused an imam associated with Khan of supporting Islamic State. The claim was later retracted (Fallon had to pay damages). After his mayoral defeat, Goldsmith remained in the party despite there being no apology, no acknowledgement of the racism of the campaign and despite the fact continued to state that Khan had links to extremism. One MP, Bob Blackman, shared an anti-Muslim tweet from the far-right activist Tommy Robinson in 2016, though he claims it was an “error”. He also hosted a hardline anti-Muslim Hindu nationalist in parliament. He was also a member of Islamophobic Facebook groups including Britain for the British. Just this week, he was revealed to have shared a tweet by the website ShankhNaad, which has been accused of publishing false stories designed to cause tensions between Hindus and Muslims. It’s not just MPs. Conservative candidates and councillors exhibit Islamophobia on a weekly basis. One shared a post that called Muslims “parasites”, another endorsed the idea that Muslims should be “repatriated” to keep Europe safe, and another was exposed as being a former “security adviser” to the British National party. This overwhelming evidence of Islamophobia is extremely serious and merits urgent action. Sayeeda Warsi, the first Muslim to serve in cabinet and the party’s former chair, believes there is a “simmering underbelly” of Islamophobia in the party. Lady Warsi raised her concerns informally and formally, including a letter to the prime minister last year, but on each occasion, she says the party “shrugged its shoulders” and did nothing. The decision by the MCB to issue a formal letter on this issue has not been reached lightly. The Conservative party has so far chosen to be defensive, rather than engage with the cases put forward. But a Conservative party that deals with Islamophobia will not only increase its support among Muslims who share its values – 11% voted for the party in 2017 – it would also strengthen our democracy.

The Home Office has now announced a welcome review. But what happens while the review takes place? Under para 322(5) the victims may no longer face the threat of immediate deportation, but they are barred from earning a living or access to the NHS.

Dick Taverne Liberal Democrat, House of Lords • Timothy Garton Ash (1 June) is not the only one to fear for the future of the European project. However, I find fighting talk about reclaiming “European sovereignty” as depressing and shortsighted as Brexit. Mass migration is not a “threat” to Europe; it is a complex human struggle driven by war, poverty and climate breakdown, issues in which we are globally complicit. The approval in April of a new immigration law cuts asylum application deadlines, doubles detention times and will introduce a one-year prison term for entering France illegally. In northern France, police are confiscating tents and removing shoes from refugees. This does not make Macron “impressive” and “compelling”, it makes him cruel and miserly – the same as all other European leaders who are overwhelmed by their obligations and so retreat to identity politics. We might feel reassured pretending this emperor is the one wearing shiny new clothes, but we have a greater responsibility to our neighbours – people, not “juggernauts” about to “trample us”.

The Metropolitan police would start a pilot of the deferred prosecutions scheme as it searched for new ways to stop violence and for longer term solutions, Scotland Yard’s head of countering gang and gun crime told the Guardian. Deferred prosecutions were one of the key recommendations of a government-backed review of racial inequality in the criminal justice system, which reported last September. Commander James Stokley said: “Rather than trying to prosecute a young person for a minor offence, rather than criminalising them, is there a way of delaying that prosecution and then offering them diversion, with a mentor, to help them into employment or education, with a view to not having a life of crime.” He said the majority of young people who got involved in gun and knife crime could be saved by preventative measures. While details of the scheme have yet to be laid out, in a similar pilot in Durham offences including assault, drug possession, minor assault, fraud and some thefts were considered for deferral. The Met initiative comes amid growing concern about violent crime, which has led to a sharp rise in London’s homicide rate this year, and debate about how to deal with its causes. Stokley said police could not arrest their way out of the problem, and a greater emphasis on prevention had produced impressive results so far. “If you take people out of that environment … I think the majority of people would want to not be part of that life,” he said. “Some young people could possibly be trapped within that life and if you give them the opportunity and the time to come out of it, then you have saved not only their lives, but potentially people they could have committed violence against. “If you just chose to arrest and imprison them, that is not going to be the solution to get them out of that life.” Stokley cautioned that the approach would not work for offenders who appeared to be committed to a violent or criminal way of life. Durham police, who were the second to trial the scheme after the West Midlands, say it has proved successful in stopping violence and cutting re-offending rates. Research on the West Midlands scheme found victims were more satisfied with deferred prosecutions. It was a key recommendation from the review into racial disparities in the criminal justice system, led by the Labour MP David Lammy. One of the biggest flaws in the criminal justice system is the high rate of re-offending. Official figures for 2016 showed adults released from custodial sentences of less than 12 months had a re-offending rate of 63.8%. Stokley said a combination of factors contributed to why people offended: “It can be to do with education, housing, health, it could possibly be to do with policing … They might want some sense of belonging … they might want to obtain the perceived trappings of success, of dealing drugs to get a car, nice clothes … There are so many factors, that’s why there is no one solution to it.” He said the Met’s more traditional criminal work, known as “pursue”, had resulted in record numbers of guns being taken off the streets last year, and that would continue. Stokley said the Met may adapt Durham’s approach to deferred prosecutions to suit the needs of the capital. Mike Barton, the chief constable of Durham, denied it was a soft option. “It’s not going soft, it’s going sensible,” he said. “When we ask victims what they want most, they do not want future victims. What we are doing is preventing re-offending better than the current system, which is a revolving door.” The Lammy review said those convicted of minor offences had their life chances damaged because employers were put off by their criminal record. The report said: “The deferred prosecution model, which takes plea decisions out of the equation, has produced impressive results and should be rolled out across the country.” Stokley said that under an exisiting diversion programme, which offers mentoring, re-offending rates had fallen to 7%. The Met is considering other options to deal with suspects, beyond the courts. Commissioner Cressida Dick has been to Scotland to learn about their approach to knife crime, which is treated as a public health issue. Chris Sims, who was chief constable of West Midlands when the deferral scheme began, said he and his colleagues realised the courts system offered a poor deal. “Diverting people from the courts into more appropriate treatment or community action is a better deal for the victims, the offender and society as a whole.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/jun/01/trump-comments-on-jobs-report-before-its-official-release","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T13:22:31Z","webTitle":"Trump appears to comment on jobs report before its official release","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jun/01/trump-comments-on-jobs-report-before-its-official-release","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/jun/01/trump-comments-on-jobs-report-before-its-official-release","fields":{"headline":"Trump appears to comment on jobs report before its official release","bodyText":"Donald Trump broke with years of protocol on Friday, commenting on the US’s latest jobs report an hour before its official release. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced at 8.30am that the US had added 223,000 new jobs in May as the unemployment rate slid t0 3.8%, its lowest level since April 2000 and one of the lowest levels since after the second world war. Trump, who has taken credit for job market growth despite the fact that it began under Obama, said on Twitter he was looking forward to the release of the monthly jobs report just over an hour ahead of its release. Following his tweet, treasury yields moved sharply higher. The monthly report is one of the most market sensitive pieces of economic information released by the government and is carefully guarded ahead of its release. For anyone other than the president, the comment would likely lead to an investigation or likely firing. The report is given to senior White House officials the day before its release but is usually closely protected. Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, said Trump should never again be given sight of the figures before their release. “You should have gotten the employment numbers from the Council of Economic Advisers yesterday. And if this tweet is conveying inside information about a particularly good jobs number you should never get them in advance from the Council of Economic Advisers again,” he wrote on Twitter. The latest gains were in retail trade, healthcare and construction, and wage growth – which has been slow since the end of the recession – picked up modestly. From a year ago, wages were up 2.7% – better than the 2.6% growth economists had forecast. So far this year the US has now added 207,000 new jobs a month, continuing a record nine-year streak of job creation. The strong numbers come as some economists worry that a threatened trade war could damage the US economy and as investors fret that the news will further pressure the Federal Reserve to speed up the rate at which it increases interest rates. But the report highlighted once again that many Americans remain on the sidelines despite the tightening labor market. The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of workers in jobs or looking for work, edged down to 62.7% from 62.8% in April – levels last seen in the 1970s. That fall in participation was partly responsible for the latest dip in the unemployment rate, said the Economic Policy institute. “About two-thirds of the drop in the unemployment rate in May was because workers found jobs, while about one-third of the drop was from people leaving the labor force,” wrote EPi economist Elise Gould in a blog post."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/jun/07/top-200-universities-in-the-world-2019-the-table","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-07T09:59:41Z","webTitle":"Top 200 universities in the world 2019 - the table","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/jun/07/top-200-universities-in-the-world-2019-the-table","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/jun/07/top-200-universities-in-the-world-2019-the-table","fields":{"headline":"Top 200 universities in the world 2019 - the table","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/blog/2018/jun/01/community-chest-hendon-fc-fans","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T15:27:43Z","webTitle":"How tragedy led to Hendon’s offer of free tickets to isolated fans | Simon Burnton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jun/01/community-chest-hendon-fc-fans","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/blog/2018/jun/01/community-chest-hendon-fc-fans","fields":{"headline":"How tragedy led to Hendon’s offer of free tickets to isolated fans","bodyText":"It was still less than a week ago that an unusually emotional Champions League final featured a player from each side depart in tears before half-time and the losing goalkeeper, whose individual errors swung the game, report the following afternoon that he “hadn’t really slept” as “the scenes are running through my head again and again”. Also last Saturday, Tom Cairney scored the only goal as he captained Fulham to victory in the Championship play-off final and declared his side’s promotion was “a dream come true. It feels incredible. It feels like an out-of-body feeling”. Meanwhile Steve Bruce, the manager of defeated Aston Villa, described “a feeling of utter disappointment for everybody”. “It was heartbreaking,” said their midfielder Josh Onomah, who had spent the season on loan from Tottenham. “I’ve got to get my head around the result. It was just so disappointing we lost.” John Terry cried on to the shoulder of Jack Grealish, said he was “absolutely devastated” and left the club within days. Whether on the pitch or in the stands, sport has a particular ability to toy with the emotions of all involved with the violent unpredictability of a cat with a field mouse, with the chance of ending the experience feeling only metaphorically chewed up. It is no accident the phrase “emotional rollercoaster” has been used by British national newspapers in football reports precisely 400 times over the past decade, averaging one use in every week of every football season. Hendon FC, who play at level seven of English football’s pyramid, are all too aware of the sport’s sometimes savage cruelty. They finished third in last season’s Isthmian League Premier Division to qualify for the promotion play-offs, in which they merrily thrashed Folkestone Invicta 4-0 in the semi-final before losing to Dulwich Hamlet after extra time and penalties with, in the words of the club’s own match report, a feeling among the players of “abject misery and exhaustion”. But though misery is never an emotion to be cherished, there is a certain pleasure to be had in sharing it, even if in Hendon’s case it would not be with an enormous number of people – average attendance last season was just 245. It is one reason why the club has decided that in the future they will offer free tickets to anyone “suffering from depression or loneliness or anything similar”, with anyone interested invited to contact the chairman, Simon Lawrence, at his personal email address. “If anyone comes forward and says, ‘I’m lonely’ or ‘I’m depressed’, the chances are they’re lonely and depressed,” he says. “It’s quite an admission, really quite courageous, to say to people that your life isn’t perfect. It doesn’t cost us anything to do something good. “Almost certainly, the person who gets the free ticket wouldn’t have bought one anyway but even if they would we lose out to the tune of £11, and I think we can live with that. And maybe somebody is going to come along – there might only be one all season – who watches a game and starts to feel like this is something they might want to be a part of.” This week Chelsea decided to put a £1bn stadium redevelopment on hold because of the “current unfavourable investment climate”. The plan, similar to that nearing completion at Tottenham, was designed to allow them to attract fans in sufficient numbers and to charge sufficient prices to allow them to compete with the Premier League’s other giants without the endless assistance of friendly bottomless-pocketed oligarchs. The focus on cash over community is understandable, and probably essential, at the highest level. Further down the pyramid, and particularly for a club such as Hendon, who have been in their own new stadium for only two seasons and are still establishing themselves in the area, those priorities are not so much reversed as totally intertwined. Hendon’s unusual offer may be intended to assist individuals and to cement their place in their community but it was born of tragedy. Last November Dermot Drummy, one of the club’s greatest and best-loved players, a product of Arsenal’s youth system and later the manager of Chelsea’s academy and their reserves, died suddenly. In April the coroner recorded he had killed himself. Drummy had gone into first-team management at Crawley Town in April 2016 and had struggled after leaving the job 13 months later. “He was just an all-round good guy, with a really bubbly personality,” Lawrence says. “He was very loved and very well respected. Genuinely I do not understand how somebody could be in such a terrible place. I went to his funeral; it was as crowded a funeral as I’ve ever seen and I think everybody was just completely blown away.” The idea to offer free seats was the result of a conversation between Lawrence and a volunteer at the club on the day the coroner reached his verdict. Demand may be great or it may be nonexistent but it illustrates an awareness, certainly not unique to Hendon, that a club’s focus on fans cannot entirely be about how much cash can be squeezed out of them. “At Hendon if we were to be remembered not for the cups that we’ve won or the league titles that we’ve won,” Lawrence says, “but for doing some good things in the field of mental health, I certainly won’t be disappointed.” • In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Some US politicians have seized on these reports to construct conspiracy theories in which they imagine a mysterious disease-causing “sound ray gun” – something that isn’t possible with today’s technology. These same politicians have used their positions of authority to present their speculations to a credulous public as though they are fact. The pronouncements, in turn, have led to international confrontation and hysteria, resulting in the removal and expulsion of diplomats, and travel advisories. Now, an apparently analogous incident has been reported in China. A “preliminary communication” from the University of Pennsylvania, with US government support, published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), has been used to buttress this putative “acoustic attack” idea with science. In fact, that work is deeply flawed, and does nothing to support the attack theory. We thus applaud the recent paper by Sergio Della Sala and Robert McIntosh, for its thoughtful criticisms of the JAMA report, and praise the effort described in the Guardian (Cuba calls on US and Canada to investigate ‘sonic attack’ claims, 29 May) to engage in an international scientific collaboration to study any connection between the illnesses and sound. Science works best this way, when qualified people can evaluate evidence without political pressure to draw poorly founded conclusions. We hope that sober and calmer heads will prevail in de-escalating this frenzy, avoiding a chill in both diplomatic relations and scientific collaboration between the US and Cuba.

Researchers found that a range of connected appliances – increasingly popular features of the so-called smart home – send data to their manufacturers and third-party companies, in some cases failing to keep the information secure. One Samsung smart TV connected to more than 700 distinct internet addresses in 15 minutes. The investigation, by Which? magazine, found televisions selling viewing data to advertisers, toothbrushes with access to smartphone microphones, and security cameras that could be hacked to let others watch and listen to people in their homes. The findings have alarmed privacy campaigners, who warn that consumers are unknowingly building a “terrifying” world of corporate surveillance. “Smart devices are increasingly being exposed as soft surveillance devices that owners have too little control of,” said Silkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch. “People are now being subjected to invasive and unnecessary corporate snooping on an unprecedented scale. “The very notion of a smart home is one of ambient surveillance and constant recording, which will without doubt lead people to modify their behaviour over time. If this current direction is continued, we will become a society of watched consumers subjected to the most granular, pervasive and inescapable surveillance. It is a terrifying thought.” Which? bought more than £3,000 worth of smart home equipment and set it up in a lab to monitor how much data was being collected and transferred. As well as the manufacturers, more than 20 other companies were on the receiving end of data transfers including social networks, third-party monitoring services, advertising and marketing data brokers. Just one device – a Samsung smart TV – connected to more than 700 distinct internet addresses after being used for 15 minutes. If the viewer accepts Samsung’s privacy policy, the company gains the right to monitor what is being watched and when. It uploads some of that data to Samsung’s advertising platform, Which? says, “suggesting it is used for marketing”. Another Samsung device, the company’s Smartthings hub, sits at the heart of the smart home and has a privacy policy that allows aggregated information to be shared with “advertisers and/or merchant partners”. Other devices didn’t transmit much data but unnecessarily asked for it anyway, creating the possibility of breaches down the line. A Philips bluetooth toothbrush, for instance, links up with a smartphone app to monitor brushing habits, frequency and technique. But the app also asks for location information, which Philips said was used only to find a local company store, and microphone access – Philips said this wasn’t used at all. Some devices collected only the data they should, but then failed to keep it secure. Which? tested a security camera, sold under the IeGeek brand, and found a security flaw in the app that meant the company could access usernames and passwords for other cameras. If they had misused that access, they could have seen live video feeds from other people’s homes, and even talked to those users. That flaw was fixed by IeGeek, but Which? has since found others that are still live. Alex Neill, the managing director of Which? home products and services, said the investigation showed the downside of a digital home. “Smart home gadgets and devices can bring huge benefits to our daily lives, but our investigation shows they can collect vast amounts of data about us,” he told the Guardian. “Companies should be clear about how they are collecting and using data and ensure consumers feel in control about what they are sharing – without having to trawl through impenetrable terms and conditions.” While users may be comfortable trading their data for free services, or for a better quality of product, Which? suggested that it may be worth thinking twice about intrusive monitoring connected to paid products – particularly when “dumb” devices are frequently cheaper, and just as useful. “Not all data collection is bad,” the organisation concluded. “In fact there can be real benefits for those who want a more personalised service or some extra features. However, you need to know what you’re getting into when you choose to buy an internet-connected product over a traditional ‘dumb’ one. With services such as Facebook and Gmail, you’re getting a free resource in exchange, at least partially, for access to your data. “With products that you’ve purchased, however, there’s even more onus on companies to be transparent over what information they’re collecting, and how it is being used.” In a statement, Samsung said: “Samsung takes consumers’ privacy and data security very seriously and is in compliance with all the EU directives and regulations of member states on personal data privacy. We have also taken extra steps given the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in order to ensure our compliance with the regulation. “We will continue to work on strengthening and improving our policies, procedures, organizational structures and systems to ensure our customers have more control over their personal data and to guarantee a high level of data protection.” Which?’s research comes days after Google made a new push into the smart home market, launching a video doorbell in the UK that uses facial recognition technology to identify friends and family when they’re at the front door. The Nest Hello, from the search firm’s smart home division, is a £229 wifi-connected doorbell that uses a wide angle camera to pump video footage of visitors to connected smartphones. A bundled AI system can analyse video from the front door automatically, alerting residents to suspicious visitors while welcoming loved ones and residents. The device may raise privacy fears, analysts warned. “Facial recognition on smart home cameras is not something new but the Nest Hello will likely raise awareness among consumers that could spark a deeper debate about the implications of such technology being deployed by people’s front doors,” Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, said. “This could be a major challenge for Google given the broader unease around privacy at present.” Which? has also been carrying out a policy study to understand the public’s attitudes to data collection and use. The report, to be published on 5 June, will raise important questions about how to build consumer confidence in the data ecosystem following the introduction of GDPR, it says."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/01/can-germaine-greer-still-be-called-a-feminist-after-her-comments-on-rape","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T16:00:09Z","webTitle":"Can Germaine Greer still be called a feminist after her comments on rape? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/01/can-germaine-greer-still-be-called-a-feminist-after-her-comments-on-rape","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/01/can-germaine-greer-still-be-called-a-feminist-after-her-comments-on-rape","fields":{"headline":"Can Germaine Greer still be called a feminist after her comments on rape?","bodyText":"There are important points in Germaine Greer’s proposal to reduce sentences for rape (See rape as careless instead of violent and lower the punishment, says Greer, 31 May) but it is a pity she presents it in such a provocative manner – as if she intended to anger victims of rape. Given the nature of the adversarial legal system, rape cases always end up with, in the absence of witnesses, the jury trying to figure out who is telling the truth – the alleged victim or the alleged perpetrator. There is a far greater onus on the victim to prove it was non-consensual sex. The truth is often somewhere in between, as communications around sex tend to get lost in translation, as Greer points out. Could a rape charge be reduced to a charge of unintentional sexual assault, similar to a murder charge being reduced to manslaughter – and thus the sentencing reduced? Would this lesser charge allow an accused man to admit that he had not realised his actions were being received as harmful (by the complainant) and that, on reflection, her enthusiastic consent was not so certain? Where Greer really goes wrong is when she tells us that women love men more than men love women, and that women love their sons more than their daughters. Insulting to both men and women, this sounds more like the 1950s patriarchy than the sort of feminist rallying call for which she was such a remarkable advocate in the 1970s. Alison Hackett Dun Laoghaire, Co Dublin, Ireland • I have assessed 463 asylum seekers to write medico-legal reports for the courts: 355 men and 108 women. I have seen some horrific scars of torture. I have also heard 58 accounts of rape: 28 men and 30 women. Every person has found it horribly difficult to speak to me about their rape. They are deeply humiliated, and their distress about the rape is more than that about the whipping, beating and burning they have suffered. It is true that there are frequently no physical scars of rape. The scars are in their mental state, in their sense of self. Their modesty and privacy have been violated; they are deeply humiliated. Marriages are broken, single women feel they cannot marry, men are ashamed to speak of it. One man rushed out of my room to be sick when he started to speak of his rape, although he had been able to describe being hung upside down, burned and whipped with reasonable calm. Rape is violation of the soul – do not forget that. We should give victims all the support we can. Dr Charmian Goldwyn London • Germaine Greer has some important things to say. So important that the headline to your report should be challenged. Let’s address the content though, as much of what she said is very significant. Non-consensual sex is common. It means that one person gets what they want against another’s will in a uniquely personal way. One will be triumphant, sated or vindicated, and the other ashamed, diminished and angry. Or pregnant or infected. Is Greer right to distinguish between rapes that involve penetration against our will and a violent hatred of women by violent men? Yes, I believe she is. What is wrong is the clumsy nature of our courts. Having read The Secret Barrister, I am convinced that the adversarial system is the wrong one to give justice to violated women and girls. Jacqueline Darby Twickenham, Middlesex • Laura Bates (Germaine Greer’s comments on rape are dangerous and damaging, theguardian.com, 31 May) does a good job of exposing how wrong Greer’s opinions are, but I wish she, and others who do so, would cease describing Greer as a “leading feminist”. She wrote a book a long time ago. She was not and has never been a leading figure in the women’s liberation movement – we eschewed leaders as a matter of political principle, in fact – and she is not a spokesperson for anyone but herself. Her comments and attitudes have often been a source of embarrassment, which I believe lack depth of understanding or feminist analysis, and these latest statements are so crass and ridiculous as to make it a matter of debate whether she can really even be called a feminist.

The annual total in dad’s case came at most to a dozen small bottles of beer plus a whisky at New Year, while over the same 12 months Mum might have two or three glass of advocaat mixed with lemonade, and at New Year a couple more of sherry. These tiny amounts have to be measured against my own domestic intake of getting on for three bottles of wine a week, or let’s say 150 bottles a year, which takes no account of the uncertain number swallowed outside the house at restaurants, farewell parties, funerals and the homes of friends. I console myself with the fact that I hardly ever drink spirits or beer, rather like the brandy-befuddled shepherd whom Richard Hannay meets in The Thirty-Nine Steps, who can’t understand his condition: the shepherd considers himself a teetotaller because he “keepit aff the whisky”. In truth, compared to the good and sober habits of my parents, my consumption is shameful. They would be worried by the ritual that occurs more evenings than not: the squeak of the corkscrew, the glug of wine into glass, the question: “Oh, shall we have another?” In their day, the alcohol that was kept in the house hardly ever left its little cupboard. A bottle of cognac and a bottle of Glenlivet, given to my grandparents at their wedding in 1899, lay there unopened. Slowly their gilt labels (“Bruce &amp; Glen, wine merchants, Dunfermline”) turned black with the passing years. I don’t think my mother was ever in a bar, and my father entered them only reluctantly after pressure from his workmates or brothers-in-law. We were a respectable family. Some fathers in the neighbourhood drank on a Saturday night. Others – “family men” – took their wives and children to the pictures. The typical Scottish bar hid behind painted or heavily curtained windows; when the door swung open you glimpsed a forbidden interior of talkative men and tobacco smoke. Later, on the last bus home (from the Regal cinema, in my case, from the Volunteer Arms in his) one of these men might be sick, the yeasty liquid changing its course across the floor as the bus went up or down a hill. Or there would be someone in overalls – “still in his working clothes”, other passengers might say sorrowfully – who needed the conductor’s help to get down, having stayed in the pub till 10pm instead of going home to have tea with his wife. In the 1950s and 1960s it was possible to see scenes like these as the dwindling remnants of a darker past, when the industrial working class regularly anaesthetised themselves with beer and whisky, to add to the squalid chaos of their surroundings, the neglect of their children, the bruising of their wives, etc. Out of this time had come the temperance movement, which taught my mother as a schoolgirl to write “alcohol is a poison not a food” in her exercise books and equipped my 16-year-old father with an ornate certificate from the Christian charity Band of Hope on which he signed a pledge “to abstain from all intoxicating drinks as beverages” – the last two words presumably exempting a medicinal shot of brandy. “Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation,” is inscribed between illustrations of women who sit draped and coiffured like Greek goddesses, one labelled Knowledge and the other Temperance, and each with a child at her knee. Clearly, my parents had entered temptation – advocaat, India pale ale – but it was very slight. Others had fallen much further. As well as the men on the bus, there was the old man who lived with his family in the flat downstairs, who after a Saturday night in the pub would be towed homewards by his dog to ignite scenes of noisy disharmony. But to many people of my parents’ generation, alcohol must have seemed in general retreat. My father remembered how his mother had stretched “vinegar cloots [cloths]” across her husband’s forehead on a Sunday morning after the night before, and how his maternal grandfather had died of drink, alone in an Edinburgh lodging house. It’s easy to detect in this history a pattern of action and reaction – drunks in one generation, abstainers in the next – but in the last century larger forces were also at work. Youth movements such as the Scouts inveighed against drink. Other forms of entertainment, chiefly the cinema and the dance hall, began to change young men’s ideas of an evening out. In the interwar years, intellectual and physical pursuits such as night school classes, hiking and cycling became hugely popular: Charlie Chaplin and the Cyclists Touring Club probably did more to moderate alcohol consumption than the worldwide temperance movement. Male-only pleasures such as an evening in a pub began to look as quaint and outdated as the music hall. In the early 1960s, even in a Scottish provincial town, the coffee bar reigned as the fashionable place to meet and be seen. How, then, did we get from there to here – to a world in which 17-year-old girls develop pancreatitis as a result of excessive drinking, where, to quote its chief executive in England, the NHS is becoming the “national hangover service”; but also to a world in which “overage drinkers”, people like me, are encouraged to change their habits. According to Drink Wise Age Well, a charity headquartered in Glasgow, harmful drinking is increasing more among the over-50s than any other age group. This week I watched a video put out by the charity that showed us either happy and careless or sad and heedless, drinking “a little more than we should” to cope with retirement, bereavement and the empty nest syndrome. A memorable little film that got through four lives and three different problems in 167 seconds. There was Kevin with his cans of lager “who didn’t think his long-anticipated retirement would leave him quite so bored”. There was Liz with her gin and tonic “increasingly isolated since losing her life partner Frank … once the life and soul of every party”. And there were Jackie and Derek, unloading their weekly half-dozen bottles of red from the boot of their little car and soon relaxing with full wine glasses “increasingly enjoying their evening tipple as the long evenings stretch out without the busy chirruping of family life”. There was a grim undertone of as yet undiagnosed diseases; it seemed no coincidence that Frank, who died of bowel cancer, had liked a drink. As I watched, I noted with a little relief that Jackie and Derek were red wine boozers whereas I hardly ever stray from white. Then I made my calculation that suggested Dad drank only a 100th of what I do, and vowed to do better quite soon. • Ian Jack is a regular Guardian contributor"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/01/councils-girls-forced-marriage-child-protection","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T14:19:40Z","webTitle":"When will councils start saving girls from forced marriage ‘holidays’? | Louise Tickle","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/councils-girls-forced-marriage-child-protection","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/01/councils-girls-forced-marriage-child-protection","fields":{"headline":"When will councils start saving girls from forced marriage ‘holidays’?","bodyText":"The 3,500 reports of forced marriage over a three-year period, revealed by the Guardian this week, translates to 22 unwilling brides (sometimes bridegrooms) every single week. That sounds bad enough, but what’s even less palatable is that every such “marriage” means someone is being raped. Typically, repeatedly raped. And it’s the people who are loved and trusted most – mothers and fathers, aunts, uncles and siblings – who are facilitating those rapes. When it’s a minor who is married off against their will, the plain truth is that these relatives are planning, assisting and encouraging child rape. Extraordinary numbers of young women – and sometimes young men – are living in fear of this crime: last year alone the charity Karma Nirvana, which campaigns against “honour”-based violence, took nearly 9,000 calls on its Forced Marriage helpline. Last year, almost 200 of those calls were made either by terrified children aged 15 or under or on their behalf. Their fears are not inflated: it turns out that the majority of applications for forced marriage protection orders are for children aged 17 or under. According to charities that support victims of forced marriage, “honour”-based crimes are most prevalent in diaspora communities from South Asia, the Middle East and north and east Africa practising Muslim, Sikh and Hindu religions, as well as Orthodox Jewish and occasionally Traveller communities. Uncomfortable though it may feel, teachers, police, medical professionals and child protection workers can no longer dance delicately around this, fearful of potential damage to community relations. It’s hard to imagine that anyone might facilitate the repeated rape of their own child, but the numbers tell a different story. And in the past two weeks, a mother in Birmingham and a couple in Leeds have been found guilty of tricking their teenage daughters oversees – to Pakistan in the first case and Bangladesh in the second – to marry against their will. When it’s a minor, the state has enhanced statutory duties under the Forced Marriage Act of 2007 to protect these children – so who was looking after them? In Birmingham, whose children’s services have been in dire straits for years, it appears the answer is, nobody much. When the jury at Birmingham crown court last week returned a guilty verdict, the girl’s mother was jailed, but the city’s children’s services needs to do some serious soulsearching. As the trial unfolded, it became apparent that this young girl had first been raped in Pakistan when she was 13, after which she returned pregnant and had an abortion. Aged 17, she was duped by her mother into going back, and was then married off to the man she’d been promised to previously. Unsurprisingly, after her horrendous experience aged 13, the girl went off the rails when back in Birmingham. Presumably because of concerns for her safety, the local authority did take her into care. But crucially, they did this with her mother’s consent . Questions are now being asked about why Birmingham children services didn’t grasp the risk of her being taken back to Pakistan and married off after her initial nightmare “engagement” trip. Despite the teenager’s incredibly dangerous behaviours on her return, it appears that social workers never asked a court to make a care order. This would have given the council shared parental responsibility, and meant her safety and wellbeing would have been overseen by an independent family judge and regularly reviewed by a senior social worker. With a care order, the local authority would never have had to hand over her passport when her mother demanded it. But despite her social worker’s misgivings stated in evidence in the trial, Birmingham children’s services had no right to withhold the passport. In the Leeds case, children’s services had become involved with the family shortly before the girl was taken to Bangladesh, so clearly there were concerns. Sometimes, it’s true, councils prefer to work collaboratively with families, and may choose to take a child into care by consent. But even so, given what the council knew, it beggars belief that no one saw fit in Birmingham’s children’s services to apply to the courts for a forced marriage protection order, which could have stopped this young woman from once again being whisked out of the country by the parent who had so badly abused her in the past. Jasvinder Sanghera, who founded Karma Nirvana, and Diana Nammi of the Iranian and Kurdish Women’s Rights Organisation, have spent years travelling the length and breadth of the UK to train councillors, MPs, teachers, NHS staff and social workers to recognise the signs that a child is at risk of being taken out of the country and married off. There is a known risk in the West Midlands: the Home Office’s forced marriage unit last year supported more people from the region than anywhere except London. When I have sat in front of a young men and women telling of how they fled actual or threatened forced marriages, their emotional anguish was evident: they knew they would lose their families, their communities, often everyone they loved. It is also sometimes extremely dangerous for victims to disclose their fears; the father in the Leeds case threatened his daughter that he could “chop her up” if she refused to marry. There is no doubt that lives can be at stake. Finally, there is the guilt: it is terribly hard for victims to come forward as they know they will implicate their parents. These young people rely absolutely on professionals to protect and support them. For years, nobody listened hard enough to the words, behaviour or experiences of one vulnerable young girl in Birmingham, and another in Leeds. Now, professionals must be more alert, and much braver, to ensure there are no more victims like them. • Louise Tickle writes for the Guardian on education, social affairs and family law"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"cities/2018/jun/02/the-darker-side-of-groznys-push-to-be-the-dubai-of-the-north-caucasus","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T07:00:12Z","webTitle":"The darker side of Grozny's push to be the Dubai of the North Caucasus","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/02/the-darker-side-of-groznys-push-to-be-the-dubai-of-the-north-caucasus","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jun/02/the-darker-side-of-groznys-push-to-be-the-dubai-of-the-north-caucasus","fields":{"headline":"The darker side of Grozny's push to be the Dubai of the North Caucasus","bodyText":"Sooner or later, it seems, everything in Chechnya will bear the name Akhmat. The name of the republic’s former leader, Akhmat Kadyrov, now adorns the Russian region’s main mosque, the Heart of Chechnya, its major thoroughfare and its state gallery. When the Egyptian national team arrives in Grozny next week, players will practise at the Akhmat Arena, the home grounds for the region’s football team, the recently renamed Akhmat FC. Ramzan Kadyrov, the region’s strongman, has incorporated his father’s name into his unofficial slogan: “Akhmat is power.” So it’s no surprise that a planned skyscraper, the latest megaproject in the capital city of Grozny, will be named Akhmat Tower. Billed as the tallest building in Europe at 102 storeys and a staggering cost of $1bn, it is the embodiment of the city’s feverish aspirations to become a kind of Dubai in the North Caucasus. Beyond the secrecy around the building’s investors there are other hints that this isn’t your average business development. “It’s not seen as correct to speak out of turn about this project. These are cultural differences, you understand. Permission comes from the top down in the republic,” a representative for the developer told me over coffee recently, declining an interview. Instead, he handed over a glossy magazine called Tall Buildings, sponsored by Akhmat Tower’s architect. Akhmat Tower reflects the craze for marketing and PR in modern Chechnya, a province sustained by subsidies from Moscow where poverty rates are among the highest in Russia, but where the Grozny-City complex’s skyscrapers with half-filled offices and a luxury hotel have become the symbol of new wealth. The Chechen government presents Grozny’s carefully-manicured downtown as Exhibit A of the republic’s rebirth following the wars of the 1990s and 2000s that left the capital devastated and hundreds of thousands of civilians dead. “The tower is a symbol of the defeat of good over evil, of our defeat of the threat of international terrorism,” said Dzhambulat Umarov, a regional minister whose portfolio includes media and nationality politics. “The tower is a symbol of the victory of the ideals of the first president of the Chechen Republic, Akhmat Kadyrov.” On a recent Thursday afternoon in Grozny, there were just a handful of people on the sunbaked marble walkways by the Heart of Chechnya mosque, styled after the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. Cafes were mostly closed for the Ramadan fast along Putin Prospekt, the main avenue named in honour of the Russian president. A pair of security guards lazed by a memorial officially dedicated to those killed in the fight against terrorism. Everyone is a bit woozy from the lack of food and water, waiting to break their fast with iftar, the evening meal. The foundation pit lies just across Akhmat Kadyrov Prospekt, right at the heart of the city. At a projected 435 metres (1427 feet), Akhmat Tower will be the tallest building in Europe, erected by a government at its very fringe, embracing a rejection of western liberalism with an ultraconservative ethos that emphasises cohesiveness over individual rights. In practice, those values have taken a dark turn. Numerous reports last year indicated that the region’s authorities rounded up hundreds of gay men and subjected them to beatings and torture. The outcry made Kadyrov a household name in the west. Asked about the purges, Kadyrov appeared to take greater umbrage at the idea that there were any gay Chechens than accusations that they had been jailed or murdered. Before that, he had been accused of practicing collective punishment against the family members of suspected terrorists and of those who protested against his rule, often by burning down family houses. A number of Chechens spoken to for this article declined to be identified by their full names in a western publication. Even casual critics of the government have been publicly shamed on television, sometimes recanting their views by saying they had been possessed by demons. Journalists and rights workers have been the targets of assassinations and charged with serious crimes. A young woman named Mariyam, who works in PR and moves between Grozny and another city in Russia, said that she believed the tower was indicative of a misuse of resources that she thought was tied to self-dealing. “Nobody believes that this is what Chechnya needs right now, or if they believe that, then they believe the propaganda,” she said. “But mostly people just try not to stick their necks out and just live. Honestly speaking, I really think most people don’t have any opinion on this tower at all. It’s too far from their lives.” There isn’t much to see at the moment, just a rectangular foundation pit with pilings blocked off from public view. Construction is active at the Grozny Mall next door, a shopping complex that is expected to serve greater demand than the luxury apartments and offices planned for Akhmat Tower. Already, there are suggestions that construction of the tower has stalled and the 2020 deadline for its construction could be pushed back to 2022 or 2024. The project points to Kadyrov’s ambition for the city to take on an international veneer, modelled on Dubai, that began with the glass towers of the Grozny-City building complex. A deeply coveted sense of internationalism is also lent by the hiring of a firm led by Adrian Smith, the architect behind Dubai’s Burj Khalifa and the Kingdom Tower in Saudi Arabia. Asked about the comparison made between the city and Dubai, Elina Bataeva, the director of a state-backed tour developer, said she supported the development in the city but it helped to keep things in perspective. “People do come just to see Grozny-City. A lot of Russians who haven’t been to Dubai like to compare it. I’ve been to Dubai, so I know it’s not quite Dubai,” she said laughing. “But there is something to the city and the people.” One mystery remains the source of funding. The investors in the tower have not been made public, unlike the Emirati backers for an Islamic university being built downtown, and it is not clear how the building will ever turn a profit. Originally projected to cost $500m, in 2016 the city’s mayor, Muslim Khuchiyev, revealed that the tower would cost more than $1bn. He said then that the building was entirely financed by private investors rather than government subsidies, but declined to name them, fuelling speculation the list could include state-run companies or funds controlled by the Chechen government. A person close to the regional government who spoke on condition of anonymity said that much of the current complex at Grozny-City hasn’t been occupied by any businesses, and that current tenants included state-run companies who were placed there by political decision. The hope, he said, was that the supply for offices space and luxury apartments would eventually create demand. “If there’s a mini-Dubai here, maybe they will come to it,” he said.

This week the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority will be centre stage as he defends – or not – his plan to water down London’s stock market rules for the likes of the oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, an issue that deeply divides the City. Already this year Bailey has fought a protracted battle over the publication of the FCA’s report on how the Royal Bank of Scotland mistreated small business customers. The “whistleblower” affair at Barclays, where the chief executive Jes Staley was fined £642,000 but cleared to stay in his post, was equally high profile. It goes to show what a varied life Bailey leads at the top of the regulatory tree. It is one that has made him favourite with the bookies to be the next governor of the Bank of England when Mark Carney departs next year, which probably reflects a few factors. First, he is now the country’s most widely experienced financial regulator. After a long career at Threadneedle Street, he was switched to the FCA in 2016 to fix an organisation seen as lacking credibility and clout. Second, for all the criticisms that the FCA was slow and soft over RBS’s Global Resructuring Group (GRG), Bailey retains respect in the market. When senior bankers gossip at City dinners over Carney’s successor, they usually conclude that Bailey’s front-runner status is deserved: he has run the FCA, a vast organisation that regulates 56,000 companies, without causing serious headaches for government. Third, he knows the European regulatory landscape backwards, a useful quality as Brexit approaches. So what does he make of reports this week that the Treasury and the Bank are quarrelling over the best Brexit strategy for the City? Chancellor Philip Hammond, it is said, wants to maximise UK firms’ access to the EU market whereas Bank officials think the UK must not offer so many compromises that it ends up becoming “a rule-taker”. “If you put us [the FCA], the Bank of England and the Treasury into a room you would not find differences of view on basic planks of this,” Bailey replies. “Do we believe in open markets? Yes. Do we think it is to the benefit of everybody, including the EU, that we have open markets? Yes. Are we concerned about what we could call ‘narrow’ rule-taking? Well, it would be a problem. “But I think some of this is overblown. We can’t have automatic rule-taking and I don’t think any of us could be comfortable with that because Brussels rings you and tells you what the answer is. That is not a proposition any of us could live with. I don’t think there is a sliver of difference between us on that one. I think we have made some progress. I think we have pushed back on the argument that you can’t have financial services in any trade agreement.” Bailey’s frustrations are directed at the EU side. On transition arrangements, he says “it is proving a bit hard to get engagement on the common technical solutions”. The problem, he argues, is that “if the EU says nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then whatever is said you can’t be certain.” The UK has committed to a “temporary permissions” regime for financial companies that would replace the current “passporting” set-up. At a basic level, that will allow UK consumers to know that their car and home insurance policies with EU insurers such as Axa and Allianz will be be valid after Brexit. “Obviously we can’t say that to EU consumers who have taken policies off UK firms because the UK government can only legislate in the UK ... It would be much better if we could do that across the board and say ‘no, we are not going to put you at risk’ and let the negotiation go on.” On what he calls the eventual “steady state” arrangements, Bailey invites the EU to think again about “mutual recognition”, one of the UK’s preferred options but not popular with EU negotiators. “It’s a two-way process,” he says. “I’m always interested when I hear them say ‘We don’t like mutual recognition.’ I think you probably do want us to recognise you, actually.” In other words, it might be in the EU’s interest to look at “outcomes”, in the negotiating jargon, rather than equivalence in rules. Bailey points to Mifid II, the huge pan-EU set of financial rules that came into force at the start of this year and set transparency and risk thresholds for shares, bond, commodities, derivatives and more. “All those things were calculated on the basis of an EU single market with the UK as part of it,” he says, “and the UK is the biggest part.” If markets were split but the same Mifid rules were applied “you will not get equivalent outcomes because we have different size markets” and the “there would be a big incentive for business to move one way or another at that point.” The risk for the EU, in effect, is that more non-EU financial trade could gravitate to the City. “So I think you [the EU] want equivalent outcomes because that it is how you get protection on the level playing field, as it were.” He concedes, however, that “we are still in the foothills of that argument”. Any regrets about handling of the GRG affair? The tangle flowed from the fact that the investigation was commissioned by the FCA in 2014 as a “section 166” report, meaning its contents were supposed to be confidential. That position became near-impossible last year when leaks revealed the scale of RBS’s mistreatment of small businesses. The FCA published a summary of the findings but demands for full disclosure were unrelenting. The stand-off ended only when the Treasury committee used parliamentary privilege to publish the whole report. “There were two things we were not prepared to do,” says Bailey. “One, water down the report. And, two, break the law. I know this gets interpreted outside as ‘we caved’ but we can’t break the law.” The report itself, he argues, was “tough but fair” but the real answer would have been to hold a public inquiry in the first place, thereby forcing everything into the open. “The problem is that, if you look at the post-crisis history, we have had several governments in that period and none has wanted to go down the public inquiry route,” he argues. As for the whole year it took to resolve the Staley case, he pleads the sheer volume of evidence in the email age and the need to interview a lot of people. “I am keen that we speed up our processes where we can do so, but you are always balancing that against how much legal risk you are prepared to take,” he argues. As for the big Bank gig, he’s an old hand who knows not to offer a word out of line: “I have got my hands full. I love this job.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/01/reducetarian-cut-down-meat-dairy-healthy-eating","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T14:45:37Z","webTitle":"Why you’re probably a ‘reducetarian’ – and you may not even know it","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/01/reducetarian-cut-down-meat-dairy-healthy-eating","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/jun/01/reducetarian-cut-down-meat-dairy-healthy-eating","fields":{"headline":"Why you’re probably a ‘reducetarian’ – and you may not even know it","bodyText":"Name: Reducetarians.

A reducetarian is someone who wants to help the planet by giving up meat and dairy, but also likes meat or dairy too much to give them up. God, they sound awful. You’ve read the reports, right? According to a study in Science, giving up meat and dairy is the single biggest step any of us can take to reduce our impact on Earth. Yes, I read that. And yet you still eat meat and dairy? Absolutely. Meat and dairy are delicious. So you’re just happily chomping your way through millions of acres of farmland without a second thought? No!

Loads of people are reducetarians. According to a study by RSPCA Assured, about 40% of us are now trying to cut down on the amount of meat we eat. Half of us don’t even know we’re doing it. Those people are called subconscious reducetarians. Hang on, you mentioned that everybody hates us. Of course they do. Tell an avowed omnivore that you’re cutting back on your meat intake and they’ll call you a traitor. Tell a vegetarian that you still eat meat and they’ll call you a murderer. And what if I tell a vegan? Well, they’ll just bang on at length about being a vegan. Why are there so many reducetarians now? It’s thought that we’re all being bombarded by so many messages about healthy eating that changing our diets has just slowly become something that we all do. And it’s a good thing, right? Sure it is. If you only eat meat four times a week, rather than seven or 10, then you’re effectively halving your consumption. If everyone on Earth did the same, it would add up to a huge positive effect on the environment. So I’m suddenly a climate change activist! You are. Feels good, doesn’t it?

The higher a pedestal you set these books upon, the more daunting and lengthy they seem. What if we approached them more neutrally for what they are?

Give them their chance to delight or disappoint you. How to retain discipline and patience as a reader? Divide your time. Allocate 15 minutes a day before bedtime. Declare all transport time as reading time. Or divide the book itself. War and Peace can be read in a couple of weeks if you read it strictly 50 pages at a time. When Andrew Davies was adapting War and Peace for the BBC, he cut a secondhand copy up into manageable chunks using kitchen scissors. The other solution? Start with Chekhov’s short stories, especially Lady with Lapdog. It’s about 20 pages long and completely perfect.

A section of hydraulic cement tile – the once-ubiquitous flooring material used in homes around the city for a century or so from the mid-1800s – had been discarded during a home renovation. Cánovas picked up the tile, and a passion was born. Spotting tiles in dumpsters throughout Barcelona, Cánovas soon began to document his discoveries on Instagram as The Tile Hunter (@i_rescue_tiles). Hydraulic tiles first appeared in homes in Catalonia midway through the 19th century, and for decades they were a popular flooring material for middle-class families – cheaper than marble, but no less beautiful. To Cánovas, the tiles are a unique form of local art, each with a different geometric or floral design pressed atop layers of cement and sand. Today, homeowners are swapping out their tiles for modern flooring. Cánovas is on a crusade to save the tiles, which are no longer widely manufactured the old-fashioned way: by hand, using a mould, a hydraulic press and pigmented cement. When Cánovas started gathering tiles in 2014, he was a casual collector, picking up stray pieces that he would use to make end tables or picture frames. But after a feature in a local newspaper, his phone started ringing off the hook with tips from locals spotting hydraulic left in skips, or homeowners with entire apartments’ worth of tile that they wanted taking off their hands. “Now, it’s a responsibility,” he says. His collection today includes more than 30,000 tiles with 1,800 unique designs. After running out of space in his apartment, Cánovas moved his tiles into a small workshop in Gràcia but that space is now overflowing (“You can’t even walk in there”), so he recently expanded to a warehouse space outside of the city. Although Cánovas occasionally sells his tiles to cover the cost of renting storage space – he once shipped 1,800 tiles to an interior designer in Australia – he’s more interested in preserving part of Barcelona’s history than embarking on a retail enterprise. \u001fOnce a month, Cánovas hides tiles around the city and shares clues with his Instagram followers. The game, dubbed Tile Crossing, is like Pokémon Go for tiles, and the winners keep their findings. Cánovas plans to release a Tile Crossing app to facilitate the game and make it easier for his followers to drop a pin when they find tiles for him to salvage. “I think it will be the first app that serves solely to recuperate a part of our street heritage,” Canovas says. “These tiles aren’t thought of as part of our heritage, but they should be.” Guardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.

He concluded: “Now the braai talk is: ‘Why didn’t Adriaan Strauss get picked?’ which is a big change from: ‘Why did we pick Adriaan Strauss!?’” It may seem a touch a harsh on Strauss, who captained South Africa during their lowest ebb in 2016 with considerable dignity before retiring from international rugby, such was the strain of the job. But White’s point is that with Rassie Erasmus shaking things up in his first few months in charge, the Springboks no longer appear to be at rock bottom – far from it. White also credits the South African Rugby Union for finally giving Erasmus the backing and support he needs and believes the former coach Allister Coetzee too has significantly contributed, citing his leaked letter in which he was scathing of Saru and how it jolted the governing body into action. Erasmus has, in turn, had somewhat of a free hand with his squad selection. Back come five overseas-based players to bolster the ranks – Duane Vermeulen, Faf de Klerk and Willie le Roux among them – while Erasmus’s appointment of Siya Kolisi as South Africa’s first black captain has been met with universal approval. When making the announcement, Erasmus was asked if the appointment had anything to do with “recent events”, no doubt a reference to Ashwin Willemse walking out of a live SuperSport broadcast, accusing two fellow former Springboks of undermining him. Erasmus was clear in his response but the incident involving Willemse and its fallout served only to highlight how complex and divisive an issue race remains in South Africa. “Before I was appointed‚ I have always understood all the transformation issues and that they are part of the way we are heading, and I have bought into that,” Erasmus said. “We are trying to fix all the wrong things that were done in the past. The recent things that happened did not have a bearing on this decision because my contract was signed long before. The players we have in this squad deserve to be here and I am not trying to fabricate things.” Like England, South Africa are not without their injury problems – Warren Whiteley, Malcolm Marx, Lood de Jager and Eben Etzebeth in particular will be missed – and Erasmus could probably have done without Saturday’s match against Wales in Washington DC. But a strong-looking squad and the Super Rugby form of the Lions and the Bulls is engendering the aforementioned optimism. As ever with South Africa, a sense of identity is key and the makeup of Erasmus’s squad – and its warm reception – is undoubtedly a good start. How that translates on the pitch is less certain and Erasmus is faced with the age-old debate. Does he stick to South Africa’s traditional strengths or look to introduce an attacking style? “I think that is a question that is always asked and I think the answer coaches always give is that we want to find the balance,” Erasmus said. “I’m not going to try and use the old cliche that we want to find the balance. I think it would be great if we could keep the traditional things that people talk about us, and where people used to fear us. If we could keep that it would be great and people know what that is. Our physicality has always been something that we have prided ourselves on – we have to maintain that and we have to bring smartness into our game because at that level physicality won’t just win Test matches.” That may be right but it seems clear that Erasmus, just like Eddie Jones when at the start of his England tenure, is intent on restoring his side’s traditional strengths first and foremost. England and Jones already have a fair idea of what to expect this month, stopping it is another matter entirely."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"media/2018/may/31/julian-assange-ecuador-president-lenin-moreno","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T21:13:03Z","webTitle":"Ecuador's president says Julian Assange can stay in embassy 'with conditions'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/31/julian-assange-ecuador-president-lenin-moreno","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/31/julian-assange-ecuador-president-lenin-moreno","fields":{"headline":"Ecuador's president says Julian Assange can stay in embassy 'with conditions'","bodyText":"Lenín Moreno, the president of Ecuador, has said Julian Assange’s asylum status in the country’s London embassy is not under threat – provided he complies with the conditions of his stay and avoids voicing his political opinions on Twitter. However, in an interview with Deutsche Welle on Wednesday, Moreno said his government would “take a decision” if Assange didn’t comply with the restrictions. “Let’s not forget the conditions of his asylum prevent him from speaking about politics or intervening in the politics of other countries. That’s why we cut his communication,” he said. Ecuador suspended Assange’s communication’s system in March. Moreno’s statements come two weeks after an investigation by the Guardian and Focus Ecuador revealed the country had bankrolled a multimillion-dollar spy operation to protect and support Assange, employing an international security company and undercover agents to monitor his visitors, embassy staff and even the British police. Over more than five years, Ecuador put at least $5m (£3.7m) into a secret intelligence budget that protected him while he had visits from Nigel Farage, members of European nationalist groups and individuals linked to the Kremlin. Earlier this month, Moreno withdrew additional security assigned to the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where the WikiLeaks founder has remained for almost six years. Moreno has previously described Assange’s situation as “a stone in his shoe” and repeatedly hinted that he wants to remove the Australian from the country’s London embassy. In an interview in Quito, the president said granting Assange Ecuadorian citizenship in December last year had not been his idea but that of the foreign minister, María Fernanda Espinosa. He had delegated all decisions related to the case to her, Moreno told Deutsche Welle. “I told the foreign minister she should, with complete freedom, choose how to solve the problem. And she chose that system. It wasn’t the most suitable, but I respected it,” he said. He denied that external pressure from the United States or any other countries had influenced his government’s treatment of Assange whom he said had “surpassed the limits of freedom of expression”. Assange had tweeted in support of the Catalan independence movement and challenged the UK’s accusation that Russia was responsible for the poisoning of a Russian former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. “Liberty must be used with a lot of responsibility,” Moreno said, without confirming whether or not Assange’s access to the internet would be restored. Rafael Correa, Moreno’s predecessor who approved of the operation, defended the security measures as “routine and modest”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/may/31/dunes-detected-on-pluto-by-scientists","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T19:59:48Z","webTitle":"'Riot of processes': dunes of frozen methane detected on Pluto's surface","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/31/dunes-detected-on-pluto-by-scientists","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/31/dunes-detected-on-pluto-by-scientists","fields":{"headline":"'Riot of processes': dunes of frozen methane detected on Pluto's surface","bodyText":"Scientists have detected a large field of dunes on the surface of the distant, frigid dwarf planet Pluto apparently composed of windswept, sand-sized grains of frozen methane. The dunes, spotted on images taken by Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraft during its 2015 flyby, sit at the boundary between a heart-shaped nitrogen glacier about the size of France called Sputnik Planitia and the Al Idrisi Montes mountain range made of frozen water, scientists said on Thursday. Jani Radebaugh, a planetary scientist at Brigham Young University, said: “Pluto, even though it’s so far away from Earth and so very cold, has a riot of processes we never expected to see. It is far more interesting than any of us dreamed, and tells us that these very distant bodies are well worth visiting.” The existence of the dunes, which cover about 775 sq miles (2,000 sq km), came as a surprise. There was some doubt about whether Pluto’s extremely thin atmosphere, mainly nitrogen with minor amounts of methane and carbon monoxide, could muster the wind needed to form such features. Pluto, smaller than Earth’s moon with a diameter of about 1,400 miles (2,380 km), orbits about 3.6bn miles (5.8bn km) away from the sun, almost 40 times farther than Earth’s orbit, with a surface marked by plains, mountains, craters and valleys. Methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, all gaseous on Earth, are rendered solid with Pluto’s temperatures near absolute zero. Pluto’s dunes were shaped by moderate winds reaching about 22 mph (35 kph) apparently blowing fine-grained frozen methane bits from mountaintops. Pluto’s dunes resemble some on Earth like those in California’s Death Valley and China’s Taklamakan desert, though their composition differs, according to Radebaugh. “It’s a little bit lower density than sand we’re used to holding on the Earth,” she said. “So it would feel lighter in your hand, but it would still be granular and would kind of flow off of your hand, and your feet would kind of crunch them as you’re walking along. It would just kind of feel a lot like you’re on another sand dune on the Earth.” University of Cologne physicist and geoscientist Eric Parteli said dunes had been detected elsewhere in the solar system including on the planets Mars and Venus, Saturn’s moon Titan and Neptune’s moon Triton. Pluto’s dunes probably formed within the past 500,000 years and potentially more recently, Parteli added. The University of Plymouth’s planetary scientist Matt Telfer, who estimates the dunes are tens of metres high, said: “Given we have dunes on the scorching surface of Venus under a dense atmosphere, and out in the distant reaches of the solar system at minus 230 degrees Celsius (minus 382 Fahrenheit) under a thin atmosphere, yes, dunes do have a habit of cropping up in a lot of surprising places.” “Much work is left to do to understand dunes on Pluto,” Cornell University’s Alexander Hayes wrote in a companion article. He was not involved in the study. “Most notably, it remains to be shown how high the dunes are, when they are most active, whether they change” and whether particles can be swept into dunes without rising into the air. The research was published in the journal Science."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/31/real-madrid-mauricio-pochettino-tottenham","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T18:55:12Z","webTitle":"Real Madrid target Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino to replace Zidane","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/31/real-madrid-mauricio-pochettino-tottenham","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/31/real-madrid-mauricio-pochettino-tottenham","fields":{"headline":"Real Madrid target Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino to replace Zidane","bodyText":"Real Madrid have identified Mauricio Pochettino as the principal candidate to take over as manager after Zinedine Zidane’s surprise decision to walk away. Tottenham, however, are adamant the Argentinian’s new contract does not contain a clause that allows him to join the triple European champions. Zidane announced he was leaving the Santiago Bernabéu on Thursday, five days after Real beat Liverpool 3-1 in the Champions League final in Kiev. It is understood the Real president, Florentino Pérez, has anointed Pochettino and has already sought to make contact with the 46-year-old after being caught off-guard by Zidane’s departure. Real are aware Pochettino signed a five-year deal with Spurs six days ago and had believed it contains a clause that allows him to leave. Tottenham insist that is not the case and have also denied the existence of any verbal agreement between the former Espanyol and Southampton manager and the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, over a potential departure to La Liga. Pochettino’s contract is worth a reported £8m a year, making him the fourth-best paid manager in the Premier League. Before signing, he urged Levy to “be brave and take risks” and it is believed he has been given assurances Tottenham will have money to spend as they prepare to move into their renovated stadium next season. But the lure of moving back to Spain, where he spent eight years as a player before cutting his managerial teeth with Espanyol between 2009-2012, may prove too strong to resist."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/31/eddie-jones-england-training-scrutiny","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T18:09:29Z","webTitle":"Eddie Jones’s England training methods to come under scrutiny","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/31/eddie-jones-england-training-scrutiny","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/31/eddie-jones-england-training-scrutiny","fields":{"headline":"Eddie Jones’s England training methods to come under scrutiny","bodyText":"Eddie Jones’s training methods will be at the top of the agenda at the board meeting between the powerbrokers of the English game amid an escalating row over the number of injuries suffered at his England camps, Premiership Rugby has revealed. Premiership Rugby on Thursday expressed its concern at the number of injuries sustained in training – both with England and the clubs – after Jones hit back at criticism from Bruce Craig, the Bath owner. Craig had described the injury toll at his club as “totally unacceptable” with the England coach responding that the Premiership clubs have “no right” to tell him how to run his side. The issue will be discussed when Jones’s employers at the Rugby Football Union as well as representatives from Premiership Rugby and the players’ union convene at the next Professional Game Board meeting in June. “Training is arguably a much more controllable environment whether it is club or country. Are we concerned about injuries happening in training? Absolutely,” said Premiership Rugby’s chief executive, Mark McCafferty. “That is an area we think is more controllable and we should be able to bring those injury rates down in that environment. The PGB will meet again in June and no doubt it will be one of the top items. Training injuries are one of the things we should be able to bring down.” When Ben Te’o was ruled out of next month’s tour of South Africa on Tuesday, becoming the 15th player to suffer an injury on Jones’s watch, the spotlight on his notoriously gruelling camps intensified. Addressing the criticism on Wednesday, Jones hit back: “We prepare players for Test matches. I don’t think anyone at a club has the right to tell a coach how to train a Test team. I don’t have any concerns. We train appropriately for Test match rugby.” An injury audit, commissioned jointly by the Rugby Football Union and Premiership Rugby and released in March, showed that the severity of injuries sustained in England training drastically rose during Jones’s first season in charge. The Professional Rugby Injury Surveillance Project [Prisp] report showed that the “burden of injuries” – which takes into account both their frequency and their severity – more than doubled at England training in the 2016-17 season, compared with the previous campaign. The same audit showed that 36% of injuries suffered across the English game, either with club or country, were sustained during training. “We are concerned that injury rates are rising in general as we saw from the latest Prisp report,” added McCafferty. “We have worked very hard at the last round of reporting Prisp to develop a specific action plan. “We have eight points within that action and one of those is injuries in training.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/jun/11/five-books-world-cup-football-richard-williams","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T05:00:11Z","webTitle":"Five books about football: Richard Williams chooses his favourites","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/11/five-books-world-cup-football-richard-williams","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/jun/11/five-books-world-cup-football-richard-williams","fields":{"headline":"Five books about football: Richard Williams chooses his favourites","bodyText":"More than any other sport, football combines the ugly and the beautiful, the venal and the transcendent. It transforms small-time chisellers into millionaires while enabling the children of shanty towns and remote villages to express their innate gifts on a global stage. In the last big match of the 2017-18 European season, both its faces were on display: one in a piece of skulduggery that removed Liverpool’s most dangerous player from the game, the other in the sublime overhead volley that tilted the Champions League final in Real Madrid’s favour. Those faces will no doubt be turned towards us again in the coming weeks, when the players of 32 nations gather in Russia to compete at the 21st World Cup finals. The quadrennial update of Brian Glanville’s The Story of the World Cup offers the surest path through the competition’s history, the author’s unsparing judgments and sharp asides enlivening the match-by-match chronicle. Jimmy Burns’s newly published Cristiano and Leo examines the parallel rise of the two players, Portugal’s Ronaldo and Argentina’s Messi, who have spent the last decade and a half vying for the title of the world’s best player; now, as they approach their years of inevitable decline, each fancies emulating Diego Maradona’s career defining feat of winning the 1986 tournament virtually single-handed. Among those who left a mark on the World Cup is Andrea Pirlo, the modern playmaker in excelsis, a gentle stroker of lethal passes and free kicks who stepped forward to take the penalty that set Italy on the way to success in the decisive final shoot-out against France in Berlin’s Olympic stadium 12 years ago. “I took a long, intense breath,” he writes in I Think Therefore I Play. “That breath was mine, but it could have been the manual worker who struggles to make it to the end of the month, the rich businessman who’s a bit of a shit, the teacher, the student, the Italian expats who never left our side during the tournament, the well-to-do Milanese signora, the hooker on the street corner. In that moment, I was all of them.” The closest Irish midfielder Eamon Dunphy came to a World Cup was very close indeed: a 1-0 defeat by Spain in a play-off for the 1966 finals. If Pirlo’s autobiography is the amusingly indiscreet story of a golden boy, Dunphy’s Only a Game?, although first published in 1976, and covering a Millwall season in the old Second Division, remains unchallenged as a portrayal of the game at a level where survival is the priority. “You talk about team spirit and being together,” he writes. “But you always find in practice, when the bad times come, the cracks come, that it’s every man for himself.” The World Cup is football’s biggest money geyser – the organisers declared a profit of $2.6bn on revenues of $4.8bn from the 2014 edition, held in Brazil –and the tawdry consequences are analysed in David Conn’s The Fall of the House of Fifa. Readers of this newspaper will note the author’s identity and be prepared for a forensic account of 20 years of murky dealings among the leaders of the world governing body, its controlled anger infused with a fan’s sorrow. • Richard Williams’s The Perfect 10 is published by Faber."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/04/book-shop-at-risk-rent-increase","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T06:31:02Z","webTitle":"My landlord is increasing the rent by 50% – what can I do?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/04/book-shop-at-risk-rent-increase","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/04/book-shop-at-risk-rent-increase","fields":{"headline":"My landlord is increasing the rent by 50% – what can I do?","bodyText":"Since 1987, I have run Adelphi Books, a small second-hand bookshop in Southsea, Hampshire. That is a total of 31 years, during which time I have paid about £100,000 in rent. Every three years there is usually a rent review, which results in an increase. The last one was 5%, from £5,000 a year to £5,250. This year, the proposal is a rise of £2,500, which is almost a 50% increase and far more than I can reasonably manage. It would have been less of a shock if the landlord’s agents had given me several months warning to make contingency plans and to argue my case, but they didn’t. This treatment seems callous. I would be grateful for any help and advice you could give as I simply cannot afford the higher rent and would have to find another space, or close down. RS, Southsea This is a tale of modern Britain – a tenant who has been in residence for more than 30 years but has no protection against a landlord who decides to increase the rent by half, maybe because a few trendy bars have opened up nearby. I repeatedly approached your landlord (Zionstone), which is ultimately owned by Weybridge-based property developer the Malins Group, for an explanation, but it has refused to talk to me. To make matters worse, the landlord’s agent demanded the rent increase 10 days after the review date and appears to be applying it retrospectively. You have said you are happy to pay £5,750 a year, but Malins, which specialises in building £1m-plus apartments in “iconic” London locations, has declined and it looks as though you will have to close your doors. You are just one of Zionstone/Malin’s 600 or so tenants. Tenants in your shoes can go to arbitration and you should explore this option. That said, this is not really our area of expertise – can anyone else offer some practical advice or help? This looks like a another case of a small trader being forced out by an area’s mild gentrification, aided by the UK’s outdated property laws. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

In a lively talk at the Hay literary festival on Thursday, Cooper, mostly with her tongue in her cheek, spoke about sex, horses, football, gender fluidity and Germaine Greer, who had appeared at Hay the previous day. “Men cry all the time now,” the author said. “The whole time, always crying. And they have beards.” Cooper said she had “an adorable gay friend” who had lost his partner. “He’s just started going on the internet now and he said it is extraordinary – it is all married men wanting to have gay affairs. Do you think they are so terrified of women now it is safer to go with their own sex?” Before publishing her romantic novels, which include Riders, Rivals and, most recently, Mount!, Cooper joined the Sunday Times Magazine as a columnist in 1969 – her first big break. She recalled having lunch with the editor, Godfrey Smith. “I said, ‘Oh, it is so difficult being a young wife. One gets up in the morning, one goes to work, one comes home, one cleans one’s flat, one cooks dinner, one washes one’s husband’s clothes, one goes to bed and has sex all night. And it starts all over again. After six months you die of exhaustion.’ He roared with laughter and said: ‘Write about it.’” Later in 1969, Cooper published a manual for women, How to Stay Married, which contained much the same advice: cook, clean, iron and keep him happy in the bedroom. She writes in this week’s The Lady magazine about rereading the book recently, saying she “nearly died of horror ... What a smug, opinionated, proselytising little know-it-all I was back then.” Cooper has been writing about sex and love affairs for most of her career and the Hay event was laced with innuendo. “How easy is it to be surprising or shocking about sex, given you have been doing it for so long?” asked her interviewer, the historical novelist Stephanie Merritt, to laughter from the audience. Cooper’s next novel – probably her last, she said – is about football and will have the title Tackle. She promised a glamorous England manager and said the English needed one, given that all the glamorous managers in England were European – men such as Mourinho, Pochettino and Conte. On Wednesday, Greer, the feminist academic, caused controversy by saying the punishment for rape should be reduced, and it should not be seen as a violent crime but mostly “lazy, careless and insensitive”. Asked about Greer, Cooper said: “I think she’s terribly clever ... I think she’s brilliant, but is there a word for applause junkie? Is that terribly rude?

The findings have prompted concern that hospitals are discharging some patients too soon, that warning signs about patients’ conditions are being missed, possibly because staff are so busy, and that staff are dealing with patients who should not need to be there. Medical leaders have voiced unease at the findings, particularly that almost 200,000 patients a year are having a second spell in hospital because staff failed to spot they had a blood clot, pneumonia or pressure sores. Researchers identified those three conditions as a source of acute concern because they are all preventable, as long as the patient receives the right care, either in or outside hospital. The number of patients readmitted as a result of those illnesses grew over the same period, from 130,760 to 184,763 – a rise of 41.3%. Readmissions with pneumonia rose by 72.5%, while those involving pressure sores almost trebled and those for venous thromboembolism (blood clots) were up by a third. “Unnecessary trips and overnight stays in hospital put a strain on elderly patients and their families. That’s why it’s concerning that our research shows the number of people being readmitted to hospital within 30 days with potentially preventable conditions is greater than it was seven years ago”, said Prof John Appleby, the Nuffield Trust’s director of research. Dr Nick Scriven, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, warned that some patients were paying the price – through an increased risk to their health – of understaffed and under-resourced hospitals sometimes not being able to cope with the number of severely ill patients who need care. “Each readmission is a tragedy for the individual concerned in that it further puts them at risk of declining health in a downward spiral and in my view is often a consequence of units and individuals being totally overstretched by demands on them,” said Scriven, whose members are hospital doctors specialising in acute medicine. But beds in NHS community hospitals are now so few that patients are not getting the right care once they are discharged, he added. “Sometimes we have to acknowledge that we need to keep patients in hospitals longer than we would hope, to give them a chance to recuperate enough not to need a readmission. This is where community care should be picking up the load and really we would ideally rethink the now almost total lack of community beds.” Donna Kinnair, the Royal College of Nursing’s director of nursing, policy and practice, said the NHS-wide shortage of nurses was a key factor. “These findings reflect the impact 40,000 nurse vacancies has on patient care. Nurses want to do the best they can for their patients, but with hospitals struggling to recruit and shifts left unfilled, there are too few nurses to deliver the best care. Patient mortality rises and falls with the number of nurses on duty,” said Kinnaird. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the council of the British Medical Association, said: “Bed occupancy across the country is still staggeringly high and way above levels considered safe. A chronic lack of resourcing is entirely to blame and with so few beds available, patients could end up being discharged before they’re fully ready to leave. A lack of district nurses and social care means that patients are also being discharged without enough support in home settings.” A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “No patient should have to face going in and out of hospital unnecessarily and we expect the NHS to work closely with local authorities to ensure people are treated in the most suitable setting and when they are discharged from hospital they have a care plan in place.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/31/treasury-misses-a-trick-with-male-bank-of-england-appointment","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T18:13:28Z","webTitle":"Treasury misses a trick with male Bank of England appointment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/31/treasury-misses-a-trick-with-male-bank-of-england-appointment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/may/31/treasury-misses-a-trick-with-male-bank-of-england-appointment","fields":{"headline":"Treasury misses a trick with male Bank of England appointment","bodyText":"How is the Bank of England’s “reflecting diversity, choosing inclusion” mission going? Let’s remind ourselves of the ambition as it applies to gender diversity: a tripling of the proportion of women in senior roles to 35% by 2020. Thursday was not a good day. From a shortlist comprising four women and one man, the man got the gig to be the next member of the high-profile monetary policy committee To be fair to the Bank, it played no role: the chancellor, Philip Hammond, made the appointment. It is possible that Mark Carney, who often points out that he is the 120th in an unbroken line of male governors, is privately tearing his hair out. To be fair also to Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, he was a perfectly decent candidate; his expertise in productivity could be useful in the current climate. Yet this feels like a huge missed opportunity by the Treasury, whatever it says about how it contacted 44 women to apply for the post. The next opportunity to address the 8-1 male bias on the monetary committee may not arise for another four years, given the tenures of the current crew. It is only Carney who is definitely departing soon and the betting odds heavily suggest the 121st governor will also be male. Meanwhile, the 13-strong financial policy committee contains one woman. And 10 of the 12 members of the Bank’s governing court are men. The Labour MP Rachel Reeves, chair of the business select committee, called the latest appointment “truly staggering”. In a week in which some of the business world’s ludicrous justifications for male-dominated boardrooms were exposed in a government-commissioned report, one can only agree. Haskel, no doubt, will pass his confirmation hearing in front of the Treasury select committee with flying colours. It would more interesting to hear the MPs grill Hammond. O’Toole’s exit from FirstGroup was inevitable The miracle is that Tim O’Toole lasted eight years as the chief executive of FirstGroup. An innings of that length usually counts as decent when the share price travels in the right direction. At FirstGroup under O’Toole, the journey has been from 300p to 90p. Shareholders haven’t even had the consolidation of a dividend for the past half-decade. The source of half of FirstGroup’s woes is the top-of-the-market $3.6bn cash takeover in 2007 of US group Laidlaw, owner of an impressive school bus operation but also the Greyhound long-distance coach business. That deal happened before O’Toole’s arrival but his attempts to deal with the debt hangover never hit the mark. The thumping £615m rights issue in 2013 only semi-repaired the balance sheet and the option of selling Greyhound was resisted, with the word “iconic” being grossly overused. It is only now, with FirstGroup taking a £277m goodwill impairment against Greyhound, that a sale is being contemplated amid grumbles about competition from icon-toppling US budget airlines. The other write-down definitely relates to events on O’Toole’s watch. A sum of £106m is being charged as an “onerous contract provision” on the TransPennine Express rail franchise to cover expected losses out to 2023. This looks to be a straightforward case of overbidding in 2015 to retain the franchise. There was nothing wrong with passenger revenues at TransPennine last year – they were up 10%. In the circumstances, O’Toole’s resignation was inevitable after the latest grim results. The shame is that for the first 20 years of its life FirstGroup was a story of stunning success as it grew from a few bus routes in Dundee to become the UK’s biggest transport company. Recent chapters have involved scraps with activist investors and, last month, a vague bid approach from the private equity group Apollo Management, which was dismissed by the board as “opportunistic”. Despite FirstGroup’s many woes, saying no to Apollo was justified. There should – still – be a decent business lurking within. It does, though, require the next boss to change a corporate mindset that the Unite union fairly condemned as “managed decline” under O’Toole. Find some rigour – quickly. Pensions Regulator chief lacks fear factor Lesley Titcomb, the chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, can take a hint. She won’t seek to renew her four-year contract when it ends next February. Mind you, MPs were hardly subtle in pointing out the exit door. The “current leadership” of the organisation may not be equipped for cultural change, said the two committees probing Carillion’s collapse, adding that “a tentative and apologetic approach is ingrained”. The work and pensions committee called next year’s corporate plan “very modest in scope”. Many in the pensions industry think it’s all terribly unfair. The worst mistakes at BHS and Carillion were made before Titcomb became boss. Wasn’t the government giving mixed messages on how quickly companies should close pension deficits? Hasn’t Titcomb also managed the logistical challenge of rolling out auto enrolment? Well, yes, some sympathy is in order. But regulation is a rough business and a pensions enforcer needs to be feared in the outside world. Titcomb, perhaps out of loyalty to long-serving staff, never was."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/31/asda-profits-fell-by-10-in-2017","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T12:18:05Z","webTitle":"Asda profits fell by 10% last year after price cuts","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/31/asda-profits-fell-by-10-in-2017","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/31/asda-profits-fell-by-10-in-2017","fields":{"headline":"Asda profits fell by 10% last year after price cuts","bodyText":"Asda, the supermarket chain being taken over by larger rival Sainsbury’s, has revealed a 10% slump in annual profits for 2017. The supermarket blamed price cuts and an overhaul of its own-brand products for the decline in pre-tax profits as its regrouped to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl. Pre-tax profits fell from £791.7m in 2016 – which was its worst performance since it was taken over by the American grocer Walmart in 1999 – to £712.6m last year. Sales increased by 2.6% to £22.2bn. Asda’s chief executive, Roger Burnley, said: “Our 2017 accounts reflect a solid performance and a strong, well-managed business. During the year, momentum returned, driven by a series of planned investments in lowering prices, further improving quality and innovation in our own-brand ranges and providing an even better shopping experience whether in store or online.” After several years of falling sales, Asda started winning back shoppers in 2017 and has clocked up four successive quarters of underlying sales growth. After stripping out Easter, Asda reported like-for-like sales up 1% in the three months to 31 March. In April, Sainsbury’s and Asda spelled out the details of the deal that could create a new force in supermarket retailing that is bigger than market leader Tesco. Sainsbury’s will pay Walmart nearly £3bn in cash and hand it a 42% stake in the combined business if the tie-up is approved by the competition watchdog. Sainsbury’s has promised to retain both brand names and insisted there were no plans for store closures as a result of creating the group comprising 2,800 outlets and sales of £51bn."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/03/donald-trump-gut-feeling-decision-making-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T13:37:34Z","webTitle":"Trump goes it alone: running the White House not like a president, but a CEO","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/03/donald-trump-gut-feeling-decision-making-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/03/donald-trump-gut-feeling-decision-making-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Trump goes it alone: running the White House not like a president, but a CEO","bodyText":"Such a photograph would, it is fair to assume, have been beyond the most delirious, hallucinatory imaginings of a tropical fever patient five years ago. Donald Trump sits at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office with hands folded and a broad grin. To his right, dressed in black, stands an unsmiling Kim Kardashian West, a reality TV superstar catapulted to fame a decade ago by a sex tape. “‘I broke the internet.’ ‘I broke the country!’” parodied Comedy Central’s the Daily Show in response. The journalist Tom Gara of BuzzFeed News tweeted: “It’s amazing that the most powerful person in the world is just taking casual meetings with Trump like this.” And as preparations continue for talks with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, the NBC correspondent Peter Alexander posted: “The other Kim summit.” Trump himself tweeted simply that it was a “great meeting” at which they “talked about prison reform and sentencing”, glazing over Kardashian’s somewhat dubious qualifications as a White House policy guru. But then, the 45th US president appears to have dispensed with expertise or a trusted inner circle. The doors of his Oval Office have been thrown open to the national security adviser one minute, a famous face from Keeping Up with the Kardashians the next. As Trump approaches 500 days in office, unleashing a daily barrage of remarks, tweets, insults, pardons and threats, teeing up a global trade war and chasing an on-off-on meeting with Kim, the restraints are off and the fabled “adults in the room” appear scarcer than ever. It is, critics say, not so much a team of rivals as a team of one. Donald Trump. Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “I think we’ve got a fuller picture of it now. He’s not a president who thinks he needs anybody. This is the ‘I’ presidency. You hear it in every speech and see it in every tweet: it’s always about himself. As in all things, his presidency will rise and fall on his own efforts.” Once it was thought that rival White House factions would compete to shape the Trump presidency. But talk of a fight to the death between the “globalist-Goldman Sachs” wing and the “populist-nationalist” wing has faded into the background noise of individual egos. It’s now a war of all against all, multiple media reports suggest. A feud between the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the trade adviser Peter Navarro, for example, is said to have erupted in a shouting match last month on the sidelines of trade talks in China. According to the Axios website, Kelly Sadler, who had made a derogatory comment about the ailing senator John McCain, told Trump in front of colleagues that she thought her boss, Mercedes Schlapp, was one of the worst leakers in the White House. Schlapp “pushed back aggressively” and defended herself as the president looked on, Axios said. Steele commented: “He gets almost a sadistic pleasure watching his staff form up camps, go after each other, tear each other down. What he did not expect from his business background was the leaks. There was one agenda at Trump Tower; there is not one agenda at the White House. What he’s learned is that people come into it with their own agenda. But by and large he gets his kicks from watching the staff behave like children on a playground.” The list of departures is long and includes his communications director Hope Hicks, likened to a surrogate daughter, and his chief strategist Steve Bannon, likened to Thomas Cromwell in the court of Henry VIII. Neither has been replaced. “He’s his own communications director; that job is still vacant,” Steele added. “He’s his own chief strategist: he goes by his gut. He’s his own policy person: again he goes by his gut.” In the past week alone, that gut instinct has led Trump to: slap hefty steel and aluminum tariffs on allies Canada, the European Union and Mexico, risking a global trade war; abruptly reinstate the Kim summit in Singapore on 12 June while saying, “I don’t want to use the term ‘maximum pressure’ any more”; accuse the New York Times of making up a source when in fact it was quoting a White House official who briefed numerous reporters; make 35 claims that were untrue at a rally in Nashville, according to a Washington Post count; declare that he wished he chose someone other than Jeff Sessions as attorney general; insist that he did not fire the FBI director James Comey over the Russia investigation, despite having admitted doing so in a TV interview, and continue to push his baseless “Spygate” theory; and react to comedian Roseanne Barr’s racist joke with self-pity rather than condemnation. Then there was the curious episode of a presidential pardon for the conservative author and film-maker Dinesh D’Souza, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to violating federal campaign finance laws (and who once referred to Barack Obama as a “boy” from the “ghetto” ). The president also ruminated about pardons for the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich and the TV personality Martha Stewart, both of whom had links to his show The Apprentice. It was widely speculated that he is sending a signal to aides questioned by the special counsel Robert Mueller: stay loyal and all will be forgiven. Typically a chief of staff would be expected to intervene and save a president from himself. John Kelly, who succeeded Reince Priebus in the job, never had much control over Trump’s Twitter finger and is now seen as a diminished force who no longer has the president’s ear. Even Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, seems a bit-part player these days. By contrast, the newest faces in the West Wing have a reputation for reaffirming Trump and making him feel good about himself. His national security adviser, John Bolton, economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani seem to indulge rather than check their boss’s impulses. Bob Shrum, a 74-year-old Democratic strategist, said: “This is the first president in my memory, including Richard Nixon, who only listens to people who agree with him. I think it’s gotten worse. If there’s any change, it’s in the direction of impulsive, unilateral, unconsidered decision making.” Giuliani, a septuagenarian, thrice married New Yorker prone to incoherent interviews, and who has been working overtime to discredit Mueller, seems a natural fit. He and Trump are, the satirist John Oliver observed, “basically two versions of the same person.” Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer, said: “Trump is a salesman and now he has a deputy salesman. He doesn’t regard Giuliani as a rival; Giuliani is there specifically because he can get headlines and attention. Now Trump has two distraction machines: two spinning tops are much better than one. It doesn’t matter if they contradict themselves because they get two headlines.” Trump’s management style is familiar from his decades as a chief executive in the cut-throat Manhattan property world, Blair added. “It’s what he always did: he’s the hub of the wheel and everyone else is a spoke. He sets everyone against each other and without overlapping duties so their only loyalty is to him. It’s constant upheaval: first someone is up, then they’re in the doghouse. He loves them and then he fires them. It’s what he’s done his whole career.” She observed: “If you’re named Trump, you’re probably pretty safe, although there have been a couple of wives thrown under the bus.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/01/england-v-pakistan-second-test-day-one-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T17:54:22Z","webTitle":"England hold advantage over Pakistan after day one of second Test – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/01/england-v-pakistan-second-test-day-one-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/01/england-v-pakistan-second-test-day-one-live","fields":{"headline":"England hold advantage over Pakistan after day one of second Test – as it happened","bodyText":"Vic’s match report has landed, so I’ll leave you with that. Thanks for your company – we’ll be back tomorrow morning to see if England can ram home their advantage. Stuart Broad speaks! “We’re delighted. It was an interesting toss decision; I don’t think any of us expected it to swing like it did. [On talk that he might be dropped for this game] I don’t mind criticism, but I didn’t feel some of the flak that came my way was overly logical – I think there were people promoting their own shows and columns, but that’s the way of the world. “I know within myself that I’m bowling well. I felt in good rhythm from ball one today. I looked to swing it away from the left-handers and wobble it to the right-handers because that brings LBW into play. What we did well as a unit was that we backed up each other from both ends; we created a longevity of pressure.” Further reading department Here’s Ali Martin on how Stuart Broad set the standard at Headingley today. Sam Curran, 19, made his Test debut after Ben Stokes was ruled out through injury Pakistan won the toss and chose to bat first Stuart Broad, James Anderson and Chris Woakes took three wickets apiece as Pakistan were bowled out for 174 Shadab Khan’s rapid 56 helped them stage a partial recovery from 79 for seven England finished on 106 for two, with Alastair Cook out for 46 and Keaton Jennings for 29. England are back! (They’re not back) 37th over: England 106-2 (Root 29, Bess 0) Hasan Ali bowls the last over of the day. Root gets a single off the first ball and Bess blocks the remainder to complete a fine day for England. They trail by 68 runs with eight first-innings wickets remaining. 36th over: England 105-2 (Root 28, Bess 0) Shadab shrieks an LBW appeal when Bess gets in a mess trying to defend a googly. It hit him in his personal space, but the umpire decided it was slipping past the leg stump. Replays confirm it was a good decision. It wouldn’t have been leg before wicket so much as le- well, you can do the rest. 35th over: England 104-2 (Root 26, Bess 0) Whether you call it a golden arm, force of personality or sheer filthy effing luck, Hasan Ali has it. I’m not sure any other bowler on either side would have taken a wicket with that delivery at that time. That said, Cook will be so annoyed to get out like that. The new batsman is the nightwatchman Dom Bess. Hasan Ali, the man who makes things happen, returns for a two-over burst before the close – and he sends Cook for an early ice bath! It was a poor delivery, a short ball on leg stump, but Cook gloved an attempted pull down the leg side to Sarfraz. 34th over: England 102-1 (Cook 45, Root 26) Shadab goes around the wicket to Cook, who muscles a single to leg to bring up the England hundred. They have a great chance to bat Pakistan out of the game over the weekend. What a difference a day makes. What a difference a lost toss makes. 33rd over: England 99-1 (Cook 44, Root 24) The forecast is mixed for tomorrow. Doesn’t really matter: England have all the time in the world and will have to work extremely hard to make a balls of this. They’ve had a really good day, though after recent events I doubt they will be adding up poultry. “Does Ian Botham drink cocktails?” says Jeremy Yapp. “If he did, would it be a Beefy-fty-two? ‘Jokes’ like that are why I became a father.” You met someone who likes jokes like that? Good work. 32nd over: England 96-1 (Cook 40, Root 24) Shadab Khan comes on to bowl the first over of spin today. There’s some turn off the pitch, albeit slow, in an accurate first over. Well bowled. 31st over: England 95-1 (Cook 40, Root 24) Pakistan enquire about a catch down the leg side when Cook flicks at Amir. He can be susceptible to that type of dismissal but this one hit the pad, the whole pad and nothing but the pad. “As the Pakistani pace bowlers struggle for a breakthrough,” says Angus Bujalski, “perhaps time for a Rawalpindi Express-o Martini?” 30th over: England 92-1 (Cook 37, Root 24) Root plays the ball back to Abbas, who flings it towards the stumps as a way of telling Root to get back in his box. Root smiles and then clips the next ball through midwicket for four. Root looks more fluent in this innings than for many a month. It’s almost like he’s playing at home. “Surely a ‘Whispering Death’ is a cricketing cocktail waiting to be made?” says Matt Brown. “No idea what would be in it but I’m guessing something smooth, velvety, moreish and ludicrously potent.” And guaranteed to make you grovel. 29th over: England 87-1 (Cook 36, Root 20) For a captain who doesn’t like having a third man, Root certainly knows how to score there – he gets his third boundary behind square on the off side with a deliberate steer off Amir. A Sky graphic shows that 26 per cent of his runs against seam in Tests in England have gone to third man. I love the smell of data in the evening. “Stephen Davenport’s literary segue to Kurt Vonnegut puts one in mind of Slaughterhouse Five,” says Brian Withington. “A potentially brutal cocktail (?) but also perhaps an apt description of England’s upper order last winter.” That’s also the name of Quentin Tarantino’s upcoming film about the Kent pace attack of the early 1990s: Duncan Spencer, Martin McCague, Dean Headley, Alan Igglesden and Dr Julian Thompson. 28th over: England 81-1 (Cook 36, Root 14) Mohammad Abbas has had quite a start to his Test career: eight matches, 40 wickets at 17. He almost gets his 41st when Cook gets a late inside edge to fine leg for four; had he not done so there would have been a huge LBW appeal. 27th over: England 77-1 (Cook 32, Root 14) Everything feels so much more secure when Cook is playing well. The stats support that perception: he averages high 50s when England win or draw and 29 when they lose. Meanwhile, Amir angles a majestic, double-bluff legcutter past Root’s outside edge. He’ll never be as exhilarating as he was in 2010 but it’ll always be a joy to watch such an artist at work. 26th over: England 76-1 (Cook 31, Root 14) Root, on the walk, is beaten by Abbas. Cricket doesn’t yet have Expected Score data – let’s keep it that way, pleasedammit - but this could easily be 65 for three. The ball has gone past the outside edge a helluva lot for a score of 76 for one. 25th over: England 76-1 (Cook 31, Root 14) Mohammad Amir returns to the attack. Pakistan will probably want two more wickets tonight, with a view to restricting England to a lead of around 100. Root survives an LBW enquiry from an inswinger that pitched outside leg; nothing much else to report. “So cricket-based cocktail puns, is it?” hics Fran Mason. “How about Daiquiri Underwood, AEJ Tom Collins, Chris Old Fashioned, Peter Martini and someone whose surname is already a cricket-based cocktail pun, Otis Gibson.” I usually order a Slow Comfortable Screw Against Rahul Dravid. 24th over: England 75-1 (Cook 31, Root 14) Oofah! Cook leaves a ball from Abbas that just bounces over the off stump. That was not without risk, but ultimately it was well judged. Ish. Cook is beaten later in the over, driving outside the line of a full-length wobbler. Pakistan have bowled really well in this session – it would have been so easy to go hunting for wickets but they have bowled with a lot of discipline and accuracy. 23rd over: England 75-1 (Cook 31, Root 14) Cook plays a lovely extra cover drive for four off Faheem. He looks in excellent touch at the moment, particularly with his driving. “Good either morning or afternoon, Rob,” says Stephen Davenport. “I have neither the wit nor the depth of bar-fly experience with which to invent a cricketing cocktail; but as an homage to a certain ruddy-faced former Kent and England opener I drink at one of Kurt Vonnegut’s supposed hangouts in Indianapolis, the Red Key.” 22nd over: England 70-1 (Cook 26, Root 14) Mohammad Abbas, the subtle interrogator of this attack, replaces Hasan Ali. Root waves a shortish ball through backward point for four. Like Jennings, Root is batting outside his crease to negate the late movement of Abbas. England have been doing thought! “Re: the 15th over,” begins Matt Dony. “If someone told me that an activity involved ‘a yoga mat, a small plastic bat, gaffer tape, and some vigorous thrusting’, I don’t think my first guess would be ‘a demonstration of cricket umpiring.” Ha. It sounds like a scene from Oz, probably involving a displeased Adebisi. 21st over: England 65-1 (Cook 25, Root 10) “As he has suffered from being rather all or nothing with his scoring recently, am I correct in suggesting that a score of 43 for Cook is by far the most desirable outcome of his current innings?” asks Tom Bowtell. Didn’t he have a couple of scores from 31-49 during the Ashes? I’d go for a nice solid 92. From memory I don’t think he’s been out in the nineties since he was bowled at Lord’s by Mitchell Marsh at 3.31pm on Saturday 18 July 2015. 20th over: England 64-1 (Cook 24, Root 10) Four more to Root, guided through backward point off Hasan Ali. 19th over: England 57-1 (Cook 23, Root 4) Root gets off the mark with a confident stroke, clipping Faheem between mid-on and midwicket for four. England have another 75 minutes to survive until the close. 18th over: England 53-1 (Cook 23, Root 0) Hasan beats Cook with another ridiculously good delivery. Another maiden, which means the last four overs have produced three maidens, two runs and one wicket. 17th over: England 53-1 (Cook 23, Root 0) Joe Root is the new batsman. Keaton Jennings falls for a useful 29. Faheem Ashraf angled a length delivery across him from over the wicket, and Jennings snicked a defensive push through to Sarfraz. He might feel he could have left that, but overall it was a decent return to the side. 16th over: England 51-0 (Cook 23, Jennings 27) Hasan Ali, back over the wicket, beats Cook with a brilliant legcutter at the start of a fine maiden over. I must say, I love watching Hasan bowl; he’s Pakistan cricket personified. If he was 7-8mph quicker he’d be a world beater. 15th over: England 51-0 (Cook 23, Jennings 27) Jennings survives an optimistic LBW appeal after leaving Faheem on length. It looked dodgy at first but it was a good leave. Of course it was a good leave: it was a Keaton Jennings leave. Here’s Mark Higgins. “Nasser was showing he needs to keep up to date with the latest MCC laws (15:57). Law 41.15.1, which became effective on 1 October 2017, states that “The striker shall not adopt a stance in the protected area or so close to it that frequent encroachment is inevitable.” That’s what the umpires were picking up on with Jennings. One of our club umpires recently ran a session where he explained and demonstrated various new laws. I recall that the demonstration of law 41.15.1 involved a yoga mat, a small plastic bat, gaffer tape, and some vigorous thrusting. Happy Days!” Oof, that’s a good spot – thanks. Still not sure I agree with the law, mind you. 14th over: England 51-0 (Cook 23, Jennings 27) Hasan Ali goes around the wicket to beat Cook with a gorgeous full-length delivery that zips away off the seam. He bowls some serious jaffas – but he also bowls a few four-balls, and Cook drives the next delivery through extra cover for four to bring up the fifty partnership. While I’ve been pencilling Keaton Jennings in for 20,000 Test runs, Cook has been playing beautifully. As at Lord’s, his driving has been terrific. “Afternoon Rob,” chirps Phil Sawyer. “Cricket cocktails? A Sex on the Leach, and of course a Mai Mum Could Have Hit That With A Stick Of Rhubarb Tai.” 13th over: England 47-0 (Cook 19, Jennings 27) Jennings looks so relaxed between deliveries. It’s only a small thing, buT I’VE SAID HE’LL MAKE IT AT TEST LEVEL I’M GOING TO INVENT AS MUCH EVIDENCE AS POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS, OKAY? Faheem jags a fine delivery back into Jennings, who plays a beautiful Chinese cut just wide of leg stump for four. Superb technique. Faheem, who is a better bowler than he looks, then beats Jennings outside off with consecutive deliveries. Terrific over. “Fairbrothers’ Ruin,” says Ant Pease. “I believe it’s also a component of a Llong Island Iced Tea.” 12th over: England 43-0 (Cook 19, Jennings 23) A dangerous inswinger from Hasan Ali is defended solidly by Cook, who back cuts the next delivery for four. Hasan has been a bit impatient so far; I suppose that’s human nature given the match situation. “‎Afternoon, Smyth,” says Sean Clayton. “A World Cup month during England participation is no time to give up anything (5th over).‎ I timed giving up cigs for the day after England went out of the 2002 World Cup as I knew I’d weaken during the inevitable penalty shoot-out\\extra-time\\90 minutes stress otherwise...” And to think Prince wanted to do a collaboration the day before you gave up. 11th over: England 39-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 23) A double bowling change, with Faheem Ashraf replacing Po’ Mo’ Amir, who bowled much better than figures of 5-0-24-0 would suggest. Jennings survives a biggish LBW shout from a ball that seemed to clearly pitch outside leg. No review from Pakistan, and rightly so. “The way to test for swing potential at Headingley is to wave a ferret in the air before the toss,” says Kim Thonger. “If the ferret’s fur goes curly, like it’s had a perm, bowl. I’m told this works at all Northern cricket grounds.” And you say you’re off booze at the moment? 10th over: England 39-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 23) Pakistan need something to happen, which means it’s time for Hasan Ali. He starts with an absurd jaffa that beats Jennings, who smiles in acknowledgement of his futility and then larrups a square cut for four later in the over. “The classic Wallbanger would use vodka rather than gin,” says Adrian Armstrong, “but I’m sure Fairbrothers’ Ruin would work. As long as it also contains the essential ingredient, Jason Galliano.” 9th over: England 32-0 (Cook 15, Jennings 17) Amir drifts onto the pads of Cook, who puts him through midwicket for four. These are good signs for England, both in the judgement of Cook and Jennings and the relative lack of movement for the Pakistan bowlers. Mind you, a good start against Pakistan at Headingley is never much of a guarantee. In 1992, England were 270 for one – and then 320 all out. “Rob,” says Brian Withington. “Regarding Kim Thonger’s Drune™️ (Dry June) conundrum I think all will be well if England can make it to July (!) at which point Kim will be able to give it some Wely™️ as needed.” 8th over: England 28-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 17) Abbas moves around the wicket to Jennings, who gets another inside edge onto the pad. The pitch looks pretty flat, with little seam movement for either bowler, and that knowledge gives Jennings the confidence to chase a wide one and lash it through extra cover for four. Good shot. I may look like a moron if somebody dredges this up in 2027, but I do think Jennings has got something about him. “Rob,” says John Starbuck. “It’s not that hard to judge if the ball will swing at Headingley. Just look at the sky. Granted, you do need a long history of doing it to get this right.” I always thought there was no rhyme or reason to when it swings at Headingley – eg 1989, gloomy and overcast, Australia 601 for seven declared. And don’t get me started on poor old Mike Smith. 7th over: England 24-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 13) Jennings fences the unlucky Amir just short of the man at gully. It’s an interesting battle of patience, this. Pakistan are trying to force the issue without forcing the issue. So far I think they’ve bowled really well. “I seem to remember getting an hilarious OBO years ago about a cricket-themed beer called IPA Richards,” says Ant Pease. “With reference to Guy Hornsby’s impending insobriety, can we crowdfund an OBO gin called Fairbrothers’ Ruin?” That’s the one you put in a Neil Harvey Wallbanger, right? 6th over: England 23-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 12) Discipline was the defining feature of Pakistan’s victory at Lord’s. It’ll be interesting to see how patient they are with the ball if England don’t lose early wickets. Amir and Abbas have started well, whatever the scoreboard might suggest, and Abbas’s third over is an accurate maiden to Cook. 5th over: England 23-0 (Cook 11, Jennings 12) Cook fiddles an exasperated Amir to third man for four more. This is Lord’s in reverse at the moment, with Pakistan’s bowlers desperate for wickets because of the failure of their batsmen. Amir produces another jaffa that beats Cook by a long way - that would barely have hit the outside edge of a second bat - and ends the over with a delicious outswinger that beats Jennings. Lovely bowling. “Can you please ask Guy Hornsby to cease and desist the gin worship?” says Kim Thonger. “We’ve embarked on Drune™️ which is short for Dry June and it means I can’t even look at a bottle of the stuff on pain of tongue lashing from eldest daughter. It’s all terribly unfair, especially when the England batting is so fragile.” You’ll be a joy to live with during the World Cup when England are 1-0 down to Panama with 10 minutes to go. 4th over: England 18-0 (Cook 6, Jennings 12) Jennings inside-edges Abbas back onto the pad. He is batting out of his crease to reduce the late movement with which Philander undressed him last summer, and so far it is working well. When he gets a bit of width he belts a square drive for four. Well played. One thing’s for sure about Jennings: if he doesn’t make it Test level (though I reckon he will), he will score millions of runs for Lancashire in the next decade. “Did Pakistan’s decision to bat first on this pitch draw criticism?” says Andrew Watson. “Should it? For extra credit, compare and contrast with England’s decision to bat first in the first Test.” No and no, because the pitch is good – it was the swing wot done it, and it’s very hard to predict when it will swing at Headingley. It was a really good toss to lose. 3rd over: England 14-0 (Cook 6, Jennings 8) Jennings steers Amir for three to get off the mark, and then thick-edges his first boundary. There’s a lot to like about Jennings, who is smart and mentally tough. Some quick singles make that an excellent over for England - ten from it. “I know I’m basically Sir Geoffrey of Yorkshire saying this, but we don’t know what par is here until both sides have batted, and I can’t be the only one absolutely petrified of us actually getting nibbled out by this Pakistan attack soon?” says Guy Hornsby. “It’s ok though, I’ve got a new bottle of gin at home. Blessed gin.” 2nd over: England 4-0 (Cook 4, Jennings 0) Keaton Jennings had a lot of trouble with Vernon Philander last summer. Mohammad Abbas is a pretty similar bowler with his accuracy, full length and movement. After two balls, the square leg umpire walks in to have a chat with Jennings. “What’s he been told there then?” says Nasser Hussain. He’s batting outside his crease to Abbas, and apparently was told that his forward press was taking him into the danger area. That’s very strange. As Nasser says, what about when you charge a spinner? Anyway, Jennings shows good judgement to ignore a series of tempters from Abbas; it’s a maiden. 1st over: England 4-0 (Cook 4, Jennings 0) Mohammad Amir takes precisely two balls to find the outside edge. Cook pushed at an outswinger with sufficiently soft hands to edge it short of first slip. I bet he uses Fairy Liquid. It’s a beautiful first over from Amir, who swerves a belter past Cook’s outside edge and then finds a thick edge that scuttles away for four. This is a dodgy session for England, who could easily lose five or six wickets if the ball continues to swing. “Do you not agree that all counties should encourage their young players to display good basic, defensive technique which they can fall back on when the going gets tough?” says Geoff Caldwell. “At the moment the majority of our ‘best’ – don’t all snort at once – batsmen don’t appear have a decent forward defensive stroke between the lot of them. They can do a very good bat waft outside the off stump with which to donate their wicket in double quick time; oh yes.” I do, but I’m an old man. The world has changed. I actually think most of this line-up have a good defensive technique; they just don’t always know when to use it. So how will England do against the bowling attack that cleaned their clocks last week? Only one way to find out: stick around so Rob Smyth can tell you about it. Emails to him here. That’s tea, by the way. That partnership between Shadab and Hasan took the edge off a bit - England might be disappointed they didn’t get rid of the Pakistan batsmen for under 150, but it was still a brilliant bowling effort by Broad, Anderson and to a slightly lesser extent Woakes. Now, of course, we get to see what Amir and Abbas can do with conditions that England’s top men tucked into. You fear for Jennings, who quite possibly sees Vern Philander in his nightmares, in particular. First Test wicket for the kid, as Shadab tries to launch one towards where the old pavilion was at Headingley, but gets nowhere near enough and Jennings takes a comfortable catch at deep mid-wicket. 48th over: Pakistan 174-9 (Shadab 56, Abbas 1) Broad is back to try tidying this innings up, only with three slips to Abbas. But it’s a bit of a wasted opportunity, too many balls outside off that are left alone. By the way, Shadab seems to have lost a run somewhere: not sure how that happened. Sorry. 47th over: Pakistan 174-9 (Shadab 57, Abbas 1) Curran continues, and nearly cleans out Abbas a couple of times. Abbas then surprisingly takes a single, after which Curran tries a bouncer which sits up like it was bowled into sponge, and Shadab flaps it over mid-wicket for four. 46th over: Pakistan 169-9 (Shadab 53, Abbas 0) Shadab turns down a single to deep backward square, then helps himself to four with a nice carve past a very wide third man. Then, his fifty, after Woakes drops short once more and a pull is nailed in front of mid-wicket. Terrific innings from Shadab this: he may just have saved his team’s skin. 45th over: Pakistan 161-9 (Shadab 45, Abbas 0) Curran has struggled today, alas. He goes short and wide to Shadab and it gets the appropriate treatment, leathered down to third man. That said, he nearly cleans out Abbas with a yorker, then beats him on the outside edge. 44th over: Pakistan 156-9 (Shadab 39, Abbas 0) Shadab punched the back of his bat in frustration after Hasan dollied that catch to Woakes. In a very “you had one job” sort of way. More runs, and lovely ones too, as Shadab plays a lovely flick off his pads to the mid-wicket fence, then a short and wide one is cut with gusto to the other side of the field. Then a sharp single allows Woakes to go for the old one-two: a bouncer to Hasan, then a full one that he tries to whip across the line, but gets a leading edge straight back to the bowler. 43rd over: Pakistan 147-8 (Shadab 31, Hasan 24) Here’s Sam Curran with a bowl. Some singles, then Curran plays the part of ‘First Bowling Machine’ by floating up a driving practice ball that Shadab creams through the covers. 42nd over: Pakistan 140-8 (Shadab 25, Hasan 23) Runs coming quite quickly now. Singles for Shadab, Hasan gets three through the covers, four with a flick to fine leg then another four after a big edge that Root, at third slip, flies to his right to grab. He gets a fingertip to it, but if he’d held on it would have been the best catch you’ve ever seen. Hasan gets a bit giddy and misses with a big swipe that was aiming for Harrogate. “Just put TMS on,” writes David Brown. “Turned off after 5 seconds. Boycott was moaning about the bowling. Where there is light, let there be darkness (is probably his family motto).” 41st over: Pakistan 127-8 (Shadab 23, Hasan 12) Hasan jabs at one from Anderson like he’s trying to unblock a toilet with a stick, but gets four from it, squirting through gully. Then he gets two more fours, with drives of increasing certainty, the second in particular a very nice one down the ground. 40th over: Pakistan 114-8 (Shadab 22, Hasan 0) Shadab digs out an attempted yorker from Woakes and takes a single, but such is his haste to cling onto the strike like a kid with its favourite teddy, nearly sets off on an absurd second which would have certainly resulted in a free wicket had they not come to their senses. Hasan just about survives the rest of the over, without much certainty. 39th over: Pakistan 113-8 (Shadab 21, Hasan 0) “I don’t want to be a bore,” says Frederick Simon. “But Glue by Bicep is breakbeat, not techno. It’s not entirely wrong, just very jarring. Like suggesting YJB should play as a specialist batsman.” You were doing so well until that last sentence. In other news, that’s all from me for this session. Nick Miller will be with you until tea – you can email him here. Amir finally nicks one. He threw his hands at a shorter delivery from Anderson and top- edged it to Bairstow, who took a comfortable catch. 38th over: Pakistan 113-7 (Shadab 21, Amir 13) Chris Woakes replaces Stuart Broad, who has excellent figures of 14-5-38-3. There’s a brief break in play when a beach ball lands on the pitch, and then Shadab clips a yorker through midwicket for three. He’s playing really nicely.. “Just had my first opportunity today to check the score,” says Simon Lea. “Delighted to see that all of England’s problems are resolved and no further improvements are required. Phew.” Bring on India! And Australia! Sod it fire up the DeLorean and bring on the 1980s West Indies! 37th over: Pakistan 106-7 (Shadab 17, Amir 10) England now have four slips and a gully for Amir, who is threatening to edge every ball. He must have played and missed five or six times already, and he’s only faced 20-odd balls. A quick single provides a bit of respite, and then Shadab slaps a wide ball up and over the cordon for four. After almost an hour of Branderson, it might be time for a bit of Coakes. “I think you’d find Woakes’ stats abroad would improve markedly if he was given the new ball,” says Mike Daniels. “Overseas generally is a hard place to bowl with a Kookaburra when the openers haven’t made inroads - as has generally been the case the last couple of years. When he’s given the new ball in ODIs overseas he’s penetrative - see his two Man of the Series awards in the winter. Judge him when he’s had the opportunity to set the tone rather than try to drag back the situation with an older knacker.” Yep, that’s fair. But even allowing for that point, his figures overseas are surprisingly crap. 36th over: Pakistan 101-7 (Shadab 13, Amir 9) Amir may be a walking play-and-miss but Shadab is playing with soft-handed control and eases Broad through extra cover for four. Lovely shot. “England in taking wickets by bowling at the stumps shock!” weeps Andy Bradshaw. 35th over: Pakistan 97-7 (Shadab 9, Amir 9) Amir is beaten again, this time by Anderson. It feels a like a matter of time before the eighth wicket falls, , just as it did when Sir Ian Botham and Graham Dilley were giving it some humpty on this ground 37 years ago. 34th over: Pakistan 96-7 (Shadab 8, Amir 9) Amir swings and misses again at Broad, prompting an exchange of words and a smile from both players. Broad ends an excellent maiden by beating the outside edge again. He clearly fancies a five-for here; it would be his first in a home Test since that surreal morning at Trent Bridge in 2015. 33rd over: Pakistan 96-7 (Shadab 8, Amir 9) Amir slashes Anderson just wide of Buttler, leaping to his right at fifth slip. It would have been a comfortable catch for fourth slip, had he existed. Shadab then gets four cheap runs, flicking a loose delivery to fine leg. 32nd over: Pakistan 88-7 (Shadab 2, Amir 8) Amir is beaten by an absurd jaffa from Broad. I’m sure if Sarfraz would have bowled first if he knew how much the ball was going to swing. It’s 32 overs old and still doing plenty. Amir has sensibly decided to have a dart – he slices booming drive over gully for four. Then he is beaten by another superb delivery. “I’m looking forward to a big round of humble pie gobbling from everyone who was calling for Broad to be dropped earlier this week,” says Sam Jordison. “(Unless it was a clever tactic to get him on one...) Meanwhile, moving techno: Luke Slater - Love. Also, on the subject of Bicep, the video for Glue made me want to weep for my lost youth - for everyone’s lost youth. Moving techno is a beautiful thing.” 31st over: Pakistan 83-7 (Shadab 1, Amir 4) Pakistan should declare and stick England in before the ball shuts up. Also: mind games. Amir gets off the mark with an absurd shot, chipping a big inswinger back over Anderson’s head for four. Faheem’s reprieve last two balls. He has fallen LBW to Anderson, plumb in front as he played around a nipbacker. A number of Pakistan batsmen have been dismissed playing across the line today. 30th over: Pakistan 78-6 (Shadab 0, Faheem 0) Faheem is dropped off Broad! It was a simple chance to Malan at second slip - or it would have been, had Root not put him off by diving across from third slip. Ach. Broad has bowled brilliantly today. “That’s some incredible stats on Woakes,” says Guy Hornsby. “He’s basically Ars*nal last year, rampantly Wengery at home, staggeringly Brighton away. I know it’s not in vogue, but surely he’s as good an argument for squad rotation as anyone? Yes, he’s got to learn to play on wickets abroad, but if he’s half as effective away from home, then pick someone else until he’s stepped up. The problem being, of course, there’s few alternatives. Speaking of which, I hope Curran does well here, and not just because he’s a Surrey man. We need a good left-armer and he does seem to have a bit about him.” Don’t get me started on squad rotation. I’ve been boring people about it for so long that even my imaginary friends have started ostracising me. If England bowl properly this should be over pretty quickly. There goes another one: Salahuddin plays around a big inswinger from Broad and is given out LBW. He reviewed, as most debutants would, hoping it was swinging past leg stump. It wasn’t: replays showed it was hitting the leg bail and Salahuddin has gone. 29th over: Pakistan 78-5 (Salahuddin 4, Shadab Khan 0) I bet there was a very small part of Anderson that begrudged himself that wicket, because it came from the kind of fuller delivery everyone has been telling him to bowl. Replays show that it moved quite sharply off the seam to hit the pad and deflect onto the stumps. At first I thought it had gone straight through him. “After the first 17 away Tests of his career James Anderson averaged 45 and looked without a clue as to how to bowl without conducive movement,” says Eamonn Maloney. “I don’t see Woakes ever getting the knack.” I suppose Anderson was younger at that stage. Weird thing with Woakes is that there’s no particular reason why he shouldn’t take wickets away from home – he’s often the fastest England bowler, he can swing the new ball, is very fit and has bowled well overseas in ODIs. For now, broadly speaking, I would use him at home and have him as back up for Anderson overseas. James Anderson gets his first wicket, slipping a full, straight delivery straight through Sarfraz. I don’t think the ball did much; Sarfraz just played all around it. 28th over: Pakistan 78-4 (Salahuddin 4, Sarfraz 14) Stuart Broad will bowl from the Nobody Ever Pays for a Pint Round Here, Ever End. He slips one wide to Sarfraz, who belts it through the covers for four with the minimum of fuss. He knows only one way, to counter-attack, and has raced to 14 from 12. It’s the way he plays! 27th over: Pakistan 72-4 (Salahuddin 3, Sarfraz 9) James Anderson returns to the attack after lunch. He bowled a stubborn length before lunch, in more ways than one, though he hints at something a bit fuller in that over. One ball swings sharply back into Salahuddin, who smothers it with bat and pad. It’s worth updating those Chris Woakes stats 12 Tests at home: 441 runs at 44.10 and 44 wickets at 23.56 12 Tests overseas: 405 runs at 20.25 and 18 wickets at 61.77 He’s an All-Time World XI in one country and Ilford 2nds in the rest. Lunchtime listening Who knew techno could be so moving? Lunchtime reading (and a free cricket-writing masterclass) Thanks Nick, hello everyone. On the face of it, Every Loser Wins by EastEnders heart-throb Nick Berry is an epic meditation on the value of perseverance in the face of life’s vicissitudes. In fact, it’s a subtle comment on the quirky nature of Test cricket, and why sometimes it’s a good thing to lose the toss. The Ashes of 2005 and 2015 turned England’s way when they lost a toss at Edgbaston, and they benefitted from something similar at Headingley this morning. Pakistan didn’t necessarily make a mistake by batting first – as Nasser Hussain says on Sky, it was roughly a 50:50 call – but it’s easy to imagine the heap England might be in had they won the toss and batted first in tricky conditions. Instead, Stuart Broad and Blighty specialist Chris Woakes pitched the ball up and reduced Pakistan to 68 for four. England are back! (NB: They’re not actually back, but it’s been a good morning.) That’s it from me for the moment: Rob Smyth will take the first hour after lunch, then I’ll be back for the second bit of the afternoon. Direct your emails here until then. Having asked you to sign up for the Spin, we should probably give you a sample of what you’re signing up for. Here’s the latest edition, by Tanya Aldred. Strong morning for England, and despite suggestions that they should have more wickets by this point, I’d wager they would have whipped your arm off like a hungry shark if you’d offered them this at the start of play. Of the three bowlers only Curran has looked a bit innocuous, and we’ll let him off that for now as he’s not old enough to rent a car. 26th over: Pakistan 68-4 (Usman 3, Sarfraz 6) Sarfraz spends a decent amount of time complaining about movement behind the bowler’s arm, which brings up two thoughts: 1) is it really that distracting if someone shifts a little bit near the sight screen and 2) the players’ balconies are right above said sight screen - isn’t that going to cause a few problems? Anyway, Sarfraz settles himself enough to drive Broad through the covers for four, despite a despairing dive from Curran, then flick another round the corner. And that’s lunch. 25th over: Pakistan 63-4 (Usman 3, Sarfraz 1) Skip’s in, and he gets off the mark straight away with a tuck off his hips. Good morning for England thus far. Another in what will probably be the last over before lunch would pop a little bow on it. Usman is off the mark, flicking a full straight one from Woakes off his toes for three just wide of mid-on. But then he loses his partner, Shafiq edging a terrific ball from Woakes - your classic off-stump away ducker - which Cook juggles but catches at first slip. 24th over: Pakistan 59-3 (Shafiq 27, Usman 0) The old man is back to show the young shaver how it’s done: Broad returns and beats Shafiq’s edge twice, but then sends down a slightly laboured bouncer which Shafiq jumps all over, pulling just in front of mid-wicket and collects four. 23rd over: Pakistan 55-3 (Shafiq 23, Usman 0) Whoosh. Peach of a lifter from Woakes tickles Usman’s nose: there was a noise there, although there wasn’t really an appeal from bowler or keeper...and snicko suggests there was a tickle on the fingertip as it went through. Technically an opportunity missed for England, but it was such a small sound it seemed more like a flick of the shirt or something 22nd over: Pakistan 53-3 (Shafiq 22, Usman 0) Usman Salahuddin is the new man in, making his Test debut in what is also his 100th first class game, seven years after making his international bow. He watches from the other end as Shafiq blocks out most of an over from Curran, then plays a nice carve for four through gully. 21st over: Pakistan 49-3 (Shafiq 18, Usman 0) Wicket at a good time for England: those two batsmen were looking settled. Haris had been looking good until then, playing a nothing shot to a ball on a decent line from Woakes, hanging his willow out there (as it were), catching the edge through to Malan at second slipper, where he takes a good low one. 20th over: Pakistan 46-2 (Haris 26, Shafiq 17) Good fielding from Buttler, chasing down a Haris push towards the ropes off Curran to save a run. They merely take three: at those points fielders must have some existential questions for themselves, wondering what on earth they’re doing with their lives, throwing themselves around like loons for the sake of a single. 19th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Haris 23, Shafiq 16) Woakes has an appeal of his own, otherwise a fairly uneventful over. Tom Bowtell has been at the stats again. “Lovely to see Broad getting it to spit past the edge like old times. He’s currently 31 years and 342 days. Since he was that age, Jimmy has taken 180 wickets at 21.42, so there could be life in those ludicrously long legs yet...” 18th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Haris 23, Shafiq 16) For a cruel tiny moment, Curran thought he had snuck through Shafiq’s defences, but like a child having an ice cream whipped away from him, a pesky bat got in the way. Broad then comes over to offer some advice, and Curran does a decent enough job of looking respectful, but also like he wants to tell the old boy to eff off. Haris times a push rather nicely just in front of point for a couple, then Curran has a big lbw shout, but it looked high and they don’t review on that basis. Decent pace though. 17th over: Pakistan 39-2 (Haris 21, Shafiq 15) Woakes goes across Haris, and Bairstow - but only Bairstow - screams for a caught behind. There was a noise but it was probably a hint of thigh. Decent enough over. 16th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Haris 21, Shafiq 14) And here is Curran. My colleague Rob Smyth, who’ll be on after lunch, sends me this list of teenagers who’ve played for England: 16 Test wickets taken by the under-20s. Curran goes full to Haris, with a hint of swing, but by the third over the batsman seems to have got it sussed: he drives once through the covers for two, then for a second time for four, holding the pose and showing off his excellent form, like a gymnast sticking their arms out to display they’ve nailed the landing. 15th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 14) It’s Chris Woakes first change rather than Curran, replacing Anderson. Woakes sends down the loosener’s loosener which Shafiq plays a slightly odd shot at, a cut off his tip-toes that goes over the covers and to the ropes. Next is a much more convincing shot, from a over-compensating half-volley, Shafiq driving splendidly to pretty much the same spot on the boundary. The rest of the over is better, beating the bat a couple of times, including a big flash that Shafiq misses. As they have a drink, here’s John Starbuck: “I just caught TMS discussing Broad’s run-up, but I noticed myself that it now seems to be a few stutters, then 16 full paces. This is much longer than he used to do, which is a bit odd, as you’d imagine an older bowler would shorten it. It probably means he won’t be able to bowl quite so many overs, but if it means he gets more wickets, as he’s doing so far, perhaps that won’t matter too much. I recall lots of fast bowlers (West Indies and Australia mainly) in the old days would start from somewhere near the boundary. Presumably it helps to steady their accuracy in some way, or maybe just to irritate the batters?” 14th over: Pakistan 24-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 6) Broad in again, sticks one down leg side then bowls the most perfect leg cutter, starting on middle-off and moving away. The sort of ball that Shafiq just had to stick his bat down, close his eyes and pray he didn’t nick it. After Shafiq gets away from strike, Broad repeats the trick to Haris. Great bowling. 13th over: Pakistan 23-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 5) Anderson continues, which is a bit of a surprise. This over looks a bit tired: a couple of excellent balls, but too many too wide. That will surely be his last of the spell. 12th over: Pakistan 23-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 5) Curran is loosening, so we might see him next up. Meanwhile, Broad beats Haris with an absolute peach that moves away. He has a little grin on his face at the top of his run - think Broad is having a lovely time out there. Another one nearly gets through but Haris gets a single, jabbed into the covers. 11th over: Pakistan 22-2 (Haris 14, Shafiq 5) Possibly Pakistan’s first really convincing shot of the day comes as Shafiq plays an absolutely perfect cover drive to the ropes. Honestly, you could frame that and hang it above the fireplace. Beautiful. 10th over: Pakistan 18-2 (Haris 14, Shafiq 1) Shafiq goes positive straight away, and gets off the mark with a leading edge through the covers. Azhar’s 40-minute nightmare comes to an end, as Broad gets one to dip in just enough to trap him in front. Brief suggestion of a review, but that looked stone dead. 9th over: Pakistan 17-1 (Azhar 2, Haris 14) Azhar still looks in some bother, beaten on the outside then the inside edge. Eventually he walks down the pitch to try smothering the swing, but the best he can manage from the over is a leg bye. 8th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Azhar 2, Haris 14) Azhar gets another single from an edge, that one an insider that saved him from a pretty certain lbw. Haris then drives without timing it that well through the covers, and they take two. Then four for Haris, a drive just in front of point that was in the air for a while, and was a bit outside-halfy. And then another four, with a proper edge that flew just - just - over the slips. Pakistan still haven’t really played a convincing shot, but Gary disagrees with me... 7th over: Pakistan 5-1 (Azhar 1, Haris 4) Pakistan’s first boundary comes from a peach of a ball from Anderson, on off stump and shaping away that Haris gets a thick outside edge on, and it zips through the slips to the third man fence. Anderson beats the edge with another couple, and despite the naysayers I reckon England are bowling pretty well here. For those asking, here’s the TMS YouTube link for those reading/listening abroad. 6th over: Pakistan 1-1 (Azhar 1, Haris 0) Getting quite a few tweets and emails complaining about how England are bowling this morning, from who I think are England supporters. Sure, a few might have been a touch wide but these two batsman are just surviving at the moment. There are plenty of times to whinge about this England team, but I would say now isn’t one of them. Another maiden, Broad getting Azhar to play plenty. 5th over: Pakistan 1-1 (Azhar 1, Haris 0) A run! Azhar nudges into the leg side, and Pakistan are off the mark, to sarcastic cheers from what crowd can get in Headingley given that one end is being constructed. And no, I will not be letting this one go. Anderson’s last ball is very full from around the wicket and moves an outrageous amount, but started just to wide for the swing to hit Haris’s stumps. Not too far away though. 4th over: Pakistan 0-1 (Azhar 0, Haris 0) Broad sends a few far too wide, so tries coming round the wicket. Haris plays a big shot at the first one vaguely in his arc, lucky not to nick one that shifted significantly away. Another blank for the tourists. Not making them play enough though. 3rd over: Pakistan 0-1 (Azhar 0, Haris 0) Big hoop in from Anderson at Azhar, which he does well to keep out. The rest of the over is there or thereabouts, without Azhar being in much serious trouble, and is another maiden. “I disagree with the mindset that you can only have a single ‘keeper in the side,” writes Christian Seller. “If a specialist ‘keeper is good enough to get in the side for his batting, then he should get the nod. I seem to recall the Kiwis going in to a test against England at this ground a few years ago with 4 of them* and winning the match. Indeed, all four of them scored at least a 50 in that match, if Statsguru is to be believed (which it always is).” *Latham, McCullum, Watling and Ronchi, if you’re asking. 2nd over: Pakistan 0-1 (Azhar 0, Haris 0) Broad was getting movement both ways in that over, but looking at the reply of the wicket it didn’t look like it went that far, if at all. The reprieve doesn’t last long. Broad throws one up, a lovely line and length for a drive but there may have been a touch of away movement and a thick edge goes high to Root at third slip. Good catch, good start for England. And it was too high! A good inch or two as well. Imam survives, an excellent review, but he might worry that he was so easily beaten by the in-dip. There was some talk that Broad might not get the new ball, but he does take it and traps Imam lbw first ball! The finger goes up, but it looks high enough to send it upstairs. 1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Azhar 0, Imam 0) Bit of movement first up for Anderson, beating Azhar all ends with the opening and closing balls of the over. The rest of the over wasn’t quite pitched up enough, or too wide, but some encouragement at least for England’s bowlers. The players are out. Anderson will have the new pill, bowling to Azhar. Here’s a grumble of my own: how come we’re playing a Test at Headingley when it’s half a building site, when, say, Old Trafford doesn’t have a Test this summer? I guess there is a straightforward answer, but of course I couldn’t possibly comment on that... “Why is Curran in, rather than a bit of continuity for Wood?” asks Jenny Newcombe. “Already churning. I don’t get it.” I guess the theory is that Wood wasn’t much good at Lord’s so doesn’t necessarily deserve the continuity, plus Curran beefs up the batting a bit, plus it’s always handy to have a left-armer in there. “Is it me or is the shape of the England team looking weirder and weirder?” grumbles Peter Salmon. “I grew up in an era of six batsmen, a wicketkeeper, four bowlers. If the number six was an all rounder that was great, and hopefully one of the bowlers was a spinner. Now we have two wicketkeepers who should just be batsmen, fast bowlers at number 7 and all sorts of nonsense. In football, goalkeepers are much better at passing nowadays, but you don’t play three of them in a side. I realise things have changed, but the old template lasted well over a hundred years and it feels like at least referring to it occasionally might be helpful.” “If I remember right,” remembers Kevin Wilson, “in what will forever be known as the ‘Kerrigan Test’, Woakes batted at six. A demotion for the poor lad.” You are quite correct. Also worth noting that Kerrigan only actually bowled eight overs in that Test, enough to scar a man for life. Poor bloke. So the expected changes for England, and it’ll be very exciting to see how Curran does. Might he even take the new ball? Just one change for Pakistan, Babar Azam injured and Usman Salahuddin coming in. England Alastair Cook, Keaton Jennings, Joe Root (c), Dawid Malan, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Sam Curran, Dom Bess, Stuart Broad, Jimmy Anderson Pakistan Azhar Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Haris Sohail, Asad Shafiq, Usman Salahuddin, Sarfraz Ahmed (c &amp; wk), Shadab Khan, Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Abbas ...will bat first. “Given that England’s tail pretty much starts with the openers,” writes Sam Kelly, “does it matter where Woakes bats?” Oof. SCurran has been given his cap (by Graham Thorpe), which means he’ll be the first left-arm quick to play for England in a Test since...Ryan Sidebottom? Am I forgetting anyone there? If Vish here is right - and he very often is - Stokes hasn’t made it, which means a debut for Sam Curran, plus Mark Wood is out in favour of Chris Woakes...who will...gulp...bat at 7. That’s...that’s a relatively lengthy tail. England are in a pickle. No wins in the last eight Tests, still to find an opening partner for Alastair Cook (who some people want dropped, as if it’s not hard enough to find one reliable opener, never mind two), still to really find a spinner, still to find a third fast bowler (or even a second, depending on what you think of Stuart Broad’s form), still a spot or two uncertain in the middle order, still to really work out what Trevor Bayliss does apart from peer out from under that hat at the end of a day’s play and run through exactly what went wrong. Still, let’s focus on some good news. Jimmy Anderson is bowling better than ever, having taken 68 wickets at 19.36 in the last year (15 Tests), Jonny Bairstow is fit to play and Jos Buttler is back in the team. Plus they’re playing Pakistan, which is always pretty joyful. Because, among other things, they have Mohammad Amir. I’ve never seen anything like him, at that age, when he showed up in England in 2010. It’s one of the great tragedies of sport that we missed five years of this generational talent, because while he’s good now, what on earth might he be like had he not been banned. He’ll be bowling to Keaton Jennings, one of possibly two changes to the England team, depending on Ben Stokes’s fitness. Could be on for another ripper. Stick around. Toss: 10.30am BST Nick will be here shortly. In the meantime you can read Tim de Lisle’s thought-provoking piece about the difficulties of opening the batting alongside Alastair Cook …"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/05/identity-fraud-credit-card-scam-action-fraud-bank","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T07:50:59Z","webTitle":"Fraudsters ran up a £16,000 bill – but they still get sent more credit cards","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/05/identity-fraud-credit-card-scam-action-fraud-bank","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/05/identity-fraud-credit-card-scam-action-fraud-bank","fields":{"headline":"Fraudsters ran up a £16,000 bill – but they still get sent more credit cards","bodyText":"I have been the victim of identity theft and card fraud over several months now. I have had a bank account opened in my name and four credit cards issued, two of which have been maxed out and run up more than £16,000. I have reported events as they happen to Action Fraud and dealt with the banks directly to stop the accounts. However, as there seems to be no end to the card applications being passed, I am wondering if something is going wrong with the reporting to the credit agencies that would flag up concerns attached to my name and address. There is also the issue of how they are physically getting hold of the cards, as they have not come to the house. I have applied for an Experian report but it insists I send it several forms of ID. I have had to take days off work to sort it out. Every time a white envelope comes through the door now, I feel sick. SM, London What a nightmare this has been, and our first reaction was that you must make sure you are registered with Cifas – the fraud prevention body that will warn any other bank that your ID has been used by thieves. This has since been done and should prevent any future applications succeeding. The next thing to do is to get a copy of your credit file. You said you were having problems. We asked Experian’s HQ to step in and it has now sorted this out and sent you a code that will enable you to see your file. You probably need to contact the other two credit agencies, Equifax and CallCredit, too. Experian says that once you have established the fraudulent applications, its “victims of fraud team” will then dispute these entries directly with the lenders on your behalf, to help take away some of the legwork. It says it will take some time to sort out, depending on the extent of the fraud. However, once it is all done, your credit file should be restored. It also says you should consider adding a password to this report using a “notice of correction”. This is an additional security measure that can be sensible if your identity has been compromised, particularly as not all lenders are members of Cifas – this was a new one to me and, I suspect, many others. Lastly, I would be asking for compensation from the bank (HSBC) and the card providers to cover the days that it will take you to get it all resolved.

But some faced losing far more. Since 2016, employers have been obliged to report to the Home Office anyone in the UK on a tier 2 “skilled worker” visa who exceeds 20 days’ unpaid absence in a year. Had the action continued, migrant lecturers who took part would have risked deportation. It is just one way in which the “hostile environment policy”, pursued by the government since 2010 to make living in the UK as uncomfortable as possible for illegal migrants, affects university students and staff who are in the UK legitimately, according to Sanaz Raji, an independent researcher and founder of the campaign group Unis Resist Border Controls (URBC). “It’s not like Prevent [the government’s counter-terrorism strategy], where the way it’s implemented you know it’s a policy. It’s a far more pernicious level of surveillance,” she says. On Tuesday, the group launches a survey targeted at administrators, lecturers and students to find out how institutions are responding to immigration policies. The aim is to prepare a united effort to oppose practices that disadvantage migrant staff and students. The points-based immigration system, brought in by Labour, meant universities must act as sponsors for their non-EU students and staff. The Home Office can withdraw universities’ right to recruit international students if they accept too many who are later declined visas or whose attendance is poor. Tougher policies affecting universities followed under David Cameron in 2010. Overseas graduates can no longer remain in the UK for up to two years to look for, and take up, work and international students face time limits on how long they can study in the UK. They must now pay a health levy, and the amount they must prove they have set aside for maintenance while they study has increased. The government has also increased the minimum amount skilled migrants must earn to be allowed to work in the UK, with knock-on effects for lecturers and graduates. Duncan Lane, director of advice and training at the UK Council for International Student Affairs, says pressure to comply with stringent Home Office practices to retain a licence to recruit foreign students, and “complex and changeable” immigration rules, often lead institutions to take “an understandably risk-averse approach”. “Unfortunately, the balance of accountability is uneven. When the Home Office makes errors or when caseworkers rigidly follow instructions that often lead to punitively absurd decisions, the student suffers with devastating results – both as regards their studies and their immigration status. This causes undue distress to the student while not even serving the integrity of immigration control.” Raji says institutions have responded to government demands differently, with some more zealous than others. In 2013, Sunderland and Ulster universities were found to be employing biometric fingerprinting to track international students at their London campuses, although both have changed this to digital registers or swipe cards. Coventry University, which caused controversy by asking international students to check in three times a week, now asks students to swipe in for teaching sessions. More common is for universities to ask lecturers to take registers. But Caoimhe Mader McGuinness, a lecturer in drama at Kingston University, and a member of URBC, says she finds this problematic because it is often presented as a way of safeguarding students, particularly in the light of increased concerns about student mental health. “It is sold to lecturers as a way of making sure that the student is taken into account and sees someone, but this is also the sort of data that is used by the Home Office to, if they so wish, declare that that student hasn’t been to enough contact points and then potentially deport them,” she says. Universities also differ in their monitoring of staff. Earlier this year, Times Higher Education reported that the University of York had sent an email to all staff asking them to check whether foreign visitors to their department had visas and what they were doing in the UK. The university said this was aimed at “helping us reduce the university’s right to work and sponsorship risks”. Earlier this year, Sussex University warned international staff that the institution was due to be audited by UK Borders and Immigration and they needed to report times when they were absent from their offices between 9am and 5pm, Monday to Friday – not easy for academics who move around the campus and rarely keep office hours. A university spokesman said: “The university is legally required to comply with the UK government’s policies. Our role is to make sure our staff understand what information the university has been asked to provide.” URBC members have been delivering “resistance workshops” across the UK, informing people about how government immigration policies have affected universities. It has also been involved with a number of specific cases, including Luqman Onikosi, an MA student at Sussex whose appeal to stay in the UK to have life-saving treatment for a liver condition was rejected by the Home Office, causing the university to revoke his student status. The Home Office says his application was fully considered and “an immigration judge found that he has no right to remain in the UK”. URBC has also supported Ahmed Sedeeq, an Iraqi PhD student at the University of Sheffield, whose student visa was curtailed after his asylum application was rejected. A spokesperson from the university said: “Ahmed has returned to his studies and we continue to support him and all international students with information and guidance on UK immigration and visas.” Raji claims that many UK universities have been more complicit in the “hostile environment policy” than necessary, and calls on student and staff unions, as well as institutions, to offer more support to those affected, including access to lawyers. “There is no push back within institutions in the UK university system, and that’s really alarming,” she said. A spokesman for Universities UK says its members have worked with the Home Office to ensure any changes to immigration compliance are “proportionate and reasonable”. A Home Office spokesman said the number of university-sponsored visa applications is higher than in 2010. She said: “We welcome international students. There is no limit to the number of genuine international students who can come here to study.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/02/low-paid-face-decade-wage-squeeze","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T23:05:31Z","webTitle":"Britain’s low-paid face decade of wage squeeze","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/02/low-paid-face-decade-wage-squeeze","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/02/low-paid-face-decade-wage-squeeze","fields":{"headline":"Britain’s low-paid face decade of wage squeeze","bodyText":"The wages of 10 million low-paid workers have stalled for two decades and face pressure for a decade to come, according to a bleak assessment of Britain’s future jobs market. Global economic competition, automation, the shift to the gig economy and a widening regional divide will see further pressure placed on the incomes of those earning between £10,000 and £15,000, it warns. The analysis by the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) thinktank, which is on the political right and chaired by the former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, also blamed a chronic national failure to boost skills and education. It will be seen as another warning to Theresa May from Conservative figures to kickstart her domestic agenda. There have been concerns within the party that the focus on Brexit has led to inaction in other crucial areas that could hold Britain back after its exit from the European Union. The analysis, co-written by Boris Johnson’s former economic adviser and Brexit supporter Gerard Lyons, concludes that wages of those on the lowest salaries stalled long before the 2008 financial crash. It warns that the current evidence shows that most never escape a life on low pay. The centre’s support for action on low pay shows that it is now an issue of concern across the political spectrum, with automation expected to place further pressure on jobs in some low-paid sectors unless new skills and opportunities are developed. The CSJ report states that 20% of Britain’s 33 million workers earn £15,000 a year or less, and that 50% earn no more than £23,200. Only 10% of employees, or about 3 million people, earn above £53,000 a year. Britain does not compare well with other developed nations when it comes to low pay, it states. Taking data from manufacturing, and giving the US a score of 100, Switzerland topped the table with a pay rate of 155, followed by Norway on 126, Germany on 111 and France on 97. However, the UK was much further behind, on 73. While the report shares concerns about low pay, it argues that the UK should prepare for automation by stripping back taxes and regulation. “The biggest opportunity for the UK is to unleash the potential of the private sector, particularly small and medium-sized firms, helped by lower regulations and taxes,” it states. “The wider macroeconomic environment has driven some of these changes. Globalisation has added to intense competition, suppressing costs and wage growth.” It warns of the reliance of the UK economy on the financial sector, Britain’s continuing budget deficit and the regional imbalances between London and the rest of the country. Half the people employed in so-called elementary occupations, such as bar staff, clerks, care workers and labourers, are on low pay, as defined by two-thirds of the median income of £25,000 a year. It urges a skills overhaul to deal with the coming pressures. The authors conclude: “The British labour market has changed significantly in the last 20 years. There are more people in work than at any time on record, driven partially by a growth in the number of women entering the workforce, the increase in the number of people working part-time, people working far longer into old age, and a large influx of workers from abroad. “This far more diverse workforce is increasingly employed in the service sector, as manufacturing has continued to cut the number of workers, and mobility between low-paid, low-skilled jobs and high-paid, high-skilled jobs seems to be decreasing.” Other research suggests there is better news for those on low pay. The Resolution Foundation thinktank recently found that a smaller proportion of UK workers are low paid now than at any time since the early 1980s, due to above-inflation increases in the government’s national living wage. The national minimum wage has risen from £6.70 in 2016 to £7.50 in 2017 and £7.83 from April 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/03/observer-view-european-union-foreign-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"The Observer view on EU foreign policy: a united voice speaks louder in a fractured | Observer editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/observer-view-european-union-foreign-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/observer-view-european-union-foreign-policy","fields":{"headline":"The Observer view on EU foreign policy: a united voice speaks louder in a fractured world","bodyText":"In a new policy brief from the European Council on Foreign Relations, an independent thinktank, authors Mark Leonard and Anthony Dworkin pose the question: “Can Europe save the world order?” After another week of intense political turmoil in Italy, Spain and Greece, contagious eurozone instability that sent global stock markets plunging, and an unprovoked, highly damaging trade assault by the continent’s closest ally, a more apposite question might be: “Who in the world can save Europe?” The ECFR report underscores what most Europeans, close observers of the international scene or not, instinctively know: “The world is becoming a scarier place… Rules and alliances that promoted international co-operation and stability seem to be losing their hold. In their place, there is a resurgence of international relations based on assertive nationalism, winner-takes-all competition and disdain for the rule of law. Authoritarianism and illiberalism are in the ascendant, at the expense of democracy and human rights. European leaders, the report argues, face a choice: defend the post-1945, rules-based, collaborative world order by joining together to uphold progressive and democratic values at home and abroad – or don’t and face the consequences. Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, bluntly summed up the challenge earlier this year. “In our joint European policy, we want to show results. As Europeans we will be unbeatable if we remain united,” she said. The unspoken alternative was clear: risk being steamrollered by the forces of reaction, typified by Donald Trump, China, Russia and Europe’s own hard-right and hard-left nationalists, demagogues and xenophobes. The divisions undermining efforts to forge unified European positions have rarely been more evident or more daunting. Italy’s governmental crisis, peaking last week, is a case in point. It dramatised Europe-wide tensions between insurgent populist parties, feeding on public resentment over austerity and immigration, and traditional politics as usual. Italy’s travails also highlighted the alarming fragility of the eurozone system, beset as ever by contradictions between the needs of national economies, particularly in southern Europe, and those of the European Central Bank (ECB) headquartered, significantly, in Frankfurt. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president and leading advocate of enhanced integration, intended this month’s EU summit to be a showcase for his eurozone reforms. Macron proposed creating a joint eurozone budget and the post of European finance minister. His ideas were already watered down under German and Dutch pressure before Italy’s Five Star Movement and its eurosceptic allies took power, promising to tear up deficit and borrowing rules. Now, even modest ECB plans to end quantitative easing this year and restore a “normal” interest rates policy may be in jeopardy. Macron’s ideas about an integrated “sovereign Europe” standing up for itself in the world extend to defence, education, research and migration. “We will propose a clear, ambitious roadmap for this re-foundation,” he said in March. But it all looks increasingly unrealistic. His path ahead is now strewn with additional obstacles, not least the growing concern whether Greece, struggling after years of austerity and still €320bn in debt, will be able to manage once a third EU bailout ends this summer. Last week’s general strike reflected Greeks’ ongoing misery. Slower than expected 2018 growth across Europe, German mercantilist tendencies, an extended period of political instability in Spain following prime minister Mariano Rajoy’s sudden downfall last week, and bitter internal arguments with Poland and others about legal standards, media freedom and the distribution of regional funds in the next EU budget all diminish the prospect of a strong, united Europe crusading for shared values. And nobody in Brussels has come close to articulating a credible joint policy on the corrosive issue of migration, which continues to divide and weaken communities and countries across the entire bloc. In this sea of troubles, the British government’s conceited belief the EU summit will give top billing to its selfish Brexit drama would be amusing if it were not so dismayingly symptomatic of Theresa May’s delusional politics. The reality is that the UK’s chaotic attempts to cut itself adrift from the EU, desperately ill-advised two years ago, are now even more obviously at odds with Britain and Europe’s shared interests. We do not need Russia to poison people in a British city to recognise the expanding threat to common values posed by Vladimir Putin’s hostile, corrupt regime. Even the most blinkered hard Tory Brexiter surely grasps that the UK alone cannot begin to counter the global spread of the anti-democratic ideology represented by China’s communist-capitalist president-for-life, Xi Jinping. And look who’s joined the growing band of aggressively authoritarian super-nationalists. None other than the US president. Trump’s provocative and potentially illegal decision to impose swingeing tariffs on European steel and aluminium imports, closely following his sabotage of the Iran nuclear deal, proves beyond doubt how untrustworthy and unreliable a partner the US has become under his leadership. Trump symbolises the trend away from rules-based multilateralism towards an irresponsible, dog-eat-dog global mindset. If Europe and its values are to survive, let alone prosper, European countries must hang tough together – and Britain must stand with them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/02/juncker-eu-italy-olive-branch","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T19:25:26Z","webTitle":"Juncker: EU won’t ‘meddle’ in Italy’s affairs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/juncker-eu-italy-olive-branch","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/02/juncker-eu-italy-olive-branch","fields":{"headline":"Juncker: EU won’t ‘meddle’ in Italy’s affairs","bodyText":"Jean-Claude Juncker has thrown the new government in Rome an olive branch, warning that Brussels and “German-speaking countries” must not repeat the error made during the Greek crisis by reading stern lectures to the Italian people. The president of the European commission said that, while he had been tempted to intervene during the recent political impasse in Italy, he was determined not to feed the populist narrative: that the EU is meddling in domestic affairs. Juncker noted that the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the rightwing League party had both recently dropped their policy of exit from the European Union, and he would judge them on their deeds and not their rhetoric. Giuseppe Conte was sworn in as Italian prime minister on Friday after a last-ditch coalition deal between the two parties ended months of political deadlock and narrowly averted the need for a snap election in the eurozone’s third-largest economy. Conte attended a military parade on his first full day in office, while his deputy Matteo Salvini, head of the League and an ally of French rightwing leader Marine Le Pen, was heading to Sicily as part of his campaign against illegal immigration. In an interview with German news service RedaktionsNetzwerk, Juncker admitted to “concern” about the recent developments in Italy, but insisted that the recent turmoil in the financial markets in response to the new government had been “irrational” and should not be seen as a guide to how the political story will unfold in Rome. “I think very highly of President Mattarella, but I have not spoken to him during this crisis. I have not interfered, although I have been tempted to,” Juncker said. “I do not want to feed the accusations spread by the populists that we are sitting in Brussels meddling in Italy’s affairs. I am certain the Italians have a keen sense of what is good for their country. They will sort it out.” But he went on: “By keeping out of it, I’m not helping. By getting involved, I’m not helping. I am caught between a rock and a hard place.” The commission president had flirted with danger on Thursday by suggesting that the EU should not be blamed for the state of Italy’s poorer regions, where there needed to be “more work” and “less corruption”. Rather than blaming the EU, there needed to be more “seriousness” within the country about tackling its economic and social problems, he said. In this latest interview, Juncker claimed that he had personally fought against those who wanted to launch an excessive debt procedure against Italy over the state of its finances, a process that would be designed to give the EU more power to enforce austerity on Rome. Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, has a public debt second only to Greece’s and there was a negative reaction from the financial markets to the League-M5S coalition, which plans to significantly raise public spending. Juncker offered a more placatory tone, suggesting that Brussels and Berlin had learned the lessons of the Greek crisis. He also denied that the eurozone was set on a course for another economic downturn: “The Italians cannot really complain about austerity measures from Brussels. However, I do not now want to lecture Rome. We must treat Italy with respect. Too many lectures were given to Greece in the past, in particular from German-speaking countries. This dealt a blow to the dignity of the Greek people. The same thing must not be allowed to happen to Italy.” Juncker said that the financial markets’ reaction was “irrational”: “People should not draw political conclusions from every fluctuation in the stock market. Investors have been wrong on so many occasions.” Neither of the coalition parties in the new Italian government campaigned on leaving the euro or the EU, but both have backed such calls in the past and are scathing about the rules that underpin the eurozone. Mujtaba Rahman, a former European commission and UK Treasury official who now works for consultancy the Eurasia Group, warned that as the cornerstone of the coalition government’s platform was fiscal expansion, it was liable to clash with the commission this autumn. “Though no official estimates have been produced, independent estimates suggest the proposed measures would cost, combined, upwards of €100bn per annum, around 6% of GDP.“If the government were to propose a very expansionary budget, the commission – which provides its opinions and recommendations on member states’ draft budgetary plans – would have to reject it in September. This would be a first, and would set the stage for a real confrontation with Rome,” he said. “A significant deviation from EU-mandated fiscal targets may prompt the commission to open a new Excessive Deficit Procedure, a process designed to give the EU more power to enforce austerity on Rome. Yet the symbolism of this move would only strengthen the Italian government’s domestic standing.”The size of the Italian economy means that a bailout in line with that given to Greece – should the financial markets turn on the Italian government – would be a huge and crippling endeavour for the EU. Rumours have emerged in Brussels that Berlin is looking at a plan B which would instead involve seeking to contain the spill over of future economic turmoil in Italy. Daniel Gros, a German economist, and director of the Centre for European Policy Studies think-tank, said: “The view is that it would be impossible to do a standard European Stability Mechanism programme for Italy because you would exhaust the entire capacity of the ESM. And Italy is not like Greece: it has a strong economy, it has a current account surplus and critically it has very little net foreign debt as a country. It would make no sense. Yet an ESM might be needed, if things get rough, to help Spain and Portugal. He added: “This is not an economic problem where economic measures are needed but just some crazy politics for which one does not understand the rationale... There is very little Brussels can do. I think they are still hoping that somehow they can bring Italy to reason, but I think that is a forlorn hope”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/02/legal-challenge-rent-rules-discriminate-non-uk-nationals","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T23:05:00Z","webTitle":"Legal challenge says ‘right to rent’ rules discriminate against non-UK nationals","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/02/legal-challenge-rent-rules-discriminate-non-uk-nationals","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/02/legal-challenge-rent-rules-discriminate-non-uk-nationals","fields":{"headline":"Legal challenge says ‘right to rent’ rules discriminate against non-UK nationals","bodyText":"Plans to force landlords across Britain to check the immigration status of potential tenants will be challenged in court this week after claims that they are causing serious discrimination. Landlords, politicians and immigration lawyers have all raised concerns about the “right to rent” policy, a key branch of the government’s attempt to create a “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants. Under the rules landlords face fines, or even prison, should they house people with no right to be in the country. However, there is now evidence that landlords are ignoring tenancy applications from people with “foreign-sounding” names, from ethnic minorities, and from those without British passports. Choosing someone with a British passport means landlords do not have to carry out additional online checks. The case follows criticism of the policy during the Windrush scandal, which saw those with full rights to stay in the UK prevented from taking a job, renting a house or claiming benefits because they could not prove their status. Ministers will face a legal challenge in the high court this week in a case brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), which claims that the policy is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights and must be reviewed before it is rolled out any further. Research by the JCWI found that, as a result of the scheme, 51% of landlords said that they were now less likely to consider renting to non-EU nationals, while 42% were now less likely to rent to those without a UK passport. The latter figure increased to 48% when landlords were explicitly asked to consider the criminal penalties in place. Another survey by the Residential Landlords Association (RLA) of almost 2,800 landlords found that 43% were less likely to rent to anyone without a UK passport, and 46% less likely to rent to a foreign national from outside the EU. The “right to rent” proposals have been controversial since their inception under the coalition government. Eric Pickles, the former Conservative communities secretary, was among those who opposed their introduction, suggesting that the plans would force anyone worried about their immigration status into the arms of rogue landlords. They have since been rolled out across England, but not yet to the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The RLA, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Housing, Crisis, the Immigration Law Practitioners Association, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, and Liberty are among the groups to have raised concerns. Phillippa Kaufmann QC, who is representing JCWI, said the group was arguing that the policy was clearly affecting people who were in Britain legally. “Landlords are incentivised by the very nature of the scheme to go down the path of least resistance,” she said. “If they have someone who comes to them with a British passport, they know they are at no risk of criminal liability. “JCWI argues that the government is not in any position to justify this policy because it has not gathered any evidence that its ‘hostile environment’ is having any effect – that is, the desired effect of prompting illegal migrants to leave, rather than going underground to be exploited by rogue landlords. “It can’t show that it is achieving that end, and it can’t show it has given any consideration of the unintended impact it is having.” A Home Office spokeswoman said: “It would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/02/tory-remainers-hold-key-to-86-seats-hard-brexit","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T20:00:27Z","webTitle":"Tory Remainers could hold the key to 86 of the party’s seats","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/02/tory-remainers-hold-key-to-86-seats-hard-brexit","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/02/tory-remainers-hold-key-to-86-seats-hard-brexit","fields":{"headline":"Tory Remainers could hold the key to 86 of the party’s seats","bodyText":"More than 80 Conservative MPs face a major electoral challenge as a result of Theresa May’s pursuit of a hard Brexit, a major new study reveals. In an analysis that exposes the scale of the party’s support from voters who backed Remain, it found that 3.5 million people in Britain voted to remain in the European Union in 2016 and then went on to back the Conservatives in last year’s election. More than a million live in London and the south-east, with another 800,000 living in either the east of England or the south-west. It means there are significant areas of the country in which the party will have to hold on to Remain voters if they are to protect the seats from Labour or the Liberal Democrats. The study, compiled using data from a 175,000-strong panel set up by pollsters YouGov, estimates that there are 86 Conservative-held constituencies where the number of Tory voters who backed Remain exceeds the party’s current majority. Tories at risk include Amber Rudd in Hastings and Rye, Zac Goldsmith in Richmond Park, Paul Masterton in East Renfrewshire and Justine Greening in Putney. The study makes clear that, while there has been much attention on voters in Labour heartlands who backed Brexit, the Tories also have an issue with voters who backed Remain. Recent evidence from the British Election Study suggests Conservative Remainers are more likely to care about Brexit than Labour Leavers. In a sign of the crucial role to be played by Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader seen as a future national leader, the seats in question include 12 out of its 13 in Scotland. Davidson previously backed a softer Brexit than the one advocated by the prime minister. Last week, she also called for a Brexit that did not “raise the drawbridge and pull down the shutters”. Other constituencies in which the Tory Remainer vote exceeds the party’s majority include six out of eight of its Welsh constituencies, more than half of the party’s 20 constituencies in north-west England and more than half of its 21 seats in London. The study, by former Labour strategists Ian Warren and Kevin Cunningham of Election Data, also includes a worrying trend for the Tories in local byelections in areas with high levels of pro-Remain Conservatives. In the east of England, south-east and south-west, the Conservatives have lost more than a third (68 out of 168) of the local byelections it was defending. More than half were lost to the Lib Dems, who are backing a referendum on the final Brexit deal. It will give pause for thought to Tory MPs and the party’s high command as it attempts to form an electoral coalition able to deliver a majority. Senior Tories are openly pushing for a “sensible Brexit”, a compromise to soften the government’s position. Former cabinet ministers Greening, Rudd and Damian Green went to No 10 last week in an attempt to persuade May to back a position that would unite most of the party around a compromise, which could see Britain stay inside a customs union with the EU for years after the transition period ends in 2021. The new data will embolden Labour figures pushing the party into a much softer position on Brexit. While Labour has backed staying in a customs union with the EU, it has not backed remaining inside the single market or backing a new referendum on the final Brexit deal. Eloise Todd, from the Best for Britain campaign, said: “This data shows that the Conservatives’ adoption of a hard Brexit could spell disaster for its election hopes, as well as the country.” The dozens of MPs at risk need to start representing their constituents and call on the prime minister to change course.” The study also exposes a major potential role for voters who cast a ballot in the EU referendum, but opted not to vote in the last general election. There are 4.5 million of the voters, 2.9 million of whom backed Leave and 1.6m supported Remain. They could yet shape the next election should they be persuaded to cast a vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/02/matteo-salvini-italy-interior-minister-far-right-hardline-immigration","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T23:05:32Z","webTitle":"Five Star and the League: can Italy’s ‘odd couple’ last?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/matteo-salvini-italy-interior-minister-far-right-hardline-immigration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/02/matteo-salvini-italy-interior-minister-far-right-hardline-immigration","fields":{"headline":"Five Star and the League: can Italy’s ‘odd couple’ last?","bodyText":"To his many critics, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League, is a racist opportunist who is about to take Italy down a dangerously confrontational and xenophobic path. To his supporters, in the League’s northern heartlands, he is a “warrior” whose high-profile instalment as interior minister in western Europe’s first populist government is a symbol of the country’s much-needed pivot to the right. That is certainly the view in Pontida, a relatively prosperous village in the northern Lombardy region’s Alpine foothills, where thousands of League supporters converge once a year for a rowdy celebration in the party’s honour. “Salvini is a great revolutionary,” Giuseppe Paruta, a pensioner who has supported the party since its early days as a northern Italy secessionist movement, told the Observer. “He’s one of us. When he comes to the festival each year, he makes a speech, eats with us, drinks with us. Sometimes he comes across as aggressive, but he’s not a bad person.” Paruta is jokingly known around town as Pontida’s Donald Trump – he sports a hairstyle uncannily similar to that of the US president. “I like him too, but Salvini is better,” he said. Much like Trump, Salvini is esteemed by Paruta and his friends at the town’s Bar8 as the strongman needed to restore law and order in a country they claim is buckling under the weight of the migrant crisis. Salvini supporters admit they have relatively little to complain about: their pensions are good and they own their homes. But they say they resent having had to work so hard for their achievements when they see “illegal immigrants wandering around, doing nothing and not paying taxes like we had to”. They are counting on Salvini to put a stop to all of that. After weeks of tortured negotiations, the 45-year-old Salvini was handed power over the interior ministry on Friday, when the League was sworn into government in coalition with its former rival, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S). Salvini, born in Milan to a middle-class family, was swift to remind voters that his top priority would be to deal with thousands of illegal immigrants. “Open doors for good people and a one-way ticket for those who come to create commotion,” he said. The government was formed despite the apparent collapse of talks when president Sergio Mattarella rejected the coalition’s nomination of controversial Paolo Savona as finance minister. The 81-year-old economist, a noted critic of the European Union, had previously called the euro a “German cage” and his appointment was judged to be beyond the pale by Mattarella. As markets went into turmoil, insults were traded with the EU and calls were made by Luigi Di Maio, leader of M5S, for Mattarella to be impeached. But faced with the prospect of fresh elections in July, Salvini and Di Maio scrambled to put together an alternative cabinet that will now see Savona challenge the EU in the guise of European affairs minister. Meanwhile Giovanni Tria, an economics professor with a more moderate tone towards Europe, was named finance minister. Salvini and Di Maio agreed that neither should become prime minister of the new coalition, instead appointing Giuseppe Conte, a relatively unknown law professor with no political experience, to steer a government programme that includes generous tax cuts, a universal basic income and a raft of hardline policies against illegal immigrants, Roma people and Muslims. They will, however, share the role of deputy premier, with Di Maio, a 31-year-old former waiter, also serving as minister of labour. The new coalition is expected to receive a vote of confidence this week. But while League supporters are happy their hero has made it into government, they have reservations about the union with M5S. Salvini, usually seen wearing jeans and open-necked shirts, is considered by his admirers as a down-to-earth man of conviction. Di Maio, on the other hand, is perceived as a sharp-suited ditherer, who is as inexperienced as he is inconsistent. “The League is totally different from M5S,” said Giulio Sapelli, an economics professor who taught Salvini at the University of Milan. “You never know what they [M5S] are thinking or going to do. For example, this calling for Mattarella to be impeached was crazy.” Sapelli, a eurosceptic who was among those mooted as a potential premier for the coalition, also pointed to the League’s history in government and experience in administering two of Italy’s richest regions – Lombardy and Veneto. Meanwhile, haphazard management has seen M5S lose support in the two biggest cities it runs, Rome and Turin. “It’s very hard to know how long [this government] will last,” added Sapelli. “The League is the only classic ‘rank and file’ party left; M5S is a movement with a weird leadership.” Marco Ghezzi, the League’s candidate for mayor in upcoming local elections in Calolziocorte, a town close to Pontida, would have preferred the party to have stuck with its centre-right coalition partners: Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia and the smaller far-right Brothers of Italy. The group won the biggest share of the vote in the 4 March elections but fell 3% shy of the majority required to govern. Berlusconi stepped aside to allow the League to forge a deal with M5S, which sees the 81-year-old media magnate as a symbol of the corruption it has long railed against, although the alliance still campaigns at regional and local level. “The problem with M5S is that they don’t have a ‘structured party’. Most of it is based online,” said Ghezzi. Ghezzi is expected to win the 10 June vote in Calolziocorte by a landslide, ousting a centre-left Democratic Party leadership, which in itself is an anomaly in a region dominated by the League. At a mayoral hustings on Thursday night, the prime concern of the town’s residents was security. Its population of 15,000 includes about 1,500 foreigners. Ghezzi said most are integrated, but in recent years the area has seen an uptick in the arrival of illegal immigrants. “They hang around the station at night, sleep in abandoned houses and by the river,” he added. “It’s a scandal for the people here, who mostly live in mountain villages and cherish their values and tradition.” Echoing Salvini, Ghezzi said that migrants ought to be vetted before they arrive. Salvini is notoriously quick to speak out when crimes are committed by foreigners, while remaining silent over incidents involving white-skinned Italians. In a recent Facebook post he expressed horror at the alleged gang-rape of an Italian woman by Bengali men in Rome, but failed to mention the arrests of five Italian hotel workers a few days earlier over the alleged rape of a British woman in the holiday town of Sorrento. Ghezzi claims the reactions are different because the proportion of crimes committed by immigrants outweighs that by Italians. Italy’s crime rate has fallen 8.3% over the past decade, according to interior ministry figures, despite the number of foreigners increasing from three to five million. “In Italy, public debate is often not based on reality, but on the perception of reality,” said Matteo Pucciarelli, a journalist at La Repubblica and author of Anatomy of a Populist: the true story of Matteo Salvini. “Crime has gone down, but the feeling of insecurity has risen. Truth doesn’t count, but what you say does, and in this respect Salvini is incredible. We don’t live in the Wild West, but he gives the impression that we do.” Pucciarelli believes that Salvini, whom he describes as a “media animal”, will continue to project false realities while giving the impression that all is in order. “For example, deporting thousands of immigrants is impossible. But all the same he’ll succeed in making it look as if he is a minister ruling with an iron fist.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/02/mps-urged-back-forced-liberalisation-abortion-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T20:01:00Z","webTitle":"MPs step up pressure for Northern Ireland abortion reform","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/mps-urged-back-forced-liberalisation-abortion-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/02/mps-urged-back-forced-liberalisation-abortion-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"MPs step up pressure for Northern Ireland abortion reform","bodyText":"MPs are being canvassed to back a plan to force through measures liberalising abortion in Northern Ireland, it has emerged. A cross-party coalition has drawn up a proposal that would force Theresa May into taking action. Some of the most senior women in the Tory party are said to be supportive of the campaign following the landslide result in Ireland’s referendum in favour of ending its near total ban on abortion. In a letter sent to all MPs seen by the Observer, the cross-party group calls on its colleagues to take a stand and explains that there is a clear constitutional path allowing the Westminster government to act. “Together we view this not as a partisan issue, but a matter for the conscience of all representatives,” the group writes. “By working in this way we want to show we can make progress on a matter of human rights for the benefit of all UK citizens.” It creates a political problem for May, who will have to balance support for reform among her own MPs with the risks involved in upsetting the DUP, which is against any change in Northern Ireland. The DUP’s 10 MPs are propping up her administration. Some MPs want to force a Commons vote this week, as part of an emergency debate on Northern Ireland’s abortion laws. While that vote would not be binding on the government, it would show the prime minister that there is clear support among MPs for liberalising abortion laws in Northern Ireland. The cross-party letter to MPs has been drawn up by Stella Creasy and Diana Johnson from Labour, Jo Swinson from the Lib Dems, Caroline Lucas from the Greens, Liz Saville Roberts from Plaid Cymru and Sarah Wollaston, the Tory chair of the Commons health select committee. “We as a cross party group of parliamentarians call upon our colleagues to recognise the urgency and importance of reforming our outdated abortion laws to put the safety and dignity of all UK women first,” they write. “The situation in Northern Ireland has highlighted to many the need for action to ensure the safety of women. In particular, we are concerned at the unequal treatment of UK citizens, with women in Northern Ireland unable to access abortion even in instances of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality. The prosecution of young women for seeking terminations via taking misoprostol and the thousands who now buy these pills online and so risk their personal safety further reinforce the need for legislation that can address modern healthcare methods. “We are also conscious of the clear evidence the people of Northern Ireland wish to see change; that they recognise the damage being done by these outdated laws and support reform across all faiths, political persuasions and age groups. Indeed, recent opinion polls show more than 70% agree that the issue of abortion is a matter for medical regulation – not criminal law.” Their campaign is backed by the London-Irish Abortion Rights Campaign, Amnesty International, the Family Planning Association, Marie Stopes and National Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory Service (Nupas). The group of MPs believe they have found a way to force the government to intervene in Northern Ireland. The Offences against the Person Act was written in 1861 and makes it a crime for any woman to cause her own abortion. However, the 1967 Abortion Act includes exemptions to women in England and Wales. The group believes they can force all parts of the UK to reconsider their abortion laws by repealing sections of the 1861 Act. “Far from overriding devolution, removing this archaic legislation from the statute creates the direct opportunity for each nation to update its abortion laws for the 21st century and so respects the devolutionary process,” they write. “We believe there is growing cross-party consensus that change in legislation is required to enable modern laws to be enacted.” Creasy said: “The DUP keeps telling us that this isn’t a matter that should even be discussed in parliament, forgetting it’s UK-wide legislation which makes having an abortion a crime. It’s time to stand up for the rights of all women in the UK and show we’re prepared to act. [The DUP leader] Arlene Foster may have her seat at Theresa May’s table, but that doesn’t mean she gets to tell us what to do in Westminster, too.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"crosswords/cryptic/27533","type":"crossword","sectionId":"crosswords","sectionName":"Crosswords","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-11T23:00:34Z","webTitle":"Cryptic crossword No 27,533","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/27533","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/crosswords/cryptic/27533","fields":{"headline":"Cryptic crossword No 27,533","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/03/shetland-seabirds-climate-change-catastrophe-terns-kittiwakes-puffins","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:59:39Z","webTitle":"Eerie silence falls on Shetland cliffs that once echoed to seabirds’ cries","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/03/shetland-seabirds-climate-change-catastrophe-terns-kittiwakes-puffins","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/03/shetland-seabirds-climate-change-catastrophe-terns-kittiwakes-puffins","fields":{"headline":"Eerie silence falls on Shetland cliffs that once echoed to seabirds’ cries","bodyText":"Sumburgh Head lies at the southern tip of mainland Shetland. This dramatic 100-metre-high rocky spur, crowned with a lighthouse built by Robert Louis Stevenson’s grandfather, has a reputation for being one of the biggest and most accessible seabird colonies in Britain. Thousands of puffins, guillemots, razorbills, kittiwakes and fulmars gather there every spring to breed, covering almost every square inch of rock or grass with teeming, screeching birds and their young. Or at least they used to – for this year Sumburgh Head is a quiet and largely deserted place. Where seabirds once swooped and cried in their thousands, only a handful of birds wheel round the cliffs. The silence is uncanny – the result of a crash in seabird numbers that has been in progress for several years but which has now reached an unprecedented, catastrophic low. One of the nation’s most important conservation centres has been denuded of its wildlife, a victim – according to scientists – of climate change, which has disrupted food chains in the North Sea and North Atlantic and left many seabirds without a source of sustenance. The result has been an apocalyptic drop in numbers of Arctic terns, kittiwakes and many other birds. “In the past, Sumburgh Head was brimming with birds, and the air was thick with the smell of guano. The place was covered with colonies of puffins, kittiwakes, fulmars, and guillemots,” said Helen Moncrieff, manager of RSPB Scotland’s office in Shetland. “There were thousands and thousands of birds and visitors were guaranteed a sight of puffins. Today they have to be very patient. At the same time, guillemots have halved in numbers. It is utterly tragic.” This grim description is backed by figures that reveal the staggering decreases in seabird numbers in Shetland, the most northerly part of the British Isles. In 2000, there were more than 33,000 puffins on the island in early spring. That figure dropped to 570 last year and there are no signs of any recovery this year, although it is still early in the season. Similarly, Shetland’s kittiwake population plummeted from over 55,000 in 1981 to 5,000 in 2011, and observers believe those numbers have declined even further in the past few years. Only the lack of a properly funded census has prevented ornithologists from putting precise numbers on the devastation that is occurring. “I went to check our sites at Dalsetter and Troswick last week to compare numbers of Arctic terns with those we counted during Seabird 2000, the last national seabird census carried out across Britain and Ireland,” added Moncrieff. “I found there were around 110 Arctic terns there last week compared with around 9,000 that were counted in the same area in 2000. That is the kind of loss we have sustained here.” This point is backed by Euan Dunn, principal policy officer for the RSPB. “These are apocalyptic numbers,” he told the Observer. “We are seeing something very dramatic happening, something that has never occurred in the history of ornithology up there.” The causes of these devastating declines are many, according to scientists – though most agree that the disappearance of food sources is the main reason. Seabirds rely heavily on sand eels for food, and this supply was severely depleted in northern waters by fishing – though this was eventually halted, allowing stocks to recover. However, these have now been disrupted again by global warming, triggered by rising carbon dioxide emissions from factories, cars and power plants that burn fossil fuels. Temperatures in the North Sea and North Atlantic have risen significantly as a result. “This warming seems to be affecting the availability of plankton at the time when sand eels produce their larvae,” said Dunn. “There is less plankton and the larvae grow less well and survive less well.” Not every coastal area of the UK is affected to the same degree, as has been highlighted in a recent project carried out by the RSPB. Groups of puffins, one of the seabirds worst affected by the current crisis, were tagged at two different locations: Shetland and the Shiant Islands, in the Inner Hebrides, where numbers have remained relatively stable in recent years. In the latter, the birds were found to travel on very short journeys of a few kilometres before they returned to their young with plenty of plump fish. However in Shetland, the picture was found to be starkly different. One of its puffins was found to have to fly more than 400km (248 miles) to find food. “That is more than 10 times further than we thought they were flying,” added Dunn. “Journeys like that are hugely energy consuming and leave the birds very weakened. Not only that, they bring back fish that are much less nutritious than the ones they caught in the good old days when Shetland had plenty of puffins.” A similar story is provided by trackers fitted to guillemots and razorbills from nearby Fair Isle, which has also suffered serious seabird population losses. They too are having to travel hundreds of kilometres to find food. “It explains clearly why our colonies have foundered,” said Dunn. In addition to the sand eel crisis that affects coastal areas of Scotland, there is the problem of plastic which builds up on beaches and is ingested by seabirds, with fulmars being particularly badly affected. “We believe there is plastic in the stomachs of every Shetland fulmar,” said Moncrieff. “If you scaled up what you find in a fulmar’s stomach, it is the equivalent of having a lunch box full of plastic inside your own stomach. There would be no room left for proper food.” The catastrophe that has struck Shetland’s seabird population has been revealed just as similar crises are being reported from other islands round Britain. Puffin numbers have dropped dramatically on the Farne Islands, it was reported last month, while on St Kilda, one of the most significant seabird colonies in the North Atlantic, there has been a 99% reduction in kittiwake nests since 1990. Two years ago, in all the island’s monitored sites, only one pair bred –and that single chick died. Yet as these crises have unfolded, the government has declined to fund a new national census, along the lines of those organised in 1970, 1985 and 2000, even though it is supposed to instigate one every 15 years. “Fortunately, it has now agreed to proceed with one, which we hope should be completed by the end of next year,” said Dunn. “Then we should have a better overall picture of what is happening and why these striking declines are happening in particular places.” For Shetland, the catastrophic decline in many of its key seabird populations is an issue of real concern. The islands are famed for their bleak beauty and have become an important eco-tourism destination. The loss of many of its seabird colonies does not help that cause – though it still has many special attractions: its prehistoric houses and iron age towers, called brochs; a large population of otters (more than 10% of Britain’s otters live here); and increasing numbers of visits by killer whales. As Moncrieff said: “There are still good reasons to come here, but equally the crisis that has hit so many of our seabirds is not something that we can continue to ignore.” • Turtle doves used to arrive in large numbers in April to breed in the British Isles but have now disappeared from large areas of the countryside for a variety of reasons: lack of seed from arable plants; the parasite that carries trichomonosis; and hunting during their migration through southern Europe. As a result, the turtle dove has become the UK’s fastest declining bird and is now considered at risk of global extinction. • Wader populations are declining worldwide thanks to the loss and degradation of habitats, increased predation, and a changing climate. In the UK, this has produced dramatic declines in curlew populations over recent decades – the species has been proposed as the UK’s most important bird conservation priority. • Nightingales and pied flycatchers have declined in large numbers since monitoring of these woodland species began in 1994, leading to their appearance on the red list of endangered bird species in the UK.

And yet Ye – the eighth studio album by Kanye West – finds the controversial rapper in candid, unrepentant form, making the news once again. Over a brief seven tracks, the 40-year-old superstar confirms his production prowess, veering between sparse, hyper-modern styles and compositions which hark back to the soulful bent of the producer-turned-rapper’s early career; a volatile mix of the sweet and the acrid, the sentimental and the tendentious. Lyrically, he is less easy to defend. “I don’t take advice from people less successful than me,” sneers West, the lofty self-made millionaire, on Make No Mistake – a song whose buttery first verse and chorus (sung by Charlie Wilson and Kid Cudi) curdles into a series of self-righteous outbursts. Much of Ye – Kanye’s nickname – feels raw, personal and up-to-the-minute, the album cover-shot having been taken on an iPhone as a private listening party and album streaming session was being set up last Thursday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Yikes – one of the best tracks, musically – bounces and swings, as West raps through an entire pharmacy of drug references, harking back to the episode last year which found him hospitalised for exhaustion: “on meds, off meds.” If there is a valuable seam of wisdom on this record, it is the fear of legal opioids, the prescription medication implicated in the deaths of Prince, Michael Jackson and countless others. On Wouldn’t Leave, another track with a superficially twinkly mien, West raps about the furore unleashed just a few weeks ago when he implied that 400 years of African-American slavery was “a choice” rather than enforced bondage. “I said slavery a choice/They said ‘How ’Ye’/Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day.” The track also provides a telling snapshot of the aftermath. “My wife callin’, screamin’/Sayin’ we ’bout lose it all.” There is plenty of love for TV personality Kim Kardashian here, as well as worry for the couple’s elder daughter. The closing track, Violent Crimes, finds West despairing at male-kind (“N****s is savage”) and hoping that four-year-old North grows up to be strong like Nicki Minaj. The closing voicemail message confirms that Minajco-wrote some of the lyrics. The pseudo-feminism West directs towards his closest female relatives is not enough, however, to claw back sympathy for an increasingly divisive artist whose support for Bill Cosby (recently found guilty of aggravated indecent assault) has added to the dismay swirling around the star. West expends plenty of couplets on Ye extolling his preferences for “girls that’s basic”, alluding to indiscretions and boasting of how often he has paid for women to have implant surgery. Obnoxiousness comes easily to West, whose apparent support for Donald Trump has recently bewildered a significant part of his fanbase. The ability to shock as well as awe has, however, long been part of the rapper’s appeal. That Ye also finds Kanye West homicidal, suicidal (all on one track, I Thought About Killing You), fatherly and able to produce music of a high calibre confirms this divisive figure is, at least, consistent in his wilfulness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/03/arkady-world-of-faked-murders-truth-is-still-out-there","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:00:37Z","webTitle":"Although we now live in a world of faked murders, the truth is still out there | Peter Pomerantsev","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/arkady-world-of-faked-murders-truth-is-still-out-there","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/arkady-world-of-faked-murders-truth-is-still-out-there","fields":{"headline":"Although we now live in a world of faked murders, the truth is still out there","bodyText":"You can trust death. All the “alternative facts” and “fake news”, all the dismissals of “objectivity” as “another form of subjectivity”, the claims that truth is relative… these all stop at the hard, objective, undisputable, undeniable fact of death. So it seemed until last Wednesday, when a journalist officially pronounced murdered on Tuesday was in fact alive and well and that his murder had been staged. Not just any journalist, but Arkady Babchenko, one of Russia’s most fearless war correspondents and Putin critics, who made his name at a newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, where journalists are murdered with sickening regularity. News of his death was followed by mass outpourings of grief. Boris Johnson even gave a speech. And then the next day he was paraded alive on television. Babchenko, who has fled Russia for Ukraine, claimed his fake death was necessary: the Ukrainian secret service, the SBU, had got wind of a Russian operation to kill him and the only way to catch the organisers was to imitate the murder. No one doubts the danger he is in. It’s too early to ascertain if the SBU acted effectively. But after outpourings of joy that he was still alive, many wondered, would there be a cost? Had it raised or demeaned the credibility of Ukrainian officials? Would it mean that information about other murdered journalists would be treated as “fake news”? Does it further undermine the sense of objective reality, which the Kremlin works so assiduously to do in undermining Ukraine? It’s not as if reality has been having a good time of it. Last week was typical. The Evening Standard, it was claimed, has offered favourable coverage to companies in return for money: the pieces would be so subtle, it was alleged, they would blur the line between advertising and reporting. The newspaper has denied the claims. Meanwhile, an English aristocrat television pundit (who commented on the royal wedding for US TV) turned out to be a New Yorker in a tweed jacket and fake accent. Pillar by pillar, the architecture of shared reality has been knocked down. It used to be believed that having lots of TV channels would lead to better debate and more mutual understanding. Instead, in the US especially, it has led to a reality so fractured that Fox and CNN viewers now live in worlds so polarised it’s doubtful they are still living in the same reality. The internet, which was meant to deliver us from the hegemony of television, has turned out to be even easier to manipulate: full of fake accounts who purport to be one person but turn out to be another, run by the Kremlin or Bell Pottinger, attention captured by “trending topics” created by bots “manufacturing consensus”. If one goes to the farther reaches of the internet, to 4Chan messaging boards or Discord channels, you will find digital activists involved in sharing GCHQ and KGB manuals on information manipulation, instructions on how to “shape reality”. Anyone, not just the SBU, can play at being a little media Machiavelli now. And in a sense we have all become mini spin doctors of ourselves. Every time we go on Facebook and show off our photos, share or dislike, we become digital influencers. Although, as it’s become clear, the sense of self-empowerment Facebook gives us is just a way to get us to reveal more about ourselves and thus be made more pliable by larger forces to whom Facebook sells our data. But surely there are some things we can put our faith in? The most trusted people in societies save lives: medical and emergency professionals, soldiers. Since the Babchenko case broke, some in Ukraine have brought out this aspect. Maxim Eristavi, a critic of both Putin and Ukrainian authorities, a journalist and one of Ukraine’s leading LGBT campaigners, was positive about the operation: this was the first time the security services had shown themselves to be on the side of journalists. The Ukrainian writer Andrey Kurkov said it felt like the security services were on the side of their own people for the first time. Eristavi and Kurkov were looking at trust as something generated by the sense of people looking out for you. Kurkov is perhaps best known as the author of Death and the Penguin, a satire about post-Soviet Ukraine in which an obituarist finds that the columns he prepares for the possible death of their subjects are a murder hitlist for a mafia. I mention this because when it comes to dealing with a world where reality has broken down, Ukrainians have experience in what really matters. But even faith in those who risk their lives for others has taken a mauling. The White Helmets, the first responders in Syria who pull people from the rubble after the barrel bombs, have become the target of online disinformation, which has found a receptive audience. Much of it is pathetically easy to catch out: pictures of a girl being rescued by three different people is taken as evidence that she’s an actress. She’s not, children get passed from one rescuer to the next in any operation. But if you live in a world where you’re so aware that everything can be manipulated it’s easier to doubt than risk being taken for a ride. Triumphant, gloating cynicism is a safe space to retreat to. So are we doomed to endless manipulations and snide asides? If you have attended one of those awful corporate trust-building exercises, you know how they create bonds by forcing people to collaborate on achieving something. Within minutes of the news of Babchenko’s death, usually rival teams of investigative journalists had started an investigation, knowing the authorities are never to be trusted. Within hours, the streets were crawling with people gathering video from shop security cameras, cross-checking police data, talking to witnesses, with each piece of the puzzle co-ordinated live. Money was raised to support his family. Other investigative journalists flew in from Moscow. Perhaps such collaborative archipelagoes fostering truth are one thing to hold on to. A more extreme gesture is self-sacrifice: if you’re ready to put your life on the line, it means you mean it. In northern Russia, the Ukrainian film director Oleg Sentsov, who opposed the Russian takeover of Crimea and is facing 20 years in jail on fact-free charges of “terrorism”, has gone on hunger strike to draw attention to the 64 Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia. We can all build trust by helping to rescue those lives. • Peter Pomerantsev is the author of Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible and senior fellow at the Arena programme at the London School of Economics"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/02/pressure-grows-for-theresa-may-to-tackle-islamophobia-in-conservative-party","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T13:30:06Z","webTitle":"Pressure grows on May to tackle Islamophobia in Conservative party","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/02/pressure-grows-for-theresa-may-to-tackle-islamophobia-in-conservative-party","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/02/pressure-grows-for-theresa-may-to-tackle-islamophobia-in-conservative-party","fields":{"headline":"Pressure grows on May to tackle Islamophobia in Conservative party","bodyText":"Theresa May is under growing pressure to investigate Islamophobia in the Conservative party after a top Tory peer echoed calls made this week by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) and Sayeeda Warsi. Mohamed Sheikh said an independent inquiry was required to “show we will not tolerate any form of discrimination within our own party”. His call comes after the MCB accused the Tories of failing to take the issue seriously. Lady Warsi, the party’s former chair, has said the failure was “embarrassing” for the party and that her calls over the past two years had gone unheeded. In an open letter to the prime minister, Lord Sheikh said Muslim voters “cannot bring themselves to vote Conservative because they simply do not believe the Conservative party can and will support Muslims”. His letter highlighted a number of incidents, including the “smear campaign” conducted by Zac Goldsmith against Sadiq Khan before the 2016 London mayoral election. Goldsmith’s decision to label his Labour rival as a “‘terrorist sympathiser’ was an absolute disgrace, even for the most ardent Conservative supporter – Muslim or not. Such conduct not only embarrassed the party but alienated many Conservative members from the campaign, and voters,” Sheikh wrote. Attempts to raise the issue with Goldsmith, Conservative party chiefs and then prime minister David Cameron were “ignored”, he said. The party donor was a top adviser to Cameron and ran the Conservative Muslim Forum. The MCB said this week that Goldsmith’s campaign was evidence of a wider problem of “dog whistle anti-Muslim racism” in the party. Harun Khan, the head of the MCB, called for a “genuinely independent inquiry” into Islamophobia in the Tory party. He questioned why no action had been taken against Bob Blackman, the Harrow East MP, after he hosted a hardline Hindu nationalist, Tapan Ghosh, in parliament in October 2017. In his letter, Sheikh said he had raised the issue with May. “Regrettably, the response fell short of the swift and determined action required,” he told the prime minister. The peer, who entered the Lords in 2006, also said it was a “great disappointment” that Muslims he had recommended as potential Tory candidates in the last general election were not chosen. The Tories have been contacted for a response to Sheikh’s letter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/02/egypt-abdel-fatah-al-sisi-sworn-in-second-term-amid-crackdown-on-dissent","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T11:20:43Z","webTitle":"Egypt's Sisi is sworn in for a second term, amid crackdown on dissent","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/egypt-abdel-fatah-al-sisi-sworn-in-second-term-amid-crackdown-on-dissent","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/02/egypt-abdel-fatah-al-sisi-sworn-in-second-term-amid-crackdown-on-dissent","fields":{"headline":"Egypt's Sisi is sworn in for a second term, amid crackdown on dissent","bodyText":"The Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, has been sworn in for a second term, following a fresh round of arrests targeting opponents and critics. “Egypt can fit us all with all our differences. Accepting others and creating common ground will be important for us in order to create political development,” he told MPs who had gathered to witness his oath of office, following a ceremony heavy on military pomp. Some interrupted his speech to shout their admiration of the president, including one MP who recited a poem of praise. Sisi won more than 97% of votes in the March election, which international and Egyptian rights organisations denounced as “farcical” after five opposition candidates were barred from running. His only opponent was Moussa Moustafa Moussa, an avowed supporter of the president. Sisi’s inauguration follows a renewed crackdown on even the most benign opposition to his rule. In recent weeks, at least six prominent dissidents have been arrested and detained in pre-dawn raids. Twenty-two people protesting against a fare hike on the Cairo metro were arrested and investigated on terrorism charges, including joining a banned group. As Sisi took the oath of office, the arrests of recent weeks indicated that his second term may allow even less space for dissent than his first. Since coming to power in 2013, Sisi’s rule has been marked by efforts to crush all forms of dissent, with his government targeting Islamists, critics, activists, human rights organisations and journalists. But with almost no public opposition remaining, he is working to shore up support within an already compliant system. More than 200 MPs in Egypt’s rubber-stamp parliament have switched allegiances to a new political party, Future of the Homeland, founded to support Sisi and drawing comparisons with the corrupt National Democratic Party of deposed autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Its creation is a possible precursor to an anticipated referendum that would alter the constitution to extend presidential terms, removing limits and allowing Sisi to become “president for life”. The opulent inauguration followed a wave of arrests of dissidents including the blogger Wael Abbas, labour lawyer and socialist activist Haytham Mohamadeen, satirist Shady Abu Zeid, activist Shady al-Ghazaly Harb and outspoken former Sisi supporter Hazem Abd al-Azim. It also includes activist Amal Fathy, who made a video discussing sexual harassment in Egypt. “Sisi is expecting a turbulent second mandate so he needs the opposition forces to be under control while unchecked voices are silenced,” said Fathy’s husband, Mohamed Lotfy, the head of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms. The French journalist Nina Hubinet earlier this week said she had been barred from entering Egypt after arriving in Cairo for a holiday five years after she last reported from there. In February, Egypt arrested and deported British journalist Bel Trew, a correspondent for the Times. Electricity and fuel prices are expected to rise by 55% and 60% respectively in the upcoming budget in July, generating further discontent among Egypt’s poorest, already struggling to cope with the price hikes of Sisi’s first term. But analysts say the government’s increasingly draconian tactics prevent many from expressing their discontent. “The inequality of growth is stark and the situation of most Egyptians is still quite dire,” said Michael Hanna, an analyst with the New York thinktank The Century Foundation. “We can say very clearly that there’s not going to be a course correction. There’s no sense in which [Sisi’s] second term engenders a political easing. The ratchet is going only in one direction,” he said.

Her most recent album, A Seat at the Table, chronicled the pain and beauty that comes with inhabiting the world as a black woman. The film clips that accompanied it imagined a world that centred the beauty of black women within an entirely black gaze. How do you bring this energy and vision to a space like the Sydney Opera House? We were lucky to be able to experience her in the first place. The artist has been dealing with chronic health problems and had pulled out of shows late last year and early this year to, rightly so, prioritise her wellbeing. She had also been reconsidering the way she performs. In her acceptance speech of the prestigious Harvard Arts prize, she said: “I cannot stand on a stage and just deliver the work for purely the sake of being entertained. I want to continue to create work that exchanges and engages and activates and continues to challenge myself and spaces on what it means to identify as an artist in this body during this time. I want to sculpt, I want to build, I want to tear down walls and build news ones, I want to dismantle, I want to disrupt, I want to bore, I want to quiet you down, I want to create frequency.” If this is the benchmark Solange sets for herself, she did what she said she wanted to do. Before she was even in the country, before she had even stepped on the stage, she was leaving her mark on black and brown communities. Call-outs for performers of colour were circulating a month or so before she arrived. Black and brown people who managed to get tickets were planning their pilgrimage. People drove up to 15 hours this week to see her. And she gave back to us. Solange’s performance was proudly black and it was a privilege to experience her proud blackness. It was a full sonic and visual delight. She seemed to effortlessly hit every single note, moved with grace and vigour, and didn’t break a sweat. She was backed by an ensemble of horns, back-up singers, drummers and keyboards, who were all people of colour. The stage was transformed with two pyramids on each side and a giant sphere hanging from the ceiling. It was black excellence. During her speech at Harvard, she spoke about artists performing or speaking their truths and talked about Nina Simone: “When I think of Nina Simone, I think about how safe many people feel with her voice pouring into their homes today, many of which wouldn’t have dared to embrace even some of her truths.” I did wonder whether the white audience members of her show could embrace her truths. When black international artists come to Australia, my elation is tinged with slight trepidation. In this case, I was worried the ballot that was required to buy a ticket might have meant there would not be as many people of colour in the audience. Could this audience understand her art in the way she wanted it to be understood? Australian audiences and cultural commentators are often embarrassing and don’t know how to respond or talk about proud exchanges of blackness. I recall seeing Kendrick Lamar in 2016 at the Byron Bay Blues festival with a predominantly white audience who felt entitled to yell the N-word while he was rapping. Jon Faine repeatedly said the N-word on his ABC talkback show when referring to the James Baldwin documentary I am not your Negro last year. Michael Cathcart did the same while interviewing Man Booker prize-winning author Paul Beatty and Mia Freedman dehumanised Roxanne Gay when she was over last year. This is not surprising when we consider how Adam Goodes celebrating his Aboriginality was received by many AFL commentators and spectators. I needn’t have felt this trepidation. Solange herself remarked that the last time she was in the country was when she was a backup dancer for Destiny’s Child in the early 2000s. She said things had changed here. This was, of course, code for telling us the audience wasn’t so white. She was right. I was surrounded by beautiful black and brown people. While her show is incredible regardless, it is black and brown people who truly get to experience her black girl magic. She pointed us out. She came down and danced with us. She told us we had a right to be mad. She told us some stuff is for us. And we knew she was right. The tickets were seated but she told us all to stand and dance. She told us how beautiful the black and brown people in the crowd were. Last night was a celebration of blackness and it was healing and affirming. • Solange is performing at the Sydney Opera House as part of Vivid festival until 4 June"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"news/2018/jun/03/corrections-and-clarifications","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T20:00:55Z","webTitle":"Corrections and clarifications","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/03/corrections-and-clarifications","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/jun/03/corrections-and-clarifications","fields":{"headline":"Corrections and clarifications","bodyText":"• We referred to staff being treated for “electrocution” at an Amazon warehouse, when we meant for “electric shocks”.

The GMB union announced on Monday that it is taking legal action on behalf of members working for three delivery firms used by Amazon, arguing that the companies wrongly classed them as self-employed. A statement from the union, which represents professional drivers, said: “The drivers were required to attend scheduled shifts that were controlled by Amazon, meaning they did not have the flexibility that is integral to being self-employed. In this situation, the couriers were treated like employees in terms of their working hours and the GMB union contends they should be treated as employees in terms of their rights too.” The case is the latest in a string of gig economy legal disputes challenging what unions say is bogus self-employment among couriers and other drivers. The GMB won a landmark judgment against Uber in 2016 and others, including Deliveroo, Addison Lee and CityLink, are all involved in ongoing legal action. The case is being handled by solicitors Leigh Day. Partner Nigel Mackay, a specialist in employment and discrimination law, said seven drivers – including two who had been dismissed – were involved in the claim at this stage and he expected that number would grow. One of the drivers described his experience of leaving the house at 6am, not returning until 11pm at night and as a “thank you” for his hard work, had £1 per undelivered parcel deducted from his wages. On more than one occasion he was told by the company that he would not be paid if he did not complete a route and had sometimes driven when “half asleep at the wheel” in order to ensure he got paid. Two of the members are also claiming that they were dismissed because of whistleblowing, claiming their roles were terminated because they raised concerns about working practice. These included that the number of parcels allocated to drivers resulted in excessive hours and/or driving unsafely to meet targets, and that drivers were expected to wait a significant time to load their vans, extending their working hours. GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, said: “The day to day reality for many of our members who deliver packages for Amazon is unrealistic targets, slogging their guts out only to have deductions made from their pay when those targets aren’t met and being told they’re self-employed without the freedom that affords.” “Companies like Amazon and their delivery companies can’t have it both ways – they can’t decide they want all of the benefits of having an employee, but refuse to give those employees the pay and rights they’re entitled to.” “Guaranteed hours, holiday pay, sick pay, pension contributions are not privileges companies can dish out when they fancy. They are the legal right of all UK workers, and that’s what we’re asking the courts to rule on.” An Amazon spokesman said delivery providers are contractually obligated to ensure drivers they engage receive the National Living Wage and are expected to pay a minimum of £12 per hour, follow all applicable laws and driving regulations and drive safely. “Allegations to the contrary do not represent the great work done by around 100 small businesses generating thousands of work opportunities for delivery drivers across the UK,” he said. He added: “Amazon is proud to offer a wide variety of work opportunities across Britain – full-time or part-time employment, or be your own boss. Last year we created 5,000 new permanent jobs on top of thousands of opportunities for people to work independently with the choice and flexibility of being their own boss – either through Amazon Logistics, Amazon Flex, or Amazon Marketplace.” In April, the delivery company Hermes, which delivers packages for retailers such as Next, Asos, John Lewis, Topshop and River Island, began a legal battle with eight of its own drivers. It is under pressure to settle after rival delivery firm DPD offered all its drivers sick pay and holiday pay as part of wholesale reforms to its gig working model sparked by the death of a driver it charged for attending a medical appointment to treat his diabetes and who later collapsed and died. In 2016 the ride-hailing firm Uber was told its drivers should be classed as workers with minimum-wage rights. Uber, which says its drivers are self-employed, lost its appeal against the decision last year but said it would appeal again. The case could end up in the supreme court this year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/jun/01/animal-cruelty-and-film-classification","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T15:59:10Z","webTitle":"Animal cruelty and film classification | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/01/animal-cruelty-and-film-classification","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/jun/01/animal-cruelty-and-film-classification","fields":{"headline":"Animal cruelty and film classification","bodyText":"Anne Billson (A lot of animals were harmed in the making of these films, G2, 25 May) asserts that the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) “still cuts non-faked animal abuse, although it is more lenient on arthouse than horror”.

I am afraid this statement is incorrect and no preferential treatment is given to “arthouse” films. Sátántangó was only classified uncut after we received detailed assurances from the film-makers regarding how the scenes with the cat were prepared and filmed in such a way as to avoid cruelty to the animal involved. Those assurances were consistent with the onscreen evidence. Oldboy was classified uncut because the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937, which is mentioned in the article, only applies to “protected animals” as defined by the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Currently invertebrates, such as octopuses, are not covered by the 2006 act and we therefore had no grounds on which to intervene. By contrast, The Mountain of the Cannibal God and Cannibal Ferox both feature scenes of animal cruelty that are clearly real, that involve vertebrate animals and that certainly appear to have been deliberately orchestrated by the film-makers.

So it is tempting to say that one fragile Spanish government has simply been replaced by another after Spanish MPs voted on Friday to dismiss Mariano Rajoy’s centre-right PP in a vote of no confidence. After all, the PP remains the largest single party, with 134 members of the 350-strong Congress of Deputies, while the new prime minister, Pedro Sánchez of the socialists, has only 84, and will be propped up by seven other left and regional parties in key votes. The temptation to dismiss the change should be resisted. The first reason is that Mr Rajoy, a great survivor who had led Spain since 2011 through a recession and the eurozone debt crisis, deserved to go. Last week a court jailed one of his party’s former treasurers for 33 years for fraud and money laundering and fined the PP itself for benefiting institutionally from kickbacks for public contracts in the so called “Gürtel” affair. Mr Rajoy had testified in the case, in which 29 defendants were jailed. After a corruption scandal on such a scale, it was entirely necessary that the party and its leader should be given their marching orders and a new government formed. The second reason is that Mr Sánchez has come into office with political momentum on his side. After the 2016 election, in which the socialists lost seats, Mr Sánchez refused to support a new Rajoy minority government, which he accused of corruption. A long socialist party stalemate took place, as a result of which he was forced out of the leadership by moderates, who then abstained to permit Mr Rajoy to take office. A year ago, Mr Sánchez regained the party leadership. Now, in the aftermath of the corruption verdicts, he can claim to have been right all along. A third reason why Mr Sánchez may hold on longer than the parliamentary numbers may imply is that his chief rival from the left, Podemos, has been faltering recently. The insurgent party’s leader, Pablo Iglesias, has recently survived a confidence vote after being criticised for buying an expensive house outside Madrid, while Podemos has slipped in the polls. But the big question in Spanish politics is whether the new socialist government and its allies can do what Mr Rajoy conspicuously failed to do and find a solution to the Catalan separatism crisis. Mr Sánchez supported his predecessor’s tough approach last year when Mr Rajoy sacked the Catalan president Carles Puigdemont for holding an illegal independence referendum. But he told MPs in the no-confidence debate this week that he wanted dialogue with Mr Puigdemont’s hardline successor, Quim Torra, providing it did not involve a breach with Spain. This is a tantalising prospect, and Mr Sánchez would gain further esteem at home and abroad if he could strike a principled bargain with Barcelona. It is desirable that he has the chance. But he knows that any failure could mean an early general election in which, if current polls are to be believed, the initiative could pass to the centrist Cuidadanos party."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/01/iowa-abortion-fetal-heartbeat-law-blocked","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T16:12:33Z","webTitle":"Abortion: judge temporarily blocks controversial heartbeat law in Iowa","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/01/iowa-abortion-fetal-heartbeat-law-blocked","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/01/iowa-abortion-fetal-heartbeat-law-blocked","fields":{"headline":"Abortion: judge temporarily blocks controversial heartbeat law in Iowa","bodyText":"A judge will temporarily block the most restrictive abortion law in the country from taking effect in Iowa next month under an agreement between lawyers for the state and abortion rights groups. Attorneys for the state and Republican governor Kim Reynolds agreed Friday to prevent the law from taking effect on 1 July after discussions with the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Emma Goldman clinic, a women’s reproductive health facility in Iowa City. The advocacy groups have sued the state to block the law, which was passed by the legislature in early May and instantly became the most restrictive abortion regulation in the country. Controversially, the new law bans most abortions if a fetal heartbeat can be detected – as early as six weeks, before many women even know they are pregnant. The new law is as part of the conservative crusade across the country, but especially in the heartland and the south, to fight against abortion rights incrementally, with the aim of eventually getting a case up to the supreme court in the hope that it would overturn the landmark Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortion in the US in 1973. Reproductive rights advocates hope that the state’s extreme stance will drive female voters to the polls in support of pro-choice candidates. But they also fear that Trump’s conversion to an anti-choice platform, combined with the potential for him to stack the courts with ultra-conservative judges, bodes ill access to abortion, both surgical and the pill method, and to birth control. An attorney for the state of Iowa said on Friday the administration hoped quickly to get the case before a judge in order to argue that the new law is constitutional. Judge Michael Huppert said during a court hearing on Friday morning that he’ll issue a temporary injunction later in the day. Reynolds signed the law on 2 May, two days after lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislature approved it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/jun/01/roadmap-to-avoid-brexit-to-be-sent-to-mps-and-peers","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T16:04:11Z","webTitle":"Roadmap to avoid Brexit to be sent to MPs and peers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/01/roadmap-to-avoid-brexit-to-be-sent-to-mps-and-peers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/jun/01/roadmap-to-avoid-brexit-to-be-sent-to-mps-and-peers","fields":{"headline":"Roadmap to avoid Brexit to be sent to MPs and peers","bodyText":"MPs and peers will be sent a roadmap next week detailing how they could stop Brexit by the George Soros-backed Best for Britain group, which has amassed £2.3m in donations to spend on a nationwide lobbying effort to persuade parliament to change its mind. The group will publish a timetable as part of its “campaign manifesto” at a launch event on 8 June saying that MPs need to introduce amendments calling for a second referendum on the final deal secured by Theresa May in which remaining in the European Union is an option on the ballot paper. Best for Britain says it is theoretically possible for a referendum to be held within 17 working days of parliament legislating for one, meaning it could be held in December. But the pressure group says the EU would allow the UK to have a second referendum as late as February or March. Eloise Todd, the chief executive of Best for Britain, said a second referendum was necessary to ultimately settle the question of whether the UK should leave the EU: “We think people should have a chance to compare the deal we can get to the one we already have. What’s clear is we can’t have ‘a best of all worlds’ illusory Brexit as the debate about the Irish border shows.” To have any chance of success, Best for Britain would have to win over Labour’s front bench, plus more than 10 Tory rebels and shore up the support of sceptical backbench Labour MPs in constituencies that voted for leave in the 2016 referendum. The pressure group is stepping up its efforts to lobby 50 MPs by trying to generate pressure on them in their constituencies. It intends to take out advertisements in regional and local papers, starting on Saturday in the Scotsman, and buy up billboards in the target constituencies “as near to MPs’ offices as possible”. Campaign adverts, which have already appeared in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool as well as in some national newspapers, are headlined “When will we know what we voted for?” and add: “We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal”. Best for Britain said it would spend £500,000 of its £2.3m in donations on the newspaper and outdoor advertising campaign. The largest donor has been Soros’s Open Society Foundation, which has provided £800,000. He will not be attending next week’s launch event, but the 87-year-old financier and philanthropist gave a speech in Paris on Tuesday in which he trailed the launch, saying that Brexit was “an immensely damaging process”. He added: “Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better, however, if they came to a decision sooner rather than later.” Labour MPs in targeted leave-supporting areas include Caroline Flint, the Don Valley MP. She supported remain in 2016 but wrote last month that the UK should respect the referendum result and that parliament should stop “game playing” and reject proposals for a second national vote. Others in the campaign group’s focus include Ian Austin in Dudley North and the newly elected Gareth Snell in Stoke-on-Trent Central. Conservative MPs being targeted include John Stevenson, who holds the seat of Carlisle with a majority of 2,599 from Labour. Best for Britain says that future investment by multinational tyre maker Pirelli at a plant in the city remains at risk, unless the UK can at least remain part of a customs union with the EU. The pressure group believes the majority of the British public are turned off by the Brexit debate and will only seriously re-engage once the prime minister has concluded her divorce negotiations with the EU. It is trying to train local organisers to organise street stalls or petitions with a target of having 20,000 conversations with members of the public in the 50 target seats. The involvement of Soros in the campaign has been attacked by rightwing newspapers, with the Daily Mail describing the Hungarian-American as a “foreign billionaire” engaged in a “plot to subvert Brexit”. Best for Britain uses that coverage as part of its fundraising campaigns, encouraging people to donate and “help us take on the Daily Mail” on a gofundme page that has raised £56,000 in the past week. Todd said: “The will of the people can be subverted by the will of the people in a second referendum. People can take a new decision based on new information.” The campaign group is not covered by Electoral Commission regulations, which ban foreign donors, because there is no pending national vote. However, a spokesman said the group did not take money from overseas and that Soros’s donations come via the Open Society Foundation’s UK branch, which is a company registered in England and Wales, which would mean they were permissible under election law. The campaign group hopes that several dozen MPs will attend the launch event, although does not intend to use any of its existing supporters as principal speakers. Labour MPs such as David Lammy and Jo Stevens have acted as spokespeople before, as well as Green party MP Caroline Lucas and Conservative Dominic Grieve."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/03/the-bbcs-new-technology-shows-the-harsh-reality-of-the-world-cup","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T15:00:50Z","webTitle":"The BBC's new technology shows the harsh reality of the World Cup","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/the-bbcs-new-technology-shows-the-harsh-reality-of-the-world-cup","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/03/the-bbcs-new-technology-shows-the-harsh-reality-of-the-world-cup","fields":{"headline":"The BBC's new technology shows the harsh reality of the World Cup","bodyText":"This summer, the BBC will be screening the World Cup in virtual reality. The broadcasts sound like a must-see for fans of emerging technology, in contexts that don’t make sense. Have you wondered what it would be like to be right there on the pitch, in the middle of the action, as Suarez bears down on you with his incisors out, or Cristiano Ronaldo launches a gob in your direction? No, because being that close to a professional match would be a terrible way to watch one. You would be alternately remote from the action or overwhelmed by it, like being teleported into an orgy. Which is why that’s not what they’re offering. The snappily named BBC Sport VR – Fifa World Cup Russia 2018 will take you not on to the pitch, but rather inside a luxury private box at a Russian stadium. I’m not sure that is any better. Is there a viewing advantage to watching a match through a pretend window, using a headset that makes you look like a copper-bottomed divot? Besides, being put in an oligarch’s box sounds like gangland slang for being murdered. VR’s potential is huge, but we are running with it before we can walk. Or render a human face. Or a realistic dog. Every time I immerse myself in its parallel dimension, I come away underwhelmed by serviceable graphics, sluggish movement and sterile environments, always curiously empty, like waking up with a brain injury following a mass extinction event. VR makes everything resemble a computer game, except less eventful. And everyone else is far more excited about it than I am. Sounds quite a lot like the actual World Cup, come to think of it.

Can Pedro Sánchez tackle the corruption plaguing Spain?","bodyText":"The surprise in Spain is not that the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has gone, but that he lasted so long. His conservative People’s party (PP) had been knee-deep in corruption scandals for years. So many of the party’s principal players were involved that it became impossible to blame a few rotten apples. The barrel itself stank of putrefaction. Somehow, however, events conspired to keep Rajoy in power. It was only when his police began beating up citizens in the streets of Catalonia that the rest of the world woke up to what that might actually mean. The worst part of his legacy is a restriction of fundamental rights and his overempowerment of a police force that can now even fine people for taking photographs of suspected abuses. Rajoy’s conversion of the constitutional court into not just an arbiter of right and wrong but an actor in the implementation of policy has produced a dangerous conflation of politics and justice that leaves the latter wide open to abuse. By weaponising the courts, he turned political problems – including those in Catalonia – into legal ones. It was a renunciation of responsibility and leadership. Rajoy’s successes, however, point to why Spain’s new socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, will now find it so hard to govern. His predecessor’s ability to hold on to power had as much to with disarray on the left as it did with his own considerable, if low-key, tenacity. The dispute between social democracy and its leftwing contenders, represented by Podemos, has been as harsh as that between left and right. Can they now work together? All this is complicated further by the joyous abandon with which nationalists of all kinds have destroyed much of the common ground that unites the Spanish. Sánchez is the overnight sensation of an otherwise moribund political beast – European social democracy. He may also be its last hope. He has the poster-boy appeal of a Justin Trudeau or an Emmanuel Macron, and the same tendency to occupy a broad stretch of centre ground. Sánchez has a far steeper mountain to climb, however, than either of the other two heroes of what may eventually become a new centrist consensus. Many voters recall that it was Sánchez’s party, under the former prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, that first sacrificed the welfare of ordinary Spaniards on the altar of eurozone austerity. With Rajoy’s support, they changed the constitution, turning strict budget control into an absolute mandate and imposing a dramatic internal devaluation based on job and salary cuts. As a result, Spain is now the most unequal large country in Europe – above even the United Kingdom. The changes introduced to the constitution were proof that a document that Spanish politicians so often claim is untouchable can be altered in the blink of an eye – but only if Angela Merkel so desires. There is, however, also hope in Spain. For the art of politics is still alive and thriving. While Italy churns and Britain rips itself apart over Brexit, even the supposedly radical left of Podemos is brimful of ideas and practical political solutions to everyday problems. It is also the country where, despite a huge influx of migrants at the beginning of the century, immigration is a non-issue. Were it not for the craziness in Catalonia, indeed, Spain could boast that this is the place where politicians have tried hardest to avoid the cynical drift towards demagoguery. There has, however, always been a gaping hole in the proud story that Spaniards tell themselves about their post-dictatorship practice of democracy. That hole is called corruption. It ended the socialist hegemony of Felipe González in the 1990s, has destroyed the rightwing era of Rajoy and has irretrievably damaged the reputation of his PP predecessor, José María Aznar. Too often, politicians conflate public power with personal property. The court system is so sluggish that, when those who steal public funds are finally caught, it takes a decade or more to bring cases to trial. The final nail in Rajoy’s coffin, for example, was the preliminary sentence in a case that took nine years to prove that his party was systematically taking backhanders. Even Spain’s version of the global financial crisis, where the economy is only now returning to the size of a decade ago, was aggravated by politically controlled savings banks that pumped extra air into an overinflated property bubble. Many of the politicians involved also lined their pockets along the way. The fractious parliament that must now govern Spain should, in theory, be able to tackle systemic elements of corruption by insisting on greater transparency, speeding up the court system and increasing penalties. Even if his government only lasts for a few months, that could be Sánchez’s single great legacy to his country. Social democracy has one foot in the grave. If he cannot deliver a solution to Spain’s political corruption, Sánchez risks burying it forever. • Giles Tremlett is the author of Ghosts of Spain and Catherine of Aragon"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/media-blog/2018/jun/03/israel-must-halt-law-that-could-criminalise-media","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T13:00:47Z","webTitle":"Israel must halt law that could criminalise media | Roy Greenslade","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2018/jun/03/israel-must-halt-law-that-could-criminalise-media","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/media-blog/2018/jun/03/israel-must-halt-law-that-could-criminalise-media","fields":{"headline":"Israel must halt law that could criminalise media","bodyText":"On the day the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem, Israeli soldiers opened fire on unarmed Palestinian protesters who gathered at the border fence on the Gaza Strip. Sorry. That requires a rewrite to reflect “the truth” as promulgated by the Israeli government. On the day the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem, Israeli soldiers opened fire to prevent an invasion of their country by Arabs living in the Gaza Strip. This is a typical instance of the divergence in reporting that has become a hallmark of recording the conflict in Israel/Palestine. Indeed, the use of term Israel/Palestine is also a matter of dispute. No matter how hard journalists may try, they find it virtually impossible to make a neutral, factual statement when writing and broadcasting about the Middle East. Both sides perceive bias in every report. It’s as if facts – those statements of reality underpinned by evidence that can be verified and which are supposed to be a reporter’s stock-in-trade – do not exist. But there is one reporting medium that continues to have value: the camera, moving or still. It enables people elsewhere to get some perspective on events. Although contextual explanation, inevitably loaded with propaganda, quickly follows, it is impossible to erase the images from viewers’ minds. Now Israel’s parliament is being asked to consider a law that would prevent us from having even that momentary, partial view of what members of the Israel Defence Forces are doing. A bill has been proposed that seeks to prohibit “the photographing and documenting” of IDF troops “with the intention of undermining the spirit” of the army. It recommends a five-year prison term for offenders and 10 years for those judged to have harmed state security. According to its proposer, Robert Ilatov, chairman of a minority rightwing group supportive of the ruling Likud party, the “worrying phenomenon” of the monitoring of Israel’s soldiers by pro-Palestinian organisations through video, photographs and audio recordings is a “biased and tendentious” act with “a clear anti-Israeli agenda”. Reports suggest the idea has the support of Israel’s defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, the founder of Ilatov’s party. That prompted Israel’s liberal newspaper, Haaretz, to treat the matter seriously in an editorial that called the proposal “dangerous”. Its aim, said the paper, was “to silence criticism of the army and in particular to prevent human rights organisations from documenting the Israeli army’s actions in the [occupied] territories”. The International Federation of Journalists also condemned the proposal, arguing that it “constitutes a serious breach of the freedom of the press” because it “criminalises the work of journalists”. Haaretz agrees, believing such a law would harm press freedom: “The public has a right to know what the reality is and especially what the ‘people’s army’ is doing in its name and on its behalf.” I couldn’t put it better myself. Any restriction on the freedom to report inhibits the possibility of holding power to account. One trigger for the Ilatov initiative is obvious. In March 2016, a Palestinian attacker who was lying wounded and immobilised on the ground was shot dead at point-blank range by an IDF soldier, Elor Azaria. The shooting was caught on video and posted on social media by the Israeli human rights organisation, B’Tselem. As a result, Azaria was arrested, convicted of manslaughter and served nine months of an 18-month sentence before being released last month. Would he have been charged if there had been no film? We cannot be sure, but it is significant that it was the first time in 12 years that a member of the IDF had been convicted of manslaughter. The truth could not be fudged because of the film footage. Azaria was the criminal, not B’Tselem. The message for Israel’s politicians is straightforward. There is no democracy without press freedom and there is no press freedom without democracy. If they wish to uphold their claim to be living in a democratic state, they should vote overwhelmingly against Ilatov’s ill-considered proposal. Robinson learns the limits So, you may rightly ask in view of the above, does the exercise of press freedom have no limits at all? Can we film wherever we like, whenever we like? Should we be able to speak without any restriction? The straightforward answer is “no”. Even in a democratic society there can be good reasons to circumscribe freedom. It is a lesson the self-described “independent activist and journalist”, Tommy Robinson, discovered last week when sentenced to 13 months in prison for breaching the contempt of court law by live-streaming from outside a Leeds court. Robinson, erstwhile leader of the English Defence League, sought to present himself as a free speech hero. Hundreds of misguided people supported him in the foolish belief that “the establishment” is engaged in a conspiracy to suppress details of an ongoing trial. Reporting restrictions have been put in place in the interests of the trial being conducted fairly, and Robinson’s action had the potential to prejudice the process. If these silly antics had not been halted, a retrial might have been necessary. To confuse matters further, Robinson’s own case was then subject to a reporting restriction that had the unforeseen effect of feeding the conspiracy theorists. Their fantasies were given full rein online before the ban was lifted following an appeal by local journalists. In reality, what Robinson and his rightwing cronies were in danger of reviving was hue and cry, a practice outlawed in the early 19th century. It was anything but a responsible use of press freedom. Fake death is gift to Russia Lies cannot be fought with lies because the original liar is always the beneficiary. That’s the clear lesson of the Arkady Babchenko fiasco. It is impossible to see any value in the Ukrainian security service’s elaborate faking of his death. The hoax has been a gift to the Kremlin’s lying machine and it is a pity that Babchenko should have allowed himself to be used in such a stupid stunt. Despite trenchant criticism of his deceit, he appears anything but repentant, describing the British press as “fucking smart arses”, and adding “go fuck yourselves”. Why single out British reporters? Journalists across the world have poured scorn on Babchenko’s actions. Rather than hurl insults, he would do better (a) to explain exactly how pretending to be dead helped prevent his assassination; and (b) to apologise for providing Vladimir Putin with his greatest propaganda gift to date. Babchenko and his Ukrainian hosts have done a disservice to truth, and to journalism."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/jun/01/famed-impulse-control-marshmallow-test-fails-in-new-research","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T16:38:52Z","webTitle":"Famed impulse control 'marshmallow test' fails in new research","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jun/01/famed-impulse-control-marshmallow-test-fails-in-new-research","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/jun/01/famed-impulse-control-marshmallow-test-fails-in-new-research","fields":{"headline":"Famed impulse control 'marshmallow test' fails in new research","bodyText":"The “marshmallow test” has intrigued a generation of parents and educationalists with its promise that a young child’s willpower and self-control holds a key to their success in later life. But there is some good news for parents of pre-schoolers whose impulse control is nonexistent: the latest research suggests the claims of the marshmallow test are close to being a fluffy confection. The results, according to the researchers who carried out the new study, mean that parents, schools and nurseries could be wasting time if they try to coach their children to delay gratification. In the original research, by Stanford University psychologist Walter Mischel in the 1960s and 1970s, children aged between three and five years old were given a marshmallow that they could eat immediately, but told that if they resisted eating it for 10 minutes, they would be rewarded with two marshmallows. According to Mischel and colleagues in a follow-up study in 1990, the results were profound for children who had the willpower to wait for the extra marshmallow. More than a decade later, in their late teens, those children exhibited advanced traits of intelligence and behaviour far above those who caved in to temptation. Now, though, there is relief for the parents of the many children who would gobble down a marshmallow before the lab door was closed, after academics from New York University and the University of California-Irvine tried and largely failed to replicate the earlier research, in a paper published earlier this week. The new research by Tyler Watts, Greg Duncan and Hoanan Quen, published in Psychological Science, found that there were still benefits for the children who were able to hold out for a larger reward, but the effects were nowhere near as significant as those found by Mischel, and even those largely disappeared at age 15 once family and parental education were accounted for. “Our results show that once background characteristics of the child and their environment are taken into account, differences in the ability to delay gratification do not necessarily translate into meaningful differences later in life,” Watts said. “So, if you looked at our results, you probably would decide that you should not put too much stock in a child’s ability to delay at an early age.” In the decades since Mischel’s work the marshmallow test has permeated middle-class parenting advice and educational psychology, with a message that improving a child’s self-ability to delay gratification would have tangible benefits. The ones with willpower “yielded less to temptation; were less distractible when trying to concentrate; were more intelligent, self-reliant, and confident; and trusted their own judgment,” Mischel later wrote, offering a prize for middle-class parents in an era marked by parental anxiety and “Tiger Moms”. But Watts, a scholar at the Steinhardt school of culture, education and human development at NYU, says the test results are no longer so straightforward. “I think the test is still a very illuminating measure of children’s ability to delay gratification. There is no doubt that Mischel’s work has left an indelible mark on the way we think about young children and their cognitive and socioemotional development,” Watts said. “But our study suggests that the predictive ability of the test should probably not be overstated. In other words, if you are the parent of a four-year-old, and they reach for the marshmallow without waiting, you should not be too concerned.” The updated version of the marshmallow test – in which the children were able to choose their own treats, including chocolate – studied 900 children, with the sample adjusted to make it more reflective of US society, including 500 whose mothers had not gone on to higher education. Mischel’s original research used children of Stanford University staff, while the followup study included fewer than 50 children from which Mischel and colleagues formed their conclusions. Most surprising, according to Tyler, was that the revisited test failed to replicate the links with behaviour that Mischel’s work found, meaning that a child’s ability to resist a sweet treat aged four or five didn’t necessarily lead to a well-adjusted teenager a decade later. “We found virtually no correlation between performance on the marshmallow test and a host of adolescent behavioural outcomes. I thought that this was the most surprising finding of the paper,” Watts said. “It suggests that the ability to delay gratification, and possibly self-control, may not be a stable trait. It certainly opens up new avenues for inquiry.” Robert Coe, professor of education at Durham University, said the marshmallow test had permeated the public conscience because it was a simple experiment with a powerful result. “It will never die, despite being debunked, that’s the problem. Parenting books 10 or 20 years from now will still be quoting it, and not the evidence against it,” Coe said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/01/john-kinsella-gangland-murder-inquiry-makes-third-arrest","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T16:14:05Z","webTitle":"Man charged over John Kinsella gangland murder in Merseyside","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/01/john-kinsella-gangland-murder-inquiry-makes-third-arrest","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/01/john-kinsella-gangland-murder-inquiry-makes-third-arrest","fields":{"headline":"Man charged over John Kinsella gangland murder in Merseyside","bodyText":"Detectives investigating the gangland murder of John Kinsella, an underworld enforcer, have charged a man with his murder. Mark Fellows, 37, has been charged with the murders of Kinsella and another underworld figure John Massey following a joint operation in Manchester and Liverpool. Kinsella, 53, was shot dead while walking his dog on the St Helens Linkway near the M62 in Merseyside on 5 May. He was a close friend of the prominent Salford gangster Paul Massey, who was killed after being shot four times in the chest with a submachine gun in 2015. Fellows is due to appear before South Sefton magistrates court on Saturday charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. Police arrested five other people as part of the investigation this week who have all been released under investigation. Known as Salford’s “Mr Big” despite being scarcely 5ft tall, Massey’s fearsome reputation grew during the drug-fuelled Manchester rave scene of the 1990s. His family insist he had tried to turn his life around in the years before his death. On 26 July 2015, the 55-year-old was shot four times in the chest as he stepped out of his silver BMW outside his family home in Salford. Massey and Kinsella are thought to have been longstanding friends and Kinsella was a pallbearer at the former’s funeral. A trial at Liverpool crown court heard how in 2001 Kinsella intervened to stop a gangster from threatening the former England footballer Steven Gerrard. A Home Office postmortem examination found Kinsella had died as the result of multiple gunshot wounds. DCI Mark Baker, of Merseyside police’s investigations team, said: “Detectives from Merseyside have been carrying out extensive inquiries since the murder of John Kinsella just three weeks ago and have established a number of positive leads. “We have been working together with both GMP and Cheshire police and as a result of our inquiries were able to carry out this joint operation today.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"voluntary-sector-network/2018/jun/04/british-red-cross-shoreham-air-show-disaster-2015-volunteers-week","type":"article","sectionId":"voluntary-sector-network","sectionName":"Voluntary Sector Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T09:00:54Z","webTitle":"'The Red Cross helped me at a time of crisis.

I looked up into the sky and saw a plane only a few hundred metres away – and coming straight towards me. There was intense heat and bits of debris flying past me. I remember thinking that I wasn’t sure I would make it out alive. Within a split second, the plane hit the ground a couple of hundred metres in front of me and exploded. In the next split second, I was engulfed in flames. I was in a lot of pain then and in quite a bit of shock. Some small bits of debris had hit me on my back and leg. It felt a bit like hailstones. When everything stopped moving, there was an eerie silence. I got to my feet in a state of shock and ran towards the airfield, in the opposite direction from the crash site. I remember I wanted to get away; I was quite scared of seeing the fallout from the explosion. As I ran, I shouted for people to go and help. I was let into the airfield and shouted “Can anyone do first aid?” Some people from the RAF spotted me and started pouring water over me, which helped quite a lot. I was burned on both hands, my right arm, left leg, and a bit on my back and neck. I spent about 20 minutes with the RAF guys cooling my burns before the British Red Cross ambulance came across the airfield and the first aiders came to help me. The Red Cross sat me down and checked all my vital signs – my temperature, blood pressure and pulse. I was very grateful that they were there. I suffered burns to 10% of my body, including second degree burns on my hands, leg and arms. But if I hadn’t had that help, I’d potentially have had much more serious injuries. In the aftermath of the crash, the British Red Cross did a lot to help the emergency personnel working on the scene – and that’s something people in the community could help with in similar extreme circumstances. Three years on, the Red Cross has launched a new scheme, to create a national network of people ready to help in a local emergency. I think it’s a really great idea. Not everyone has the time to volunteer on a weekly or monthly basis, but people do want to get involved when something major happens. To be a community reserve volunteer you don’t need specialist skills to make a difference – and simple acts of kindness can go a long way. Any necessary training will be given at the emergency scene and you can confirm your availability when you are contacted. I’m proud to be able to give something back to the organisation who stepped up for me at a very traumatic time. Volunteers’ Week, organised by the NCVO, celebrates UK volunteers and runs from 1 to 7 June 2018.

Seventy years on, does this still hold true? It is not uncommon for NHS trusts to run their on-call services (for their urgent work) with insufficient junior and senior staff to the point that it becomes unsafe. Many hospitals spend more than their incomes on treating the rising number of patients. GP surgeries close. Waiting times rise. Patients look for alternatives for which they have to pay, such as online providers or private hospitals. Long waiting times are a big problem for those in physical or emotional distress. It takes around 20 weeks, if not longer, to see an NHS physiotherapist in our area – patients often have acute pain, loss of function, are off work and losing earnings. They can lose faith altogether and disengage from NHS services, or turn to private healthcare. Sometimes they pay for private physiotherapy, but then they start and stop after one or two sessions when the money runs out. Prescribing is another area with restrictions. Doctors are told by NHS England to not prescribe low-value medications or those that can be purchased over the counter (for instance drugs for diarrhoea, constipation, eczema, hay fever, indigestion, eye symptoms and pain). The price varies from cheap, non-branded painkillers to expensive emollient for eczema. A few years ago my son, who has eczema, was going through a 500g tub of emollient every two weeks prescribed by our GP. This is now £12 or more to buy over the counter, not a small amount, with many eczema sufferers needing many tubs a year. Those who really need treatments are the ones who will suffer from lack of affordability. Many treatments are now classified as criteria-based or needing individual funding requests (that is, not routinely funded unless a detailed application is submitted by a GP or hospital specialist with evidence such as trials/research of its benefits and especially over any other patient with the same problem). So, for instance, a patient with pain and loss of hand function from a ganglion cyst would need an individual funding request. Clinical commissioning groups have a long list of conditions that need such approval – such as varicose veins, tonsillectomies and hernia surgery. Most of my applications are rejected as almost no one (despite the level of their suffering) is deemed exceptional. A friend has left hospital medicine, which had been her lifelong passion to pursue a non-clinical career. She described the moment when she woke up one morning not knowing why she was a doctor any more. She said there seemed to be no purpose to what she was doing. She had “perpetual anxiety, an unmanageable workload and a dawning realisation that she could not provide free and safe healthcare for her patients”. But there is hope, too, if we can equip the NHS to deliver free and world-class healthcare, and if staff believe they make a real difference to people’s lives. And if we can continue the goodwill of those who work within it, which is what oils its wheels. Without this, as it stands now, 70 years on, the NHS will continue its sad path to disintegration and privatisation. • Zara Aziz is a GP in inner-city Bristol"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/05/hostage-niger-islamic-state-group-they-want-to-kill-foreign-soldiers","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T04:00:35Z","webTitle":"Niger Islamic State hostage: 'They want to kill foreign soldiers'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/hostage-niger-islamic-state-group-they-want-to-kill-foreign-soldiers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/05/hostage-niger-islamic-state-group-they-want-to-kill-foreign-soldiers","fields":{"headline":"Niger Islamic State hostage: 'They want to kill foreign soldiers'","bodyText":"When a team of American special forces hunting Islamic State fighters in Niger was ambushed and four of its soldiers killed, the attack last October was described as “a total tactical surprise” by the commander of US Africa Command. Their deaths became a political scandal in Washington – where there was little awareness of US military operations in the region – and became notorious when Donald Trump, in a condolence call, told the widow of one of the dead soldiers that he “knew what he signed up for”. “They had never seen anything in this magnitude – numbers, mobility and training,” said US Gen Thomas Waldhauser last month, presenting the results of the Pentagon investigation into the attack, which found “individual, organisational and institutional failures” leading up to the ambush. But the same group that attacked the US-Nigerien team near the village of Tongo Tongo, close to border with Mali, had staged many attacks, including one of similar magnitude on an outpost of Niger’s national guard almost a year earlier. In that attack, just like in Tongo Tongo, over 100 heavily-armed men suddenly appeared on motorbikes and in vehicles. They killed six Nigerien soldiers, and took two others hostage. Only one lived to tell the tale. The Guardian has gained rare insight into the Isis-affiliated group through an interview with that soldier, who spent three months chained up as their hostage. Abdoul Wahid, 28, talked to many of his kidnappers, who said they had no demands but just wanted to wage jihad, and spoke of wanting to kill foreign soldiers in particular. Wahid also witnessed them recruiting and training an army of children aged around 10. After breaking the Ramadan fast in Niger’s capital Niamey last week, Wahid, off duty in a crisp short-sleeved shirt, sat in his mother’s room and described the chilly November morning in 2016 when the 17 soldiers at his post were attacked by a group of men. They were led by a skinny man called Aboubacar Chapori, also known as Petit Chapori, a key lieutenant of Abu Walid al-Sahraoui, leader of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS). “We shot at them until we had no bullets left,” Wahid said. “By the end, six of our men were dead, including our chief. He was shot in the head in front of all of us, and two of us were taken hostage.” Wahid was thrown into the back of a pickup, along with his 24-year-old friend Habib Isa, and the jihadist convoy sped off. Wahid and Isa had done their training together. “We were really close,” he said. They were driven across the dry scrub of western Niger. Wahid knew the region well and recognised where he was being taken. When they reached the Tongo Tongo area, they stopped and pulled Isa down from the pickup. “They slit my friend’s throat. They said he was a dog,” Wahid said, maintaining his military bearing, but his voice giving way just a little. “Then they tied my hands and feet together and blindfolded me. They said: ‘You see your friend? You’re next.’” But they kept Wahid alive. Sitting barefoot and crosslegged on his mother’s mat, Wahid demonstrated how they strung him up in the back of the pickup, his back towards the cab, arms over his head. They drove like that for two days, crossing the Malian border to join their brothers. As they sped through hamlets en route, Wahid heard villagers cry “Allahu Akbar” – Allah is great. He was deep in enemy territory, he realised. It is not known how many members ISGS has; some analysts say less than 100. But Wahid estimated that he saw up to 600 fighters, and said they told him he had only seen half their total number. Since the Tongo Tongo attack, Niger’s interior minister Mohamed Bazoum said the group had been significantly weakened, with only a few hundred survivors. But according to Malian and Nigerien security sources who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, Tongo Tongo brought Sahraoui respect and money from Isis and its other affiliates, such as Boko Haram in neighbouring Nigeria. “The Tongo Tongo attack gave Abu Walid a lot of importance and support from his superiors,” one said. Defence secretary Jim Mattis has ordered a review of US counterterrorism forces in Africa after the ambush, which could result in resources for such missions being halved over the next three years. Little is known about ISGS. The Guardian pieced together their history by talking to intelligence, military, political and rebel sources across Niger. Sahraoui, the leader and founder, may be a jihadist pledged to Islamic State, but his camel and motorbike-mounted militants are very different to ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria. Sahraoui is thought to be originally from the disputed territory of Western Sahara and spent time in Algeria before coming to Mali. After years at the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) and the al-Qaida-linked group al-Murabitoun, he split off to found ISGS, piggybacking on a conflict on the Niger-Mali border that had been rumbling on for decades and was ripe for exploitation. The people he chose – nomadic Fulani herders in the regions of Tillabéri and Tahoua – had been feuding with the Daoussahak Tuareg of the Ménaka region in Mali for decades. “The Tillabéri problem is an ethnic problem,” said a Nigerien intelligence officer who had worked on the region for decades. “The Fulani have a problem with the Tuareg, and jihadists profited from the situation.” Records show that there has been fighting over access to water and pasture land since at least the 1950s, but according to several sources who witnessed the conflict evolve, it intensified in the 1990s. An accord signed between the governments of Niger and Mali in the 90s allowed pastoralists in search of water for their animals to cross from dry Niger into Mali’s less dry Ménaka region. However, this agreement was not explained properly to people on the ground, so when Nigerien Fulani arrived with hundreds of cows in Mali, the well-armed Daoussahak Tuareg population reacted by raiding their cattle. Because they were Nigerien, the Fulani herders had no representation in Mali, and no friends in high places to support them. They started trading cows for Kalashnikovs to protect themselves and by 2010, Daoussahak and Fulani were regularly launching bloody attacks on each others’ camps. Then came the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in neighbouring Libya, which saw Malian Tuareg fighters from his armies return home. They brought with them arms and money, and the explosion of northern Mali as they joined forces with other rebels to create a separatist movement, the MNLA. Many Daoussahak joined them, and according to Niger’s interior minister Mohammed Bazoum, this drove young Fulani to join MUJAO – not out of a desire to wage jihad, but to protect themselves against their old enemy. Sahraoui took some of the Fulani from MUJAO and al-Mourabitoun, but also recruited Tuareg and Arab fighters into ISGS’s ranks. To start with, they were a small group. “Abu Walid didn’t have many men. I knew him in early 2016, and he only had four pickups then,” said the intelligence officer. In Niger’s rural regions, power is often counted in numbers of Toyota Hiluxes. But they steadily increased their firepower, mainly through attacks on Nigerien military. When Bazoum took the interior minister job, he sent emissaries to ask what they wanted. “I said ‘listen, if you have political claims, or problems with the justice, the administration, the state, then tell me’,” said the imposing Bazoum, sitting on the sofa in his Niamey office. “We are ready to discuss your problem with you and resolve it. Declare that you’re a rebel front with specific claims on the Nigerien state.” He said he received a handwritten letter from Sahraoui himself, which said: “No, we have no problem with you; we are waging jihad against Mali.” According to Bazoum, the letter contained a list of Sahraoui’s comrades in Nigerien jails, whom he wanted released. If they were freed, ISGS promised to shield Niger from attack. “I freed some of them to show my good will, but I couldn’t free all of them because some were on trial,” Bazoum said. After that, the communication channel broke down and attacks escalated. Some believe the group’s militants could still be offered an olive branch to demobilise and be reintegrated into Nigerien society. But Bazoum is not among them. “The young people working with Abu Walid al-Sahraoui aren’t just there to oppose the Daoussahak, they’re also there to wage jihad against our country, and they attack us,” Bazoum said. “We have no solution to propose to them, all we have is war to weaken them.” Wahid was chained up, freed only occasionally to relieve himself, fed on nothing but flatbread and pond water, and ferried around with the militants, who he said were constantly on the move. They were training an army of children, he said. Three to five new boys, aged around 10, would arrive every day – usually group members’ brothers who had been sent for. He said that foreign soldiers were a major ISGS target. “I don’t know whether they were American or French, but in Mali there were lots of white soldiers, and they [ISGS] particularly wanted to kill them. They knew the whites were after them,” he said. For one of his three months as a captive, Wahid was held by the group’s head of recruitment, Petit Chapori, who would occasionally come and chat to his prisoner. Since the deaths of the American special forces soldiers, much attention has been focused on Doundou Cheffou, an ISGS member who had been a target of the joint US-Nigerien raid just before the Tongo Tongo attack. According to several sources with knowledge of the group, however, Cheffou is merely a “chef de poste”, below Petit Chapori in the hierarchy. “He asked me if, when I was a soldier, I drank alcohol. I said no. He asked if I smoked, and I said yes. Did I fuck women? I said yes. How many foam mattresses did I sleep on? I said two or three. He laughed and said: ‘Look what life has done to you. Now you sleep on the ground, with no mattress at all.’” He added: “Petit Chapori speaks of Islam, but he’s not really a believer. He’s just a thug.” None of the group practised Islam as Wahid knew it. He never saw anyone do the required ablutions before praying – and he was never allowed to wash himself. They said half the usual number of prayers, and when he asked them why, they said it was because they were travellers. He asked them why they were fighting. “They always said: ‘We want nothing. Our mission is to wage jihad.’ Then they would tell me about army positions they wanted to attack.” Every day of his ordeal, Wahid thought the militants were going to slit his throat, as they had Isa’s. But one day, his captors unlocked his chains. After negotiations with the government, they had agreed to free him. He was driven back the way he had come, three months earlier. When he got back to his mother’s house in Niamey, the pain in his shoulders from being chained up for three months stopped him sleeping. But he has recovered, and is about to get married. Wahid was lucky to escape with his life. That is something his former captors cannot do, he said. “Some want to leave, and stop fighting, but they can’t. If you abandon the group, they’ll kill you.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/01/kyle-edmund-fabio-fognini-french-open","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T21:30:01Z","webTitle":"Kyle Edmund’s power faces the unpredictability of Fabio Fognini","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/01/kyle-edmund-fabio-fognini-french-open","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/01/kyle-edmund-fabio-fognini-french-open","fields":{"headline":"Kyle Edmund’s power faces the unpredictability of Fabio Fognini","bodyText":"Fabio Fognini is as close as tennis has to a wild-eyed, trash-talking boxer. Kyle Edmund would not look out of place checking your books in a library. Which only shows how appearances can deceive, as will surely be seen when the Italian and the Yorkshireman go at it for the first time in the third round of the French Open on Saturday. There is a steeliness about Edmund’s game that was missing last year, when he lost too many close matches to good players – most notably Kevin Anderson here at the same stage of the tournament, when he squandered a 2-1 advantage. First evidence that he had addressed the issue arrived in the rematch at the Australian Open. He overhauled a 2-1 deficit against the 2017 US Open finalist and was a break down in the fifth before grinding out the biggest win of his career to that point, leading on to his first appearance in a major semi-final. Edmund, 23, has no history with Fognini, who turned 31 last week, but, as he said after beating Marton Fucsovics in the second round: “The tour is aware of all players and what their attitudes are like.” Later, as he gathered his thoughts about the challenge the world No 18 will bring, he said: “He’s just a character. I was next to him this morning on the [exercise] bike. He was smiling. We get on fine. It was nothing more than hello and talk a little bit.” It is likely the volume will be turned up on Saturday. If people thought marriage to the 2015 US Open champion, Flavia Pennetta, and fatherhood had calmed Fognini’s fire, he disabused them of the notion when he was thrown out of that tournament in September for hurling “extremely derogatory and misogynistic language” at a female umpire. The source of his ire was his compatriot, Stefano Travaglia, a qualifier who bageled him in the last set of their first-round match. Fognini still has a suspension hanging over him for that one. But nobody looks away. It is his tennis as much as his temperament that makes him a star, as Edmund is aware. “He’s a really good player,” he said. “He has his own style. He finds the areas on the court which are very good on clay.” Edmund’s first glimpse of Fognini was on TV, having left the Great Britain camp before their Davis Cup match against Italy in Naples four years ago, when Andy Murray, struck by flu and hampered by a dangerous court, could not unlock his mysteries. “There was the crowd, very passionate. That was a test, like playing a South American in South America. It doesn’t get much tougher in terms of atmosphere. It’s going to be a big test for me – playing a good clay-courter at the French Open, the clay grand slam. It’s where you want to be.” Fognini acknowledges Edmund’s progress, having seen him pass him in the rankings this week. “He is growing as a player,” he said. “He was able to take [Alexander] Zverev to the limit in Rome [where Fognini took a set off Rafael Nadal]. He still has some strange results because he lost to [Andreas] Seppi in Monte Carlo and he lost a strange final to Pablo Andujar in Morocco. “But he is a player who is more difficult for me to beat on hard court than clay. He has a good forehand and serve. Before he wasn’t moving so well but now he is much better from a physical point of view. “I don’t see myself as underdog. It’s at least 50-50 chances for me. I’m coming out of six sets won in a row and I’ve lost just 14 games.” Someone who has watched Edmund close-up for years is his Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith, who said: “You’ve seen him grow in confidence. Because he is not an extrovert, it was going to take him a little bit more time. His ranking and his results are what give him that sense of: ‘Yeah, I’m here because of my tennis.’ “The good thing about him now, unusually for a British player – although Tim Henman got to a semi and Andy is obviously a very good clay-court player – Kyle is really suited to clay. It’s going to be a really good match. You have the flair and unpredictability of Fognini and the power game of Kyle.” Others have an equally high opinion of Edmund. John McEnroe said this week: “He’s got a great shot to get into the top 10 – in the next year, maximum, maybe less.” Pat Cash thinks so too. Edmund blushes and responds: “For someone to say that is great. Top 10 in waiting, OK – but it doesn’t just come. You have to earn it. I have to make it happen. I believe I can. “I have good confidence in my game, the way I played against guys that are ranked at the top. [Grigor] Dimitrov and Zverev were three in the world when I played them. I’ve played the No 1 in the world, Novak [Djokovic] and Rafa. I’m still pretty young at 23. Hopefully, as you get older you move up the ranking. Top 10 is for sure a goal. It has to be.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/01/melania-trump-skip-camp-david-retreat-public-absence","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T15:49:19Z","webTitle":"Melania Trump to skip Camp David trip, marking a 22-day absence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/01/melania-trump-skip-camp-david-retreat-public-absence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/01/melania-trump-skip-camp-david-retreat-public-absence","fields":{"headline":"Melania Trump to skip Camp David trip, marking a 22-day absence","bodyText":"The White House said on Friday that Melania Trump would not be joining her husband at the Camp David presidential retreat this weekend.

The growing interest of investors in low-carbon activity will, she said, determine the global response to climate change much more than the actions of Trump. Speaking on the anniversary of Trump’s public decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and ahead of a G7 meeting where climate change will be high on the agenda, Figueres said not only businesses but also other governments were moving ahead of the US on the issue. “The US is in a frankly un-understandable position,” she told the Guardian. “How is [withdrawing from Paris] going to strengthen the US economy? How is it going to open up new opportunities for the US when the rest of the world is becoming increasingly decarbonised?” She pointed to the large number of US businesses and cities that had reaffirmed their commitment to cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in low-carbon technology. “They are saying they will continue to decarbonise,” she said. “It’s very difficult when the White House is speaking in one direction and the real economy is continuing moving in a different direction. “Is the White House going to stop this advance [by businesses]? I don’t think so.” Figueres had praise for the UK, which she said was leading the world in areas such as offshore wind. “In the country that saw the birth of the industrial revolution, we are seeing a new industrial revolution,” she said. Brexit was not a reason to change the UK’s determination to move to a low-carbon footing, she said, as Britain could benefit from green economic growth. Figueres was also scathing about those who claim the world cannot now avoid warming of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, the limit set out in the Paris agreement based on scientific advice that warming above this level would cause catastrophic and irreversible changes. “To say we can’t avoid [such a future] and give up, that is irresponsible. That is completely unacceptable to me.” She expects a key report due from the International Panel on Climate Change later this year to underline the need for urgency in cutting emissions, but said it was still possible to stave off the worst effects of warming and that the world should focus on such efforts. “I was told in 2009 it was already too late. Had we had a global framework 10 years ago, it would have been better. 20 years ago would have been better yet. 25 years ago would have been better, better, better yet. But the point is that we are dealing with the reality that we have.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/jun/04/gender-neutral-pronouns-they-he-she-why-deny","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T10:00:13Z","webTitle":"If someone wants to be called 'they' and not 'he' or 'she', why say no? | Robin Dembroff and Daniel Wodak","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/04/gender-neutral-pronouns-they-he-she-why-deny","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/04/gender-neutral-pronouns-they-he-she-why-deny","fields":{"headline":"If someone wants to be called 'they' and not 'he' or 'she', why say no?","bodyText":"Most people prefer to be called “he” or “she”. But others, like Kelsey, do not: they want to be referred to by gender-neutral pronouns like “they”. Should you defer to Kelsey’s preferences? Many people think no. Some, like University of Toronto professor Jordan Peterson, have recently garnered celebrity status by taking a stance against gender-neutral pronouns: “I don’t recognize another person’s right to determine what pronouns I use to address them,” Peterson has said. His view is common among social conservatives. We think people should not use gender-specific pronouns for genderqueer people – people that do not identify as men or as women. We can start here: why should we use some words, rather than others, to refer to people? A common answer among the left is because we should respect people’s preferences. If you’re talking about Kelsey, you should use whatever pronouns Kelsey prefers, and Kelsey prefers “they”. Many on the right believe this is dogmatic. After all, many people prefer not to use “they” for Kelsey. Whose preferences matter more? From conservatives’ perspective, liberals just assume that Kelsey’s preferences matter more than theirs, and do so in the service of a political agenda. Is that assumption misguided? Consider an analogy. As a Muslim civil rights leader, Muhammad Ali rejected the name he was given at birth (Cassius Clay) because it represented a Christian identity that he rejected. He instead chose the name Ali. But others preferred to use Clay. Whose preferences matter more? We think the answer is clear. Ali’s identity is what’s at issue, so his preferences matter more. But maybe you think there is more to say about why conservatives’ preferences matter. Many on the far right rally around the mantra “There are only two genders!”. They apparently believe that calling Kelsey “they” would affirm that Kelsey is not a man or a woman – an idea they flatly reject. Peterson makes this point in exaggerated fashion, refusing to be an “ideological puppet”, or a “mouthpiece of some murderous ideology”. Here the debate typically turns to whether it is right that there are only two genders. But even if we granted this point, the argument fails. Perhaps people should not be “bullied” into affirming identities that they reject. But this does not give anyone the right to deny those identities. This point is important because of something the usual rhetoric around pronouns obscures: gender-neutral pronouns are gender-neutral. “They” does not communicate that Kelsey is genderqueer in the way that “he” would communicate that Kelsey is a man or “she” would communicate that Kelsey is a woman. “They” refrains from ascribing a particular gender to Kelsey. This is why “they” is often used in colloquial English as a singular gender-neutral pronoun for people who probably aren’t genderqueer. (“Who is at the door?” “Dunno – go see what they want.”) “They” is often used this way, and has been used this way since the Shakespearean era. It’s nothing new. (Note that even Peterson uses singular “they” in an earlier quote.) Conservatives think they should not be forced to affirm that Kelsey is non-binary. But “they” does not affirm that Kelsey is any particular gender; it just avoids saying anything about Kelsey’s gender. As long as Kelsey should not be ascribed a gender they reject, we should not use “he” or “she” for Kelsey. We can all respect Kelsey without anyone being “bullied” into being a mouthpiece for any ideology. To our mind, everything else in this debate is a distraction. The far right defends their devotion to “he” and “she” by appealing to freedom of speech. But freedom of speech at most gives us “a right to do wrong”. Arguably, freedom of speech may give you a legal right to use racial slurs. But it doesn’t make it right to use racial slurs. Exercising a right to do wrong is still a way of doing something wrong. The same goes for using “he” or “she” for those who prefer otherwise: even if freedom of speech gives you a legal right to do so, it is still wrong. Appeals to grammaticality are similar. Many opposed to gender-neutral pronouns claim that singular use of “they” is “non-standard” English; the National Review decries “stupid people” engaged in an “asinine effort” to “de-pluralize ‘they’”. The sentence “They are my good friend” may strike you as ungrammatical. But notice that we say things like “You are my good friend” with ease. Using “they” as a singular or plural third-person pronoun is no different from how we already use “you” as a singular or plural second-person pronoun. More importantly, just as we recognize the distinction between morality and law, we should recognize a distinction between morality and grammar. Doing what is morally right sometimes requires challenging legal rules. Why should grammatical rules be different? We should focus on what matters: whether and why we should (not) use particular pronouns. It is wrong to use pronouns that deny someone’s identity. This is enough to see why we should use gender-neutral pronouns for non-binary people. In fact, once we see the virtues of using a gender-neutral pronoun like “they” for some people, maybe we should just use “they” for everyone.

When the machine ran out of water, he asked passing boys to fetch a bucket. When he had to give directions to workers in the building across the lane, he shouted. Every few minutes, he took a long swig from his water bottle and spat the contents on to the ground without swallowing. “Ramadan,” he explained. Northern India, like neighbouring Pakistan, is in the grip of a heatwave, with temperatures reaching 47C. A blanket of hot air has settled on Delhi clearing pavements across the usually busy capital. India is particularly vulnerable to temperature increases associated with climate change. Since 1992, about 25,000 Indians are estimated to have died because of heatwaves. Yet the country is quietly optimistic that it can prevent at least some of those deaths. In the past two years, the numbers dying from heat-related illnesses has fallen sharply, from 2,040 in 2015 – when roads melted in the searing heat – to half that the following year and to a little over 200 in 2017, according to government data. Public health advocates say this has been a triumph of common sense. A combination of public awareness campaigns, training for medical staff and simple policy changes – such as unlocking the gates of public gardens during the day –have averted thousands of deaths for little cost. The catalyst was a heatwave in May 2010 in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the western state of Gujarat, that killed more than 1,100 people, and prompted authorities to seek help. “The first thing was making people aware that heat can kill,” said Parthasarathi Ganguly, a professor of public health and former World Health Organisation official. “India is a tropical country, so people are used to heat: they take it as a natural phenomenon. They say, it will be hot – what’s new?” Under Ahmedabad’s action plan – first implemented in 2013, when temperatures rose so high it risked triggering organ failure – school days were reduced, government work programmes ceased, and free water was distributed in busy areas. White reflective paint was applied to roofs in slum communities, cutting temperatures in homes by up to five degrees. In hospitals, staff were trained to identify early signs of heat stroke, including dizziness or severe diarrhoea. Instead of waiting in stifling wards, patients were rushed to dedicated cool rooms equipped with fans, ice packs and, electricity supply permitting, air conditioning. “Doctors don’t go on vacation any more when it’s hot,” said Anjali Jaiswal, of the US-based National Resource Defense Council, which advised on the plan. “They watch the temperature and make sure the hospital is staffed.” Ahmedabad already had plenty of charities willing to distribute water. “They see it as an act of god,” Ganguly said. The city government simply allocated each charity a zone, to ensure the whole city was covered. The gates of city gardens, usually closed in the daytime, were opened so that hawkers, traffic police and rickshaw pullers could seek shade. “The council didn’t spend a rupee,” Ganguly said. The first test of the new system was in May 2014 when, he says, temperatures again reached the levels that had killed so many. “According to our initial estimates, 800 fewer people died,” he said. “In terms of cost per lives saved, it is one of the most effective interventions in public health until now.” Since then, 11 more cities have adopted similar heat action plans, and one is currently in the works for Delhi. India’s national disaster management authority is aiming to reduce the death toll from excessive heat to zero. So far this year, government officials say, the heat has killed 11 people. Temperatures will drop across India at the end of this month with the arrival of the monsoon rains.

She worked for most of her career at the county record office in Warwick, initially as an archives assistant and then as an archivist after completing a postgraduate diploma. It was work she very much enjoyed, not least because it indulged her fascination with history and the stories that records could reveal about our past and present. Keen to share her passion, and to broaden access to archives in her local community, she was involved in co-ordinating the record office’s volunteer programme and in showcasing some of the important and interesting items within its collections. She was especially proud of her public talk on the records of the Warwick county lunatic asylum which documented the treatment of mentally ill people in Victorian England. Born in Chester, Susan was the elder of two children of Kathleen (nee Green) and Kenneth Groucott. The family travelled widely as a result of Kenneth’s position in the RAF, and Susan grew up in Germany, Cyprus and Libya as well as the UK. She gained a degree in history at the University of Leicester in the early 1970s. She developed a keen interest in social history, and studied for her MA under the leftwing historian Dorothy Thompson at Birmingham University, and then for an MPhil at Leicester; for her thesis she examined working-class leisure patterns in 19th-century industrial Birmingham. Susan retired from the county record office due to poor health in 2014. Beyond work, she was a great lover of animals – her home was a haven for all kinds of pets and wildlife – and was perhaps best known for her beloved Irish wolfhounds. She nurtured her garden into a wonderland of trees, rambling roses and secluded spots in a 30-year labour of love. Left-leaning politically, she was an eager and formidable participant in any debate on just about any subject, but one who showed great respect for the opinions of others. Her marriage to Ian Parsons ended in divorce in 1989. She is survived by her brother, Christopher, and by me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/booksblog/2018/jun/04/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T14:00:17Z","webTitle":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/jun/04/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/booksblog/2018/jun/04/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week","fields":{"headline":"Tips, links and suggestions: what are you reading this week?","bodyText":"Welcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. First up, Veufveuve asks us to believe the hype about Barracoon: The Story of the Last “Black Cargo” by Zora Neale Hurston: This book, which had lain unpublished since it was completed by Hurston in the early 1930s, has attracted much excitement and expectation since it was announced earlier this year. It deserves every ounce of hype and praise it has received. Based on oral history interviews conducted by Hurston, it tells the story of Cudjo Lewis, or Kossula, one of the last survivors of one of the last slavers, the Clotilda, to reach the US. It is a remarkable testament; everything one knows about slavery in an abstract sense is painfully, vividly embodied here in Kossula, still utterly bereft of Africa nearly 70 years after he was snatched away from it. Nothing could bring the psychological or emotional damage of that dislocation closer. The narrative, largely in Kossula’s own words (rendered in dialect but extremely easy to understand), is handled beautifully by Hurston. Sympathetically put together with a foreword, introduction, afterword, glossary, notes etc, this book needs to read as widely as possible. Rose Tremain’s Restoration has impressed PlumedCrest100: It is a wonderfully humorous book, but it is desperately sad in parts. Tremain captures the colourfulness and the spirit of the restoration era well, her descriptions of food, clothes and entertainment at court are spectacularly detailed. What I was most impressed with was the dialogue: it is not overly stiff and antiquated, but it still has the distinctive cadence of the speech and writing of the era. Talking of food, Tom Mooney has been enjoying Garlic, Mint and Sweet Basil by “the great” Jean-Claude Izzo: This is a delightful collection of essays by the godfather of Mediterranean noir. Izzo, one of my favourite writers, muses here on his beloved home city of Marseilles, his lust for good food and his thoughts on noir and other writing. It is very romantic and nostalgic but also contains some timely thoughts on what it is to be French, European and a citizen of the world. Meanwhile, MsCarey has been enjoying Berlin Noir and Philip Kerr’s Bernie Gunther novel, The One from the Other: Once I’d suspended belief (no big ask), had a load of fun with it. Clever, entertaining and even a little thought-provoking. I’m hoping the rest of the later ones measure up, and that they’ll be a reliable source of future entertainment. Sad to think he was only 62 when he died. Staying in Europe, Ongley has been reading Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk’s Flights as translated by Jennifer Croft: Tokarczuk has a fine narrative voice, very nicely rendered by Jennifer Croft, which somehow gets diluted in the myriad of micro-fictions that compose this constellation of a novel. There are strong characters that pop up in different locations, from Moscow to the Netherlands, among plentiful musings and asides on travel and taxidermy. The geography sometimes left me disoriented (Someone was insisting that with such great weather they ought to be able to see in the distance the Turkish coast of Mount Ararat), but it all makes for a far-reaching read... annegeraldine is a few chapters into Robbie Robertson’s Testimony: There are a lot of special guest star appearances already. Carl Perkins is there. Leiber and Stoller in the Brill building … Jerry Lee at the piano … Howlin’ Wolf blowing young Robbie’s mind. And my God, Levon Helm is there, young smiling and alive. What a precious gift. Interesting links about books and reading Chuck Palahniuk’s statement about his loss of money and the alleged embezzlement at his literary agency. Bill Clinton loves Marcus Aurelius – and he hasn’t finished Don Quixote either. “Not for the first time in her life, Sontag became cross.” Geoff Dyer on typically delightful form, discussing memory. Zadie Smith on Philip Roth: “He was writing taken neat, and everything he did was at the service of writing.” If you would like to share a photo of the book you are reading, or film your own book review, please do.

The former, easing back into action after a 30-year absence, is shortly to be a venue in the Edinburgh international festival. The latter, due for demolition, is a dilapidated art-deco picture house. Edinburgh’s most free-flowing festival, Hidden Door is a happy blend of grassroots artists and headline acts. You might go to see London Afrobeat Collective and find yourself beguiled by Jill Martin Boualaxai’s copper-sheeting maps or Oana Stanciu’s video self-portraits. Or you might head for the high drama, quirky comedy and offbeat documentary of the Edinburgh short film festival and stumble across a spoken-word gig. It is in this context that we find the theatrical debut of the Golden Trailer Collective, a group of nurses and mechanics with an unorthodox record of artistic interventions (they put an eight-tonne fishing boat on a hilltop and turned a condemned box trailer into a mobile foot-care unit). Written by Rebecca Nada-Rajah, who co-directs with Tomás Palmer, Magical Plastic Chicken is set in a holding room of Edinburgh airport where a young woman is detained under schedule seven of the terrorism act after alarming the security staff with a mechanical toy. As a play, it loses focus. Soap-opera digressions about pregnancy and domestic violence sit unevenly alongside moments of theatrical exuberance: Gus Maitland in a chicken costume, Habiba Saleh’s dreamy table-top dance and a closing coup de théâtre that reveals the cinema’s ruined glory. Hinting at political satire and expressionist nightmare, it commits to neither, leaving its concept intriguing but its intentions uncertain."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/jun/03/anglican-catholic-churches-condemn-carwash-slavery-england","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T10:49:37Z","webTitle":"Anglican and Catholic churches condemn 'car wash slavery'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jun/03/anglican-catholic-churches-condemn-carwash-slavery-england","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/jun/03/anglican-catholic-churches-condemn-carwash-slavery-england","fields":{"headline":"Anglican and Catholic churches condemn 'car wash slavery'","bodyText":"The Anglican and Catholic churches in England have joined forces to urge people to watch out for signs of modern day slavery at car washes and report their suspicions to the authorities. An app to help members of the public identify signs of forced labour is being launched on Monday by the Clewer Initiative, the Church of England’s campaign against modern slavery, and the Santa Marta Group, the Catholic church’s anti-slavery project. The Safe Car Wash app has the backing of key agencies, including the police and councils, and is part of a drive to tackle the exploitation of workers at some of Britain’s 18,000-plus hand car washes. Many are legitimate businesses, but some threaten workers and trap them in modern slavery. The app will pinpoint the location of hand car washes using GPS. Users will be shown a series of indicators of modern slavery, such as whether workers have suitable protective clothing or whether they appear withdrawn. Users can be directed to the Modern Slavery Helpline and data from the app will be anonymised and shared with the National Crime Agency and the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: “Over the last few years we have learned more about the evil of modern slavery and we have begun to understand how it is perpetrated in our communities in plain sight.” The app provided help in tackling “this scourge which is damaging so many people’s lives”, he said. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, said: “As we learn … we will also become more aware of the presence of this evil scourge in other sectors in our neighbourhood.” Kevin Hyland, the independent anti-slavery commissioner, said: “In addition to immeasurably improving the lives of victims of modern slavery being cruelly exploited in car washes today, [the app] also empowers a community to act.” Clergy will also be asked to raise awareness of the campaign in sermons and Sunday school lessons and hold events to publicise the app."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/03/lucy-gichuhi-coalition-says-it-will-take-senator-at-her-word-over-citizenship","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T07:15:37Z","webTitle":"Lucy Gichuhi: Coalition says it will take senator 'at her word' over citizenship","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/03/lucy-gichuhi-coalition-says-it-will-take-senator-at-her-word-over-citizenship","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/03/lucy-gichuhi-coalition-says-it-will-take-senator-at-her-word-over-citizenship","fields":{"headline":"Lucy Gichuhi: Coalition says it will take senator 'at her word' over citizenship","bodyText":"The Turnbull government says the Kenyan-born senator Lucy Gichuhi has no case to answer about whether or not she is eligible to sit in federal parliament. The government frontbencher Simon Birmingham said on Sunday the legal advice about her citizenship status was clear and the high court had already considered a complaint from the ALP. Birmingham pointed to the decision last August by the high court that Gichuhi was eligible to replace Bob Day as a South Australian senator in the federal parliament when the Family First senator resigned after a constitutional breach concerning the lease of his Adelaide office. Gichuhi echoed Birmingham’s line later in the day, declaring she was “Australian and only Australian”. News Corp reported over the weekend a new legal opinion arguing the senator did not automatically lose her Kenyan citizenship when she became an Australian citizen. Advice from the University of Nairobi professor Edwin Abuya says Gichuhi should have written to Kenya’s nationality affairs minister to renounce her Kenyan citizenship, News Corp reported on Sunday. But the government says there is no case to answer. Appearing on Sky News, the workplace relations minister, Craig Laundy, said there was strong legal advice supporting her position, and “I take her at her word”. Laundy said there was no reason to send her case to the high court, because the Kenyan embassy had made her citizenship status clear. Gichuhi included on the citizenship register a letter from Kenya’s high commissioner in Canberra, Isaiya Kabira, declaring she had not been recognised as a Kenyan citizens since 2010. She nominated for the Senate in May 2016. Appearing on the ABC, the shadow workplace minister, Brendan O’Connor, said the senator’s position was a problem for the government. “It would appear on the face of it that if the legislation has to be read with the constitution, she may well be in some difficulty”. • Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/03/addressing-the-antibiotics-crisis","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T16:56:31Z","webTitle":"Addressing the antibiotics crisis | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/03/addressing-the-antibiotics-crisis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/03/addressing-the-antibiotics-crisis","fields":{"headline":"Addressing the antibiotics crisis","bodyText":"I read with interest your article (Antibiotics crisis made worse by shortages in supply, 1 June) on the Access to Medicine Foundation report into this topic.

However, I fear your article missed part of the story. Over the past few years the UK independent Review on Antimicrobial Resistance (on which I worked), the EU’s Drive-AB and many other groups have suggested workable solutions to the problem of underinvestment in new antibiotics. In short, we need greater investment in early-stage drug research, and market-entry rewards that pay researchers based on the quality of the drug. This is necessary to discourage overselling and because antibiotic sales do not reflect their societal value, making patents a poor form of incentive. The problems of and solutions to antibiotic resistance are well understood. What we need now is politicians to start acting.

It is not a few bad apples; not a few social media posts taken out of context. The problem has been growing unchecked for years, despite warnings by Muslim party members, and has now become so normalised that incidents are being reported with alarming frequency. Last week, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for an independent inquiry into Islamophobia following more-than-weekly occurrences in the party last month. In these past four weeks alone, Conservative party representatives and candidates have called Islam “the new Nazism”, posted a picture of bacon on a door handle as a way to “protect your house from terrorism”, and shared an article that called Muslims “parasites” who “live off the state and breed like rabbits”. Muslim party members also reported casual racism linked to the religion, and conversations where it was heavily implied or overtly spelled out that to get ahead in the party, they had to shed as much of their Muslim identity as possible. This is now a pattern. Peter Oborne wrote last week that in his research over the years he has shown that it is impossible for a practising Muslim to make his or her way to the very top of the Tory party. Prejudices do not just land at the door of certain parties. They bubble upwards from some foundational corruption. There is a reason that the anti-Muslim bigotry that has developed over the last two decades nested on the right, and found a home in the Conservative party. There is an overlap between specific antipathy towards Muslims and general hostility towards immigration, a cornerstone Tory attitude. And there is a reason it has intensified under the auspices of today’s party. A nativist government tone sharpened after the Brexit vote and overtures to the far right have won over Ukip voters and even ex-BNP supporters. Just as antisemitism on the left arises from a warped, conspiratorial view of a world in which Jews are enablers of powerful interests that conspire against the weak, anti-Muslim prejudice on the right arises from an obsession with immigration gone haywire, hence Muslims are hordes, invaders, breeding like rabbits and changing the culture with their creeping sharia. Hate speech against Muslims also conveniently channels a racial element that on its own would meet with far more opprobrium. There are many fig leaves that cover the naked prejudice, such as: people have legitimate concerns about immigration; Muslims change the culture of a place far more than people of other religions do; is it so wrong for a nation to want to preserve its culture? A handy manual for this sort of obfuscation is Douglas Murray’s The Strange Death of Europe: a masterclass in how xenophobia can take on a respectable shape by sublimating prejudice towards Muslims – and by extension immigrants – into a legitimate cultural anxiety. But the biggest fig leaf of all is that, somehow, it is all just legitimate criticism of Islam, that no one really has an intrinsic problem with Muslims. There is not much value in arguing against this logic because it is a set-up. Those who have been grappling with the whole “Islam is not a race” diversion for a while now know that it is obvious that hate speech, mockery, calling for internment and damaging people’s employment prospects, as studies have found, is not a legitimate interrogation of a faith. The religion-not-race canard is a threadbare semantic excuse deployed cynically by those who know that, once the religion element is stripped away, all that is left is the racist bigotry. A party that engages in populist rhetoric against immigration, the party of the Windrush scandal and the “go home” vans, is the natural home for the politics of fear. Zac Goldsmith’s shameful smear campaign against Sadiq Khan still stands as its monument. On Sunday morning, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, dismissed the MCB’s claims, citing its supposedly “favourable comments” on extremists, and refusing to engage with the fact that senior Tories, journalists and junior party members have all made the same claims. This is deliberate strategy. Raise the spectre of extremism and just hope everyone moves on. Of course legitimate interrogation of Islam can be, and is often, mislabelled as anti-Muslim prejudice, just as legitimate interrogation of Israel is often mislabelled as antisemitism. But it really is not hard to also see that, just as antisemites use Israel to hide their prejudice against all Jews, anti-Muslim bigots use Islamic extremism to excuse theirs. But the similarity ends there when it comes to popular condemnation. The difference in the public outcry against Labour and Conservative failures to tackle effectively race and prejudice issues in their parties is telling. We have become inured to the sharpness of the tone against Muslims, because criticising Islam has lent a civilising comfort to those who just don’t like Muslims, and Islamophobia has been successfully twinned with immigration in the public consciousness. There will be precious few pundits calling for an inquiry or radio shows asking callers whether Theresa May is fit to lead a party whose members bully and stigmatise Muslims. There will be few voters at the ballot box who will shun the Tory party because it makes their fellow citizens feel unsafe. Pressure must continue to grow on May to tackle the problem, but the only way that can happen is if the cause is taken up by others, not just the MCB. The present situation says much about the Conservative party and the alarming direction in which rightwing politics is taking the country. We’re seeing Islamophobia not just popularised, but gentrified. • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/03/justin-trudeau-donald-trump-tariffs-insulting-us-canada-alliance","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T15:41:43Z","webTitle":"Trudeau calls Trump's tariffs 'insulting' to longstanding US-Canada alliance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/03/justin-trudeau-donald-trump-tariffs-insulting-us-canada-alliance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/03/justin-trudeau-donald-trump-tariffs-insulting-us-canada-alliance","fields":{"headline":"Trudeau calls Trump's tariffs 'insulting' to longstanding US-Canada alliance","bodyText":"Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, on Sunday described US tariffs as “insulting” to the shared history of the US and Canada as the fallout over Donald Trump’s tariff moves continued. Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press, Trudeau reiterated his appeal to President Trump to remember “there are no two countries that are as interconnected, interdependent … You sell more things to us every year than to UK, Japan, and China combined.” Later this week, Trump is due to visit Canada for the Trudeau-hosted G7 summit, which will take place at a remote luxury resort in La Malbaie, Quebec, and where he will meet with leaders of Germany, Italy, France, UK and Japan. Trudeau said on Sunday that he is having “a lot of trouble getting around” that Canada has abruptly become “a national security threat to the United States”. The Canadian prime minister went further, saying US and Canadian soldiers “who had fought and died together on the beaches of World War II, on the mountains of Afghanistan and have stood shoulder-to-shoulder in some of the most difficult places in the world, that are always there for each other, this is insulting to that.” Trudeau said the US has a $2bn surplus on steel with Canada, and the two countries are “very much aligned” on the issue of China. Speaking on CNN, the foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said Canada was “sad and insulted” to be labelled a national security threat. “I would say to our closest ally, please think hard about the message you are sending,” Freeland said. Freeland said Canada’s reciprocal tariffs, outlined last week, were “the strongest trade action Canada has taken since the second world war”. The tariffs would, she said, be a “dollar-for-dollar retaliation … this is going to hurt America and the American consumer first and foremost.” The White House economics adviser, Larry Kudlow, described the administration’s confrontation with Canada as a “family quarrel”. He told Fox News Sunday the situation could still be resolved through negotiations. “These tariffs may go on for a while or they may not,” he said. Speaking on Face The Nation,Governor John Kasich of Ohio said he was struck by how little push-back Trump had received from Republicans who consider themselves free-traders. “I have been frankly shocked at the fact that our leaders think they have to ask permission from the president to do anything. I think they ought to make it very clear that they’re not going to just sit back and tolerate this.” The administration’s actions also triggered unusual signs of division among the club of wealthy nations, with the six other G7 member countries issuing a statement calling on asking the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, to convey their “unanimous concern and disappointment” about the tariffs to Trump. The statement also called for “decisive action” to resolve the tariff dispute at a G7 leaders’ summit. But senior Republicans in Congress rejected the notion the US is headed toward a trade war. “I don’t think anybody wins a trade war. But we are not in a trade war,” the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, said on CNN’s State of the Union. “We are in a trade discussion to renegotiate Nafta.” Canada’s expressions of disappointment came as China warned that any trade dispute deals reached at talks in Beijing “will not take effect” if Trump’s threatened tariff hike on Chinese goods goes ahead. The statement came as Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, and China’s top economic official, Vice-Premier Liu He, wrapped up a meeting on Beijing’s pledge to narrow its trade surplus. Ross had said the delegations had discussed specific US exports China might purchase to ease the $337bn trade imbalance, but the talks ended with no joint statement and neither side released details. • This article was amended on 4 June 2018.

We have a plan to build a modern Britain","bodyText":"Brexit Britain is right. The status quo is insupportable. But the solution is not to leave the European Union. Our problems are made in Britain; they can only be solved in Britain. Europe does not impede this mission; rather it is indispensable. The imperative is to transform the way our country works. The poverty, inequalities and hopelessness that propelled the Brexit vote – seven out of the 10 poorest areas in northern Europe are in England, and all voted for Brexit – must be decisively addressed. Britain must simultaneously recommit to full EU membership as its benefits and the colossal costs of exit become ever clearer, and stand solidly with Europe as dark and menacing forces stalk the globe – not least an imminent transatlantic trade war and the wider threats of Donald Trump. To chase the economic moonbeams peddled by Brexiters while the values we prize are under global assault, to cower behind borders that shut out the rest of our continent, and to seek to resurrect an unachievable island sovereignty: this is a dead end that can only result in widespread suffering. That could even begin the day after Brexit next year, with widespread shortages of medicines, fuel and food as the port of Dover collapses with no Brexit deal – according to Whitehall departments’ risk assessments leaked and paraded in the Sunday Times yesterday. Brexiters dodge these truths. Intent on completing the Thatcher revolution, they want us out of the EU at any cost. While feigning concern for the state of Britain, their real agenda is wholly to embed a Thatcherite world of self-organising free markets and minimal social provision that will bring unalloyed benefit – whatever the baleful track record. They want out of Europe because it stands in their way. But two years after the referendum, the Brexiters’ “have your cake and eat it” fantasies have evaporated. There is no Brexit dividend, rather the prospect of dismal economic growth and tax rises. The extra £350m a week supposedly available for the NHS turns out not to exist and instead we have an exit bill of £39bn (and rising). Then there is the up to £20bn a year cost of observing customs obligations after Brexit – an avalanche of self-imposed red tape – along with as much or more again as UK organisations expensively relocate to the European mainland. Virtually no one still claims, as they did during the referendum campaign, that we can retain the economic benefits of EU membership while leaving the European customs union and the single market. The prospect of “quick and simple” trade deals outside the EU is now recognised as delusory, particularly with Trump’s protectionist US and Xi Jinping’s China. It is the “global” EU that already has the trade deals, either done or in the making, with at least 60 countries, including Canada, Japan and South Korea – which are all in jeopardy for the UK on Brexit day. The EU is the citadel of rules-based international free trade and the international standard-setter that Britain did so much to create – and at whose centre we stood. “Global Britain” is a chimera. The economic warnings are there for those prepared to see them. Inward investment has collapsed by some £130bn over the last 12 months. The car industry fears “Carmageddon”. There is no open-skies deal with the US. Being frozen out of the Galileo project endangers our space industry. Universities fear being cut out of EU research budgets. It is the same in sector after sector. Europe’s achievements have not been driven solely by an economic calculus: they belonged to a bigger, nobler cause of representing European values, rooted in democracy. This is why any form of Brexit is a mistake. We want to share a continent where Europeans don’t fight each other, don’t prevent trade and where we allow its people to live and work wherever they like across their region. Never has Europe been so peaceful, democratic and prosperous as in the era of the EU. But too much of Britain was hurting for it to hear this message, inflamed by fears over immigration. The 30 social mobility “coldspots” identified by the Social Mobility Commission all voted Brexit. So did areas where property prices were stuck, where life expectancy was falling, where antidepressants were widely prescribed and where life chances were thin. In too much of the UK beyond London and the south-east, economic performance is mediocre or downright bad. The social contract has become for many people effectively nonexistent. Unemployment may be at a 40-year low, but so are savings to maintain living standards: insecure, poorly paid work is at a record high. Real wages are 7% lower than they were at the time of the financial crisis – an unprecedented squeeze. Of course immigration seemed menacing. Saving Britain is a twin-pronged task: transforming our economy and society so they work for all while recommitting to an EU that covers our backs better than we know. Today’s laissez-faire, sink-or-swim approach to economics and society has to end; instead our hijacked capitalism must be populated with repurposed businesses, motivated by a desire to produce goods and services that better humanity. New technology needs to be mobilised for the public good, while great institutions that serve the mass of people – such as trade unions, public-benefit companies to run utilities and building societies – must be reinvigorated and reshaped. A refashioned social contract should invest public money where desperately needed and raise the necessary taxes fairly. The centrepiece should be an educational Marshall plan. Part of this contract should be a stronger notion of citizenship, including a national identity card system to assure citizens that we know exactly who is here and what they are entitled to. A Great Charter for Modern Britain would hand power from Westminster to the cities, towns and counties of Britain so as to transform their localities, represented in a senate to replace the House of Lords, located in the north of England. This should be the foundation of a fully fledged written constitution. It is the Labour party – firmly pro-European and credible in its commitment to social reform – that could rally the country. The present policy of colluding in Brexit, while trying to make sure it is a Tory-authored disaster, will impose unnecessary suffering on too many. The great power of democracy is that citizens can change their minds as facts change: the Brexit refusal to countenance a second vote on grounds of its divisiveness is born of fear that the people will reassess their decision. The worse divisiveness is to press on regardless. Great countries find the political resource to turn around epic mistakes. The Labour party has the chance to save Britain, stand by Europe at a critical juncture in world affairs and form a great reforming government. It is an opportunity that must be seized. • Saving Britain by Will Hutton and Andrew Adonis is published by Abacus, price £8.99.

After consultations across business and politics, a report from Open Europe concludes: “There is no strong business case for immediate significant divergence from the EU’s regulatory regime.” It says adherence to EU standards would not restrict growth in the export of British goods outside the EU. The report says the proposed “enhanced mutual recognition agreement would mean most goods manufactured by in one country would be considered pre-authorised for sale across others”. The proposal will anger many Eurosceptic MPs, but Open Europe – a thinktank that in the past has provided some of Downing Street’s most senior policy European analysts – says the government has to shift position both to unlock the polarised political debate and to meet demands clearly expressed by British business. The proposal will be taken as another sign that the tide of opinion is shifting away from a free trade deal in which the UK gains little access to EU markets in return for the right to full regulatory divergence. The Open Europe compromise has strict limits since it suggests the UK should be free to regulate itself in services – the bulk of the UK economy – and should not accept a customs union or a common external tariff. It also suggests the UK could be allowed to decide for itself whether it wishes to accept new EU regulations in goods, so long as it acknowledges that rejection of such new regulations would limit future UK market access. The paper assumes that the UK will negotiate a standstill agreement until December 2020 in which the UK maintains all of its obligations and market access but plays no role in setting rules. However, a long-term willingness to accept EU rules in the field of goods would require a greater role for the European court of justice, or at least a judicial dispute resolution mechanism informed by the ECJ rulings, and would also set limits on the UK’s ability to negotiate its own free trade deals. The compromise will be seen as significant step forward by European business leaders, many of whom are due to meet Theresa May on Monday in Downing Street. The proposal is largely endorsed by the Eurosceptic former chancellor Norman Lamont in a foreword to the pamphlet. “There is an argument that Britain could commit to preserving the existing body of EU rules and regulations on goods,” he writes. “Business has already adjusted their systems to make products to meet these requirements.” The pamphlet’s authors say: “Giving up some control – or sovereignty – over goods regulation is a price worth paying for strong market access. Manufacturers in highly regulated industries often follow EU rules anyway, in some cases even in the US. “The debate at the moment is polarised between hardline leavers who refuse to accept giving up any sovereignty whatever the economic costs, and extreme remainers who want to either reverse the referendum result or at least recreate the entire structures of the EU from the outside. This is not where business or the public are. A sensible compromise recognises that giving up a little sovereignty can deliver good economic benefits, but there are diminishing returns in asking for more.” The detailed talks over a future trading relationship are due to be held at a June meeting of the EU council, but the run-up to the meeting has been overshadowed by the inability of the UK government to come up with an agreed proposal on the Northern Ireland border. Open Europe claims its compromise should be welcomed in Brussels since the EU already allows countries such as Switzerland and Ukraine very high levels of access to the single market in goods, in return for their broadly following the EU rules. The report says a twin-track trading strategy for goods and services is justified by the trade flow figures. In 2016 the EU accounted for around 48% of UK goods exports, with the EU representing by far the UK goods industries’ most important export market. The bulk of this trade is in motor vehicles and parts, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and computing, electronic and electrical products. All of this trade is already highly integrated with European supply chains. By contrast, only 32% of UK services are exported to the EU, and a system of regulatory equivalence would be sufficient in most areas."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/03/barnaby-joyce-says-he-knew-he-would-have-to-step-down-after-pregnancy-revealed","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T22:03:30Z","webTitle":"Barnaby Joyce 'knew he would have to step down over pregnancy'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/03/barnaby-joyce-says-he-knew-he-would-have-to-step-down-after-pregnancy-revealed","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/03/barnaby-joyce-says-he-knew-he-would-have-to-step-down-after-pregnancy-revealed","fields":{"headline":"Barnaby Joyce 'knew he would have to step down over pregnancy'","bodyText":"Barnaby Joyce has revealed he campaigned to hold the seat of New England for the government during last year’s byelection in the full knowledge he would have to stand down as leader of the National party and deputy prime minister – yet he repeatedly refused to disclose any details about his private life. Joyce’s partner, Vikki Campion, also accused unnamed people in the National party – identified during a television interview aired on Sunday night only as “they” and “conservatives” – of attempting to pressure her to terminate her pregnancy, advising her if she refused “they’re going to come after you”. She said she had contemplated having a termination, but could not go through with it. Joyce caused a political storm by accepting a payment from the Seven Network of $150,000 for the interview. Joyce went on medical leave last week in the middle of the furore, amid growing speculation about his future in politics. The couple refused to answer questions during the interview about precisely when their relationship started and Joyce shut down questions about a public confrontation between Campion and his former wife of two decades, Natalie. Joyce was not asked when it was that he revealed the relationship to colleagues in the government. But Joyce said more than once in the interview that as soon as he was aware Campion was pregnant “I knew the day would come where I’d have to step down”. Despite being aware of that eventuality, he did not publicly disclose the relationship nor the pregnancy during last year’s byelection contest despite being questioned repeatedly by journalists about his private life. The first time Joyce acknowledged publicly that his marriage had ended was during the debate on legalising same-sex marriage after he defended the seat for the government last year. On Sunday night he criticised Malcolm Turnbull for being publicly critical of his conduct, and acknowledged that he hung on to the leadership of the Nationals in part out of “spite” when the controversy about his relationship with Campion sent the government into a crisis this year. He said he was much more concerned about the impact of the relationship and the pregnancy on his former wife and their four daughters than he was about the political consequences of his actions. “To be quite frank, I couldn’t give a shit about the political ramifications, really,” he said. Joyce attempted to shield his partner from responsibility for the breakdown in his marriage by noting “I’m the adult”. There was a brief pause before she noted: “I am an adult too.” Joyce was also contradicted by Campion when he recounted his decision to tell a journalist it was a “grey area” whether or not he was the biological father of Campion’s son. Joyce said his observation was “actually a decision we made together”. Campion begged to differ: “I didn’t say use the words grey area. “Uh, I was ... I was deeply hurt by the grey area headline. Definitely”. Government colleagues were bracing for the political impact of the interview. Joyce has been the subject of speculation about his political future. Last week the person who replaced Joyce, Michael McCormack, told the Conversation whether he would contest the next election was “a matter for him and that’ll be a matter for the National party in New England”. “That’ll be a matter for a branch to nominate him and then that’ll be a matter for the branch members in New England as to whether or not they decide if he nominates or if anybody else nominates,” he said. “Then it becomes a preselection process as to who they think would best represent them going forward.” The Seven Network program performed disappointingly in the ratings, with only 631,000 viewers in capital cities. More people watched the ABC’s Mystery Road, Masterchef on Channel Ten and The Voice on Nine."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/03/unions-criticise-lack-of-wheelchair-access-on-major-train-route","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T13:19:12Z","webTitle":"Anger as wheelchair users left unable to ride trains on major route","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/03/unions-criticise-lack-of-wheelchair-access-on-major-train-route","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/03/unions-criticise-lack-of-wheelchair-access-on-major-train-route","fields":{"headline":"Anger as wheelchair users left unable to ride trains on major route","bodyText":"Wheelchair users will not be allowed to travel on a third of trains on a major route in northern England this summer following the temporary reintroduction of 45-year-old carriages. The main rail workers’ union accused TransPennine Express (TPE) of flouting disability discrimination legislation and in effect operating a heritage railway by bringing back into service Mark 3 trains that were built in the 1970s for British Rail. Documents leaked to the Disability News Service show that wheelchairs will not be able to travel on 12 of the 34 hourly services to and from Liverpool and Scarborough via Manchester Victoria, Huddersfield, Leeds and York. The documents say there will be “no space on the train for wheelchairs” and that “the trains will run without wheelchair or cycle provision”. If a wheelchair user wants to board a service that is using the Mark 3 coaches, they will be told to catch the next available accessible train instead. If two consecutive trains are inaccessible, TPE will pay for a taxi to their destination. A leading disability rights campaign group said it hoped a wheelchair user would take TPE to court. The rail company admitted to Disability News Service that the arrangement was “not ideal”. It said it had to reintroduce the carriages because using the Mark 3 coaches was part of its franchise agreement with the Department for Transport (DfT) and Rail North, which represents transport authorities across northern England. A TPE spokeswoman said it was “part of our franchise agreement to introduce these extra coaches into operation to provide additional capacity on the network ahead of the introduction of new trains”. By 2020 Mark 3s will be banned because their slam-doors, small toilets, low-back seats and grab rails all fail to meet the specifications of disability access regulations. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), said: “British private train companies are ripping up disability discrimination legislation as they go along.” He accused TPE of “turning the clock back on progress that has been made”. Philip Connolly, the policy director of Disability Rights UK, said: “It’s an unacceptably shoddy offer. Disabled people should have the same access to transport as anyone else. You expect things to get better, not worse. We would hope that a disabled person would take TPE to court and challenge this move, however temporary it may be. Temporary measures should still meet the needs of disabled people.” Wheelchair users are already very poorly served by trains in northern England and unable to easily board any of the dozens of the Pacer trains in operation across the region. Pacers, which are were converted from bus chassis, are due to be replaced with 98 new trains at the end of the year. An RMT spokesman said: “These train companies are effectively operating a heritage railway, using old rolling stock that went out of fashion when Slade were in the charts.” The news came as rail users across northern England braced themselves for yet more train misery as Northern Rail, TPE’s rival operator, decided to cancel 165 daily services until the end of July from Monday. For the next two weeks there will be no trains on the Lakes line to and from Preston, Lancaster and Oxenholme. A replacement bus service will be in operation. There are further cancellations to and from Blackpool, Blackburn, Southport and other northern towns. A two-month closure of Liverpool Lime Street will compound the disruption. Northern Rail said the interim timetable would enable it to start to stabilise service levels over the next few weeks and begin to reduce the number of last-minute cancellations. James Taylor, the head of policy and campaigns at the disability charity Scope, said: “This is extremely disappointing. Public transport is vital for disabled people to get to work, see family and engage in their local community. “Disabled people already face too many unnecessary barriers to travel and shouldn’t be treated as second-class citizens. Life costs more if you are disabled, and the prospect of being forced to use taxis is totally unfair and unnecessary.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/03/el-capitan-two-climbers-die-in-fall-from-yosemite-rock-face","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T05:07:47Z","webTitle":"El Capitan: two climbers die in fall from Yosemite rock face","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/03/el-capitan-two-climbers-die-in-fall-from-yosemite-rock-face","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/03/el-capitan-two-climbers-die-in-fall-from-yosemite-rock-face","fields":{"headline":"El Capitan: two climbers die in fall from Yosemite rock face","bodyText":"Two US climbers reportedly training for a speed ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite national park, northern California, died in a fall at the weekend. Jason Wells, 46, and Tim Klein, 42, fell at about 8.15am on Saturday while scaling the so-called Freeblast route of the granite rock formation, the US National Park Service said. It is the third serious incident involving speed ascents of the granite monolith into the last year, prompting at least one local expert to question the practice. The pair, experienced climbers in their 40s, had climbed El Capitan many times before and were reported to have been training for a speed ascent of it. The two men were climbing using a system popular with speed climbers and some alpinists called “simul” – or simultaneous – climbing. Unlike conventional roped ascents where one climber is attached at regular interval points and anchors the lead climber as he places equipment to secure the rope against uncontrolled falls, in simul climbing both climbers move together at the same speed with the rope between them. Using the technique, there is a far greater risk that if either climber falls then the other will also fall. The method is favoured for speed ascents, including informal speed records, as both climbers are moving together with neither needing to stop and belay the lead climber, but it requires expertise, confidence and often knowledge of the climb. El Capitan, which looms 900 metres (3,000ft) above the floor of Yosemite valley, is one of the best-known landmarks in the national park. The incident occurred days after the climbers Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell set a new speed record for El Capitan’s Nose route, one of the world’s best known rock climbs, completing a climb that typically takes about six days in two hours and 10 minutes. Last month Hans Florine, who has held multiple speed records for climbs on the face, broke both of his legs while attempting a one-day ascent of the Nose. Another climber, Quinn Brett, fell more than 100ft on the Nose during a speed ascent, leaving her paralysed. “I’ve been worrying about this speed game for a while. The faster you go the more dangerous it is,” Ken Yager, the founder of the Yosemite Climbing Association, told Climbing magazine this weekend. “I understand the attraction of it, but [speed climbing is] a lot different than what we did here 30 or 40 years ago, and what we did then was plenty dangerous. With speed climbing you don’t have time to double-check your systems. It’s all fun and games until you lose a party like this. It’s horrible.” A British climber was killed and his wife was badly injured in September 2017 during a rockslide while on El Capitan. More than 100 climbing accidents occur in Yosemite each year, and 51 climbers died from traumatic injuries in the park between 1970 and 1990, according to the park service."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/02/italy-populism-election-2018-five-star-movement","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-02T23:05:31Z","webTitle":"New Italian government: little regard is paid to what voters really think | Roberto Saviano","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/02/italy-populism-election-2018-five-star-movement","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/02/italy-populism-election-2018-five-star-movement","fields":{"headline":"New Italian government: little regard is paid to what voters really think","bodyText":"Italy is like a house in which for years there have been leaks that nobody noticed, a house that could suddenly collapse. That suddenly, but inevitably, collapses. To understand what has happened, we must first take on board that establishment politics has taken its own stability, as well as its ability to contain discontent, for granted. As the Italian house collapsed, these politicians have continued to demonstrate arrogance and contempt in the face of people’s fears and the progressive impoverishment of the nation, and especially of the south. The government “experts” have given up seeking genuine communication with people – to such an extent that we currently find ourselves wondering what happened to the now threadbare relationship of trust between the elite and the people, politicians and voters. Over recent years, governments have responded to popular unease by attempting to redistribute some of the resources, but this was seen as nothing more than handouts to people, so as to take on populist parties on their own turf. The unspoken message went: “Be good and you, too, will be able to grab a few crumbs.” But the time for handouts is over and this behaviour has only increased support for the Lega and the Five Star Movement (M5S), both of which promised to “give back what had been wrongfully taken away”. What we are seeing today stems from what happened yesterday. It didn’t come from nowhere, like some unexpected meteorite. Similarly, what happens tomorrow depends on how far we can really get a grip on what is happening now. The fact that even now, despite everything, scant consideration is given to the choices made by people, and the reasons underlying those choices, is revealed by the attitude taken to M5S and Lega voters. It’s identical to that adopted towards those who voted for Silvio Berlusconi in the past and constitutes an air of superiority which assumes people have been conned without realising it. But there has been no con trick, either now or before; just discontent that is no longer manageable. And if there is no specific project for growth for the south of Italy in the Lega-M5S manifesto, it’s also true that politics at the national level long ago gave up the south as a lost cause. At the election in March, the promise that paid off best was the reddito di cittadinanza, the minimum income for citizens, which tackled the impoverishment compounded by the crisis of the past 10 years by promising a return to the era of welfare policies for the south. The real question now will be to see if whoever governs in the coming years has a proper plan for preventing Italy’s south taking a nosedive. Because if it collapses, then the national settlement goes to the wall. (And the south does not help itself with declarations and promises about tackling mafias and corruption with an iron fist: instead, it should devise a robust, investment-friendly business framework.) As all this plays out, political Europe barely seems to exist. Each nation state plays its cards regardless of, and often to the detriment of, the others with whom it shares the same currency. The Italian political class bears considerable responsibility for the situation, but the failure of European leadership and the triumph of national selfishness are the fundamental problems. It is also true, of course, that in desperate situations there is nothing better than an external scapegoat. Europe is an excellent scapegoat, especially if one plays upon the increased cost of living after the introduction of the single currency, which has not led to a corresponding rise in wages. Europe’s interference will be blamed in the event of a failure to apply the two mainstays of the new government’s contract with the people: a minimum income for citizens (M5S) and flat tax (Lega). It will be easy for the “Government of Change”, which is what the Lega and the M5S call its creation, to make a suffering and impatient electorate believe that its path is blocked by an arch-enemy – Europe. The hope is that it will still be possible to prove the opposite through facts – that Europe, with all its problems, is now the only house in which it is still possible to grow. It was with these reflections in mind that I reread the Ventotene Manifesto, a 1941 call for a united Europe. The one thing that struck me more than any other was the concern expressed by its authors, European founding father Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi, about people’s possible unease over such a project and how to avoid its being exploited for political ends. “Reactionary forces […] in critical moments will masquerade and proclaim their love of freedom, peace, the general wellbeing and the poorer classes. We have already seen how in the past they sneaked in behind popular movements and then paralysed, diverted and converted them into the exact opposite. They will, without any doubt, be the most dangerous force that we will have to come to terms with.” These words were written nearly 80 years ago, but they seem to describe what has taken place in Italy in the past few weeks between the Lega and the M5S – or, to put it better, between a reactionary force (the Lega) that has swallowed up a popular movement (the M5S). I was put in mind of the words of Beppe Grillo, the founder of M5S, who, on more than one occasion over the years, has emphasised that the very existence of M5S – accused by many of itself being a populist party – made it a bulwark against the most dangerous populist excesses, such as those demonstrated by Matteo Salvini’s Lega. Never has an analysis been more mistaken.

In a stark sign of the frustration among prominent Brexit supporters over the government’s handling of negotiations with the EU, Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who backed the Leave campaign, said he believed the environment secretary had the skills to make a success of Britain’s exit and appeal to voters. Odey, whose most recent donation to the Conservative party was a £50,000 gift before last year’s general election, said the government needed to be far bolder in its attitude to Brussels. It should be learning from the new Italian populist coalition government, which has plans that would defy EU rules on debt, he said, suggesting that Britain should start breaching EU rules by pursuing policies such as signing trade deals. He also backed a change in leadership. “We’ve got to have that self-confidence to make breaches,” he told the Observer. “There’s no point in voting for freedom if you don’t know what to do when you’re free. What is true is that you have a whole lot of people who didn’t want this to happen who are in charge of it happening. “I would go to Gove. He’s the only minister who is still being a minister. Michael has got lots of attributes that make him a non-traditional Tory. He is very aware that he has to appeal not just to the wealthy, but also more broadly. I don’t think May can carry Brexit through any more.” He added: “Italy has confronted the EU – they’ve said they will go ahead and be in breach of its rules. “We should say, ‘we’ve got to have life after this, so we’re creating that life. We are creating trade agreements which are in breach of everything, because we won’t be in breach by the time you come to take us to court’. That’s how Elizabeth I would have been leading with this.” His backing for Gove risks reigniting the Tory debate about May’s leadership, with some Brexiters worried that Britain could end up being locked into a customs union with the EU that would prevent it pursuing an independent trade policy. In reality, few Tory MPs want an unpredictable leadership election which could further destabilise the party. However, a challenge to May’s leadership could emerge should pro-Brexit MPs conclude there is a better alternative. Gove was one of the figureheads of the successful Vote Leave campaign. His botched attempt to succeed David Cameron in 2016 saw him widely condemned by Tory MPs for betraying Boris Johnson, whose leadership bid he had been supporting. He was then sacked from the frontbench by May. However, he has been enjoying something of a renaissance since returning to the cabinet as environment secretary last year. “No other politician could have made such an impact in that job,” said an ally. A source close to Gove said the environment secretary was “fully supportive of the prime minister and will continue to be so”. He added: “He believes it’s vital we get behind our prime minister to deliver the Brexit 17.4 million people voted for.” Odey, who has also donated to Ukip in the past, said he believed that May was a gifted technocrat, but questioned her handling of Brexit. “The European Union are not good at hitting a moving ball,” he said. “The problem is, Theresa May is not good at hitting a moving ball, either. “As someone said about May, she should have joined the civil service, rather than becoming a politician. She is perfect for that, but she can’t make a decision. So there is no leadership. “We should be reaching out to Italy. We should be saying that we have so many of the same problems.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/03/sloane-stephens-madison-keys-cruise-french-open-quarters","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T17:54:24Z","webTitle":"Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys cruise into French Open quarters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/03/sloane-stephens-madison-keys-cruise-french-open-quarters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/03/sloane-stephens-madison-keys-cruise-french-open-quarters","fields":{"headline":"Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys cruise into French Open quarters","bodyText":"A happy Sloane Stephens is a dangerous player, so when she reached the quarter-finals, a feat she has now achieved in each grand slam, on Sunday by beating the in-form No25 seed Anett Kontaveit, 6-2, 6-0 in 50 minutes, she declared it “super cool”. This is a place that generally makes the American smile, she has reached the fourth round five times in seven visits. “I have always played well here,” she added. “I have never had a bad year here. I have lost to some really great players [Sam Stosur in 2012, Maria Sharapova in 2013, on her way to the final, and Serena Williams, when she won the title in 2015].” There was good reason for more celebration on Sunday, as she reflected on a run of four solid wins. Only the Italian Camila Giorgi has pushed her to three sets, but the No10 seed is looking in the sort of form that lifted her to a breakthrough US Open title last year, when she beat Madison Keys in the final. Her compatriot went through to the second week, too, on a warm Sunday afternoon, way too good for the No31 seed Mihaela Buzarnescu. She took 65 minutes to win 6-1, 6-4 and advance to a quarter-final against Yulia Putintseva, who added Barbora Strycova to a list of prey that includes Johanna Konta from the first round. The Americans could meet in the semi-finals, which would please both of them no end. “She’s playing well,” Stephens said. “She’s the only person I actually watch because I will be texting her during the match: ‘Come on, what are you doing?’ In a slam she really gets up, so she’s going to make whoever she plays play. That’s what’s great about Maddy.” Keys spoke afterwards about her waning mistrust of clay. “I like it a little bit more now. It’s always easier to like it when you’re in the quarter-finals though. Even though it’s still not my favourite surface, I definitely feel more comfortable on it. This year I have been finding the balance of being more patient but also playing my game. That’s the biggest thing: remembering how I like to play tennis, but maybe adding a couple more shots to each rally.” Keys, too, has now completed a clean sweep of reaching quarter-finals at each grand slam. She said: “[The French] was always the toughest one to feel like I could play well.” There was very little wrong with her tennis on Sunday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"society/2018/jun/04/taking-aspirin-with-acid-reducers-can-slow-advance-of-esophogeal-cancer","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T23:01:29Z","webTitle":"Taking aspirin with acid reducers can slow advance of esophogeal cancer","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/04/taking-aspirin-with-acid-reducers-can-slow-advance-of-esophogeal-cancer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/jun/04/taking-aspirin-with-acid-reducers-can-slow-advance-of-esophogeal-cancer","fields":{"headline":"Taking aspirin with acid reducers can slow advance of esophogeal cancer","bodyText":"Taking aspirin with acid reducers can help patients with chronic acid reflux slow the advance of cancer of the esophagus, the tube from the throat to the stomach, a new study has found. The study looked at patients with Barrett’s esophagus, damage to the lower portion of the tube usually caused by stomach acid, which is considered a precancerous condition. People who complain of acid reflux are 10 times more likely to develop Barrett’s esophagus, and patients with Barrett’s are at a 50-fold risk of developing esophageal cancer. “Based on these data, we believe people with heartburn should talk with their doctor about their risk of Barrett’s esophagus,” said lead study author Dr Janusz Jankowski, deputy vice-chancellor at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland. He added: “But they should not self-medicate with these medications.” The research was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the largest gathering of cancer doctors in the world. Esophageal cancer is rare compared with other diseases, such as breast or prostate cancer, but nevertheless has ticked upward over the last three decades. Each year, 9,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with the disease, and 7,900 die because of it. Esophageal cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death for British men and sixth most common for British women, according to research from Cambridge in 2014. Barrett’s esophagus is believed to occur in 2% of western adults, and esophageal cancer occurs within 2% of that population, researchers said. “The risk of esophageal cancer weighs on patients with Barrett’s esophagus. This low-cost, over-the-counter regimen seems to be a win-win, delaying or preventing cancer and with little to no side effects,” said ASCO expert Andrew Epstein. “It’s an approach people with Barrett’s should consider and discuss with their doctors.” However, Epstein cautioned against broadly interpreting the study. “Should anyone with heartburn, even if its long-term heartburn do this? No, the data do not bear that out,” he said. “These data definitely need to be treated with caution.” Researchers looked at whether adding aspirin to the acid reducing medication would benefit patients with Barrett’s esophagus, in an effort to prevent the aggressive treatment often recommended for the cancer. Researchers followed a randomized group of 2,563 patients from Canadian and British hospitals for a median of nearly nine years. Of those parents, 313 developed cancer, worsened Barrett’s, or died. The participants received either 20 or 40 milligrams of Nexium twice daily, taken with or without aspirin. Researchers then studied whether patients developed esophageal cancer, worsened Barrett’s Esophagus, or if they died. Researchers determined that a high dose of acid suppressant was superior to a low dose, and that taking aspirin with the high dose proton pump inhibitors showed a 20% overall risk reduction. Currently, doctors treat Barrett’s esophagus by monitoring the condition with frequent endoscopies, a way to look at and biopsy the esophagus with a camera. Researchers said this approach has a “modest effect” on esophageal cancer, and is only “supported by low quality evidence”. “The bottom line is if you have Barrett’s esophagus, you probably ought to be on high-grade acid suppression therapy, maybe with aspirin,” said Dr Richard L Schilsky, senior vice-president and chief medical officer of ASCO. “The incremental benefit of aspirin was small but significant.” However, scientists said more research is needed, noting that most of the participants in the study were white, and that the number of countries in which research occurred was limited. Further, although the side effects of aspirin and acid reducers are mild compared to aggressive surgical or chemotherapy treatments for esophageal cancer, there are still side effects. Patients sometimes experience diarrhea with acid reducers, and aspirin can cause bleeding. As well, long-term use of acid reducing proton pump inhibitors is associated with adverse side effects including increased risk of dementia."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/03/sebastian-gorka-oxford-union-links-far-right-groups","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T16:26:03Z","webTitle":"Sebastian Gorka, former aide to Donald Trump, to speak at Oxford Union","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/03/sebastian-gorka-oxford-union-links-far-right-groups","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/jun/03/sebastian-gorka-oxford-union-links-far-right-groups","fields":{"headline":"Sebastian Gorka, former aide to Donald Trump, to speak at Oxford Union","bodyText":"Sebastian Gorka, a former aide to Donald Trump and an ex-editor at rightwing website Breitbart, has been invited to speak at the Oxford Union, it was announced on Sunday. Gorka, a hardliner on immigration and terrorism, is scheduled to address the university debating society on 7 June. The Hungarian American intelligence analyst resigned as a White House foreign policy adviser in August last year amid pressure over allegations of links to Hungarian far-right groups. In a press release on Sunday, the Oxford Union, which is mainly run by students, said Gorka had risen to “prominence as deputy assistant to President Trump and a committed defender of the president’s foreign policy initiatives”. It added that he resigned becasue he “believed that White House officials had begun to undermine the ‘Make America Great Again’ platform”. Gorka, a former ex-Fox News counter-terrorism analyst, had initially been asked by the Trump administration to sit on the short-lived strategic initiatives group, a panel created by Steve Bannon. Gorka was unable to get clearance for the national security council after he was charged in 2016 with carrying a weapon at Ronald Reagan airport in Washington. Gorka, who is in his late 40s, was born in London to Hungarian parents who had fled during the country’s 1956 failed anti-Soviet revolution. His wearing of a medal awarded to his father by the Hungarian group Vitezi Rend – or Order of Heroes – at Trump’s inaugural ball raised eyebrows, as the group, which was anti-Soviet, has been linked by some to Nazi colluders. Gorka later reportedly defended wearing the medal. He said it was in memory of his family and what they suffered “under the Nazis and under the communists”. His links to the Vitezi Rend as well as other ties to the Hungarian right had come under scrutiny before his White House departure. Prior to immigrating to the United States, Gorka had mounted an unsuccessful political career in Hungary and, in doing so, once expressed support for a far-right militia in the country. The Oxford Union was founded in 1823 and has hosted prominent political and otherwise prominent figures over the years, including Winston Churchill, Mother Theresa and former US presidents Jimmy Carter, Reagan and Bill Clinton. Some of its guests, including OJ Simpson, have prompted controversy for being invited."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/03/england-pakistan-second-test-day-three-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T15:45:41Z","webTitle":"Dom Bess picks up maiden Test wickets as England beat Pakistan by an innings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/03/england-pakistan-second-test-day-three-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/03/england-pakistan-second-test-day-three-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Dom Bess picks up maiden Test wickets as England beat Pakistan by an innings","bodyText":"It is a pity there is no third Test. This one at Headingley was a mirror image of the match at Lord’s except this time England were the resounding victors as Pakistan were thoroughly outplayed. Thus the series ended at 1-1 after no more than six days’ play and it would be a brave person who could predict what would happen if they met again. No doubt England, after a thumping victory by an innings and 55 runs at Leeds, would be confident of prevailing but so they were before the first Test. Here everything went better than anticipated for selectors as well as players and punters. There was blistering strokeplay in the morning from Jos Buttler; he reached his half-century with a pull for six off Mohammad Abbas. It is debatable whether that came from the middle of his bat but the one he hit on to the rugby ground/ building site in the middle distance off Faheem Ashraf most certainly did. It was just as well that this was Sunday, when innocent construction workers were putting their feet up at home. Buttler was left on 80 not out and the rest of us were left wondering why convention had not been defied earlier by parachuting the white-ball king into the Test team. It is still early days in Buttler’s renaissance as a Test player but this is an experiment that must run and run. So England had a lead of 189 and by lunch Pakistan’s three senior batsmen were back in the pavilion. Then the youngsters, with a bit of help from old Chris Woakes, took centre stage with Dom Bess taking his first three Test wickets and Sam Curran, on his 20th birthday, chipping in. It may never be as gloriously simple for this fresh-faced pair but along with the return of Buttler they have brought zest and charm to a side that was in danger of stagnating. Along the way their naivety will be exposed now and again but there is no doubt that both of them are relishing being Test cricketers. The Pakistan batsmen were as hapless as England’s at Lord’s as they were bundled out for 134. First Azhar Ali, the senior man unable to show the way in this series, played all around a full‑length delivery from Jimmy Anderson. Then Haris Sohail punched a drive in the air from the middle of his bat to the left of mid-off. Stationed in this vicinity was Bess, who dived, stuck out a large left hand and it was there that the ball magically resided, a superb catch beyond the capacity of most English off-spinners of my experience. This is not the first time that Bess has had onlookers gasping at his capacity to conjure wickets in the field. Then Asad Shafiq was given out on review when feathering a leg-side catch off Stuart Broad so that Pakistan were creaking at 48 for three at lunch. There were 45 minutes of tranquillity after the break when the pitch had a little doze, and Imam-ul-Haq and Usman Salahuddin were suitably watchful against the old firm. Now Root gave Bess his first bowl of the match. To his first ball Imam skipped down the track and pummelled the ball straight for four; he opted to block the last ball of the over, missed it and was lbw in the modern manner after reviewing unsuccessfully. So the irrepressible Bess had registered his first Test wicket. Out came Sarfraz Ahmed oozing gung-ho aggression in response to an almost hopeless cause. He, too, cracked his first ball from Bess to the boundary and then crunched drives against the pacemen at the fielders before he was palpably lbw to Woakes, whose return to Test cricket was only marred by having to leave the field with “tightness to his right quad”. Next Shadab Khan succumbed to Curran, caught at slip by Alastair Cook, a more conventional mode of dismissal than the left‑armer’s first wicket in Test cricket. Now Root could happily fiddle around with his quintet of bowlers amid minimal resistance. The batsmen swung and the fielders unerringly took their catches. Both Faheem Ashraf and Salahuddin holed out against Bess, who ended up with three for 33, and then Stuart Broad returned to mop up the tail to give him match figures of six for 66. So are we any wiser? For many the conclusion after Lord’s was that Trevor Bayliss as coach was obviously a complete duffer on the verge of losing his job so, after this remarkable resurrection, is he now a minor genius? Of course both these conclusions are way wide of the mark. There must be relief for Root and the rest of the England camp at their first win in nine Tests. The players have atoned for that horrible performance at Lord’s. The rehabilitation of Buttler is an obvious and intriguing plus and the blooding of the two uncluttered 20‑year‑olds, Bess and Curran, has added sparkle to the team. They have so much to learn but they are hungry to do that. They are not tailor-made solutions and they will not necessarily be regulars from here onwards; the old pros will query Curran’s lack of pace and Bess’s rawness as a bowler on flat pitches but this was hardly the day to dwell upon that. In the meantime the sharing of 11 wickets by Broad and Anderson has provided their most eloquent argument for staying in the team together. But this is nothing more than a start to the rehabilitation of England’s Test team. There is now a two-month hiatus. Come 1 August and for the next Test the pitch (at Edgbaston) will probably be flatter and the opposition (India) more formidable, but in the intervening period we are at least spared a constant feeling of foreboding."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/03/golden-state-warriors-cleveland-cavaliers-nba-finals-game-2-live-scores","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T02:51:03Z","webTitle":"Golden State Warriors 122-103 Cleveland Cavaliers: NBA finals Game 2 – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/03/golden-state-warriors-cleveland-cavaliers-nba-finals-game-2-live-scores","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/03/golden-state-warriors-cleveland-cavaliers-nba-finals-game-2-live-scores","fields":{"headline":"Golden State Warriors 122-103 Cleveland Cavaliers: NBA finals Game 2 – as it happened","bodyText":"NBA Finals Game 2 report This game was why J.R.

The Cavaliers played a very good game tonight and it didn’t matter in the slightest. Now they’re down 0-2. They’re going to need all the home cooking they can get. That will do it for our live coverage of Game 2 of the NBA Finals. Hope you’ll join us for further NBA coverage here at the Guardian. Ciao! With his nine three-pointers, Steph Curry has set a new record for three-pointers in a NBA Finals game, something which is only shocking because I had just assumed that he had done it before. The Golden State Warriors have taken a 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals. Cavaliers 103-122 Warriors, FINAL LeBron James stomps off the court as the clock hits zero. The Golden State Warriors have won Game 2 of the NBA Finals Cavaliers 101-122 Warriors, 16.8 seconds, 4th quarter I start hitting the box score while the B-squad plays some utterly meaningless basketballl. Steph Curry scored 33 points. It feels like they were all in this fourth quarter. Cavaliers 95-118 Warriors, 2:40, 4th quarter And both teams empty their benches and I play a little game of “I had no idea this player was on this roster.” Zaza Pachulia gets two free throws for the Warriors for instance. Oh hey Jose Calderon, he can still make layups. Cavaliers 93-114 Warriors, 3:05, 4th quarter Steph Curry hits his ninth three-pointer of the game and that will do it for Curry’s night. Cavaliers 93-111 Warriors, 3:50, 4th quarter Out of the timeout, James pulls up for a jumper that doesn’t go in. Love manages to steal away a Steph Curry pass but his three-pointer doesn’t go in. This is not going to be his night, or any of his teammates’ night. Cavaliers 93-111 Warriors, 4:33, 4th quarter Durant makes a dunk. The Cavaliers take a timeout, but what do you even talk about at this point of the game? Cavaliers 93-109 Warriors, 5:44, 4th quarter LeBron gets to the line and makes both free throws. They’re gonna need to exploit the free throw line if they want to… Nevermind, it may not matter. Curry gets fouled as he makes another crazy-long three-pointer. Of course he makes the “and one:, Cavaliers 91-105 Warriors, 6:53, 4th quarter Kevin Durant makes a basket. The Cavaliers need to respond here. Jeff Green makes a basket, which is a start, but they can’t go trading those. Time is running out. Cavaliers 89-103 Warriors, 7:54, 4th quarter Out of the timeout, the Warriors show some beautiful ball movement that ends with Curry making a ridiculous three pointer right as the shot clock was about to expire. Holy heck, that might be the defining play of the game. Cavaliers 89-100 Warriors, 8:11, 4th quarter LeBron drives to the hoop and makes a layup. Golden State calls a time-out. Cavaliers 87-100 Warriors, 8:59, 4th quarter Jeff Green gets to the line, makes two free throws and, as you can probably guess, the Warriors score immediately afterwards, in this case Green tips in a missed Curry layup. Cavaliers 85-98 Warriors, 9:30, 4th quarter Kevin Love hits a layup out of the timeout, it quiets the crowd but only very briefly. Livingston gets to the rim with a layup. Email from “40-Year Old Man”: I think it’s pretty clear. Look at the statistics and LeBron has more assists than anyone else on in the building. Out of anyone he should be allowed to play more selfishly. LeBron’s team mates should be the best passers in the league that can bring out his strength. That’s what it takes to beat the Warriors, the full power of LeBron. Not even with LeBron AND Kevin Love, and even with Kyrie Irving too, three aces will never match a team of aces. LeBron leads in most aspects and he should have team mates that can get rebounds for him so he has more in the tank to score, and can pass so he can pull unbelievable plays and even amazing combo plays with his own passing skills, not be the sole player who can pass and apart from KL, the only one who can rebound. Thank you for your time. PS: Good work on today’s game, I enjoyed reading your thoughts. Cavaliers 83-96 Warriors, 10:11, 4th quarter Oh no. This is the last thing the Cavaliers wanted to see. Curry hits two straight three-pointers. Cleveland, wisely, calls for a timeout right then and there. Cavaliers 83-90 Warriors, 11:04, 4th quarter Steph Curry and Kendrick Perkins apparently got into it on the sidelines before in-between quarters. Sounds about right. After a few fruitless possessions by both sides, LeBron his a three-pointer to start the fourth quarter scoring. Cavaliers 80-90 Warriors, 12:00, 4th quarter I have no idea what exactly is going to happen in this fourth quarter, something which has been an all-too-rare experience during these playoffs. Cavaliers 80-90 Warriors, end of the 3rd quarter And after all of that, David West hits a three-pointer in the game’s last few seconds and it feels like naught. Oh, hey, Bell gives Cleveland a gift by fouling Kyle Korver, who hits the one free throw he’s awarded. The Warriors have a shot at getting the art shot, but Curry’s three is off-the-mark. Cavaliers 79-87 Warriors, 55.7, 3rd quarter Larry Nance is on the line for the Cavaliers, the more they can score and stop the clock at the same time the better things will get for them. Nance hits both of his. Cavaliers 77-87 Warriors, 2:00, 3rd quarter This feels less like a game than a type of afterlife torture issued by a jealous Greek deity. The Cavaliers are making play after play and yet it doesn’t seem like that Warriors lead is going down all that much. And even when they cut it down there comes Kevin Durant to push it right back to where it was before. Cavaliers 77-85 Warriors, 2:45, 3rd quarter This is getting into an All-Star Game Pace. After a made free throw for both teams, Love gets a layup off of a Jeff Green pass, LeBron makes a layup, Klay Thompson responds with a much-needed three for the Warriors. Cleveland takes a timeout. Cavaliers 73-80 Warriors, 4:23, 3rd quarter Draymond Green gets called for a foul, his first of the game I think? Weird. Love makes his free throws and then we get another stretch of great defense and/or no defense. It feels like the Cavs should be closer than they are. Cavaliers 68-74 Warriors, 6:28, 3rd quarter Tristan Thompson dunks, cutting the Warriors lead down to six, but only for a blink of an eye, as Jordan Bell makes a layup. Cavaliers 66-72 Warriors, 6:33, 3rd quarter George Hill knocks down a there-pointer, the Cavaliers could use a few more of those. JaVale makes a dunk, which is amusing, You’d think the Cavaliers would start to get discouraged but they’re answering every basket here, or at least LeBron is. He answers a Klay Thompson with a three-pointer of his own and the Warriors take a timeout. Cavaliers 56-66 Warriors, 9:37, 3rd quarter Kevin Durant gets to the line to give the Warriors their first points of the quarter at the free throw line. He knocks down both but the Cavaliers are counterpunching here, after some back and forth, including Durant and Love hitting three-pointers within seconds of each other. Cavaliers 51-59 Warriors, 11:02, 3rd quarter Tristan Thompson makes a layup, Kevin Love knocks down a three-pointer and the Cavaliers are coming out swinging. Cavaliers 46-59 Warriors, 12:00, 3rd quarter And we’ve entered the second half! Email from Gokul Kannan: Hunter,Newbie to NBA. This the fourth full match I am watching. The other three being the last 3 matches. It seems Lebron is in a team of ..Well..What team. There is no team. But if I am not mistaken, Stephen Curry seems to be the guy Warriors rely on the most. His three pointers...Take him out and warriors would be rolled over by Lebron. But please, let Lebron have a decent team. Messi can’t select who are born in Argentina, but Lebron can get decent teammates. I can’t really get over this situation. Probably I should read up some history on Well, this would look like a genuinely great team had they not traded Kyrie Irving, I believe (although not as great at LeBron’s old Miami Heat teams). As far as getting better teammates? Well, he might be looking into that come free agency. Well, the Cavaliers came out strong, which they needed to do. It didn’t look like the Game 1 gaffe was affecting their play. Against another opponent, maybe they have the lead but this is a Warriors team that seems to be working on all cylinders, so they’re down double digits. Cavaliers 46-59 Warriors, end of the 2nd quarter LeBron gets a basket and Kevon Looney misses his two free throws, so it’s not all bad for Cleveland, but it definitely feels like the Warriors are still heating up here and they have a 13 point lead to work with. Cavaliers 44-59 Warriors, 1:05, 2nd quarter Durant gets to line, going 2-for-2, and Curry hits his fourth three-pointer of the game. If he has that shot going, the Warriors are quite literally unbeatable. Cavaliers 44-54 Warriors, 2:04, 2nd quarter George Hill hits both free throws and the makes a layup on the next Cavaliers possession. LeBron makes a layup himself and it looks like the Cavaliers are going to cut the lead down to… Oh never mind, Curry hits a ridiculous three to end the Cleveland run. Cavaliers 38-51 Warriors, 3:13, 2nd quarter MCGEE WITH A DUNK! That was fun. Less fun, and more expected, Nick Young committing a foul, this one on George Hill. Warriors take a timeut. Cavaliers 38-49 Warriors, 4:20, 2nd quarter JaVale is in the game again and he scores, he’s up to six points now (yes, I’m definitely keeping track of this) and then he fouls LeBron (I’m also keeping track of that). LeBron hits one of his two free throws. Cavaliers 37-47 Warriors, 4:51, 2nd quarter So that’s a 7-0 run and the crowd is getting loud. The Cavaliers starters are now all back in the game, Tyronn Lue knows how big this moment will be for the Cavaliers. They need to be able to fight back. The Cavaliers can’t land a shot, but Tristan Thompson does draw the foul, the third one, on Klay Thompson. Tristan makes one of two free throws. Cavaliers 36-47 Warriors, 6:11, 2nd quarter So it looks like the Cavaliers have the momentum on their side now, so you know what that inevitably means, right? Yep. Time for a Warriors run. Livingston scores on two straight possessions, Curry hits a trademark three and Cleveland uses a timeout. Cavaliers 36-40 Warriors, 7:49, 2nd quarter Klay Thompson gets to line, makes one of two free throws. Love answers for Cleveland, with a basket of his own plus a free throw. Cleveland creeping back in. Cavaliers 33-39 Warriors, 8:14, 2nd quarter The Cavaliers come out, only to be challenged by the Warriors defense every step of the way until they run out of time and commit the shot clock violation. But that defense goes to waste as on the very next play George Hill steals the ball and hits a three-pointer. Cavaliers 30-39 Warriors, 9:12, 2nd quarter Remember how there was all that discussion about whether Klay Thompson would play tonight or not? Well, the Cavaliers are probably wishing that he took this one off. He hits his second three of the game… but doesn’t really though, the call is changed to a 2 pointer but it’s still enough to force the Cavs into taking a timeout. Cavaliers 30-37 Warriors, 10:02, 2nd quarter The little-loved Jordan Clarkson makes a layup, a lot of action around the basket in this game. Well, not for Durant though, he hits a ridiculously long three pointer that gets the fans to cheer and extends the Golden State lead. Cavaliers 28-34 Warriors, 11:17, 2nd quarter There’s a bit of back-and-forth before we get the first scoring of the second, it’s Durant with a mid-range jumper. Cavaliers 28-32 Warriors, 12:00, 2nd quarter Alright, let’s keep this going. This has been fun. Cavaliers 28-32 Warriors, end of the 1st quarter The Warriors put LeBron on the line where he makes both of his free throws. And now we’re in the “bench-warmers get theirs” portion of the quarter. Livingston scores for the Warriors, while Jeff Green scores for Cleveland. Klay Thompson has got a good look for a three at the buzzer, but it’s a bit off. Cavaliers 24-30 Warriors, 1:40, 1st quarter And LeBron hits a layup. Warriors need to respond here, and they do, both Curry and Shaun Livingston score. Cavaliers 22-26 Warriors, 2:53, 1st quarter And as soon as I say that this looks like a fun, well-played game, the free throws begin. Durant fouls LeBron, who gets one of two, Next time around, it’s Love’s turn. He hits both of his free throws, This is not what the Warriors should be doing with a lead. Cavaliers 19-26 Warriors, 3:32, 1st quarter Okay this is officially a fun, well-played basketball game. It feels like ages since I last could say that. LeBron finds Kevin Love for a jumper. On the Golden State side of things, Jordan Bell (in for JaVale) alley-oops a Draymond pass. Cavaliers 17-24 Warriors, 4:05, 1st quarter This game is going to end up being J.R. Smith vs JaVale McGee duel and it’s going to be the most hilarious Finals game in NBA history. Curry misses a three pointer. He misses, but he gets another shot at it in the next possession. He drills it. Cavaliers 17-21 Warriors, 4:34, 1st quarter Klay Thompson’s looking healthy enough, he gets off a long-range jumper that J.R. Smith immediately answers with a three. Golden State takes a timeout, their lead cut to four points. Cavaliers 14-19 Warriors, 6:00, 1st quarter Durant scores to extend the Golden State lead but Cleveland is starting to chip away. LeBron gets fouled making a layup. He gets to the line to complete an old fashioned three-pointer. Durant answers and J.R. Smith, working for redemption, hits a jumper that cuts the Warriors lead down to five points. Cavaliers 9-15 Warriors, 7:22, 1st quarter Cavaliers go 7-for-7. Is that good? Out of the timeout, Hill makes a three pointer and man did Cleveland need that. Cavaliers 6-15 Warriors, 8:14, 1st quarter Durant makes a layup, George Hill responds with one of his own. And it’s mostly All Warriors from thereon out, with the exception of a Tristan Thompson dunk. Everyone in the starting lineup is scoring and Cleveland can’t figure out a way to slow them down. They have to take a timeout early. Cavaliers 2-4 Warriors, 10:41, 1st quarter And JaVale giveth away, a goal-tend against him gives 2 points to LeBron, and the first points for the Cavaliers. Cavaliers 0-4 Warriors, 11:18, 1st quarter JaVale McGee gets two straight dunks to start the scoring. So Kerr’s lineup is already paying dividends. Cavaliers 0-0 Warriors, 12:00, 1st quarter And we’re off! I’m still laughing at the cheers for J.R. Warriors starters: Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, JaVale McGee, Klay Thompson, Steph Cury. Cavaliers starters: LeBron James, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, J.R. Smith (he gets ironic cheers from the Warriors fans), George Hill. My take on Santana’s “Star Spangled Banner?” It’s a hot one. It’s 8pm EST, which means that we’re going to get actual basketball shortly. I gotta think the Cavaliers are happier than anybody else on the planet. My number one rule when it comes to getting performers for the national anthem at a sporting event: unless you can bring Whitney Houston or Marvin Gaye back into the world of the living, just have someone to an instrumental version. So I’m psyched about this: My favorite prediction so far Predictions I’m saying: this is exactly what’s going to happen. LeBron will get his numbers but I don’t trust anyone else on this team. The Warriors are winning by double-digits tonight and the series very well might never return to Oracle. But that’s just a shot in the dark from me. What do you think? Feel free to send your predictions here either via email (hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or via Twitter (to @HunterFelt). The fact that JaVale McGee is in the starting lineup for the Golden State Warriors in Game 2 of the NBA Finals should be all you needed know about the foolishness of attempting to predict anything that happens in sports. Like ever. With that in mind, I think it’s pretty safe to say that if the Cavaliers want to have any hope of tying up the series before heading home, they’re going to have to have a great start. If they come unfocused or second guessing themselves, the Warriors are going to blow them out and this will be over a few minutes into the third quarter. Golden State Warriors starters Klay Thompson isn’t a 100% but he is in the starting lineup for the Warriors as is… (wait for it) JaVale McGee, who had one of his randomly great games back on Thursday. He’ll be starting over Kevon Looney. Andre Iguodala is officially out. In case you need reminding, or are a Warriors fan who delights in schadenfreude, here’s the end of Game 1: Note LeBron James’s expression: a mixture of shock and justified exacerbation. Yes, yes that has launched a million memes. Hello and welcome to Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors. While there’s plenty of things to talk about, there’s one topic that completely overshadows everything else: J.R. Smith’s gaffe during the final few seconds of regulation. With time expiring, Smith held onto the ball, apparently briefly unaware that the game remained tied, rather than attempting a shot that could have given the Cavaliers a lead. The Warriors ended up winning in overtime, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. It’s a rough loss to take, it’s likely that the Cavaliers will never have a better chance to pull off a road victory in this series, something that they will have to do at some point. Meanwhile, the Warriors know that they dodged a number of bullets back on Thursday and will be better prepared today. The Warriors are never more dangerous than when they have a chance to make adjustments, it’s the reason why they have had so many big third quarters. So this is going to be the key game of the series. Can the Cavaliers put Game 1 in the rear view mirror? Can the Warriors avoid being complacent after being gifted a Game 1 victory? It’s going to be fascinating. As always, we’re looking for your commentary throughout these liveblogs, you can email your thoughts to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt. It’s Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the Cavaliers and the Warriors at Oracle Arena. Opening tip is set sometime after 8:00pm EST, but we’ll be back well before then. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s how the teams are preparing for tonight’s game: All the chatter is that Cleveland could be deflated after they blew a golden chance to win Game 1 of the NBA finals. But LeBron James, at least, has found motivation. “It’s one of the toughest losses I’ve had in my career,” James acknowledged on Saturday, “because of everything that kind of went on with the game and the way we played. Obviously, we all know what happened in the game.” There were miscues aplenty, most notably when JR Smith failed to go for what would have been a winning basket in the final seconds with the game tied because he appeared to think the Cavaliers were winning. The decision baffled a frustrated and stunned James. Smith initially denied he had got the score wrong but on Saturday walked that back. “After thinking about it a lot after the last 24 hours and however long it’s been since the game was over, I can’t say I was sure of anything at that point,” Smith said.

Signalling that confidence is gradually returning to the country’s banking system, the leftist-led government has doubled the amount depositors will be able to withdraw from their accounts as of Monday. “As is usually the case with the economy, this is about psychology,” said a senior official at the Bank of Greece. “The relaxation is as much about boosting confidence among investors and savers as showing banks can now afford to work under normal conditions.” Barely three months before its third international bailout programme expires, the country once at the epicentre of the euro crisis is keen to prove its financial turmoil is over. Under the new rules, the limit on cash withdrawals from local banks will be raised from €2,300 to €5,000 per month. Business transactions will also be facilitated, with cash transfers abroad being doubled to €40,000 a month. The Greek finance ministry said it had similarly decided to increase the amount depositors can take abroad, in euros or foreign currency, from €2,300 to €3,000 per trip. From 1 July, banks will be allowed to accept customer orders for money transfers overseas for up to €4,000 bi-monthly. In a statement the finance ministry said the aim was to fully lift restrictions “as soon as possible” while ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability. The move follows Greece’s euro area creditors and the International Monetary Fund failing this weekend to crack the conundrum of easing the nation’s staggering €320bn debt pile at a G7 meeting in Canada. Athens is hoping for a solution for what is widely seen as its last remaining obstacle to economic recovery before it returns to “post-bailout normality” on 20 August. “The easing of controls is indicative of the normalisation of the economy and of the country,” Stelios Kouloglou, a Euro MP with the governing Syriza party, told the Guardian. “The only thing that remains is for Germany to respect its own engagement and agree to debt relief, which it appears not to want to do due to internal political reasons.” The controls were first imposed in June 2015 after Greece skirted perilously close to crashing out of the euro as fears of a bank run mounted amid global market jitters. The turmoil led to the country receiving €86bn in emergency rescue funding – its third bailout since May 2010 – in August 2015 with the aim of tackling economic imbalances, social challenges and paving the way to sustainable economic growth. Greek banks are still encumbered by high levels of non-performing loans although non-performing exposures dropped by 4.8% – the highest quarterly reduction since the onset of the crisis – over the fourth quarter of 2017. The Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos has sought to allay fears that Italy’s financial turmoil will adversely affect Greece’s return to borrowing markets and long-desired normality. “Markets know that the Greek economy is doing well and its prospects are excellent,” he said last week. Rather than be a cause for fear, events in Rome validated Athens argument that debt relief was crucial if Greece is to successfully access markets again, Tsakalotos insisted."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/05/bbc-to-close-maida-vale-studios-and-move-live-music-base-to-east-london","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T09:20:43Z","webTitle":"BBC to close Maida Vale studios and move live music base to east London","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/05/bbc-to-close-maida-vale-studios-and-move-live-music-base-to-east-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/05/bbc-to-close-maida-vale-studios-and-move-live-music-base-to-east-london","fields":{"headline":"BBC to close Maida Vale studios and move live music base to east London","bodyText":"The BBC plans to close its Maida Vale studios after 84 years and move its live music base to Stratford in east London. The world-famous studios have hosted thousands of performances ranging from the Beatles to Beyoncé to Girls Aloud, in addition to hosting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The studios were originally constructed in 1909 as a short-lived rollerskating venue. The BBC took over the building in the 1930s and refurbished it to serve as studios, making it one of the broadcaster’s oldest buildings. However, the distinctive and unusual building is in a residential area and contains asbestos, increasing the cost of refurbishment. “I understand how much our musical heritage at Maida Vale means to us, to artists and to audiences,” the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said in a note to staff. “We haven’t taken this decision lightly. But we’re determined to ensure that live music remains at the heart of the BBC and moving to this new development gives us the opportunity to do just that.” Maida Vale was the site of Bing Crosby’s last recording session and has hosted tens of thousands live music events for BBC radio stations, ranging from John Peel sessions to Radio 1’s Live Lounge recordings. It was also the home of the experimental BBC Radiophonic Workshop, where Delia Derbyshire recorded the Doctor Who theme tune. The BBC hopes to relocate most of Maida Vale’s functions to a new complex in the Stratford Waterfront development in the Olympic Park by 2023. The site will contain recording and rehearsal studios, providing a purpose-built base for the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus and the BBC Singers, as well as being used regularly by the BBC Concert Orchestra. The broadcaster has pledged to run music sessions in east London schools as well as making digital music resources available to schools everywhere. The BBC will also partner with local education groups on other music projects. James Purnell, the BBC’s director of radio and education, said: “This proposed new building will act as a magnet for music development in east London and will allow us to share our music facilities and expertise with local, diverse communities as well as being a much better place for our brilliant music staff to work from.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/blog/live/2018/jun/05/corbyn-backs-calls-for-inquiry-into-islamophobia-in-conservative-party-politics-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T16:11:55Z","webTitle":"MPs debate calls to liberalise abortion laws in Northern Ireland – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jun/05/corbyn-backs-calls-for-inquiry-into-islamophobia-in-conservative-party-politics-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jun/05/corbyn-backs-calls-for-inquiry-into-islamophobia-in-conservative-party-politics-live","fields":{"headline":"MPs debate calls to liberalise abortion laws in Northern Ireland – as it happened","bodyText":"Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, has said government MPs will get a free vote if the Commons does consider legislation to liberalise the abortion laws in Northern Ireland. She appeared to rule out the government whipping its MPs to vote against on the grounds that this is a devolved matter. Speaking in an emergency debate on the issue, Bradley said: This is a matter of conscience: a free vote on this issue in this House would be afforded if the matter of abortion comes before the House again, and the same applies in Northern Ireland. But Bradley also restated the government’s view that this is a matter that should be decided by the Northern Ireland assembly, when power-sharing is restored, not by Westminster. Opening the debate, which she secured, the Labour MP Stella Creasy said she was proposing a UK-wide law change that would repeal the sections of the Offences Against the Person Act (OAPA) 1861 that make abortion illegal in Northern Ireland. She said: Even though the Good Friday Agreement explicitly retains human rights responsibilities for (Westminster), let me reassure those MPs who want to uphold the role of devolved assemblies that repealing OAPA would not write a particular abortion law for anyone, but it would require them to act. During the debate, which saw many MPs from both sides of the Commons speak in favour of liberalising the law in Northern Ireland, the Conservative MP Heidi Allen said she was passionately pro-choice because she had an abortion herself. She said: I was ill when I made the incredibly hard decision to have a termination: I was having seizures every day, I wasn’t even able to control my own body, let alone care for a new life. The government has finally given the green light to the controversial plan to build a third runway at Heathrow after years of delays and opposition. A no-deal Brexit could cost British and EU businesses up to £20bn, the head of Britain’s tax authority has said. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has called for tougher controls of migration as part of a package of measures designed to address the concerns of Brexit voters and to prevent Britain being permanently paralysed by its decision to leave the European Union. The UK government has cleared the way for Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox to buy Sky on the condition it sells Sky News to another organisation. Jeremy Corbyn has called on the prime minister to intervene to stop the ongoing rail disruption in the north of England, as MPs launch an inquiry into the chaos on train services across the UK. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Gordon Brown, the former prime minister, is speaking at an event at London’s Southbank centre tonight and his office has sent out advance extracts from what he is going to say. To use a phrase coined by Tony Blair’s former communications chief, Alastair Campbell, Brown is making the case for being tough on Brexit, and tough on the cause of Brexit. It is classic Brown; in part almost brilliant, but over-complicated and not necessarily practical. It all hinges on a five-point plan (another quintessential Brownism). From what Brown is saying in his press release, he seems to be advocating a very soft Brexit, involving staying in the single market, although he is not explicit about what he is proposing. The main problem with it, of course, is that it’s probably two years too late. Still, it is interesting stuff. Here is a summary. Brown says the Brexit vote was “the biggest revolt against the political establishment of our country” and that remainers can’t just tell leavers they were wrong. The Brexit vote was the biggest revolt against the political establishment of our country - and the commercial, industrial, financial and cultural establishment. Something as seismic cannot be dismissed as false consciousness on the part of a poorly-informed electorate: we have to accept that was a genuine expression of people’s anxieties about the future. The vote sent a powerful message that globalisation is not working for British citizens and this is reflected in economic discontent about wage stagnation and the prospects for young people, and in cultural pessimism – a sense that “the country is not what it was” and has “changed out of all recognition” – as well as an anti-politics sentiment. Millions of people are feeling left out and left behind. He proposes a five-point plan that could unite both sides of the Brexit argument. To deal with the underlying drivers of Brexit – the root causes – remainers have to attempt to answer and address the Leavers’ concerns about migration and sovereignty. In turn, leavers should listen to the legitimate concerns that Remainers have about how diminished access to trading opportunities in mainland Europe may have a negative impact on wages and the prospects of young people, hit northern communities hard, and even deprive the NHS of staff and funds – and that job prospects may be more vulnerable in a hard Brexit economy more detached from mainland Europe, because so much depends on trade. Here are the five points. First, managing migration more successfully; Second, giving proper weight to British law; Third, fashioning an up to date British industrial policy that addresses stagnant wages and lost jobs; Fourth, forging a new regional policy that gives a voice to the North and to communities which feel they have been held back – and accept that the third and fourth priorities will require the best possible access to European trading opportunities; and Fifth, solving the funding crisis of the NHS. He says there are six measures the UK could implement to curb immigration that are all compatible with EU or single market membership. If we wish to manage the migration of European citizens into Britain more effectively and address fears people undoubtedly have, then I believe that the British public would accept – and the European Union could not refuse – the following six proposals, all of which are in force in at least one country under ‘free movement’ rules and could be implemented in Britain now: 1. No undercutting of wages by migrants. Follow the precedent set by France this year and legislated last week across the EU by insisting that a migrant worker cannot be paid, for example, Eastern European wages in a British job. 2. Registration of jobs. As in Switzerland, again under European freedom of movement rules, employers should be required to notify local job centres of job openings - generally or in sectors of high unemployment. Locally resident applicants would be eligible for a guaranteed interview with the employer. 3. Registration of migrants. Following the example of Germany, any migrant coming to the UK from within the EU should be required to register on arrival at a local job centre or on an online platform. 4. Possible removal of migrants. After nine months, migrants who do not have a job could be required to leave, in line with the law in Belgium. 5. No undercutting by employment agencies. We could ban employment agencies from advertising jobs abroad that are not at first advertised at home and end the practice where employment agencies bring groups of workers to Britain for jobs that British workers have been unable to compete for or even apply for. 6. Significantly expand the government’s fund for mitigating the impacts of immigration on local communities. Provide extra financial support for areas where there is pressure on resources because of large numbers of immigrants – helping local hospitals, schools and public amenities. He proposes a declaration of national identity that would allow the UK courts to prioritise the British constitution when it clashes with EU law. The declaration will build on sentiments already expressed by the UK supreme court regarding the protection of UK constitution in applying EU law, for example in the cases of HS2 and Pham. It will ensure that the British courts will be in no doubt that the British constitution must be prioritised and protected, if ever EU law comes into conflict with it. I would suggest that in the longer term, parliament passes a statute which requires Parliamentary approval for the application of EU law which may be seen to cut across or undermine ‘constitutional statutes’, including the Bill of Rights 1689, the Magna Carta, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Equality Act 2010, as well as the European Communities Act 1972. The statute would empower UK citizens to bring a case to UK courts on the grounds that a piece of EU law undermines the rights provided by the UK’s constitutional statutes. He says Britain risk being “permanently paralysed” by Brexit. In our long history as a United Kingdom – at times threatened by invasion, sometimes subject to bombardment and for a time laid low by civil war – we have always found the strength from within ourselves to come together as one. By seeking and then finding common ground we have triumphed over whatever crises we have confronted. Yet we are now at serious risk of being permanently paralysed by seemingly irreparable divisions – a fractured country divided not just over Brexit, but also with Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English regions at odds with Westminster and at what they see as a London-centric view of the world. He proposes changes to the EU withdrawal bill to take more account of the interests of devolution. The current EU withdrawal bill, which reverses without Scottish consent some of the devolution settlement - at least for a seven-year period – is generating a new set of grievances. I will propose that we restrict the retention of powers at the centre to essential matters where international obligations and negotiations require a united front and I suggest that when the EU withdrawal bill returns to the Commons next week we trigger the sunset clause not in 2026 but not later than 2024, thus restricting the amount of time that Westminster can ‘freeze’ devolve powers after Brexit. Turning back to Jeremy Corbyn, according to the BBC’s Norman Smith, the Labour leader told the GMB conference in Britain that Labour wants a customs union with the EU after Brexit that would allow the UK to strike its own trade deals. This repeats what Corbyn said in his speech in February announcing Labour’s support for staying in a customs union long term, but it is contentious because many would argue that the two goals are incompatible. Corbyn also restated his opposition to the so-called Norway option. Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative MP and GP who chairs the Commons health committee, backs Creasy. She says ministers should prepare for the fact that cross-party amendments demanding liberalisation of the abortion laws in Northern Ireland will be brought forward. She says she hopes ministers won’t delay the domestic violence bill just because they want to avoid this vote. Most parties generally allow their MPs a free vote on abortion. But, on this issue, Labour as a party is committed to liberalising the laws in Northern Ireland. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said on this subject earlier today. I would say very politely to Arlene Foster, you were elected to the Northern Ireland assembly, maybe you should play your part in ensuring that assembly functions and we get a devolved administration working in Northern Ireland. In the absence of it, then clearly the UK Parliament has responsibility to adhere to human rights standards, and there is a Supreme Court decision coming on Thursday. Labour’s position has always been that abortion rights should be extended, without fear or favour, across the whole of the UK. In the Commons Tony Lloyd, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, has just finished speaking. He backed up Corbyn’s position, but he stressed that Labour’s preference was for power-sharing to be restored in Northern Ireland and for the Northern Ireland assembly to take forward this issue. Bradley says any read-across from the Irish referendum to the UK needs to be treated with care. Ireland voted to repeal an article in their written constitution. They are now writing a new law. She says the law in Ireland has not changed yet. Creasy says she is not talking about getting rid of the Preservation of Infant Life Act from 1929, which banned abortion after 28 weeks (subsequently reduced to 24 weeks). Bradley says this is a matter for a democratically elected assembly in Northern Ireland. MPs are in danger of disenfranchising people in Northern Ireland. She says Theresa May has been clear in her support for women’s rights. She welcomes the result in the Republic of Ireland, she says. And that’s it. Bradley has finished. What she said did not really go much beyond what Downing Street has said - she certainly did not show any enthusiasm for allowing MPs to have a vote on this - although what she said about this continuing to be a free vote matter (see 3.22pm) implied that, if Creasy or anyone else does find a way of forcing a vote on this in the future, the government would not whip its MPs to vote against on the grounds that this was a devolved matter, not a matter for Westminster. Bradley says government MPs would get a free vote if the Commons were to vote on liberalising the Northern Ireland abortion laws. This does not mean there will be a vote at any point in the future. Creasy wants to table an amendment to the domestic violence bill, but that is still at the consultation phase and only a draft bill was published in the Queen’s speech. Even if an amendment were to be tabled, government sources have said they think there is a strong chance of it being disallowed on the grounds that this is a devolved matter. Bradley says abortion has long been a matter of conscience in the Commons. It has been, and will continue to be, a matter for a free vote in the Commons, she says. Ian Paisley, the DUP MP, says what Creasy proposes would change the law for the UK. That should not be done in the heat of the moment, following a vote in the Republic of Ireland. Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, is speaking now. This may well be the most important speech of the debate because she will set out the government’s thinking. See 3.09pm. Maria Miller, the Conservative former culture secretary who chairs the Commons women and equalities committee, backed calls for changing the law in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP chief whip, is speaking now. He says people claim he is out of touch with the views of his constituents. But he has been returned as an MP six times. He says the DUP is explicitly a pro-life party. And there are nationalist and unionists in Northern Ireland who back that position, he says. He says 100,000 people are alive in Northern Ireland because it did not accept the 1967 Abortion Act. This is from Sky’s Beth Rigby. If Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, says explicitly that Theresa May is in favour of liberalising the abortion laws in Northern Ireland, she will be going further than the prime minister’s spokesman. Up to now Downing Street has played down the prime minister’s personal views on this, stressing that it is a devolved matter. Turning back to Heathrow for a moment, this is from ITV’s Robert Peston. Creasy says that, by repealing OAPA, MPs can show they trust women. They can also show they trust devolved administrations to take their own decisions. The next issue is, when can MPs vote, she says. She says the government is consulting on a domestic violence bill. Parliament does not protect women by criminalising them, she says. And she says the majority of people in Northern Ireland would like to see abortion managed as a medical issue, not a criminal issue. She says she has respect for people opposed to abortion. But she says she thinks women should have the choice. She says today she made the mistake of reading her emails. One person said women could always say no, and keep their clothes on. She says people like this are more concerned about how women became pregnant, not what happens to the foetus, she says. She says, as far as she is concerned, this is all about freedom. By supporting the case for liberalisation, MPs can show they think all women deserve to be treated as citizens. She says today she is asking ministers to commit to allowing parliament a vote on this. She ends: I ask the ministers - give us a date. The DUP MP Ian Paisley says the Northern Ireland assembly debated this issue in 2016 and rejected what Creasy is proposing. Creasy says in 2016 the assembly did not reject the proposal. In fact, the DUP said it just had to be considered properly. And there have been two elections since then, she says. The independent MP for North Down in Northern Ireland, Sylvia Hermon, intervenes. She says she has received many letters from constituents who think MPs legislating to liberalise the abortion laws in Northern Ireland would subvert devolution. Creasy addresses this. She says she wants to get rid of the sections in the Offences against the Person Act that outlaw abortion. This is UK legislation, she says. If it were repealed, it would then be up to Northern Ireland to draw up its own law on abortion. The Northern Ireland assembly, if reconstituted, would not be able to ignore this issue, she says. She says she is opposed to calls for a referendum. What would the terms of the referendum be? If there were to be a referendum, that could open the way to other referendums, such as one on the border, she says. Stella Creasy is opening the debate now. She says she and colleagues have been planning for this since they managed last year to force the government to offer women from Northern Ireland abortions in England on the NHS. This debate has been triggered by the result of the referendum in the Republic of Ireland, she says. She says under the law in Northern Ireland, a woman who is raped and seeks a termination can face a higher sentence than her attacker. MPs are starting the emergency debate on the abortion laws in Northern Ireland in the next few minutes. It has been scheduled in response to a demand from the Labour MP Stella Creasy. I’ve described it as a debate on the abortion laws in Northern Ireland, but technically it’s a debate on the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, which banned abortion (among other things). The abortion section now longer applies in the rest of the United Kingdom, but it does still apply in Northern Ireland. These are from the Evening Standard’s Joe Murphy. Matt Hancock, the culture secretary, is now making a Common statement about the Sky takeover bids. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering it on his business live blog. Grayling says the Heathrow vote has to be taken within 21 sitting days from today. (That timetable is set out in the Planning Act.) He says the date of the vote will be announced in due course. The Labour MP Richard Burden says regional airports should not be called regional airports. Grayling says he wants to “get on with it” and hold the Heathrow vote soon. This is from the Wales Office. Labour’s Stephen Timms says he welcomes the announcement. How many jobs will it create? Grayling says it should create in the region of 100,000 extra jobs. Labour’s Gavin Shuker says that, given this project will last several parliaments, isn’t it incredible for any party that aspires to government not to have a clear view on this. He asks if there will be special whipping arrangements to allow some Tories (Boris Johnson, especially) to vote against. Grayling won’t comment on whipping arrangements, but he says all parties that aspire to government should back the plan Labour’s Ian Austin, MP for Dudley North, says most of the benefit will go to London and the south east. He says the government should have expanded Birmingham airpot instead. The GMB union, which is also a major financial backer of Labour, is also supporting Heathrow expansion. This is from the Manchester Evening News’ political editor Jennifer Williams. And this is from the Labour-supporting elections expert Ian Warren. But Greenpeace has described the move as a mistake. This is from the Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven. Green-lighting a new runway at Heathrow on world environment day is like handing out free cigarettes on world health day. This airstrip alone will load the atmosphere with as much extra carbon as some entire countries pump out. And it would make Londoners’ air more dangerous to breathe, contributing to an air pollution crisis that’s already cutting short thousands of lives. It’s time the UK Government took seriously its commitment to protect the environment by building a low-carbon economy. Trains not planes for short haul journeys and a tax on frequent flyers is needed to prevent aviation emissions from rising. The Institute of Directors has welcomed the plan. This is from its director general, Stephen Martin. Businesses will be delighted by the cabinet’s decision to proceed with a new Heathrow runway. This gets us within touching distance of the end of a debate that has drawn out for far too long, holding us back at a time when we should be looking outward to become a truly global Britain. Labour’s Seema Malhotra, who represents Feltham and Heston in west London, says polling suggests her constituents are in favour of the third runway. But they have some concerns about it, she says. Grayling says there was “almost universal support” for the decision at cabinet this morning. There is some laughter at his implicit reference to Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and former London mayor who is a longterm opponent of the scheme. Labour’s Mike Gapes welcomes the decision and says he is glad that a government has finally got a grip on this issue. George Freeman, a Conservative, congratulates Grayling on putting the national interest before party politics. He says he hopes the same approach will apply in other areas (ie, Brexit). Labour’s Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, says she is in favour of the plan, provided it boosts regional growth. But John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor and MP for Hayes and Harlington, near Heathrow, has confirmed his opposition to the plan on Twitter. Labour’s Kevan Jones says he backs the plan for a new runway. Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP for Richmond Park in west London and prominent opponent of the scheme, says this looks like a whole load of blank cheques being written by the government. He suggests the government should be building a new runway at Gatwick instead. Grayling says, from the 2060s, the economic case for Gatwick gets stronger than the economic case for Heathrow. But not before, he says. Business groups have welcomed the decision. This is from the CBI. And this is from the British Chambers of Commerce. The Unite union, which is one of the Labour party’s main financial backers, has put out a statement urging MPs to vote for the third runway. Oliver Richardson, its national officer, said: After repeated delays the government has finally given the green light to Heathrow’s expansion. Now it is critical for the wider economy that this additional capacity is delivered, and done so in a timely fashion. As a nation, we cannot continue to have a never-ending holding pattern of inaction. It will not only postpone the economic boost and jobs a third runway would bring to the UK economy, but hand rival airports like Frankfurt and Charles de Gaulle in Paris a keen competitive advantage. Ministers need to avoid playing parliamentary games with such an important project and put Heathrow expansion to a vote of MPs as soon as possible. The UK is a world leader in aviation and aerospace. We urge MPs from all political parties to back growth for the UK economy and vote for Heathrow’s expansion to create and maintain high quality jobs. Unite represents 34,000 workers at Heathrow. The Green MP Caroline Lucas asks about carbon emissions. (See 1.15pm.) Grayling says the airports commission said the third runway was compatible with the UK meeting its climate change obligations. Grayling says allowing more capacity to Heathrow will allow new firms to enter the aviation market. These are from the Green MP and outgoing co-party leader, Caroline Lucas. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says all the big regional airports oppose the plans. Grayling does not accept that. He says there is huge support for the plan from regional airports. Damian Green, the Conservative former first secretary of state, says this decision probably should have been taken 10 years ago. He asks Grayling to accept that new rail links with Heathrow will be required. Grayling says some new rail services are already planned. The plan includes proposals to improve rail access to Heathrow from the south and from the west. Lilian Greenwood, chair of the transport committee, asks Grayling to explain how a new runway will ensure there are more domestic routes. Grayling says having a new runway will provide more connectivity. That will the main benefit to travellers from the UK outside London. Justine Greening, the Conservative former transport secretary and Putney MP, says this is the wrong decision. Grayling says a night flight ban is “an absolute requirement”. It is “non-negotiable from the government’s point of view”, he says. That would only change if the local community proposed something different. This is from Sir Christopher Meyer, the former diplomat who ended his career as ambassador to Washington. The SNP’s transport spokesman, Alan Brown, says supporting a third runway was counter-intuitive for him. But he says all the Scottish airports back the proposal. Grayling says the government welcomes the SNP’s support. It wants Scotland to benefit from the new runway. Here is the full text of Grayling’s statement to MPs. Here is the 93-page airports national policy statement (pdf). And here is a Department for Transport statement summarising the government’s position. Grayling is replying to McDonald. He says McDonald did not say whether or not Labour backs the project. He regards it as important for the whole of the country, he says. On air quality, Grayling says the runway will not open if it does not meet air quality rules. On landing charges, he says they will have to stay at about the same level they are now. He says promises on night flights will have to be met. This project can and will be delivered, he says. If you look at the price at which slots at Heathrow are sold, you will see it is one of the world’s premier airports, he says. He says Heathrow expansion will give people in all parts of the UK, as well as from the crown dependencies, better access to the rest of the world. The vote has to take place within 21 days, he says. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, says Grayling does not have the support of the Commons. He is only here because Theresa May was too weak to sack hi, he says. As Tory MPs jeer, he says they did not support Grayling during yesterday’s statement on the rail timetable crisis. He says Labour will assess the plans in accordance with its four test: 1) that they will meet the UK’s capacity demands. 2) that they will not breach noise and air pollution obligations 3) that they will allow the UK to meet its climate change targets in their entirety 4) that they will support growth across the whole country. He says some MPs have not forgotten Grayling’s broken promises on duel-fuel trains. How can they believe the assurances he is giving on Heathrow, for example on the number of slots available for domestic flights? He says MPs must look at the revised NPS in detail. And Labour will apply its tests, he says. He says, alongside the NPS (national policy statement) being published today, he is releasing a lot of other material that will help MPs make a decision on this. Grayling says the process involves the Commons having to approve the government’s plans, and then a much more detailed planning permission having to be approved. Grayling says the government’s airport strategy will set out a longterm strategy for airports. He says he has met financial backers who could fund a new southern rail access to the airport. Grayling says Heathrow are the only body who could deliver this scheme. His department will be working closely with it, so it can meet the target date of 2026, he says. Chris Grayling says he comes to the Commons to mark a historic moment. He is laying before the House a plan to expand Heathrow airport. It is an example of the the government’s industrial strategy. He says he is aware of the strength of feeling on this and has met residents. He summarises the consultation process. He says the UK has one of the largest aviation sectors in the world. The time for action is now, he says. Heathrow is already full and the evidence shows that the remaining London airports aren’t far behind. Heathrow is already losing out because it is full, he says. He says it is a nationally significant freight hub. A third runway would enable it to double its freight capacity. He says he expects the whole of the UK to benefit. Regional connectivity is one of the key reasons for Heathrow getting a third airport. He says communities around Heathrow will get up to £2.6bn in compensation. That is 10 times bigger than what was first proposed in 2009. That covers money for sound proofing homes. Grayling tells MPs £2.6bn has been set aside to compensate people living near Heathrow for the impact of the new runway. Communities will be supported by up to £2.6bn towards compensation, noise insulation and improvements to public amenities – 10 times bigger than under the 2009 third runway proposal. This package is comparable with some of the most generous in the world and includes £700m for noise insulation for homes and £40m to insulate schools and community buildings. The airport has offered 125% of the full market value for homes in the compulsory and voluntary purchase zones, plus stamp duty, moving costs and legal fees, as well as a legally-binding noise envelope and more predictable periods of respite. Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is about to make a Commons statement about going ahead with the third runway at Heathrow. As we switch from customs to Chris Grayling, here is a tweet from Peter Ricketts, the former head of the Foreign Office, neatly linking the two topics. This is what Jon Thompson, the HMRC chief executive and permanent secretary, told the committee earlier (see 11.18am) when asked what the cost to business would be of a no deal Brexit. He said stressed that this was not the government’s preferred option. But he went on: If we moved to WTO [World Trade Organisation] rules, then that would definitely require customs declarations. So it would similar [to the costs of the “max fac” option]. Thompson says HMRC has worked with internet service providers to stop people receiving fake HMRC phishing emails. He says it estimates that it has prevented 500m of these emails being sent out. HMRC never sends out emails inviting people to click links, he says. And that’s it. The hearing is over. They were due to cover economic crime, but Nicky Morgan says they will address that on another occasion. Labour’s Wes Streeting goes next. He asks about the revelation that HMRC made a reference to Lycamobile making a donation to the Conservative party when HMRC wrote to the French authorities refusing to raid Lycamobile’s London office on their behalf. Thompson says HMRC has reviewed all requests for help from other tax authorities. There around 260 a year. That review showed there were no other references to political donors. He says the person who included that reference made a mistake. But in other respects the reply to the French authorities was excellent, he says. He says the reply stressed HMRC’s need to comply with the law. Nicky Morgan says she was surprised to read a recent Times article saying HMRC is employing 2,000 fewer people than at the time of the EU referendum. Thompson says there was an assumption that digitisation would reduce the need for staff. He says he has described that assumption as over-aggressive. Thompson says HMRC has continued to ask for permission to have discussion with other tax authorities about systems after Brexit. But at the moment all negotiations are with the EU, he says. Nicky Morgan goes next. Q: You says, under the new customs partnership plan, there would be no checks. Presumably you mean no customs checks - not all checks. There could be checks for sanitary reason, couldn’t there? Harra confirms that. He says HMRC has been focusing on checks for the purposes of tariffs and VAT. Q: The Sunday Times at the weekend said a no deal Brexit could result in “armageddon”. How do you provide reassurance in the light of that? Karen Wheeler, director general of the cross-government border delivery group at HMRC, says that story referred to a report she has not seen. It is not something she recognises, she says. Her group is trying to minimise risks. Thompson says, if such a report exists, he has not seen it. Labour’s Rushanara Ali goes next. Q: You said HMRC would be able to have a functioning border by January 2021, even though new arrangements might not be fully optional. And you said one of three things would have to give: security, revenue or trade. So would that really be a functioning border. Thompson says he did tell the committee two weeks ago that there would be a border, but that it would be sub-optimal. Q: We can’t compromise on security or trade, so we will have to compromise on revenue. How much might that cost? Thompson says that question is too hypothetical to answer. But ministers would have to make a choice, he says. Harra says customs procedures always have to balance out these three objectives. Thompson says HMRC is only one department of several looking at customs options. He says HMRC is not the primary author of government papers on the two options being considered. Thompson says he does not believe that the alternative methods used to calculate the cost of “max fac” take into account the actual nature of UK-EU trade. The Commons transport committee has announced it will launch an inquiry into the rail timetable debacle, likely spelling another uncomfortable hearing for transport secretary Chris Grayling. Thousands of trains have been cancelled and seriously delayed on Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern rail services since a new timetable was introduced two and a half weeks ago, leading to calls for urgent government action. Lilian Greenwood, the committee chair, said: Passengers continue to suffer from terrible disruption to their train services, particularly on Northern and GTR services. We will begin by questioning Northern, GTR and Network Rail but plan to take further evidence, including from the Department for Transport, so that we properly understand why the introduction of the new timetable has gone so badly wrong, what is being done to put it right and the steps needed to prevent this happening again. The secretary of state has said there have been ‘major failures’ - we want to unpick this mess and understand how it can be prevented from occurring in December, when another timetable change is due. Q: You have been accused of muddling consignments and containers in the calculations that produced a figure for the cost of “max fac”? Thompson says he has explained how he arrived at his figures. They reflect the fact that trade with the EU is lower value, higher frequency than trade with elsewhere in the world. Q: Other people say customs cost would only be about 1% of the overall costs of trade. Your figures are out of line. Thompson tells Elphicke he is ignoring what he is saying. He produced his figures using a bottom up method, looking at the nature of trade. For example, a well-known firm of chemists distributes its goods in the UK from a warehouse in northern France. Charlie Elphicke, who was elected as a Conservative but is currently suspended from the party, goes next. He asks about a letter he received from the Treasury minister Mel Stride saying government policy after Brexit would be to stick close to EU VAT policy. Is that right, he asks. Elphicke is referring to a letter written up in a Financial Times story (paywall). This is how it started. Britain is taking what a minister has described as an “active role” in shaping new EU value added tax regulations for the 2020s, suggesting the Treasury is planning for the UK to remain inside the bloc’s VAT area after the Brexit transition period. In a letter seen by the Financial Times from Mel Stride, financial secretary to the Treasury, to Charlie Elphicke, MP for Dover, the minister also says: “The government aims to keep VAT processes after EU exit as close as possible to what they are now.” If Britain seeks to remain inside the EU VAT area, it will continue to be bound by rules set in Brussels that are ultimately policed by the European Court of Justice, breaking one of Prime Minister Theresa May’s negotiating red lines. Jim Harra, the HMRC chief executive, says the intention is to start with a VAT regime mirroring the EU’s after Brexit. But after that things could change, he suggests. The five-page letter from Jon Thompson to the Commons Treasury committee sets out in detail how he arrived at the figures he gave the committee two weeks ago for the costs to business of the two customs options being considered by the cabinet - “max fac”, and the new customs partnership. The letter says the estimate that “max fac” could cost business up to £20bn a year does not include the “costs of delays” at the border. Thompson is now being asked about some figures he has provided the committee in a letter which has been published on its website. Thompson says the new customs partnership, the customs option said to be favoured by Theresa May over “max fac”, would not require customs declaration. He says leaving the EU with no deal would also cost business about £20bn a year, because there would have to be customs declarations, as with “max fac”. A no deal Brexit would cost business around £20bn a year, HMRC boss tells MPs. Q: Have you been challenged on your figures by government departments or ministers or Downing Street? Thompson says there has not been much challenge from officials. Jim Harra, Thompson’s deputy, says those figures have been shared in Whitehall. He is not aware of any challenge to them in the last two weeks. HMRC boss says Whitehall officials have not challenged his claim “max fac” would cost business up to £20bn a year. Q: Those figures were described as speculative. Do you accept that? Thompsons says there are speculative in the sense that we do not know how the government’s plans will work. He says two economists challenged his methodology. (He is referring to this article for Reaction.) You can try to find a figure for costs by looking at the number of declarations, or by looking at the volume of trade overall (the top down approach). He says he does not accept the top down approach. He says trade with the EU is generally lower value, higher volume, than trade with the rest of the world. Nicky Morgan, the chair, is asking the questions. Q: Can you talk us through the sources you used when you told us two weeks ago what the costs of custom declarations would be under the “max fac” option? Jon Thompson says he was basing his figures on three reports: an Ipsos MORI one, a Dutch government one, and a Nottingham Business School one. Q: So £32.50 was just an average? Thompson says it was a weighted average. Q: Do you take into account the fact that different industries will have different costs? Not per se, no, says Thompson. Jon Thompson, the chief executive and permanent secretary at HM Revenue and Customs, is giving evidence now to the Commons Treasury committee about Brexit. He appeared two weeks ago, in a dramatic hearing during which he said that the “maximum facilitation” customs plan favoured by cabinet Brexiters would cost business up to £20bn a year. That was a one-off hearing promoted by a newspaper story about HMRC views on the “max fac” plan. This will be a more wide-ranging session, covering borders and economic crime. You can watch the hearing here. And, since we’re on the subject of Theresa May, these tweets from the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg are worth a read. They were promoted by this, from HuffPost’s Jess Brammar. And this, from Sky’s Lewis Goodall, is worth noting too. And, while we’re on the subject of polling, the ConservativeHome survey of Conservative party members for the month of May makes grim reading for the prime minister. Amongst cabinet minister, only Philip Hammond, the chancellor, gets a worse satisfaction rating. Here is an excerpt from Mark Wallace’s write-up for ConservativeHome. Readers will remember that March’s Cabinet League Table contained quite a remarkable showing for the Prime Minister. Apparently as a result of her confident response to Russia’s attack on Salisbury, she had gained almost 47 percentage points to leap to a positive rating of +56.4, up from a miserable +9.1 the month before. To paraphrase the investment adverts, reputations can go down as well as up, however – and Theresa May now finds herself with a net negative rating, languishing at -9.5. Unsurprisingly, this appears to be a reflection of Party members’ frustrations about her Brexit performance. And here are the March figures. Disagreement with Britain’s decision to quit the European Union has reached its highest point since the 2016 Brexit referendum, according to a new poll (pdf). As the Press Association reports, the YouGov survey found 47% of voters thought the decision to leave was wrong, against just 40% who said it was the right thing to do - the widest margin since the weekly survey began two years ago. YouGov interviewed 1,670 voters for The Times weekly tracker poll on May 28 and 29. Here is a What UK Thinks chart showing how the figures have varied over time. My colleague Lisa O’Carroll has been covering the Treasury committee hearing where bosses from from the ports of Calais and Zeebrugge, and from Getlink (formerly Eurotunnel, have been giving evidence on Brexit. Here are some of her tweets. The Commons culture committee has taken a further step towards getting Dominic Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaign director, found guilty of a contempt of parliament for refusing to give evidence to its fake news inquiry. It has published a report requesting a Commons vote on an “order of the House” telling Cummings he must appear. If Cummings were to ignore that, the committee of privileges would investigate, which could lead to the Commons passing a motion finding him in contempt of parliament. I went into all this in some detail last month in a post explaining what this procedure means, and why Cummings will be supremely unbothered by the prospect of a parliamentary reprimand. In a subsequent post on his blog Cummings rather conveniently stood up my analysis, telling the committee (among other things): “You seem unaware that most of the country feels contempt for parliament and this contempt is growing.” This is what Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan police commissioner, told Yvette Cooper a few moments ago about how police cuts have contributed to the increase in violent crime. (See 9.49am.) Dick said: A whole series of social issues will have contributed to the changes and the increases [in violent crime]. I answered a radio interview in which I said, in effect, of course austerity has probably had something to do with it, by which I mean, of course, the other services as well as the police. But I would be naive to suggest that reduced numbers of officers on the street, for a whole variety of reasons, including - and I’m talking across the country here - reduced officer numbers overall, have had no impact. I’m sure it’s had an impact, together with a whole series of other things. But government ministers have consistently played down the link between police cuts and the increase in violent crime. For example, Jeremy Corbyn asked Theresa May at PMQs in February if she regretted cutting police numbers in the light of rising crime. In her replies, May insisted that overall crime figures are low (generally she is right, but violent crime is an exception), that the police were better now at recording crime and that police budgets have been protected. Cooper asks Thornton about police funding. Thornton says the settlement in December 2017 was better than expected. She says, as the next spending review approaches, the Home Office needs to make a coherent case on police spending. At the home affairs committee Yvette Cooper, the committee chair, asks why violent crime in London is getting worse. Cressida Dick says it is hard to tell. She says it is important to have some context. This is a problem affecting some communities. It is not making the whole of London unsafe. But she has hundreds of officers out addressing the problem. She says, in a radio interview, she said austerity had something to do with this. She was referring to the cuts to services generally. And she says it would be wrong to pretend that police cuts have not been a factor. Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, has just started giving evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the future of policing. She is appearing alongside Lynne Owens, director general of the National Crime Agency, and Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs’ Council. You can watch the hearing here. I will be keeping an eye on it and posting any highlights. Jeremy Corbyn has faced persistent criticism for allegedly refusing to do enough to tackle antisemitism in the Labour party. His supporters argue that the media should be focusing as much on allegations of Islamphobia in the Conservative party, and last week the Muslim Council of Britain put this story in the news by calling for an independent inquiry into the problem. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, responded at the weekend by claiming that the MCB does not represent Muslims - prompting Mishal Husain to post what for a BBC presenter amounted to an unusually pointed tweet suggesting Javid was talking nonsense. It is no surprise that Corbyn would want to comment on this, and last night he did. Speaking at the speaking at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre in Westbourne Park, after an evening meal for Muslims to end their daily Ramadan fast, he said there should be an inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative party. He said: I think if there are allegations made then an inquiry should be held and it should be addressed and it should be dealt with. Islamophobia, as with antisemitism, as with any other form of racism, has no place whatsoever in our society or in any of our political parties. Nobody should be condoning it, nobody should be hiding it, everybody should be exposing it. Today he is speaking to the GMB conference in Brighton. But there is a lot else around. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: A cabinet sub committee meets to confirm the decision to go ahead with the third runway at Heathrow. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 9.30am: Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. 10am: Executives from the ports of Calais and Zeebrugge, and from Getlink (formerly Eurotunnel) give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee on Brexit. At 11am Jon Thompson, the HM Revenue and Customs chief executive and permanent secretary, gives evidence. 10am: Former international development secretaries Clare Short and Andrew Mitchell give evidence to the international development committee on sexual abuse in the aid sector. 10am: The police and CPS give evidence to the Commons justice committee on the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases. Around 12.45pm: Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, is expected to make a Commons statement on plans for the third runway at Heathrow. Around 2pm: MPs begin an emergency debate requested by the Labour MP Stella Creasy on the abortion law in Northern Ireland. Afternoon: Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech to the GMB conference in Brighton. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary at lunchtime and another at the end of the day. You can read all today’s Guardian politics stories here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning’s political news from Jack Blanchard. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today’ top 10 must reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I’m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer direct questions, although sometimes I miss them or don’t have time. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/jun/05/australias-large-fish-species-declined-30-in-past-decade-study-says","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T07:26:29Z","webTitle":"Australia's large fish species declined 30% in past decade, study says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/05/australias-large-fish-species-declined-30-in-past-decade-study-says","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/jun/05/australias-large-fish-species-declined-30-in-past-decade-study-says","fields":{"headline":"Australia's large fish species declined 30% in past decade, study says","bodyText":"The number of large fish species in Australian waters has declined by 30% in the past decade, mostly due to excessive fishing, a new study says. Marine ecology experts are calling for changes to fisheries management after publication of the study by scientists from the University of Tasmania and the University of Technology (UTS), Sydney. The decade-long study used data from diving surveys by three different bodies – the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the University of Tasmania and Reef Life Survey, a supervised citizen science group – to compare trends in fish populations in unprotected marine areas, protected areas that allow for some fishing, and protected areas that prohibit fishing. Data was collected repeatedly from 533 sites around Australia from 2005 to 2015 for large fish species – those bigger than 20cm in length, such as snapper, bream and parrotfish. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon They found the biomass of large fish had declined by 36% on fished reefs and 18% in marine park zones that allowed for limited fishing. “Because we were measuring the fish in the fished areas and comparing them to the same species in the unfished areas – and we found substantial differences in the trend over the 10-year period – we can ascribe that to the impact of fishing,” study co-author Trevor Ward, a marine scientist from UTS, said. He said the work also found there was some level of effect from what they assumed was climate change: “That is, the fish species would still be declining to an extent, even if they weren’t fished, because their habitat is changing.” Ward said there was a strong need for “highly precautionary fisheries management” but that greater use should also be made of no-take marine protected areas that prohibit recreational or commercial fishing. “Marine reserves are a natural consequence of wanting to protect both the ocean ecological system and the fisheries so that in the course of things we can safely catch more fish.” On Tuesday, the Greens urged the government to establish an independent scientific review of Australian fisheries stock. “This study also shows that marine parks can be successful fisheries management tools but we simply don’t have enough of them or enough protection within them to deliver widespread benefits,” the Greens senator and healthy oceans spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, said. But the assistant minister for agriculture and water resources, Anne Ruston, questioned the paper’s conclusions and said Australia’s sustainably managed commonwealth fisheries were “world-class”. “The paper contains flawed arguments and conclusions, which are not supported by the weight of publically available evidence,” she said. “The commercial catch for all fish stocks is set at ecologically sustainable levels and, for the fourth consecutive year, no fishery solely managed by the commonwealth has been subject to overfishing.” She said the Greens had “failed to present any information to suggest a review is warranted.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/05/tougher-race-hate-laws-nsw-as-government-reverses-position-again","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T06:41:09Z","webTitle":"Tougher race hate laws for NSW as government reverses position again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/tougher-race-hate-laws-nsw-as-government-reverses-position-again","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/tougher-race-hate-laws-nsw-as-government-reverses-position-again","fields":{"headline":"Tougher race hate laws for NSW as government reverses position again","bodyText":"The New South Wales government has again reversed its position on reforming the state’s race hate laws, widely criticised as outdated and ineffective, announcing its intention to introduce tougher penalties for inciting violence. The attorney general, Mark Speakman, on Tuesday announced new penalties for public threats or incitements to violence made on the basis of race, religion or sexuality. Those who breach the proposed laws would face up to three years’ imprisonment and an $11,000 fine, replacing the current six-month prison term provided for in the Anti-Discrimination Act. The proposed new laws are the result of a concerted lobbying campaign from an alliance of 31 ethnic community groups in the state, which united under the umbrella organisation Keep NSW Safe. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The government has drawn a very important line in the sand, and this is a great day for the residents of NSW,” the group’s spokesman, Vic Alhadeff, told Guardian Australia. But the announcement is also a change of position for the NSW government. In December, Speakman said there were “no present plans to amend section 20D of the Anti-Discrimination Act”. That’s despite the former attorney general Gabrielle Upton acknowledging in 2015 that the laws were broken and promising to introduce a bill in early 2016. The existing race hate laws in NSW have been on the books for almost 30 years. There has not been a single successful prosecution in that time. Their inadequacy was made clear in 2015, when the director of public prosecutions was left unable to charge Ismail Al-Wahwah, the leader of the fringe Islamic movement Hizb ut-Tahrir, who called for a “jihad against the Jews”. Speakman said the proposaed new laws sent a “very clear message” that inciting violence would not be tolerated. “People who incite violence are a threat to community safety,” he said. “If passed, these laws will help protect individuals and groups from being targeted by cowards who seek to cause physical harm to innocent people.” Alhadeff, who is also chief executive of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said Keep NSW Safe had been lobbying government since 2016. That had involved “scores” of meetings, he said. “The government deserves credit for responding to our concerns and identifying the need for the legislation, and taking this most important step,” he said. The state’s shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, welcomed the government’s announcement, but said it had taken far too long. “It has been five years in the waiting but I am pleased that the state government is finally adopting our position,” Lynch said. “The community has waited far too long for this day and it is shameful that the government has been so inactive on this issue for so long.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/06/rana-plaza-disaster-bangladesh-brands-ikea-new-safety-accord","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T05:42:09Z","webTitle":"Brands including Ikea shun new safety accord after Rana Plaza disaster","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/06/rana-plaza-disaster-bangladesh-brands-ikea-new-safety-accord","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/06/rana-plaza-disaster-bangladesh-brands-ikea-new-safety-accord","fields":{"headline":"Brands including Ikea shun new safety accord after Rana Plaza disaster","bodyText":"American retailer Abercrombie and Fitch, Swedish furniture giant Ikea and the clothing label of rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs are among the brands yet to sign a new accord to uphold the safety of millions of garment workers in Bangladesh. The pact follows on from the Bangladesh Accord, the largest of the safety agreements signed between brands and unions five years ago after 1,134 garment industry workers were killed in the collapse of the Rana Plaza building on the outskirts of Dhaka. The accord expired on Thursday, and another similar agreement, the Alliance for Worker Safety, will run out at the end of the year. Under both, factory owners were made to improve the structural and fire safety of their buildings in order to keep supplying to major western brands. So far about 176 of the 220 companies in the Accord have signed its extension including H&amp;M, Zara and Primark. But the shortfall means about 250 factories supplying to western brands would no longer be monitored under the scheme, according to Rob Wayss, the executive director of the Accord. They include factories supplying to Abercrombie and Fitch, the British retailer Edinburgh Wool Mills and Sean Comb’s label Sean John. Abercrombie did not respond to questions. Edinburgh Wool Mills has been contacted and Sean John could not be reached. Campaigners have also called on Ikea to sign up to the new accord which, unlike its predecessor, is also open to non-garment companies producing textiles in Bangladesh. Ikea told the Guardian it shared the objectives of the accord but preferred to work under its existing company-wide code of conduct called IWAY. The code is considered rigorous but does not make suppliers or the findings of inspections public. Worker fatalities have fallen dramatically and more than 100,000 identified safety issues have been resolved in the past five years under the accord and alliance. But their expiration this year signals a new, more uncertain phase for efforts to improve conditions in Bangladesh’s garment factories. The new accord is being challenged by disgruntled factory owners in the Bangladesh high court, which has allowed the extended scheme to operate until December while it hears the case. The alliance, which oversees factories supplying to brands including Gap and Walmart, is still negotiating about whether it can continue its work after it expires this year. Both the Bangladesh government and peak bodies for the powerful garment industry have said they want the international agreements scrapped as soon as possible, insisting Bangladesh is ready to monitor safety itself. “The validity of accord and alliance will not be extended after due time. Bangladesh no longer needs these two organisations,” the country’s commerce minister, Tofail Ahmed, said last week. “Their validity will not be extended for due reasons. Activities of such organisations no longer belong in the world.” Factories inspected by the Bangladesh government have shown significantly less progress towards alleviating safety issues than those overseen by the Accord and Alliance. As at February, less than 15% had fixed even half their outstanding dangers, according to the International Labour Organisation. International scrutiny is also dwindling. This year is the first since 2013 that Bangladesh has not been singled out for examination by the ILO at its annual standards conference in Geneva this week."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/05/jacinda-ardern-will-work-up-until-she-goes-to-hospital-to-give-birth","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T04:28:32Z","webTitle":"Jacinda Ardern will work up until she goes to hospital to give birth","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/jacinda-ardern-will-work-up-until-she-goes-to-hospital-to-give-birth","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/05/jacinda-ardern-will-work-up-until-she-goes-to-hospital-to-give-birth","fields":{"headline":"Jacinda Ardern will work up until she goes to hospital to give birth","bodyText":"New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, will not give up her office until she arrives at hospital to give birth, it has been revealed. Ardern will be only the second world leader to give birth while in office – the first being Pakistan’s Benazir Bhutto in 1990. The prime minister’s office has released Ardern’s birth plans saying she will deliver her baby at Auckland hospital but intends to travel up until her due date of 17 June. When she is admitted to hospital to give birth she will hand the reins to the acting prime minister, Winston Peters. The statement from the prime minister’s office said there were contingency measures in place if Ardern has the baby while she is travelling. The statement said Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford, would “share with the public some moments with their new baby” at the hospital but expect privacy during the six weeks she will have off work. Ardern has said she will still be in close communication with Peters and her cabinet while she is on leave. An announcement of the birth is likely to come via Instagram – the medium Ardern used to initially announce her pregnancy. Ardern discovered she was pregnant six days before she became prime minister-elect in October last year and then announced the news in January. “I think it’s fair to say that this will be a wee one that a village will raise, but we couldn’t be more excited,” she wrote at the time. Tuesday’s statement said that because of the public interest there would be a round of interviews given to major domestic media outlets close to the time Ardern returns to work. However, this would be the only formal media opportunity set aside for interviews related to her baby. At the end of her leave Ardern has said she intends to resume all prime ministerial duties."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/live/2018/jun/06/state-of-origin-2018-game-i-new-south-wales-blues-v-queensland-maroons-live","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-06T12:34:14Z","webTitle":"State of Origin 2018 Game 1: NSW Blues beat Queensland Maroons – as it happened","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2018/jun/06/state-of-origin-2018-game-i-new-south-wales-blues-v-queensland-maroons-live","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/live/2018/jun/06/state-of-origin-2018-game-i-new-south-wales-blues-v-queensland-maroons-live","fields":{"headline":"State of Origin 2018 Game 1: NSW Blues beat Queensland Maroons – as it happened","bodyText":"Thanks for your company tonight. NSW will leave Melbourne as happy as they could have hoped, and I’ll leave you with Mike Hytner’s match report. See you next time. Final thoughts NSW have the upper hand in the 2018 Origin series after this win tonight. Better yet for them, game 2 is in Sydney (on June 24). I don’t think even the most maroon of Maroons supporters could say NSW didn’t deserve it tonight. Their 11 debutants were nerveless and they held their nerve when Qld, inspired by a tireless Greg Inglis, came from eight down to lead 12-8 early in the second half. Particularly impressive for NSW were Tedesco, Damien Cook and Tom Trbojevic, while the team’s old head, James Maloney, didn’t let some personal errors (both of which led to Qld tries) shake his confidence. He finished with three try assists. Qld seemed to have the better of NSW in the forwards, their defence regularly keeping NSW pinned in their own 30m. But it was around the ruck NSW carved out enough space to make inroads, and once they were up against a broken defensive line they had the speed to make Qld pay. In a game of momentum swings the turning point came when NSW scored twice in five minutes to turn a six-point deficit into a six-point lead. James Tedesco has been named MOM. Tim Griffiths returns to let us know the meeting was “rubbish”. Aren’t they all, Tim? Anyway, he’s happy! “ONE IN A ROW, ONE IN A ROW, ONE IN A ROW!” Technically, Tim, it’s one-third in a row. NSW need to win one of the next two matches to make it two-thirds which, in a mathematical twist, adds up to 1 in Origin series. Greg Inglis, who was brilliant tonight: “Little things cost us. Can’t fault the effort. That was terrific. Just key moments cost us in the second half.” James Maloney (3 try assists) speaks: “Impressive. It went in swings and we had time we were rucking out of our own end and kicking long. But the boys kept turning up. The debutants all handled the occasion well. I knew [Cleary] was suited to this. And [Tedesco] was outstanding.” Blues fans surely won’t be getting ahead of themselves. Last year NSW won the opener and were ahead at halftime in game 2: That’s all she wrote! NSW open the ledger for 2018. 80 min: Last minute of the game, Qld kicking in centrefield. Qld regather but they’re tackled and at the call of ‘handover’ from the ref the NSW players allow themselves a moment to embrace. 79 min: Tedesco with 223m tonight in surely a man-of-the-match performance. 79 min: Maloney finds Addo-Carr 2m out. He shimmies in front of Gagai and is pulled down a few centimetres short, losing the ball in his attempt to reach out. Still, the game appears won. Even Qld can’t win from here. 78 min: NSW get six again and they’re still 10m out looking for the killer blow! 77 min: Possible try to NSW! Latrell Mitchell on his back out on the left reaching out for the line with Anthony Milford under him... No try! Milford slipped a hand under the ball to stop Mitchell touching down. There was a millimetre in it. So, held up. But NSW come again. 76 min: A let off for NSW! Qld move it left and Morgan, seeing Trbojevic racing in, catches and kicks in one motion. Had he put one less lace on it it may have sat up for Holmes but it hits the corner post. That’s a 20m restart for NSW. In another world, Earth 2 perhaps, that sat up for Holmes to score. 75 min: Campbell-Gillard knocks Gavin Cooper on his arse with a bellringer. But what’s this?! A 40-20 by Qld! Here we go! 74 min: Smart play by Maloney who grubbers into touch inside Qld’s 20m giving his side a breather and a chance to gather their thoughts. 73 min: Addo-Carr pulls Chambers down on the right, 40m out from NSW’s line. Tedesco cleans up a Qld kick as Peachey comes on for Roberts. 72 min: If you’ve watched Origin for more than five minutes you’ll know this is not over. From marker 45m out, Tedesco, from marker, slips through three tackles as if he’s smeared in peking duck fat. He races 15m before he’s hit amidships by Morgan. But Tedesco stays on his feet, and passes left where there’s an ocean of space. One pass to Maloney who floats a long ball to Addo-Carr. He steps past Chambers and touches down, his boots dangerously close to the sideline. Maloney just misses the conversion from the left touchline. 70 min: Possible try to NSW! Addo-Carr over in the left corner after another Tedesco break! 68 min: Cook muscles Morgan over the left touchline after the Qld custodian ran himself into a cul-de-sac, 30m out from the NSW line. 67 min: Qld bring it out from their own 30m line as the crowd figure is announced: 87,122. 65 min: On the NSW 20m, Munster runs in a circle looking for support players. A bomb follows and Addo-Carr leaps over Chambers and he looks to race downfield. Ah, but he leapt from his own in-goal and that’s a 20m restart. Had it been play on Addo-Carr might have had a 100m sprint for the line. 62 min: 10m out Munster is called for a knock-on after the ball came loose when he looked to offload. Can NSW get out of their own territory? Not if Inglis has anything to say about it! Inglis pulverises Cleary after a hospital pass from Jake Trbojevic. On the last Maloney reefs the ball down field but it runs touch in goal. Qld with the 20m restart. 61 min: NSW just aren’t stopping Qld in defence. But Addo-Carr is! He jumps onto Chambers like a cheetah on a zebra as Chambers looks to skirt down the right touchline. Next play Qld bomb and drag the NSW receiver over the goal-line. NSW drop out! Qld on top. 59 min: With Cook down, Qld go left and Inglis is into open space! But he’s brought down 30m out before Qld move it right. But on the third Chambers kicks ahead for himself and NSW say thank Gawd for that. Odd decision from Chambers. 58 min: Hunt kicks to Trbojevic again and once more he comes up with it safely. NSW are struggling a little here; they look gassed. They are playing forcings back and losing ground on every set. 57 min: Tedesco tries to crawl out of his own 10m line such is his desperation. Qld throwing the kitchen sink at NSW in an attempt to keep them pinned down. NSW kick but Qld come again. 55 min: Trbojevic takes a bomb nicely. He looks so at home on this stage. As does Cook. And Inglis, but there’s no surprises there. He’s been immense tonight, Inglis. 54 min: NSW working it out from their own half before it’s kicked to the Qld 20m line. Chambers is met by a gang of Blues who now have their tails up. 52 min: Credit to Tedesco for the hand he had in both those tries. Maloney, too ,who could have been hanging his head after his two errors led to two Qld tries. Phil Gould has just said Maloney has a terrible memory which in football can sometimes be an asset it seems. From five metres inside the right touchline Maloney converts. What a turnaround, NSW with 12 points in six minutes. ... who rises above Inglis, pulls the ball from the arms of Holmes, and falls over the line! What a try! The refs had a good look at it but they couldn’t take it off NSW. 50 min: On the halfway line Tedesco does a two-step on Kaufusi and Chambers and races to the Qld 20m. Next play Maloney kicks wide for Trbojevic ... No obstruction! Not even close. Maloney goes left to Tedesco who double pumps before putting Latrell Mitchell into a small gap a few metres out, and he muscles over! Maloney misses the conversion from a few metres inside the left touchline. 47 min: A big break for NSW! Gagai, on his own 20m, gets up to play the ball and loses it as Angus Crichton peels away from the tackle. Crichton helped but Gagai’s hold on the ball was tenuous. Can NSW strike right back? Yes! I think. Mitchell crashes over out wide but the on-field call is ‘no try’ due to a possible obstruction. 45 min: Since I’ve mentioned it a few times I should update you on the speed men. Addo-Carr has recorded the top speed so far: 36.3 kph ahead of Holmes 35.2. Holmes magnificently steers it over from the right touchline. After being down 8-0 Qld have got their noses in front. At second receiver Hunt kicks in behind Addo-Carr and Dane Gagai races through to beat Tedesco to the ball! That forward pass has cost NSW dearly! 43 min: Maloney makes up for it with daisy cutting tackle on Chambers after Hunt seemingly put him over the line. But it hardly matters because... 41 min: A deep kick by Hunt on tackle 4. Tom Trbojevic traps it delicately with his right boot before picking it up. Late in the count Maloney passes left to Mitchell but it’s ruled forward. If that’s forward, every pass Cameron Smith has passed since the under 8s has been forward. 41 min: NSW kick deep... Anyway, players are back out. We’re good to go! Lots of talk on social media about sartorial matters. Another has said the NSW coaching staff look like they are about to launch a new iPhone. Not spectacular, but a solid half of Origin football all the same. No sign as yet that the 14 debutants on the field look overawed. The momentum has swung from team to team. At first it was with Qld until NSW gained the upper hand and scored. They looked like doing so again until Holmes’ intercept try in the 28th minute put Qld back on the front foot. Back soon. Half-time reading? This will fill the time and more: That’s oranges! 40 min: Hunt bombs to Tom Trbojevic’s wing this time and the young Manly man does brilliantly to hold onto the pill in the shadows of half-time. 39 min: NSW run it on the last, 30m out, with Maloney passing left to Mitchell who immediately passes back inside to Cordner. But it’s slightly behind him and NSW turn it over. 37 min: A quick play the ball sees Morgan cut into NSW’s 20m line dragging Blues jerseys behind him. Qld shift right and Hunt kicks cleverly in behind where Addo-Carr and Gagai contest the bouncing ball on the try-line. It goes dead in goal. Initially the call is for a NSW drop out but the replay shows Gagai got the last touch. A welcome break for NSW who look to be feeling it at the moment. 36 min: Great tackle by Frizell on his own goal-line to stop a flying Arrow from point blank range. Don’t think Arrow realised that was the last tackle. Handover. 35 min: Chambers kicks for himself from 20m out and Tedesco tries to shepherd it over the dead-ball line with Chambers in pursuit. The margins are so fine at the end that Tedesco has no option but to run the ball dead. Drop out. 33 min: That Holmes try: 31 min: Cleary slips but offloads on the half before Cook grubbers for himself. Optimistically. He’s nowhere near regathering and it gives Qld a run into NSW territory for the first time in a while. Hunt bombs to Addo-Carr on the last and he takes it safely despite three maroon jerseys bearing down on him like missiles. 30 min: Qld needed that and no doubt that will give them a fresh take on things just when they were looking weary. How will NSW respond to the setback? Qld have no specialist goalkicker so they’ll be hoping to score under the posts all night. Holmes knocks it over from in front. INTERCEPT! Inside Qld’s 20m NSW spin it right and Maloney tries a long ball to Trbojevic which Holmes reads like a comic, plucking the ball out of the air and racing 80m to score under the posts. Had Holmes not caught that NSW would have had an overlap and likely try but on such small margins... 27 min: BOOM! Greg Inglis leaves the line and blindsides Tom Trbojevic with a mammoth hit, the young Blues’ head rocking back like he’d been hit by a bumper car. But it’s a penalty to NSW because Inglis was metres offside when he took off. 24 min: Chambers drops the ball again, although this time he may have had a hand. Either way, NSW are on the attack again. But now they drop it. A let off for Qld. Over she goes! A nice buffer to NSW with a quarter of the game gone. Fastest man on the pitch so far is Tedesco at 35.1kph. Out of interest Usain Bolt’s top speed ever recorded was 44.72kph, recorded during his world record run in Berlin in 2009. First try of the night to NSW! Damien Cook ducks out of dummy half and he finds a gap left by McGuire. Angling left he beats Kaufusi and dishes off to Maloney who sprints 15m before passing inside to Tedesco who skips away 20m to score beside the left upright! 21 min: Queensland shift right and Hunt puts Kaufusi into a hole! He then passes right to Chambers but the centre spills it with open pasture ahead of him. 19 min: According to GPS data the NSW backs have travelled 10% more distance than their Qld counterparts so far. In the commentary booth Darren Lockyer says Qld would have been relieved NSW took the two. They look tired, he says. The Blues must have been tempted to keep the pressure on but this is a gimme. 17 min: Tactical penalty? Dylan Napa comes in late to slow a NSW play the ball under the posts and he’s pinged. Take the certain two? Yes. 15 min: Another bust by Addo-Carr gets NSW into Qld territory. After Cleary steps inside to take on the line, Maloney grubbers in behind for Cordner. Qld clean up but that’s another drop-out. NSW building ... 13 min: On the fifth Cleary finds Cordner on the burst from 5m out but he’s tackled and held up over the line. Good defence by the men from Queensland. 12 min: NSW hit the Queenslander’s hard but they hold firm. On the last Cook grubbers between the posts and Morgan touches down in-goal. Drop out. 11min: Tedesco and then Addo-Carr make great ground from inside their own half and you can hear the register of the crowd rising as the Melbourne flyer gets his mitts on the ball. Next play Maloney is held back and NSW are awarded a penalty. This will put them right on the attack! 9 min: Morgan takes another bomb and almost catches Holmes by surprise, off-loading inside his own 10m line. Holmes does very well to bust a couple of tackles and gain 20m. 7 min: NSW needed that. A penalty which will help them push into Maroon territory. And on the fifth Tyson Frizell gives Inglis a magnificent fend. Maloney then kicks on the last but Morgan rises to the challenge and takes it after a juggle. 5 min: NSW’s line holds under pressure as Qld shift left (where Inglis is wrapped up by Roberts) and then right. Morgan’s grubber to the right is secured by Tedesco. NSW are struggling to get out of their half giving Qld great field position. And here’s Inglis with a half break down the left! 3 min: Holmes bent in half by Damien Cook on the halfway line. Next tackle NSW are penalised for holding the man down. Great opportunity for the Maroons. 2 min: Qld begin their first set on their 30m line after Cleary’s clearing kick drops shorter than he would have liked. On the last Addo-Carr does well to field a bomb and he skips past the first tackler. 1 min: Qld kick us off and Klemmer takes the first hit up, imitating a car with a severed brake cable entering a car park. The players are making their way down the tunnel and onto the MCG. Greg Inglis leads out the Maroons, featuring three debutants, Jai Arrow, Felise Kaufusi and Andrew McCullough. And here come the Blues to a chorus of boos — as you’d expect in Victoria which, to a person, will never get over the fact that NSW has Sydney Harbour and they have Port Phillip Bay. Time for Advance Australia Fair, with the first word pronounced ‘advarnce’, very much against convention in NSW and Qld. Tim Griffiths writes in with a lament: “[I’m] depending on text coverage as some inconsiderate so and so booked a meeting right across Origin time. Who does that? Probably a Queensland supporter. “Can we please take a moment to recoginse that NSW have already won, in terms of facial hair. Step forward Reagan Campbell-Gillard.” It is a fine mo, fo sho. Part YMCA, part Burt Reynolds. The trolls are out from under the Twitter bridge: Meanwhile, an Aussie great makes her allegiances clear: “Is this the biggest game in NSW Origin history?” is a question asked of Paul Gallen. It’s certainly the biggest game in NSW Origin history since the last biggest game in NSW Origin history. I think we can all agree on that. Does any sporting occasion do hyperbole as well as State of Origin? Maybe in America, certainly in America, but Origin could be the best of the rest. Even the AFL, which lays it on thicker than Barbara Cartland used to do, can’t outdo Origin. Speaking of Nine commentators, here’s Brad Fittler, in a pea coat, being interviewed by Andrew Johns. In past years it’s been Fittler conducting the pre-game interviews. He looks as relaxed as you could be when you’ve bet the house on a team of rookies. Cameron Smith, who has played more Origins than the entire NSW squad tonight, is in the Nine commentary box. He was always headed there but I’m surprised he’s arrived so early. Be interesting to see if his on-field smarts translate to the microphone. I suspect they will. Oh alright then, here they are for real — although that bloke on the right could be league reporting legend Steve Mascord. Electronic duo Peking Duk have just cranked out a number on stage (that could be worded better) but I can’t say I paid much attention. I could show my age and ignorance by saying ‘Pekinhg Duk? Never heard of them!’ but I won’t. NSW, as you’ve heard, have 11 on debut, the most in an Origin team (excepting 1995 when the ARL excluded Super League players) since the NSW Game 3 side in 1994. As such no-one in the team has played in a series winning match (Boyd Cordner only played game 3 in 2014, a game NSW lost after winning games one and two). The player I’m most delighted to see picked is Josh Addo-Carr. NSW Origin teams have shown in the past they are reluctant to pick (relatively) svelte wingers, and I recall here the scandal of Nathan Blacklock never winning Blues berth. So all speed to the fastest man on the pitch tonight. I know it’s gimmicky but I love the real-time info emanating from the tracking devices the players wear these days: Excitement is building in the ’G which will host its fifth Origin match, with the Blues holding a 3-1 advantage. The last time Origin came to Melbourne was for game two in 2015, a thriller won by NSW: The first time was in 1990 – though this video makes it seem like 1890: NSW walked, Qld got the bus. Lazy buggers. There was plenty of talk this week that Ben Hunt and Dane Gagai were struggling with injury. Was it a classic game of ducks and drakes, par for the course for the Maroons who will happily walk backwards from the centre of a room so they can say they have their backs against the wall? Was it legit? Whatever your take, both have been named as starters tonight. As expected, Michael Morgan goes to fullback in place of the injured Slater, while there is no room, even on the bench, for the dynamic Kalyn Ponga. For all the talk of major absences in the Qld team the Maroons have plenty of talent still on show, not least Inglis, Hunt, Morgan, Val Holmes and last year’s game 3 star, Cameron Munster. NSW, by contrast, are a team picked on both form (eight players from the ladder-leading Dragons and Panthers) and promise, and they certainly look capable of winning tonight despite having just 39 caps between them. As mentioned, there are 11 debutants on show: Tom Trbojevic, Latrell Mitchell, James Roberts, Josh Addo-Carr, Nathan Cleary, Damien Cook, Reagan Campbell-Gillard, Jack de Belin, Paul Vaughan, Angus Crichton, and Tyrone Peachey. The Blues have turned green by walking to the ground tonight. (Did they forget their Myki cards?) This would have put them within heckling distance of all the Qld fans making their way to the MCG. Not quite like walking down Caxton St towards Lang Park but potentially unsettling all the same. Brad Fittler must have weighed up whether the exercise could backfire and put extra jitters into his team of fledglings. Apart from 2014, which turned out to be the eye of the storm, Queensland has, since 2006, torn through State of Origin like a cyclone. Eleven of the past 12 series have been won by the Queenslanders, in no small part because, blessed by providence (and, quite possibly, the power of pineapples), the Maroons have had at their disposal a collection of modern greats all peaking at the same time: Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Billy Slater and Greg Inglis. If there was any consolation for long-suffering NSW fans – who have had to huddle in their cellars for so long with their tinned food, army-cots and chamber pots that they’ve forgotten what happiness feels like – it was that one day time would catch up on the greats and the storm would pass; that one blessed day they could swing open the cellar doors, feel the sun on their faces again and look up at the sky and see blue. Only blue. With game one of the 2018 Origin series about to kick off it seems a reasonable time to wonder if that day is suddenly upon us. Change was in the air after the 2017 series when Thurston and Cronk (37 and 22 Queensland caps respectively) called it a day. Then, just weeks ago, Smith (40 caps, and perhaps the chief architect of NSW’s misery) surprised everyone by suddenly retiring from rep footy. If that wasn’t fortuitous enough for NSW, Slater (29 caps), this week succumbed to a hamstring injury, having already announced 2018 would be his last in maroon. Not since 2003 has Queensland been without at least one of these players. Throw in the dropped Darius Boyd (28 caps) and Matt Scott (22) and, even though Greg Inglis (30 caps) is still there, it’s a relatively inexperienced Queensland side coach Kevin Walters will send out onto the MCG turf tonight. Of course, intriguingly, an even more inexperienced NSW side will face them. New coach Brad Fittler has seemingly drawn a line through a number of players who have ‘been there, lost that’ for NSW over the years. It’s as if Fittler remembered that pop jargon definition of insanity: “Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.” In any case, Fittler, who had much success wearing the Blues jersey himself, figured a fresh start was needed and he has recruited an incredible 11 Origin debutants, men who aren’t mentally scarred by the Maroons. Callow they may be but they are also young, fast, imposing and, you’d think, optimistic that they can begin to end, once and for all, this incredible Queensland era. Of course, history may show that while the old Queensland era ends tonight – a new one will begin. It’s an intriguing scenario and I truly don’t know what to expect tonight. If I HAD to make a prediction it would be NSW by eight, which pretty much guarantees a Queensland win. Good to have your company for what should be a cracker of a match. Kick-off: 8pm-ish local. Oh, I should of course mention that I’d love to hear your thoughts and predictions on the game tonight.

As debate on the Kosciuszko wild horse heritage bill resumed in the NSW parliament on Tuesday, the International Union for Conservation of Nature wrote to the government warning that damage to the park because of the plan would hurt Australia’s reputation. In the letter, addressed to the NSW environment minister, Gabrielle Upton, and seen by Guardian Australia, the IUCN says it is concerned the bill has “social and economic implications as well as conservation impacts”. It states that “damage to the ecosystem and biodiversity values of the Kosciuszko national park due to the proposed management actions would be detrimental to the reputation and status of Australia and NSW’s record for nature conservation”. It calls on the state to find a science-based outcome that respects the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act. Former managers from the parks and wildlife service told Guardian Australia they were concerned the bill was an attempt to change the way the Kosciuszko national park was managed. Graeme Worboys, an associate professor at the Australian National University’s Fenner school and a former executive director of the parks and wildlife service, said the bill was “not about the welfare of horses”. “It’s about the transfer of the management direction of the Kosciuszko national park from the National Parks and Wildlife Service to a community advisory panel,” he said. “This is a transfer of the management of Kosciuszko from ecological caretakers – the rangers – to horse managers. It’s basically destroying the environmental protection of one of Australia’s greatest national parks.” David Darlington, a former regional manager of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, including of the area covering Kosciuszko national park, said the bill “is one of the biggest attacks on the National Parks and Wildlife Act that I’ve ever seen”. “Whenever I returned to that same area, it was just so obvious that the horse numbers and the impacts from horses had increased and that was the situation at every site,” Darlington said. The NSW government says its bill will still allow for the removal of brumbies from the park through trapping. “The proposed brumby legislation seeks to strike the best balance between the heritage status of brumbies and the protection of Kosciuszko national park,” a spokesman for Upton said. “It provides for the removal of brumbies from the national park, which is in line with community expectations and is also consistent with preserving the natural environment of the area.” NSW Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Penny Sharpe, said it was “an extraordinary step” for the IUCN to write to the environment minister to ask her “to intervene to save the Kosciuszko national park from one of her colleagues”. The bill has been moved by the deputy premier and NSW Nationals leader, John Barilaro."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/jun/10/a-night-with-the-tough-guy-book-club-blokes-beers-and-conversation","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-09T22:02:57Z","webTitle":"A night with the Tough Guy Book Club: blokes, beers and conversation","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/10/a-night-with-the-tough-guy-book-club-blokes-beers-and-conversation","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/10/a-night-with-the-tough-guy-book-club-blokes-beers-and-conversation","fields":{"headline":"A night with the Tough Guy Book Club: blokes, beers and conversation","bodyText":"Squeezed around a table in the Irish Times pub on Little Collins Street, the men of the Melbourne city “chapter” of the Tough Guy Book Club seem pleased I’ve asked to join them. Welcoming me warmly, the nine of them shuffle around to make room and thoughtfully clear the ruins of their pub meals from in front of me. “Here’s a menu,” one says. “Can I get you a beer?” asks another, adding to the good first impression the group is making. So good, in fact, I’m unnerved. Have I’ve walked into an ambush? Is this a men’s rights group in disguise? Are they Amway salesmen? Happy clappers? Bronies? The feeling lingers as the chapter president, Lucas Earl, a bearded 27-year-old in jeans and a long-sleeve baseball T-shirt, suggests we make a start. But before we begin discussing this month’s book – Kim Scott’s 2010 Miles Franklin-winning That Deadman Dance – everyone at the table, as is customary, must introduce himself. “But don’t mention what you do for a living,” clarifies Earl, pointing out to me, and another newcomer, that “no work talk” is rule two of Tough Guy Book Club. “Rule one,” he adds, is “no dickheads.” “Well, that’s me out then,” I say, getting up from my chair as if to leave, which raises a few chuckles and puts me a little more at ease. In turn, each man – ranging in age from, at a guess, mid 20s to mid 50s – briefly takes centre stage. Snippets of their lives emerge. One is recently married. One expresses pride in his daughter’s sporting endeavours at the weekend. One is needing an evening like this after a tough week. When it’s his turn, the other new attendee – late 40s, clipped beard, amiable, chatty, a father – says matter-of-factly that he has come along this evening because he’s a book lover but also because he doesn’t have a lot of male friends and it’s an absence that he feels needs addressing. The men around the table find neither a sudden impulse to inspect the ceiling or make a joke to extinguish his candour as if it’s a spot fire in the undergrowth. Nor do they engulf him with the kind of mammarian bear hug Meat Loaf’s bosomy character, Bob, gives Ed Norton’s character in Fight Club. Rather, they take the revelation with an equanimity that suggests they understand where he’s coming from. As Earl tells me later, TGBC – which costs members nothing but the price of the books they read and any pints and parmigianas they might choose to consume – is not a self-help group. It does, however, strive to foster a supportive culture for men. “One of the intentions is to give blokes a safe space, a space they can share with other guys who, no matter what they do, or what age they are, or where they’re from, are equals.” *** Last year the Australia Council for the Arts released a survey of Australia’s book reading habits. It showed, staggeringly, that 75.1% of the males surveyed classed themselves as non-readers (compared with 24.6% of females). Of the 24.9% of males who claimed to be readers, only 39% read frequently. On that basis the Tough Guy Book Club is like a snow leopard convention, a place where members of a rare species can mingle with likeminded souls, and perhaps even marvel that they’re not alone in the world. But as Earl has pointed out, TGBC – which has 12 chapters in Victoria, five in Queensland, three in Tasmania, and one each in Canberra and Sydney, with a 23rd in Portland, Oregon – is not just about reading and discussing books. Nor is it simply an excuse for a midweek drink. Men could join any old book club for that. “If you’ve been a guy for more than 30 years you know that there are things broken [with masculinity],” says TGBC’s founder, Shay P Leighton. “You know that we guys have problems. Among other things, we need to talk more.” Leighton is informed by personal experience. About six years ago he experienced the demise of a relationship, a business, and some close friendships in a short space of time. “And that resulted in some shabby behaviour [from me],” he says, suggesting that his life began to stultify. “Nobody asked me for years if I was OK. I worked in hospitality for 15 years and knew thousands of people but no one was checking on me.” It was then that a friend, Tom Scott, returned from overseas. “He could see I was a mess and he asked me if I was OK. I said, ‘No, I’m not.’” Knowing Leighton enjoyed organising events, Scott suggested he start some kind of club. After considering a chess club, Leighton proposed a book club. The idea behind that, and the club’s ban on work talk, he suggests, had long been gestating. “One of the first things men say when they meet a new man is, ‘What do you do?’ It frames their whole [interaction]. For me, working in hospitality, I only ever talked about work. At some point it felt like I had nothing else to say. And I thought that was very strange. I couldn’t tell someone who I was, only what I did for money.” From the outset they called their venture Tough Guy Book Club – a name open to interpretation. Does it refer to the authors? The readers? Both? Is it intended ironically, perhaps, to play on an idea that tough guys – “real men” – don’t read books? “It’s a funny name,” allows Leighton, but it’s one, he says, chosen to tap into one of the club’s aims; to explore and challenge the popular idea that a man should be physically tough, stoical and consistent despite the world moving on around him. “I’ve been told my entire life that I’m meant to be tough but I honestly can’t explain to you what that means. I know I’m meant to be it but I don’t know what it is ... So we do read lots of books with what could be thought of as tough characters in them ... and we chop down and get to the core of what makes a man tough.” The purpose of this, he says, is to spark a conversation about masculinity at a time when “[male] suicide rates are going through the roof, where we are killing partners and each other at extraordinary rates, and there’s a raft of less dramatic things that are hurting us; loneliness being one of them. “But what happens if you have no one in your life, if you don’t have any friends, if you haven’t talked to any one, or had a decent relationship for years? And you’re told to stay the same. How do you improve things? How do you learn to change? “I think you can learn from other people’s stories, by putting yourself in their shoes, by experimenting with what you want to do, what you want to be. So reading books about tough characters and exploring their actions and thoughts can help you work out what needs to change and improve in your own life. And explaining that to someone else gives you a sounding board, a way to work through and process this stuff.” Over the past year the club’s reading list has included As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner, East of Eden by John Steinbeck, Johnno by David Malouf, Ham on Rye by Charles Bukowski, The Dispossessed by Ursula Le Guin, The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway, James Ellroy’s The Big Nowhere, Home by Toni Morrison and The Jesus Man by Christos Tsiolkas. After a run of heavy subject matter there’s often a lighter, palate cleanser thrown in: the latest book, was Douglas Adams’ The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. The club’s annual book list – chosen in advance by Leighton and a few others during a day spent drinking whisky and beer (“My favourite day of the year,” Leighton says) – certainly tends to the male and muscular but Leighton says they are conscious of diversifying. “Guys haven’t been great at reading queer authors, authors of colour, female authors ... How are we going to learn things and be more 3D participants in the world if don’t read people who have different experiences and ideas from our own?” This seems to fit with rule one and a question asked of those looking to join the group’s Facebook subgroup, The Pool Hall: “Lastly, our number 1 rule at TGBC is our “100% don’t be a fuckhead rule”. This means don’t be a prick, including any kind of anti-woman, anti-LGBTI, or racist bullshit. If you understand, answer OK.” The first meeting of the TGBC took place in a Collingwood bar in 2012 and the only members were Leighton and Scott. Before long a man approached them and, learning that they were a nascent book club, asked to join. Social media, posters and word of mouth led to more chapters being opened. The club, run by Leighton with the help of other volunteers, has no bookkeeping. As such, numbers are sketchy, but there are more than 5,700 followers on Facebook, some 530 members on the Pool Hall, and Leighton estimates that between about seven and 16 men attend each of the 23 chapters every month. Interestingly, he adds, many new arrivals admit they haven’t read a book since high school: “We hook them with the promise of beers and the cool pictures on the website.” Of course, TGBC also offers the lure of companionship. Considering its growth, Leighton must be pleased with how things have worked out. “Yes,” he concedes when pressed, “but I’m not seeking accolades. That’s dickish.” TGBC has naturally led to friendships forming outside the confines of the book groups. It’s also spawned an annual camp held over the AFL grand final long weekend (yes, they watch the game). Last September about 50 members from around the country attended. “It was like going back to primary school,” says Earl, who joined TGBC in 2016 after moving to Melbourne from Sydney. “We slept in bunks, in dorms, we did archery lessons, bush craft lessons. It was fantastic. As with the monthly meetings we all got to meet men we’d never otherwise cross paths with.” *** Returning to my evening at the book club, which is peppered with “beer breaks” – affording opportunities for smaller, more personal conversations to break out – we’re deep into a discussion of That Deadman Dance. In it, Kim Scott explores the first contact between the Noongar people of Western Australia and 19th century Europeans. When it’s mentioned that Scott is Indigenous someone at the table wonders aloud if a white man could write a similar book. This sparks an engaged and interesting conversation about cultural appropriation, the ownership of stories, the creative reach of authors, and about men finding themselves in strange environments. Having been in book clubs before, usually as the only male, I’d felt like a stranger in a strange land myself at the start of the evening. So much so that I’d wondered, cynically, if there had to be an ulterior motive to all this male conviviality. But in the end it was just what it said on the cover: blokes, books and beers. “People think there’s an agenda and they are always trying to work it out,” Leighton says. “If there is an agenda it’s that men are not OK right now. It’s simple. We need to read more and we need to talk more.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/05/meanjin-editor-sorry-insensitive-metoo-cover","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T02:56:07Z","webTitle":"Meanjin editor sorry for insensitive #MeToo cover","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/05/meanjin-editor-sorry-insensitive-metoo-cover","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/05/meanjin-editor-sorry-insensitive-metoo-cover","fields":{"headline":"Meanjin editor sorry for insensitive #MeToo cover","bodyText":"The editor of the Australian literary magazine Meanjin has apologised for the cover design of its latest issue, which scribbled out its Indigenous title to create the #MeToo hashtag. Jonathan Green acted quickly to apologise for what he said was his own “blindness” to the cover treatment of the word Meanjin, which is the Turrbal name for the land that became Brisbane. Green, who is also a presenter on ABC Radio National, said he had tried to create an “arresting” cover to illustrate a feature about the #MeToo movement. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “I was wrong to do it,” Green wrote on the Meanjin website on Monday. “Meanjin is the Turrbal word for the land consumed by what became Brisbane. It has been the title of this magazine since its foundation in 1940. “To put it simply, the word is more than just the name of a magazine, and it shouldn’t have been mine to obliterate in a design flourish.” Green told Guardian Australia it was too late to do anything about the cover because it had already been printed and distributed, but it was a valuable lesson that will “stand out there” as a reminder of our need to be more sensitive. On Monday, not long after the pink cover of the quarterly magazine was posted on Twitter by Green, it was called out by several Indigenous women, including journalist Amy McQuire, who said it felt “weird” to see “Meanjin” crossed out because the “destruction of land, cultures and language is fundamentally tied to violence against Aboriginal women”. Two non-Indigenous writers who contributed to the winter edition, Clementine Ford and Anna Spargo-Ryan, later added their voices to the apology and pledged to donate their fees to a cause for Aboriginal women. Founded in Brisbane in 1940, Meanjin (pronounced Mee-an-jin) is now published by Melbourne University Press, and is funded by the university and through subscriptions and sales. Green said it was a reminder of his privilege that he failed to see what is now so obvious. “It’s a reminder that the human stocks of this magazine could be enhanced by a broader range of backgrounds and mindsets in the editorial process. “Meanjin is a constant publisher of Indigenous voices and concerns. This is work of the greatest importance to us as a publication, a publication that does what it can to place Indigenous thoughts and history at the heart of the national cultural conversation. “I should therefore have known better. We work with words; the power of this erasure should not have been lost on us.” Green’s contrition was mocked by some News Corp journalists, including the Australian’s Chris Kenny and Janet Albrechtsen and the Daily Telegraph’s Tim Blair."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/08/a-guide-to-the-aflws-expansion-signing-and-trade-periods","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-08T02:37:02Z","webTitle":"A guide to the AFLW’s expansion signing and trade periods","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/08/a-guide-to-the-aflws-expansion-signing-and-trade-periods","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/08/a-guide-to-the-aflws-expansion-signing-and-trade-periods","fields":{"headline":"A guide to the AFLW’s expansion signing and trade periods","bodyText":"With the completion of the AFLW’s official expansion signing and trade periods, club lists are now being finalised in the lead-up to the next draft, the date of which has yet to be announced but is likely to be held in mid-October. While this club-by-club analysis focuses on players, each club also traded draft picks, with the finalised draft order included below. Adelaide Crows In: Renee Forth (GWS) Out (expansion): N/A Out (trade): Talia Radan (Melbourne) Delisted: Sophie Armistead, Georgia Bevan, Abbey Holmes, Rachael Killian, Calista Boyd (rookie), Becchara Palmer (rookie), Brianna Walling (rookie) It has been quite a stable trade and expansion period for the Crows, who have been able to retain most of their 2017 premiership side in a big win for the club. Talia Radan reportedly left for more opportunities at the Demons, which she may well get with Mel Hickey gone. Renee Forth has plenty of upside if she can return to her best – she was a marquee signing for the Giants in 2017, but lost 18 months to football after an ACL injury. Brisbane Lions In: Lauren Arnell (Carlton) Out (expansion): Kaitlyn Ashmore, Brittany Gibson, Tahlia Randall, Jamie Stanton (North Melbourne) Out (trade): Nicole Hilderbrand (Collingwood) Delisted: Renee Cowan, Kalinda Howarth, Molly Ritson. Jessy Keefe and Ruby Blair were initially de-listed but have since re-signed. The Lions were always likely to lose four players to the expansion clubs, and of those Brittany Gibson and Kaitlyn Ashmore will likely hurt the most. Gibson, a steal at pick 141 in the inaugural draft, was inside the top 30 for disposals in 2018, and also had three goals in a season of low-scoring contests. She, however, hails from Tasmania, and the Kangaroos have an alliance with the island state. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Likewise, former priority pick Ashmore is a Melbourne University football alumni, and will re-join team-mates including Emma Kearney and Mo Hope at their affiliated club, the Kangaroos. Like Gibson, Ashmore also kicked three goals for the Lions in season two, and was a popular team-mate. Astute recruiting welcomes Lauren Arnell, the former Blues captain who had fallen out of favour with the Carlton coaching panel in 2018. At 31, Arnell is a veteran of the competition, but pick 40 was unders for someone with renowned leadership skills. She is also an ambassador of the game and respected media personality –and will help raise the profile of the Queensland side. Carlton In: Amelia Barden (Collingwood) Out (expansion): Kate Gillespie-Jones, Danielle Hardiman (North Melbourne) Out (trade): Maddie Gay (Melbourne) Delisted: Madeline Keryk, Laura Attard, Kate Shierlaw, Sarah Last, Tiahna Cochrane (rookie), Katie-Jayne Grieve (rookie) The Blues hadn’t finalised their list at time of writing, but have announced their delistings. Kate Shierlaw was selected as rookie in 2017 as a possible key forward option, but with Tayla Harris’s arrival the odds were against her to survive. Madeline Keryk is a surprise given how highly she was rated internally in her first year – appointed joint vice-captain at just 21. Things could have been much worse for the Blues, however, with reports previously suggesting that captain Brianna Davey wanted a trade out of the club. They will be delighted to have kept her, as well as stars in Darcy Vescio and big-name signing Harris. Amelia Barden crosses from Collingwood to follow former assistant Daniel Harford, newly-appointed coach of the Blues. In 2018 she ranked fifth for tackles with 47, and will bring pressure and excellent stoppage work. Collingwood In: Nicole Hilderbrand (Brisbane) Out (expansion): Jess Duffin, Jasmine Garner, Mo Hope, Emma King (North Melbourne) Out (trade): Millie Barden (Carlton), Christina Bernadi (GWS) Delisted: Caitlyn Edwards, Meg Hutchins, Tara Morgan, Lauren Tesoriero, Bree White (retired) It’s hard to describe this as anything but a disaster period for the club. Jasmine Garner outperformed marquee Hope as a forward, and was fourth in the competition in season two for marks, while she kicked five goals (equal with Harris and Vescio by way of comparison). Christina Bernadi, meanwhile, had a breakout season, culminating in an All-Australian selection. A memorable 16 possessions and three goals against Brisbane was a highlight in the penultimate round of the season. Presumably the Pies had no intention of losing her, which is perhaps why she became part of an extremely complicated five-way deal on the final day of the trade period. Likewise, Emma King was a Collingwood marquee and ranked fourth for hit-outs as one of the premier rucks of the competition. Jess Duffin was ranked elite in season one, and is also a professional cricketer in the mould of Emma Kearney. In sum, the Pies have effectively lost their entire first-choice forward line and their ruck. They’ve also recently lost their third women’s football operations manager in three years in Matthew James. Fremantle In: N/A Out (trade): N/A Out (expansion): N/A Delisted: Stacey Barr, Kirby Bentley, Lara Filocamo, Tiah Haynes, Amy Lavell, Emily McGuire, Jodie White, Jade De Melo (rookie), Beatrice Devlyn (rookie), Lisa Webb (rookie). The Dockers narrowly averted a disaster on the final day of trade period when it looked like Dana Hooker would head east to reigning premiers the Bulldogs. Hooker was All-Australian in 2018, and ranked inside the top 10 this year for disposals. Her story, as a single mother who had a baby daughter just a few months before being drafted, is seriously inspiring stuff. Media reports claim the Dogs had little of “value” to offer the Dockers for Hooker, which highlights a key teething problem for the competition. As it stands, players nominate the state they would like to be drafted to, which is for the best given most are still working full-time and aren’t approaching anything like a professional wage. But, given the bulk of talent located in Victoria, interstate clubs can be short-changed when draft picks and their order are effectively meaningless. It is surprising to see Lara Filocamo delisted after two excellent seasons, while Indigenous talent Emily McGuire kicked two goals in a stunning debut. Geelong In: Cassie Blakeway, Maddie Boyd, Richelle Cranston, Kate Darby, Renee Garing, Rebecca Goring, Mel Hickey, Erin Hoare, Jordan Ivey, Phoebe McWilliams, Danielle Orr, Anna Teague The Cats’ trade and expansion period has largely been overshadowed by the Kangaroos’, although time will tell which approach proves the more shrewd. While North Melbourne have opted to poach talent from existing AFLW clubs, Geelong have signed a raft of players from their VFLW side, and have picked experienced players to fill gaps. The acquisition of Melbourne vice-captain Melissa Hickey is a coup, given she will bring both experience and family legacy: she is the granddaughter of Geelong legend Reg Hickey’s cousin, and will wear Reg’s famous No 18. Geelong have also benefitted from being awarded two compensation selections – pick No 1 and No 2. This was explained by the AFL as a means to level the playing field with Geelong completing less signings than North Melbourne (13 to 17). GWS Giants In: Christina Bernadi (Collingwood) Out (expansion): Phoebe McWilliams, Maddie Boyd (Geelong) Out (trade): Renee Forth (Adelaide) Delisted: Melissa Freckelton, Bec Privitelli, Alex Saundry, Pippa Smyth, Renee Tomkins, Haneen Zreika (rookie) The Giants will be disappointed to lose the talented Phoebe McWilliams, but have done well to otherwise avoid an exodus down south to the expansion clubs. Signing All-Australian Bernadi, however, should more than compensate that loss after her breakout season for Collingwood. Renee Forth was originally a marquee selection but spent 18 months recovering from an ACL injury before struggling to find top form in season two. Melbourne In: Maddie Gay (Carlton), Talia Radan (Adelaide) Out (expansion): Richelle Cranston, Melissa Hickey, Erin Hoare, Anna Teague (Geelong) Out (trade): Jasmine Grierson, Emma Humphries (North Melbourne) Delisted: Lauren Duryea, Alyssa Mifsud, Maddie Shevlin (rookie) It’s surprising to see Alyssa Mifsud on the list of delistings: she led the Demons’ goalkicking in season one, but could add only one more major in season two. Still, with Richelle Cranston’s departure – particularly after a much-improved second season – the Dees look short on goal-kicking options. Vice-captain Hickey’s departure hurts their leadership stocks, but Talia Radan and Maddie Gay should offer more midfield depth, with Gay making her way to her preferred destination at the last possible minute. North Melbourne In: Kaitlyn Ashmore, Daria Bannister, Jenna Bruton, Jess Duffin, Jasmine Garner, Brittany Gibson, Katherine Gillespie-Jones, Jasmine Grierson, Danielle Hardiman, Mo Hope, Emma Humphries, Emma Kearney, Elisha King, Georgia Nanscawen, Tahlia Randall, Ash Riddell, Maddison Smith, Jamie Stanton, Sophie Abbatangelo The Kangaroos have had an outstanding expansion signing period, with a list the envy of the competition in only their first year. So impressive was their recruiting that Lions coach Craig Starcevich even claimed it wasn’t in the “spirit” of AFLW. Their signings are headlined by best and fairest Emma Kearney, a dual All-Australian and key cog in the Bulldogs’ midfield. Just don’t ask the Bulldogs what they got for losing her. She’s joined by a bevy of ready-made stars in Hope, Emma King, Ashmore and premiership player Jenna Bruton as just some of the sought-after list. Western Bulldogs In: Belinda Smith (Fremantle) Out (expansion): Daria Bannister, Jenna Bruton, Emma Kearney (North Melbourne), Aasta O’Connor (Geelong) Out (trade): N/A Delisted: Jess Anderson, Rachel Ashley, Laura Bailey, Kim Ebb The Bulldogs will be desperately disappointed to lose Kearney, but she was integral to their 2018 premiership and was always upfront about her longstanding connection with Melbourne University, with whom the Kangaroos are aligned. Still, it is a travesty they were awarded a third-round pick for losing the competition’s best player as well as two premiership players. Daria Bannister is a Tasmanian local, which may explain why the Kangaroos appealed, but she was also rated highly by the club, who took her at pick 19 after a standout Under-18 carnival. Aasta O’Connor has long been with the club, including as captain during the exhibition series period, and her leadership will be missed. Bruton is likewise a premiership player who they wanted to keep. The Dogs pursued Dana Hooker late from Fremantle, but were unable to provide the Dockers with adequate compensation to clinch her. But they have re-signed 22 players from their premiership-winning season after a focus on list retention.

Sokratis Papastathopoulos is the favourite, as the big centre-back is on the verge of completing a £16m transfer from Borussia Dortmund. But coming up quickly on the rail is Marouane Fellaini, who might favour a move to London over Milan. Papastathopoulos has reportedly snubbed José Mourinho to join the Emery revolution, so Manchester United fans can file this whole bundle under Swings/Roundabouts. Claude Puel is still at Leicester City. His last roll of the dice involves sanctioning the transfer of Riyad Mahrez to Manchester City, but only if he gets 21-year-old winger Patrick Roberts in return. Roberts, who has been hoovering up trophies in Scotland with Celtic, would cover £15m of Mahrez’s £75m price tag. The Foxes also want Abdulkadir Omur, an 18-year-old striker at Trabzonspor. Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool can come together as one in celebration of Zinedine Zidane’s recent resignation as Real Madrid manager. Zidane had been planning on a raid on the Premier League for Eden Hazard, David de Gea and Sadio Mané. But now? Well, the window doesn’t shut for another three months and there are still plenty of column inches to fill, so let’s rule nothing out. In the meantime, there’s still a managerial vacancy at the Bernabéu to fill. Antonio Conte, Arsène Wenger and Max Allegri are all in the mix, though Real haven’t given up on Mauricio Pochettino quite yet. Conte is still at Chelsea, of course. But he’ll be ousted in favour of Laurent Blanc any day soon, according to underwhelming reports. Southampton don’t fancy another relegation scrape, and will sign rare Stoke City success story Xherdan Shaqiri for £12m … unless Tottenham Hotspur nip in first. Crystal Palace don’t fancy another relegation scrape, and will offer Christian Benteke to anyone that’s interested. No takers yet. And Cardiff City will announce themselves to the Premier League by signing Everton striker Oumar Niasse and Besiktas midfielder Tolgay Arslan."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/05/queensland-woman-charged-after-allegedly-riding-horse-while-drunk","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T07:27:54Z","webTitle":"Queensland woman charged after allegedly riding horse while drunk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/queensland-woman-charged-after-allegedly-riding-horse-while-drunk","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/05/queensland-woman-charged-after-allegedly-riding-horse-while-drunk","fields":{"headline":"Queensland woman charged after allegedly riding horse while drunk","bodyText":"A woman has been charged after allegedly riding a horse through the drive-through section of a Queensland bottle shop while highly intoxicated.

This morning the UK government sold a 7.7% stake in the bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland, raising £2.5bn but crystallising a £2.1bn loss on the price originally paid to rescue the bank. The final cost of the bailout could be £30bn... or perhaps even more. The government defended the timing of the sale but some analysts suggested it was done to get it out of the way before the Brexit vote next week. Critics said it was a wasted opportunity to help reform the banking sector. The other big development was culture minister Matt Hancock’s decision on the bids for Sky. He gave the go-ahead to the Comcast offer, and also the bid from 21st Century Fox, provided the Murdoch-controlled business agreed to sell Sky News to Disney or another buyer. Sky welcomed the news, which is likely to prompt a full takeover battle for the business while 21st Century Fox said it had already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney. But Labour expressed concerns about the sale of Sky News, saying its independence must be protected. Elsewhere the latest snapshot of the UK services sector showed stronger than expected growth which lifted the pound - on the basis it puts an interest rate rise back on the agenda - and sent the FTSE 100 0.7% lower. On that note, it’s time to close for the day. Thanks for all your comments, and we’ll be back tomorrow. Here is a handy run-through of the possible timetable for the Sky bids, courtesy of Jefferies analyst Jerry Dellis: Comcast’s Rule 2.7 announcement of 25 Apr outlined its intention to make a Takeover Offer for Sky subject to pre-conditions being met. Competition clearance from the EU is now the final pre-condition. A decision will be made by 15 June according to the EC Competition website. Comcast has said that it will issue an Offer Document within 28 days all pre-conditions being met (implicitly by 13 July). Within 60 days of this, Sky must convene the shareholder meeting at which the Comcast proposal is to be voted on (by 11 Sep). Assuming it is not blocked by the Culture Secretary, Fox would announce a firm offer around 19 June. High Court approval would then be sought and the Scheme of Arrangement document would be posted out within 28 days of the offer announcement (around 17 July). Sky’s shareholder meeting would need to take place within 21 days (7 Aug) with court approval after that. In reality, Sky’s board will need to manage timetables such that shareholders are able to give adequate consideration to both offers. Sky shares have edged up 0.29% to £13.54 after the US government cleared the Comcast and Fox bids for the company, albeit the latter was given the go-ahead on the condition that Sky News was sold. Meanwhile Royal Bank of Scotland has closed down 5.3% at 266p, compared to the 271p a share the government received in the sale of the latest tranche of its shares. Overall the FTSE 100 finished down 0.7% at 7686.8, undermined by a rise in sterling after better than expected service sector figures put a possible interest rate rise back on the agenda. Elsewhere the US tech boom continues: A bidding war for Sky is now on the cards but it is hard to judge how much higher the offers will go, says Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com: Sky shares traded up about half a per cent [on the day] at £13.55 as the Fox and Comcast bids were effectively waved through by culture secretary Matt Hancock. The commitment by Fox to let go of Sky News always looked like it be sufficient to assuage the media plurality concerns. For Comcast there were never any media plurality worries as it’s got little European presence. A bidding war looms of course. The bid on the table from Comcast is an all-cash offer worth £12.50 per share, so an increased offer is priced in already. But the fact that the shares are not roaring higher suggests investors are displaying some hesitation about whether Murdoch will significantly increase his offer. He may not have to - the option for Fox is to switch from the current Scheme of Arrangement to a Takeover Offer, which would allow it to use its 39% of shares in the vote. Then it’s up to Comcast and we’ll see just deep the pockets are - how badly does it want to diversify from the US and get exposure to Sky’s attractive recurring revenues in Europe? The fact it thinks the deal would be accretive to free cash per share from year one suggests it can. And all this is muddied by the fact that Comcast has admitted it is in advanced stages of preparing an offer for the businesses that Fox has agreed to sell to Disney. A bidding war seems on the cards but we just don’t know how far either side will push this. Comcast shares are down a touch and are around 25% lower from their highs this year, indicative of investor fears about it paying over the odds. Disney shares were also a shade lower and are around 10% off their 2018 highs. Either way it’s shaping up to be a battle royale between Comcast and Disney this summer and Sky shareholders will be winners now the deals have been cleared by the government. Ben Bird, media sector specialist at management consultancy Vendigital, said: The culture secretary’s decision to allow the 21st Century Fox bid to go ahead, subject to a request that Sky News is divested, is essentially good news for the consumer as the consolidation is all about safeguarding content. It will be especially heartening for others in the media sector that the CMA is not intending to block the bid. This could be a sign that the organisation has recognised that there is a real need for medium and large-scale companies in the sector to leverage their scale. Sky is not immune to the disruption facing the industry, with the rise of agile competitors such as Amazon and Netflix. Attracting the attention of consumers has become more difficult and the business needs to reduce costs where it can, whilst continuing to produce quality content. Other media companies will be willing the bid to complete successfully – particularly with the outcome of the CMA’s investigation into Trinity Mirror’s proposed takeover of Northern &amp; Shell still pending. More from the CMA: The full CMA report is available here. From the 414 page Competitions and Markets Authority report on the possible Sky bids, here is its view on the timetable for a Sky News sale: Sky shares have done little since Hancock unveiled his decision on both the Comcast and 21st Century Fox bids. They stood at £13.53 when Hancock stood up, and are now almost imperceptibly higher at £13.56. That compares with the £10.75 a share on offer from Fox, and the better offer from Comcast of £12.50 a share. Here’s a link to the full statement from Matt Hancock on both bids for Sky: Here’s the key section from Matt Hancock’s statement -- outlining why 21 Century Fox must sell off Sky News in return for the government approving its takeover for Sky. I agree with the CMA that divesting Sky News to Disney, as proposed by Fox, or to an alternative suitable buyer, with an agreement to ensure it is funded for at least ten years, is likely to be the most proportionate and effective remedy for the public interest concerns that have been identified. The CMA report sets out some draft terms for such a divestment, and Fox has written to me to offer undertakings on effectively the same terms. The proposals include significant commitments from Fox. But there are some important issues on the draft undertakings which still need to be addressed. I need to be confident that the final undertakings ensure that Sky News: remains financially viable over the long-term; is able to operate as a major UK-based news provider; and is able to take its editorial decisions independently, free from any potential outside influence. As a result, I have asked my officials to begin immediate discussions with the parties to finalise the details with a view to agreeing an acceptable form of the remedy, so we can all be confident Sky News can be divested in a way that works for the long term. Under the legislation, I am required to consult formally for 15 days on the undertakings. Subject to the willingness of the parties to agree the details, I aim to publish this consultation within a fortnight. I am optimistic that we can achieve this goal, not least given the willingness 21st Century Fox has shown in developing these credible proposals. However, if we can’t agree terms at this point, then I agree with the CMA that the only effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether. This is not my preferred approach. Here’s a clip of Chris Bryant suggesting that Kay Burley will drive Matt Hancock out of parliament if Sky News hits the buffers. Anything Martin Bell can do, Kay can do too..... Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine says her party has concerns about Fox’s proposed takeover of Sky. She welcomes the plan for Sky News to be divested... but wonders if rival bidder Comcast will give similar reassurances about media independence if it wins the battle for Sky. Matt Hancock replies that Comcast has given undertakings and assurances. By law, he looked at its bid for Sky because of its material size. He concluded that Comcast’s bid did not raise public interest concerns, so the government will not issue an intervention notice. Hancock adds that he hopes the Sky takeover battle will reach a conclusion that “demonstrates with confidence” that Sky News will be independent and viable, so parliament can be content with the state of media plurality in future. Back in parliament, Labour MP Chris Bryant has criticised the proposal for Sky News to be sold off if 21st Century Fox wins the takeover battle for Sky. He warns that Sky News could be starved of money by whoever buys it (either Disney or another owner). So, in a few years they’ll come back to the government and ask to be subsumed back into Fox. To laughter, Bryant suggests that Matt Hancock could even find himself facing a TV news veteran at the polling booth. Kay Burley will be out of a job, and she’ll stand in West Sussex and defeat him, because most people in this country would prefer a diversity of ownership of media and we want to keep Sky as independence as possible. Hancock replies that he relishes the prospect of a contest in West Sussex with anyone (!) but doesn’t accept that Sky News will be starved of funds in the future. Here’s a clip of Tom Watson telling parliament that Labour has serious concerns about the proposed sale of Sky News, and that the channel’s ‘independent and rigorous’ independence must be protected. Here’s our media editor, Jim Waterson, on today’s announcement: The UK government has approved a bid from US media giant Comcast to take over Sky, while indicating it is minded to approve a rival bid from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox providing it sells Sky News to another organisation. The decisions are likely to set up a multibillion-pound bidding war for the British broadcaster. Fox is attempting to buy the 61% of Sky that it does not already own, in a deal valuing the company at £18.5bn, but the bid has been complicated by concerns that it would leave Murdoch with too much control over the UK media. Comcast, which owns US TV network NBC and Universal Studios, made a rival bid earlier this year that valued Sky at £22bn. The culture secretary, Matt Hancock, approved the Comcast deal in a statement in the House of Commons, while indicating he will also approve the Murdoch deal if Sky News is offloaded to an appropriate buyer in order to avoid excessive influence by the the mogul’s family over the UK news business. Here’s his full story: Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox has also welcomed the government’s decision. In a statement to shareholders, 21CF says it has already submitted plans to sell Sky News to Disney (to address those concerns about media plurality). Here’s its statement: 21st Century Fox (“21CF”) welcomes today’s announcement by the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that he has cleared 21CF’s proposed acquisition of the remaining shares in Sky on broadcasting standards, as recommended by the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”). Regarding the effects on media plurality we note that the CMA recommended to the Secretary of State that divestiture is “the most effective and proportionate remedy”. 21CF has already submitted proposed undertakings to achieve the divestiture of Sky News to Disney. We note that the Secretary of State agrees with this solution and has instructed officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (“DCMS”) to agree final undertakings that he would be prepared to accept and consult on within the two-week timeframe. We now look forward to engaging with DCMS and we are confident that we will reach a final decision clearing our transaction. Sky says it welcomes Matt Hancock’s announcements (not a surprise, as it paves the way for a full-blooded takeover battle for the company). It adds: In respect of 21CF’s proposed acquisition of Sky, Sky notes that the Secretary of State considers that the undertakings provided by 21CF have provided a good starting point to overcome the adverse public interest effects of the proposed merger that he has identified, and that DCMS Officials have now been instructed to seek to agree final undertakings with 21CF. The Secretary of State has stated that, dependent on the outcome of these discussions, he would hope to be in a position to consult on any agreed final undertakings within the next two weeks. Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson is responding to Hancock now. He warns that selling Sky News to Disney could backfire, if the planned takeover of 21 CF by Disney should collapse. This could leave Sky News vulnerable. The CMA’s and Hancock have concluded that that the takeover would not threaten broadcasting standards. Watson, though, queries this view. He suggests that upcoming court cases brought against The Sun could show maladministration by Fox, which might make the minister change his view. Now onto 21 Century Fox’s takeover bid for Sky. Matt Hancock tells MPs that the Competition and Markets Authority has concluded that 21CN’s bid could operate against the public interest, for two reasons: potential erosion of Sky News’s editorial independence. Increased influence of Murdoch family trust on public opinion and the UK’s political agenda. Hancock says various remedies have been proposed. He says that the idea of divesting Sky News to Disney [which is hoping to take over 21st Century Fox] or to an alternative provider with funding for at least 10 years, is the most proportionate and effective remedy to address these concerns. Hancock is saying he will approve 21 Century Fox’s bid for Sky can proceed - if he is satisfied that Sky News’ independence is guaranteed. Hancock says he has asked officials to begin immediate discussions with 21 CF to draw up a final proposal for Sky News to be divested in a satisfactory way. Culture minister Matt Hancock says he has considered Comcast and 21 Century Fox’s bids for Sky separately. Comcast first.... Hancock rules that the deal does not does not raise public interest concerns. So, he will not be issuing an intervention notice. That’s a green light for Comcast! Heathrow questions are finally over. Matt Hancock has descended from his holding pattern and is giving his statement on the Sky takeover now. Matt Hancock will give his decision on the Sky takeover once transport secretary Chris Grayling finishes answering questions from MPs about Heathrow Airport. The government has decided to back plans to build a third runway at Heathrow, after years of prevarication. Plenty of MPs want their say. Some support the plan -- as do unions and business groups. But other MPs (especially with constituencies in or near West London) are very worried about the environmental impact. It’s also ironic that London is getting another runway while the railways network in the North of England suffers severe disruption after decades of under-investment. Our Politics Live blog has the details: The Financial Times predicts that both Sky takeover offers will get the green light from the government today. The FT’s Matthew Garrahan explains: The fate of competing bids for Sky by 21st Century Fox and Comcast will become clear today when culture secretary Matt Hancock delivers the UK government’s verdict on whether to block or clear each offer. Fox, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, has been embroiled in regulatory scrutiny for 18 months with its bid to take full control of Sky, offering £10.75 a share, valuing the company — which was founded by Mr Murdoch — at about £18.5bn. Comcast made a competing offer earlier this at £12.50 a share, which valued Sky at about £22bn. Mr Hancock is expected to clear both bids — possibly with some conditions attached — setting the scene for a bidding war for Sky. Separately, Fox and Comcast are embroiled in another takeover tussle: Walt Disney is attempting to buy Fox’s entertainment assets — including its 39 per cent stake in Sky — in a deal worth $66bn including debt. More here. Breaking away from the RBS share sale, the UK government is about to rule whether either Rupert Murdoch or US conglomerate Comcast - or both - should be allowed to take full control of broadcaster Sky. Culture minister Matt Hancock will make a statement on the situation in parliament shortly. Murdoch’s 21 Century Fox (21CF) currently owns 39% of Sky, and launched a full takeover bid in December 2016. However, the bid has been held up by concerns that it will give Murdoch too much control on the UK media landscape. In January, the Competition and Markets Authority said 21st Century Fox’s bid was not in the public interest due to concerns about media plurality. Fox has since offered some concessions, such as making Sky News a legally separative business. Comcast launched its own bid for Sky in April. It could potentially derail Murdoch’s plan to sell most of 21CF to Disney in a $66bn (£47bn) deal. So Hancock’s decision could be extremely significant for Sky’s future, and the wider media landscape.... If you’re just tuning in, here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today’s RBS share sale: Philip Hammond has been forced to defend the government’s decision to sell part of its stake in RBS after an overnight sale of shares left taxpayers nursing a £2bn loss. The chancellor said the offloading of almost 8% of the company’s shares for £2.5bn was a significant step in returning the high street bank – bailed out by Labour during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis – to the private sector. But the sale of 925m shares at 271p each was at a price significantly lower than the 502p at which the Treasury bought its stake a decade ago and led to criticism that ministers had sold at the wrong time. Hammond said: “This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt. This is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future.” John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank. Prem Sikka, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Essex, said: “Why sell? Taxpayers bailed out the bank and when there is a glimpse of recovery and profits, the government sells it at a loss to ensure that profits are collected by its friends in the City.” Shares in RBS have not traded above the price the government bought them at since 2010 and never once hit the 625p-a-share break-even price calculated by the National Audit Office (NAO) to take into account the cost of finance. More here: Hammond forced to defend RBS shares sale after £2bn loss to taxpayers Laith Khalaf, Senior Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, reminds us JUST HOW BIG Royal Bank of Scotland had become after years of dealmaking under the leadership of Fred Goodwin. ‘It’s now clear the losses sustained by the taxpayer on the RBS bailout are going to be substantial, though this really reflects the price paid for financial stability in the depths of the global banking crisis. In essence the RBS bailout cushioned the blow of the financial crisis, and spread the pain across many years, a decision which is now beginning to become more measurable. We will never know what the outcome would have been if RBS had been allowed to fail, though it’s important to recognise the scale of RBS at the time. The bank may have its roots in the cobbled streets of Edinburgh, but it became one of the world’s biggest banks, with a £2.4 trillion balance sheet at the height of its power. To put that number in context, it’s bigger than the annual output of the whole UK economy and compares with the $639 balance sheet of Lehman’s Brothers just before it filed for bankruptcy. It’s just possible therefore that the collapse of RBS could have taken all the other dominos with it. Clearly the losses that are now being sustained on the government shareholding are deeply unwelcome, but the alternative to a bailout might have been far worse.’ My colleague Richard Partington has been crunching the numbers... The Unite union have blasted the government over today’s share sale. Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer, says Philip Hammond and colleagues should use their power as majority shareholders to improve the bank, not sell out at a loss: “The government is attempting to wash its hands with Royal Bank of Scotland at the expense of the taxpayer. This bargain basement sale of over seven per cent of the bank’s shares is a betrayal of public finances and represents a total loss of over £3 billion for taxpayers since the original bail-out in 2008. Staff are clear that the government should be focusing its attentions on keeping RBS bank branches open and improving the corporate governance of this institution. “The catalogue of failures across the bank ranging from thousands of staff cuts, closing hundreds of bank branches and also the sale of financial products which resulted in the $4.9 billion US fine demonstrates the systematic failures by the management to effectively run this organisation. Staff across the business are continuing to pay for the mistakes at the top whilst the government merely looks the other way.” Labour’s shadow City minister, Jonathan Reynolds, argues that the government is selling up at precisely the wrong moment: He’s referring to the $4.9bn (£3.6bn) penalty which the US Department of Justice hit RBS with last month, for misselling toxic securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. That fine was smaller than expected, so one of the biggest clouds over RBS has finally lifted. That should give the bank’s shares a lift in the coming months. Then again.... there’s still the risk that the UK economy falls into recession, especially if Brexit turns out badly. Jane Sydenham, Investment Director at City firm Rathbones, argues that Philip Hammond is wise to sell some shares while he can: With the economy in relatively good shape and interest rates likely to rise in the not-too-distant future, it’s a good time for the government to start selling the RBS stock. Although the sale of stocks is still loss-making for the tax payer, it’s important that the government gets as much back as possible while they can, instead of waiting too long and potentially seeing the economy move into trouble again. With this risk in mind, there is no point waiting even if it does mean accepting a loss. I’ve just realised that the true break-even price of the RBS bailout is even higher than I thought. The 625p break-even point was set by the National Audit Office last summer, when it assessed the government’s first sale of RBS shares in 2015. It is based on the cost of the government borrowing £45bn to fund the RBS bailout (the NAO estimated that UK bonds were being sold at 3.7% per year at the time.) So, that figure includes the financial cost of the rescue. But, it doesn’t cover the additional cost of repaying the debt since 2015. As this NAO chart shows, the true cost of the bailout keeps rising the longer the taxpayer holds onto its shares. So the break-even price could already be closer to £7.... In City jargon, the government sold part of its stake in RBS through an “accelerated bookbuilding process to institutional investors” In practice, that means 925m shares were sold to banks, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and other organisations who manage our money. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan all acted as ‘bookrunners’ for the placing, which means they persuaded the institutional investors to take part (readers can speculate why it takes THREE investment banks to handle this sort of thing.....). Economics journalist Dharshini David points out that the buyers will probably make a profit (once RBS’s shares rise above 271p). Some critics say the government is wasting a great opportunity by simply selling their stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. Labour MP Gareth Thomas argues that the Treasury could turn the bank into a building society with a remit to help the UK economy: Positive Money, a group which campaigns for a fairer banking system, argues that RBS should be broken up. Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money, says today’s share selloff is a ‘colossal wasted opportunity’. As well as losing the taxpayer billions of pounds, the government is also losing the ability to reshape Britain’s banking system. “Instead of selling off its majority stake, the government should use its position to break up RBS into smaller, regional banks, with alternative business models that emphasise lending to SMEs and productive industry. “Such innovation is needed to direct lending to the real economy, which has been been starved of investment in recent years.” Graham Spooner, investment research analyst at The Share Centre, recommends that RBS investors hold onto their shares. Spooner argues that the bank’s financial performance is improving, so it should resume paying dividends to investors soon. Spooner says: “Institutional shareholders paid more or less the market price [in today’s sale] so they must have some confidence in the banks longer-term recovery. As well as this, the bank could be a step nearer to paying a dividend. “The negative is that the government still have a large holding of 62.4% which is set to overhang the market for some time; the government cannot sell any more for 90 days. “While shares are up slightly from a year ago off the back of improved performance and improved confidence leading to a change in our recommendation from a ‘sell’ to a ‘hold’, shares in early trading this morning have fallen by 3.4%. We maintain our ‘hold’ recommendation due to the increased likelihood of a dividend payment and the CEO’s restructuring plans.” Nearly 10 year ago, there were suspicions that taxpayers would never recover the tens of billions of pounds that were injected into Britain’s banks as the world’s financial system was shaking at its foundations. The Labour government announced the bailout of RBS, Lloyds and HBOS on 13 October 2008 - one of many dramatic days during the crisis. Prime minister Gordon Brown declared that taking stakes in the banks would create a ‘rock of stability’ to help Britain through the unfolding crisis. But George Osborne, then the shadow chancellor, warned that the financial consequences would be severe, telling parliament: But, of course, the scale of what the taxpayer is on the hook for is only just starting to dawn on the British people: this is the biggest bail out in the world so far, paid for by the biggest increase in debt by any peacetime Government and funded by the £11,000 of extra borrowing that will now be heaped on every family in the country. Chancellor Alastair Darling insisted that the government would sell its shares ‘in due course’: In relation to ordinary shares, we will get a dividend when dividends are payable, and when we sell our shares the money will come back to the taxpayer. There was no suggestion then that Britain would still be a majority shareholder in RBS a decade later.... Prem Sikka, Emeritus Professor of Accounting at the University of Essex, argues that today’s sale is a mistake: Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index, fears the UK government will suffer further losses on its RBS shareholding: Even with carefully timed sales the government may not be able to regain the full sum it put into keeping the bank afloat. RBS is currently working through a turnaround plan designed to build it back up to its pre-financial crisis strength. Reuters’ columnist Jamie McGeever agrees: Economist Shaun Richards pins the blame on the former Labour chancellor, Alastair Darling for bailing out RBS in 2008: The BBC’s Joe Lynam flags up that RBS’s shares have fallen this morning, as the government’s stake hits the market. Newsflash: The British economy is showing signs of having come through the worst of its recent slowdown triggered by bad weather, as the dominant services sector grew more quickly than expected. The reading on the Markit/CIPS UK Services PMI rose to 54.0 in May from 52.8 a month earlier. Economists had forecast 53.0 on a scale where anything above 50 indicates expansion. The pound has jumped by half a percent against the US dollar to $1.337, on expectations that the Bank of England might raise interest rates in August. But growth at eurozone companies has slowed to its lowest rate in one-and-a-half years, Markit reports. More on this later.... Unless Royal Bank of Scotland’s share price rallies in the next few years, Britain’s taxpayers are going to suffer a massive loss on the 2008 bailout. The government still owns around 7.5 billion RBS shares. If they were all sold at today’s price of 271p, it would create an additional loss of £17bn compared to the 502p purchase price. If you include today’s sale, and the one in 2015, and the total loss would be around £20bn. But using the NAO’s break-even price of 625p, the loss on our remaining RBS shares would actually be £26.5bn. That’s on top of the £3bn loss crystallised today, and the £1.9bn loss on the 2015 share sale - taking the potential loss over £30bn. These are immense sums of money -- not far short of England’s entire schools budget of £39bn. But we need to consider the counter-factual -- what would have happened if the government had allowed RBS to fail in 2008? Alastair Darling, the then-chancellor, later revealed that RBS was about to run out of money unless he stepped in, thanks to its disastrous takeover of Dutch rival ABN Amro, and huge losses thanks to the US subprime crisis. Darling and Brown’s £45bn bailout may have helped avoid a major economic disaster, as Michael Hewson of CMC Markets explains: If the rest of the government stake is sold at a similar price then the total loss comes to something in the region of £21bn, a sizeable loss indeed from the original £45bn, but nonetheless probably needs to be measured against what the economic cost might have been if the bank had been allowed to fail. Ultimately taxpayers and politicians of whatever persuasion need to ask themselves if a £2-3bn loss on this particular stake is a price worth paying for a smaller safer bank, as well as banking system, with the upside that the billions of pound it unlocks can be better used for things like the NHS, and other public services. • This block was amended on 6 June 2018 because an earlier version referred to England’s school budget as that for the UK. Gordon Brown’s government invested £45bn into Royal Bank of Scotland to maintain financial stability following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, not in search of a quick profit. But there’s no argument that RBS has proved a disappointing investment. The bank’s shares haven’t traded above the 502p (the taxpayers’ purchase price) since 2010. And they’ve never hit the NAO’s 625p break-even price since the bailout was finalised at the end of 2008. Back in 2015, the government sold its first tranche of RBS shares at 330p each (creating a loss of £1.9bn according to the National Audit Office). The NAO also concluded that the 2015 sale achieved value for money - and indeed, it looks like a steal compared to today’s share price..... Philip Hammond is “moving to cash in his chips” by selling some Royal Bank of Scotland shares before the Brexit negotiations reach their climax, says analyst Neil Wilson of Markets.com. Wilson also points out that RBS looks to be in ‘decent shape’, compared to a few years ago. Crucially, it has also settled its long-running legal problems in America (over misconduct in the run-up to the financial crisis. He explains: RBS has come a long way in recent years. From racking up c£50bn in losses in ten years due in large part to mega restructuring charges and impairment charges, the bank has turned a corner. As noted a month ago, the settling of the DoJ case was key, removing the last big overhang and paving the way for the government to sell off its stock and for dividends to return. Attributable profits in the last quarter tripled to £792m, versus £259m in the same period in 2017, whilst the pre-tax operating profit was up 70% at £1.2bn. The government’s critics will look at these figures, and conclude that we’re selling up at the wrong time. Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland have fallen by 3.3% in early trading to 271p -- matching the price which the government sold its shares this morning. The UK government is defending its decision to sell part of its RBS stake for around half the price they paid for it. Treasury Economic Secretary John Glen says it is ‘unrealistic’ to think that Britain should hold onto all its RBS shares until taxpayers can recoup their full investment in the bank. Glen told Radio 4’s Today Programme that: I would love it if we could sell the shares at a much higher price, obviously, that is what everyone would like to do, but we need to be realistic and look at the market conditions. Glen argues that RBS is in a “much healthier position” than a decade ago, and that this is the right time to recover some money for taxpayers. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, is pleased that his largest shareholder has cut its stake: McEwan says: “I am pleased that the government has decided the time is now right to re-start the share sale process This is an important moment for RBS and an important step in returning the bank to private ownership. It also reflects the progress we have made in building a much simpler, safer bank that is focussed on delivering for its customers and its shareholders.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Nearly 10 years after the worst financial crisis in decades, Britain has managed to reduce its stake in Royal Bank of Scotland - but at a hefty loss. The UK government has sold 925 million RBS shares this morning, at 271p each. This lowers the taxpayers’ stake in the bank from 70.1% to 62.4%, raising £2.5bn for the public coffers. Chancellor Phillip Hammond has hailed the move, saying: This sale represents a significant step in returning RBS to full private ownership and putting the financial crisis behind us. The government should not be in the business of owning banks. The proceeds of this sale will go towards reducing our national debt - this is the right thing to do for taxpayers as we build an economy that is fit for the future. However, the move also crystallises a hefty loss for taxpayers. Gordon Brown’s government bought its majority stake in RBS for around 502p in autumn 2008, to protect the bank from collapsing (and possibly taking the UK economy with it). So, Hammond’s sale price of 271p means the UK has lost just over £2bn on these shares. And the damage is arguably even worse. Last year, the National Audit Office estimated that the break-even price for an RBS share sale was 625p -- once you factor in the financing costs of acquiring the shares. By the NAO’s logic, that means a loss of nearly £3.3bn today! Opposition MPs are lining up to criticise today’s share sale. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said: “There is no economic justification for this sell-off of RBS shares. There should be no sales of RBS shares, full stop. But particularly with such a large loss to the taxpayers who bailed out the bank.” We’ll be tracking reaction to the sale this morning....

The institute, Australia’s government-backed marine research agency, periodically releases results of a long-term reef monitoring program. Each reef along the Queensland coast is visited by researchers every two years to assess its condition and coral cover. The latest results, released on Tuesday, detail how major bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 have impacted on different sections of the reef. AIMS said it had no previous record of bleaching events occurring in successive years. “Over the 30-plus years of monitoring by AIMS, Great Barrier Reef reefs have shown their ability to recover after disturbances, but such ‘resilience’ clearly has limits,” the report says. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The predicted consequences of climate change include more powerful storms and more frequent and more intense bleaching events. “More intense disturbances mean greater damage to reefs, so recovery must take longer if the growth rate remains the same. At the same time, the intervals between acute disturbance events are decreasing and chronic stresses such as high turbidity and high ocean temperatures can slow rates of recovery.” Survey reefs in the northern section, the worst hit by climate-induced marine heatwaves, have lost about half their coral cover. The impacts of the most recent heatwave is not fully represented in the results, as the most recent AIMS surveys have been in the central and southern sections. The central section “sustained significant coral loss due to coral bleaching and the continued southwards spread of the current wave of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks”. Total coral cover decreased from 22% in 2016 to 14% in 2018. “The geographic scale of recent bleaching means that breeding populations of corals have been decimated over large areas, reducing the potential sources of larvae to recolonise reefs over the next years,” the report says. “It is unprecedented in the 30-plus year time series that all three regions of the [reef] have declined and that many reefs have now very low coral cover. “The prognosis of more frequent disturbances, each causing greater damage to reefs, combined with slower rates of recovery will inevitably lead to less living coral on reefs.” Imogen Zethoven, from the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report highlighted the unprecedented scale of coral loss on the reef. “We need the government to see this as a national crisis, which it is. We are responsible for the protection and conservation of this world treasure. We have a legal and moral obligation to look after it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/jun/06/steve-ciobo-overturned-mining-loan-ban-without-consulting-department","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T18:00:51Z","webTitle":"Steve Ciobo overturned mining loan ban without consulting department","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/steve-ciobo-overturned-mining-loan-ban-without-consulting-department","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/jun/06/steve-ciobo-overturned-mining-loan-ban-without-consulting-department","fields":{"headline":"Steve Ciobo overturned mining loan ban without consulting department","bodyText":"The minister for trade, Steve Ciobo, overturned a ban on government-backed loans to domestic miners last year without consulting his department. The controversial decision meant the federal government could start funding coalmining projects at a time when Australia’s major banks are increasingly distancing themselves from investing in coal. Freedom-of-information documents obtained by Guardian Australia show Ciobo overturned the ban on government-backed loans to onshore miners even though his department had not requested it. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade sent no written material to the minister arguing for the need for government agencies to start funding onshore mining projects to address a growing “market gap” for project financing. Ciobo asked the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (Efic) last year to change its mandate so it could start financing onshore resource projects. At the time, he said protesters and activist groups had so discouraged Australia’s retail banks from financing “otherwise viable exporters in the coal sector” that the government had to step in to fund a growing “market gap.” His decision came after the Commonwealth Bank indicated it would not be lending money to Adani’s proposed Carmichael coalmine in Queensland, leaving the mine without financing from any of the big four banks. NAB was the first of the big four banks to rule out lending to the Adani mine in 2015, with ANZ following suit in December 2016. In April last year Westpac became the third of the big banks to rule out funding the project, drawing criticism from the then resources minister, Matthew Canavan, who said the bank had a conflict of interest because of its interest in other coal-producing regions, and called for a boycott of the bank. The banks’ withdrawal angered Coalition MPs, who blamed “green agendas” for putting at risk potential projects in their electorates. Ciobo’s decision to overturn the ban was criticised by the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute at the time, with Rod Campbell labelling it an “extraordinary” decision. After learning Ciobo’s department had not requested the change to Efic’s investment mandate before committing taxpayer finance to the mining sector, Campbell said the government appeared determined to remove any barrier to subsidising coal in Australia, even as countries such as the UK and Canada have committed to phasing out coal. “What this FOI shows is that this was purely a political decision, made by the trade minister without any advice from the trade experts in his department,” Campbell said. “It’s concerning that the government is making decisions without expert input, particularly when the Productivity Commission has given clear advice that taxpayer funds should not be lent to large mining projects, like Adani. “Efic has met six times with Adani and refuses to rule out supporting its controversial mine. “At the very least Efic should have a policy to ensure taxpayers are not funding new coal development, in line with major banks like Westpac and NAB.” A 2012 Productivity Commission inquiry found Efic had a bias towards large corporations and Efic’s services to them were unjustified. It was particularly critical of Efic’s provision of finance to resource projects in Australia. It prompted the then trade minister, Andrew Robb, to change Efic’s statement of expectations so it could no longer provide finance to onshore resource projects. Late last year, Ciobo reversed Robb’s changes to once again include domestic resource projects. Ciobo’s office was contacted by Guardian Australia and said the issue had been dealt with in Senate estimates in October, where Labor senators’ questions about the rationale for the change were answered on notice. The answers on notice referred senators back to Ciobo’s media release announcing the change on 11 September 2017. “The changes to the mandate are in response to an increasing number of resource projects in some market segments facing difficulties obtaining private market finance for otherwise viable projects,” the release said. Asked by Guardian Australia if Ciobo received any verbal advice from the department about the need for the change, Ciobo’s office did not reply by deadline."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/06/queensland-revel-in-unfamiliar-underdog-status-in-state-of-origin-game-i","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T18:00:52Z","webTitle":"Queensland revel in unfamiliar underdog status in State of Origin Game I | Matt Cleary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/06/queensland-revel-in-unfamiliar-underdog-status-in-state-of-origin-game-i","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/06/queensland-revel-in-unfamiliar-underdog-status-in-state-of-origin-game-i","fields":{"headline":"Queensland revel in unfamiliar underdog status in State of Origin Game I","bodyText":"Some years ago, the former England rugby union player Stuart Barnes was asked to dissect a State of Origin fixture at ANZ Stadium. While declaring that the combatants were “fabulous” and marvelling at the constant collisions, after half-an-hour of play Barnes was surprised to find himself “curiously bored”. “The game’s shape is so predictable,” Barnes wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald. “In the getting-to-know-you bash-up period, the ball is almost exclusively played between the two 15-metre lines with the backs accessories to requirements.” Barnes found that “the pace is unrelenting, much quicker than nearly all union games, and the error count is astonishingly low”. He reckoned the players were in “fantastic shape and highly skilled”. He could not imagine rugby union forwards playing at such pace and with such skill. “And yet,” added Barnes, “for 30 minutes of high-octane, low-error rugby I am bored. There might be hardly any dead time but nor is there much in the way of thinking time.” Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day Whatever you make of his assessment of State of Origin – and as a raging inferno of comments below the line attested, plenty did – an outsider’s view highlighted a curious paradigm about Origin rugby league: it’s the “best” rugby league; but that doesn’t always make it the most interesting. Indeed for those without tribal loyalties to New South Wales or Queensland, the game itself can be not that great in terms of aesthetics or even entertainment. Yet Origin is, without question, compelling. It always is. People care. Games one, two and three are always among the top-five most-watched Australian television programs of the year. And not just sport, everything. Master chefs, dating shows, all that “reality” stuff is smashed by the great ratings behemoth of Origin. It’s a rivalry among the best and most storied things in world sport. And yet the matches themselves, as Barnes alluded, can be completion-fests. The rugby league is “perfect” because the players are so good at not dropping the ball. They complete sets of six tackles without error. So much respect has each XVII for the other team’s point-scoring potential, they look to elminate their chances of doing it. They eliminate risk. Origin is about attrition. It’s hard-boned bash-footy by the biggest, fastest, most skilful elite. It’s giant humans thundering into legislated space, bashing into opponents, and wriggling free so they may quickly play the ball. And repeat. And then once in the opponent’s “red zone” near their line – and mostly only then - do players rip off the tricky manoeuvres, the plays and feints and subtle touches at speed that make the game so entertaining. And yet, ironically, State of Origin rugby league is today for the outsider among the least entertaining league fixtures of the year. But this year could be different. For NSW Blues coach, the likeable and curious Brad Fittler, has assembled a squadron of players who seem to be picked from Fittler’s head as the ones he most likes to watch. The Blues’ outside backs are among the fastest quintet ever assembled. The young halfback’s silky, a gun, plays above his years. The older five-eighth’s a winner, a competitor, a funny, gnarly old throwback. And the forwards are among the biggest and most athletic people ever to play rugby league. And yet the Maroons – as they do every single year, even when trotting out the greatest rugby league teams there has ever been – will be revelling in their underdog status. They’ve been shellacked with injuries and they’re missing four of the greatest players there has ever been. But this fixture has Queensland ambush scrawled all over it in thick maroon-coloured felt-tip pen. Because if you’re talking game plan, Queensland’s forward pack is perfectly adept at bash-complete-repeat Origin footy. Their backs, even without Billy Slater and possibly Dane Gagai, are just as good and fast and skilful as the Blues’ newbies. They’ve been around and they know how to win. Captain Greg Inglis has been marred by injury the last few seasons, but his touches for South Sydney in recent weeks have been imperious. He’s a mighty player and the baby Blues backs and edge forwards will fret on the great man like matadors fronting a tricky, malevolent bull. And that could be manna from heaven for Valentine Holmes just as it was for so long for Darius Boyd. Throw in Anthony Milford, Cameron Munster, Michael Morgan and the super-freak kid from Port Hedland, Kalyn Ponga, and the Maroons have more points in them than arguing politicians. They might even be able keep Stuart Barnes entertained."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/06/super-netballs-galacticos-finally-begin-to-speak-the-same-language","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T18:00:52Z","webTitle":"Super Netball’s ‘galácticos’ finally begin to speak the same language | Erin Delahunty","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/06/super-netballs-galacticos-finally-begin-to-speak-the-same-language","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/06/super-netballs-galacticos-finally-begin-to-speak-the-same-language","fields":{"headline":"Super Netball’s ‘galácticos’ finally begin to speak the same language","bodyText":"After failing to impress in season one of Super Netball last year and losing four of their first five matches in 2018, Collingwood’s shock win over the Queensland Firebirds last weekend has enabled the “galácticos” of Super Netball to somehow recalibrate their season, which had previously been in danger of fizzling out for a second year in succession. The five-goal victory in Launceston, led by new recruit Erin Bell who shot a personal season-high 33 from 39 for an 85% return, not only puts the seventh-placed Pies back in the finals hunt, but also signals a cultural breakthrough for Kristy Keppich-Birrell’s team. One of the voices of netball in Australia, ex-coach turned commentator Sue Gaudion, says something seems to have shifted in the black-and-white camp. Sign up to receive the latest Australian sports stories every day “What I think is, something has been going on behind closed doors, something inside the group,” she says. “Maybe it was to do with the group dynamics or the coach-player relationship or some kind of internal pressure, but somehow that seems to have been rectified this week.” Gaudion says Keppich-Birrell’s “big, big call” to bench out-of-form stars Kim Ravaillion and Sharni Layton, for veteran Shae Brown and 19-year-old Matilda Garrett respectively, was key. “The win wasn’t all down to Bell stepping up and doing her job at goal attack. Two of the biggest names in the game sat on the bench,” she says. “Rav’s form hasn’t been great for some time, and no one was holding her accountable for that, but she was held accountable. In my mind, the coach stepped up and made some tough calls. Tough love calls I would call them and they worked. “You have to take into consideration too that the Pies’ season really was on the line, their backs were against the wall. It’s such a bloody Collingwood thing to do, to come out and win that match the way they did.” But the upcoming bye – they do not play again until 17 June, against the Giants in Sydney – might be a negative for the Pies. “Given their circumstances, they might prefer not to have a week to think about how they have to prove their form again,” says Guadion. The road ahead of the Giants clash also looks rocky, with games against Melbourne Vixens and West Coast Fever to follow. Only the Vixens are outside the top three at present. Australian netball legend Norma Plummer, who coaches South Africa, says the win shows the Pies’ fortunes rest heavily on the trust and “connection” between the midcourt and 31-year-old Bell. “They have been floundering at that goal attack position,” she says. “As a spectator, I have seen Erin making moves and presenting and being bypassed time and time again. You need to feed her and bring her into the game. I always tell my players to feed what’s available in the circle, work the ball and it will all happen. “You need the defenders to feel like they have to look after two shooters, not just one, which is what happens when you bypass one and always look for the other. Let’s face it, it was Erin Bell who put them on the map [against the Firebirds]. She was back to the Erin we know she can be. She did a fantastic job and that’s because she was delivered the ball. You would hope it will be a turning point for their season.” Does the win mean the Pies can take the title? “You’d have to see more wins from them before making a prediction like that,” Plummer says. Pundit and author Jenny Sinclair lauded the move to start Brown. “Caitlin Thwaites, Madi Robinson and Rav were on Diamonds duties for the Commonwealth Games for large chunks of the Pies’ pre-season, so Brown and Bell have spent lots of time together, developing a familiarity with each other,” she says. “Brown played a more important role at the weekend than people give her credit for. The biggest thing that win will do is give the group confidence, in themselves and also in their coach. And if they can keep this form, they beat anyone.” The competition can consider itself on notice."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/05/china-denies-visas-to-australian-journalists-due-to-frosty-diplomatic-relations","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T02:21:20Z","webTitle":"China denies visas to Australian journalists due to 'frosty' diplomatic relations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/05/china-denies-visas-to-australian-journalists-due-to-frosty-diplomatic-relations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/05/china-denies-visas-to-australian-journalists-due-to-frosty-diplomatic-relations","fields":{"headline":"China denies visas to Australian journalists due to 'frosty' diplomatic relations","bodyText":"A group of Australian journalists has been blocked from travelling to China because of “frosty” diplomatic relations between the two countries. The reporters have been denied visas to travel this week. Between five and eight journalists, including the veteran political reporter Paul Bongiorno, had been due to leave for China on Thursday with Bob Carr’s Australia China Relations Institute. Each year the institute takes a delegation of journalists on a China trip. Carr told ABC radio on Tuesday that after speaking to China’s ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, last week he had discovered that the visas were being blocked because of “frosty” diplomatic relations between the two countries. He told the ABC that the refusal was “more than a bureaucratic challenge”. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “I spoke to the ambassador and asked him to look at the delay we were having with his officials in Canberra,” Carr said. “He undertook to do that [but] if it were going to be an instance of frostiness currently evident in relations I told him I’d have to accept that. “It has turned out to be more than a bureaucratic challenge; [it is a] policy position.” Australia’s diplomatic relationship with China has come under considerable strain in the past 18 months as Australia’s focus on Beijing’s influence in domestic affairs has increased. Carr blamed “loose” diplomatic language from the Turnbull government for the freeze in relations. In March last year the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, gave a speech in Singapore in which she warned China that “democracy and democratic institutions are essential for nations if they are to reach their economic potential”. Then in December the Turnbull government introduced its foreign interference and espionage bills to parliament, both of which were explicitly tied to fears of Chinese influence. Carr said those events had helped lead to a situation where relations were in a more “serious state of deterioration” than they had been in previously. He said Australia’s national interest was being “trashed” by ideological opposition to China. “We’ve drifted with a different rhetoric on China since early 2017, well in advance of the anti-espionage, anti-influence legislation which was announced in December 2017,” Carr said. “Currently we’re the American ally with the most adversarial rhetorical position towards China.” He said the refusal was evidence of “frostiness” in the relationship. “It confirms other evidence, reports that the trade minister was not able to get a meting with senior Chinese trade officials,” he said. Bongiorno told the ABC that the group had been due to fly out on Thursday and that the trip had already been planned. “We’re getting the message loud and clear that Beijing and China aren’t all that happy with Australia and relations are pretty cool if not frigid at the moment,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/jun/04/trump-calls-off-philadelphia-eagles-visit-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T11:24:25Z","webTitle":"Trump calls off Eagles' visit to White House, escalating fight over national anthem","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/04/trump-calls-off-philadelphia-eagles-visit-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/jun/04/trump-calls-off-philadelphia-eagles-visit-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Trump calls off Eagles' visit to White House, escalating fight over national anthem","bodyText":"Donald Trump has disinvited the Philadelphia Eagles, the 2018 Super Bowl winners, from a planned White House celebration, escalating his clash with American athletes over protests during the national anthem.

Three of those players – safety Malcolm Jenkins, defensive end Chris Long and receiver Torrey Smith – are part of a group that publicly supported Colin Kaepernick, the NFL player who kneeled during the national anthem to protest against racial inequality. The Eagles owner, Jeffrey Lurie, reportedly did not want to put his staff in an uncomfortable position over whether to meet the president or not, anddecided to send a small contingent to the White House. Had the visit taken place, fewer than 10 players were expected to attend, according to the NFL Network. In the president’s statement, Trump rejected the offer to send a smaller delegation, saying the “1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better”. Trump said the fans were still invited to the White House “to be part of a different type of ceremony – one that will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem”. Late on Monday night, Trump said on Twitter: “The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!” On Tuesday morning, he elaborated on his plans for the day, writing: “We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3pm, The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!” Despite Trump’s contention, Jenkins and Long were not skipping the White House ceremony solely because of the president’s position that athletes should not be allowed to protest during the national anthem. The players have long criticized the administration’s policies on policing and racial inequality. Jenkins has said he would “definitely consider” meeting with the president if the visit included a serious discussion of criminal justice reform. “No one refused to go simply because Trump ‘insists’ folks stand for the anthem,” the Torrey Smith, who left the Eagles at the end of the season, said on Twitter. “It’s a cowardly act to cancel the celebration because the majority of the people don’t want to see you. To make it about the anthem is foolish,” Smith tweeted. On Tuesday morning the NFL Players Association issued a statement saying that the canceling of the White House event for the team had resulted in the cancelation of “several player-led community service events for young people” in the Washington DC area. “Our union is disappointed in the decision by the White House to disinvite players from the Philadelphia Eagles from being recognized and celebrated by all Americans for their accomplishment,” the statement said. It continued: “NFL players love their country, support our troops, give back to their communities and strive to make America a better place.” Pennsylvania lawmakers seized on the turn of events, inviting the players to tour the Capitol instead. “I’m proud of what the @Eagles accomplished this year. I’m skipping this political stunt at the White House and just invited the Eagles to Congress. @Eagles How about a tour of the Capitol?” the Pennsylvania senator Bob Casey, a Democrat, said on Twitter. Congressman Brendan Boyle, a Democrat from Philadelphia, promised coffee from Wawa, a beloved Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain, for the football champions. In a statement on Monday night, Philadelphia’s mayor, Jim Kenney, said that rescinding the Eagles invitation to the White House “only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party, which no one wants to attend”. Trump’s announcement came two weeks after NFL owners issued controversial guidelines saying teams would be fined if their players did not show appropriate “respect” for the national anthem. The policy sparked immediate backlash, though Trump celebrated the rules as a victory, saying if someone fails to stand for the anthem, “maybe you shouldn’t be in the country”. Last year, Trump rescinded an invitation for the NBA-champion Golden State Warriors to visit the White House, ending a tradition that dated back several decades. The Cleveland Cavaliers star forward LeBron James famously called the president a “bum” at the time, tweeting: “Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!” The president previously criticized the protests – meant to raise awareness about racism and police brutality in America – by saying: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now.’”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/05/shaktar-donetsk-midfielder-fred-joins-manchester-united","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T14:46:43Z","webTitle":"Manchester United agree deal to sign midfielder Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/05/shaktar-donetsk-midfielder-fred-joins-manchester-united","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/05/shaktar-donetsk-midfielder-fred-joins-manchester-united","fields":{"headline":"Manchester United agree deal to sign midfielder Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk","bodyText":"Manchester United have confirmed they have agreed a deal with Shakhtar Donetsk to sign the Brazil midfielder Fred.

Chris Grayling has criticised Govia Thameslink, Northern rail and Network Rail over the severe disruption to train services, saying it is “clear that GTR and Northern were not sufficiently prepared to manage a timetable change of this scale”. But Labour and the people of the north are turning their fire on the government with calls for Theresa May to sack the transport secretary for letting it happen. Cancellations and delays have continued despite services being reduced to minimise disruption. Today, 25 regional newspapers have taken up the cudgel, using their front pages to demand that the prime minister get a grip on the situation. In Cumbria, the suspension of the Lake Line has brought havoc for tourist firms as visitors are shuffled on to replacement buses – compounding existing problems of fewer and less reliable services. “Trains are dire in this part of the world,” said passenger Jack Eldon, 65, from London. Separately, plans for the contentious third runway at Heathrow airport are expected to be approved by ministers today. The somewhat beleaguered Grayling will present the proposal to cabinet and is expected to make a statement to MPs where he will warn there is no alternative if they block it. * * * ‘Houses became ovens’ – Rescuers have told harrowing tales of pulling bodies from the ocean of ash and debris that engulfed communities around Guatemala’s Fuego volcano. The official death toll was 62 by Monday but the final number is likely to be far higher, with scores still missing. With heavy machinery, shovels and picks, rescue workers have been trying to dig their way into houses – but the ash still holds enough heat to melt their workboots. “Every time we lift off a metal roof a huge gush of steam rises out of the building”, said rescue worker Juan Diego Alvarez. The fate of people in dozens of smaller settlements on higher plots remains unknown, and authorities fear heavy rains later this week could turn the ash on the slopes into huge mudslides. * * * Manafort bail breach – Prosecutors have accused the Trump-Russia figure Paul Manafort of attempting to tamper with witnesses. Robert Mueller’s investigation wants the former Trump campaign manager’s bail “revoked or revised” as a consequence. A court filing says Manafort made phone calls and used encrypted messaging to approach witnesses “in an effort to influence their testimony and to otherwise conceal evidence”. Manafort is facing charges of concealing millions he had earned advising pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine, conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent. Trump, meanwhile, is sticking to his suggestion that he can simply pardon himself if things get too hot with the Russia inquiry. * * * Terminal cancer vanquished – Breast cancer has been eradicated from throughout a woman’s body using her own immune cells, say medical researchers. Judy Perkins, an engineer from Florida, was 49 when she was given three years to live after a tumour spread to her liver and other areas. Researchers harvested immune cells from pieces of her tumours, grew billions more in the laboratory, separated out those that were the most effective against the cancer, and re-injected them. Tests after 42 weeks showed Perkins was completely cancer-free. Experts caution that the treatment has only proved itself in one woman, and is expensive and complex. Researchers are planning full-scale clinical trials. * * * One week to Trump-Kim talks – Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Kim Jong-un at 9am Singapore time a week from today on Tuesday 12 June, the White House has announced. “We feel like things are continuing to move forward, and good progress has been made,” said spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, adding that the White House “advance team” of military, security, technical and medical staff were on the ground making preparations. At home, perhaps to show the North Korean leader that he’s not the only one in the world presiding over a self-fertilising cult of personality, Trump has boasted of “500 days of American greatness” and how he brought them about. * * * Breath of fresh energy – An electricity company has worked out how to store electricity by freezing air until it becomes a liquid and storing it in a tank at -196C. At times of peak demand the air is turned back into a gas and rushes through a turbine to generate power. Highview Power, which operates a demonstration plant near Bury, Greater Manchester, says it may be less efficient than a lithium-ion battery but it doesn’t wear out like one either. The company argues its liquid air technology can help electricity grids cope with the variable output of wind and solar power. Lunchtime read: Five myths about the refugee crisis The emergency of 2015-16 is over. We can neatly partition “genuine refugees” from “economic migrants” and guiltlessly turn away the latter. It’s not about racism, but protecting European values. Today, Daniel Trilling, editor of New Humanist and author of Lights in the Distance, deconstructs these and other beliefs that continue to shape policy and public opinion on refugees. Sport Yaya Touré has launched a broadside at Pep Guardiola, accusing him of “having problems with Africans wherever he goes” and claiming the Manchester City manager’s coaching reputation is “a myth”. When Serena Williams withdrew from the French Open, less than an hour before her highly anticipated fourth-round match against Maria Sharapova, she admitted it was because of a pectoral injury that struck two days earlier. Jos Buttler, England’s one-day specialist, is a thinker about the game of cricket and even at the age of 27, there is plenty of time remaining for him to have a decent Test career, writes Vic Marks. Eddie Jones’s predecessor as national head coach, Stuart Lancaster, has warned the England players and management to brace themselves for a challenging tour of South Africa. Loris Karius’s calamitous performance in the Champions League final could have been a result of concussion he sustained against Real Madrid, a doctor who assessed the Liverpool goalkeeper in Boston has said.

The Mirror goes with “McINTYRE MUGGED”, calling it “TV comic’s robbery terror”. “Why weren’t they told to get out?” – the Telegraph repeats this much-asked question over a full-length picture of the burning Grenfell Tower.

Ben Rhodes describes the incident in his book, The World As It Is, which is published on Tuesday. After landing in Saudi Arabia in June 2009, Rhodes writes, US officials were taken by golf cart to “identical housing units amid the rolling desert”, in a compound owned by the monarchy. “When I opened the door to my unit, I found a large suitcase,” he writes. “Inside were jewels.” Rhodes initially thought it was a bribe aimed at him because he was writing the “Cairo speech”, intended as an address to the Muslim world, that Obama was due to deliver in Egypt on the next stop on the trip. But then he found that others in the White House delegation had received similar gifts. “We all got suitcases full of jewels,” Rhodes said in an email exchange with the Guardian. “We all gave them to the state protocol office who handles gifts. You have the option to buy the gifts, but given the price – I don’t remember what it was but it was tens of thousands, I believe – no one kept them that I recall.” It has previously been reported that the then Saudi king, Abdullah, gave Michelle Obama a ruby and diamond jewellery set worth $132,000 (£100,000) including earrings, and a ring, bracelet and necklace. Those presents, together with luxury gifts to the president and the couple’s two daughters, were handed over to the US National Archives, as required by US law. According to the state department register, Rhodes was given a pair of silver cufflinks, a man’s and a woman’s watch, a silver pen, and a diamond jewelry set including earrings, a ring and a bracelet, of an estimated total value of $5,405. Similar gift sets, of values up to $9,000, were given to 13 other White House staff. Donald Trump made his first foreign trip as president to Saudi Arabia, in May last year, accompanied by a large entourage including his wife, Melania, his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. In public, King Salman gave Trump a gold medal and chain. Gifts given to the Trump family and entourage in private have not been made public. The state department protocol gift unit has not yet published its records for 2017. Obama’s first visit to Riyadh did not go well. The Saudi monarchy refused to accept detainees from Guantánamo Bay, to help the US president fulfill his pledge to close the detention camp. Nor did Saudi Arabia offer the peace gesture towards Israel for which Obama had been hoping. Saudi relations with the Obama White House worsened further when the US negotiated an agreement in 2015 with other major powers and Iran, curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Riyadh has emerged as one of the Trump administration’s closest allies, beginning with the mutual flattery of the 2017 visit. Last month, Saudi Arabia was one of a small handful of countries that supported Trump’s abrogation of the Iran nuclear deal."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/jun/05/tech-companies-have-the-answer-to-phone-addiction-more-tech","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-05T10:00:41Z","webTitle":"Tech companies have the answer to phone addiction: more tech","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/05/tech-companies-have-the-answer-to-phone-addiction-more-tech","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/jun/05/tech-companies-have-the-answer-to-phone-addiction-more-tech","fields":{"headline":"Tech companies have the answer to phone addiction: more tech","bodyText":"Apple’s software keynotes are normally about how the ways you’ll be able to get your devices to do more, but Monday’s event had an unusually paternalistic bent. Demonstrating their new “time well spent” apps, Apple execs showed how your iPhone will get you to spend less time on your iPhone. So if you’ve spent longer stalking your crush on Instagram then you had previously planned it will say: “You went over your Instagram limit two times this week” – presumably it’s not angry, just disappointed. The current explosion of tech solutions that supposedly help you spend less time on your phone is reflective of the oversupply of exuberance still on display in Silicon Valley. Even as tech companies recognise that the amount we’re staring at screens is making us miserable, they still believe its their products that can fix the problem. Apple announced new “digital health” tools that will be found inside the settings app. The company will allow you to stop your phone from bothering you while you’re asleep, group certain notifications together and see how many times a day you check your phone – all in a bid to improve your wellbeing. Last month, Google announced a similar suite of tools, which will issue warnings if you’ve been watching for Youtube for too long and offer options to get a single daily summary of your notifications rather than being pinged throughout the day. Your phone can also be set to turn grey when you’re ready for bed, making it easier for you to put it down. All of this is at odds with Google’s advertising, which demonstrates how Google can be used constantly to help with any task. Take the ad for their voice assistant, Google Home, which demonstrates the myriad ways Google can be with you in every part of your life and the lives of your children. Facebook also introduced changes to the news feed, which they believe will lead to users spending less time on the site – but the time they do spend will be more rewarding. Google, Apple and Facebook will have to compete with existing third-party apps that promise they can make you use apps less. One called BreakFree gives you an “addiction score” based on how much you use your phone and then invites you to do better. The ironically named Self-Control allows you to block certain URLs for a period of time while you try to focus on work. It all comes after a flurry of studies that suggest overuse of technology is making us miserable. Social media use has been linked with depression, particularly among young people. One 2010 study found teenagers who spend five or more hours a day on electronic devices are 71% more likely to have a risk factor for suicide than those who spend less than an hour a day. The phrase “time well spent”, used by all three tech giants but especially Facebook, was coined by Joe Edelman. In an essay for Medium he explains how tech companies create environments that push us to act against our values. So that, for example, it may be “harder to live by the value of honesty on Instagram, if honest posts get fewer likes”. He speaks about the rigid systems of software, which demand certain behaviour: “The coded structure of likes makes it harder to prioritize not relying on others’ opinions.” Nothing in the announcements made so far will really scratch the surface of these bigger questions about the way we use technology and why it’s making so many people anxious or miserable. Using less tech is an interesting start, but tech companies themselves seem unlikely policemen to make our interactions with software less damaging to society at large. They have not, for example, suggested that they less aggressively market a linked-up set of software and hardware that locks your entire life into their ecosystem. If anything, having your device tell you how bad you are at not using it seems like just another new metric at which we can fail."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/jun/04/trump-kim-nuclear-summit-singapore-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T20:27:23Z","webTitle":"Trump to meet Kim at 9am Singapore time on 12 June, White House says","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/04/trump-kim-nuclear-summit-singapore-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/jun/04/trump-kim-nuclear-summit-singapore-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Trump to meet Kim at 9am Singapore time on 12 June, White House says","bodyText":"Donald Trump and the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are tentatively scheduled to meet at 9am Singapore time on 12 June, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said that planning for the historic summit continues. “We are actively preparing for the 12 June summit between the president and the North Korean leader,” Sanders said on Monday. “We feel like things are continuing to move forward, and good progress has been made.” Sanders said that the White House “advance team” – which features military, security, technical and medical staff - were already on the ground in Singapore. They are “finalizing preparations and will remain in place until the summit begins,” said Sanders. The announcement of the timing for the first meeting between the two leaders came just three days after Trump hosted a senior North Korean delegation at the White House bearing a letter from Kim. Trump, who had previously canceled the summit, abruptly announced the meeting was back on. Asked about the contents of Kim’s letter, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declined to “get into the specifics of the letter” but added “we feel like things are continuing to move forward and good progress has been made.“ She added that Trump is getting daily briefings on North Korea in the runup to the landmark meeting. “I can tell you the president has been receiving daily briefings on North Korea from his national security team,” said Sanders. Experts have voiced concern that despite Trump’s claim to be the world’s greatest dealmaker, he knows little about North Korea, arms control or international diplomacy. The on-again-off-again summit is expected to focus on US efforts to get North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. The oppressive regime is believed to have developed a miniaturized nuclear device that could be placed on a missile that could strike the United States. Washington has called that unacceptable and demanded North Korea embark on full and verifiable denuclearization. With days to go before the meeting, it remains unclear whether Pyongyang is willing to take that step, or whether it is using the promise of talks as a way of easing Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign. Trump last week said he no longer wanted to use that term and indicated that he was willing to embark on a lengthy series of talks that would ease pressure on the regime. “I think it’ll be a process,” he said after welcoming top official Kim Yong-chol to the White House. “It’s not – I never said it goes in one meeting. I think it’s going to be a process. But the relationships are building, and that’s a very positive thing.” Trump also said that there would be no new sanctions while the talks are taking place, although the White House was at pains to say existing economic sanctions will not be removed either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/jun/12/tim-miller-can-find-almost-anyone-can-he-find-his-daughters-killer","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-12T10:00:46Z","webTitle":"Tim Miller can find almost anyone.

Can he find his daughter’s killer?","bodyText":"Texans have a habit of taking matters into their own hands, and Tim Miller is no exception. One day in 1994, Miller drove to the home of Robert Abel, a quiet, retired Nasa engineer. He confronted Abel outside his house. They started arguing. Miller drew a .357 revolver. He held the gun to Abel’s head and demanded he confess to being a serial killer. As Miller stared down the barrel, he thought Abel’s face was strangely impassive. Suddenly, he felt the anger flush from his body. He decided not to pull the trigger, for, he later claimed, two reasons: if Abel really were a serial killer, killing him would end the possibility of identifying his other victims and bringing closure to their families. And if Abel really were some kind of psychopath, devoid of conscience and incapable of remorse, then killing him would serve no real justice. With that, Miller walked away. He broke down weeping, drove to a hospital and checked himself into the psychiatric ward. By the time he emerged, 10 days later, he knew he couldn’t go on as he was. He had to channel his grief more productively. His mission, however, wasn’t over. Sometimes, the women seemed to vanish into air. Their bodies were never found, and their faces stood frozen in time in high school yearbooks, or memorialized by forensic sketches of what they might look like, years later, if they were still alive. Other times, investigators discovered the remains of unknown victims, fated to be remembered by their police aliases – “Jane Doe”, “Janet Doe” – and doomed to take the morgue for final resting place. The bodies were all found near Texas’s I-45 freeway, which threads its way through Houston’s urban sprawl into the coastal plain before ending at the island of Galveston. Over the years, the road has earned a grim nickname among cops, crime buffs, and armchair detectives: the “highway to hell”. Journalists and law enforcement officials believe at least 30 women and girls were abducted, raped and murdered between the 1970s and early 2000s – the victims of a series of overlapping, possibly unrelated, killers, who turned the area into a kind of Bermuda Triangle of violence and sexual predation. For three decades, killers stalked the area with apparent impunity. In recent years, thanks in part to improvements in forensic technology, law enforcement agencies have arrested or named suspects in some of the killings. Many cases, however, remain unsolved – including the case of Tim Miller’s own daughter, Laura. In 1984, Laura, 16, was abducted and murdered by an unknown assailant. Her death set Miller on a one-man crusade – organizing search parties, goading the police investigation, and working to solve not only Laura’s case but all cases of missing women in the area. Miller developed considerable expertise at finding missing people, or their bodies. Families and law enforcement agencies across the country began contacting him for his help in cases of all kinds: missing dementia patients; lost toddlers; planes disappeared over sea; and suspected homicides – a seeming avalanche of murder cases, hot and cold alike. In 2000, Miller founded Texas EquuSearch, a search-and-recovery non-profit which has assisted with hundreds of missing-persons cases and located more than 400 living people and 238 bodies, according to the organization. Miller and his team have searched for missing people, or their remains, in every kind of river, lake, retention pond, bay, bayou and canal, using everything from scuba divers to sonar to tiny robotic boats. When he isn’t looking underwater, Miller looks under the earth. Once he dug the foundations out from under a house, looking for bodies. He didn’t find any, though he found a suspiciously body-shaped hollow in the earth. Even when he isn’t leading a search, or managing his day job – a construction business – Miller seems to find himself digging. “I was on my tractor from dawn to dusk yesterday, moving dirt,” he told me when I met him. “Stress relief.” In person Miller, 71, calls to mind a coiled spring, rusted, but still strong. He radiates restless energy – pacing around in his brown cowboy ropers, fumbling cigarettes from a shirt pocket, balancing a phone in the crook of his neck, fielding phone calls from victims’ families, FBI agents, sheriff’s deputies. The one case Miller has never been able to close, however, is the one that started him on his strange mission in the first place: his daughter’s murder. But now, three decades later, he believes he knows who did it. If Miller could go back, rewinding time like spools of tape, he would stop his daughter on the moment on 10 September 1984, when Laura went to use a payphone at a nearby gas station. The Millers had recently moved into a new house in League City and their phone lines weren’t set up yet. Laura wanted to call her boyfriend. She was never seen alive again. Laura suffered seizures, so when she failed to come home her parents’ first impulse was to check area hospitals. That yielded nothing, and Tim and Janet Miller turned to the police. Laura also had a history of depression and anxiety; her great love was singing, and her self-esteem never recovered after she was humiliated by a seizure attack during a solo at her school Christmas recital. Because of her mental health problems, police investigators insisted on treating her as a possible runaway or suicide. Initially, nobody noticed that Laura had disappeared 11 months to the day after another woman – from the same gas station, while using the same payphone. Heide Fye, a 23-year-old waitress, disappeared on 10 October 1983. On 4 April 1984, a couple in League City noticed their dog playing with something in the yard. It was a human skull. The dog had dragged the skull from an overgrown nearby oil field on Calder, a deserted I-45 feeder road, and brought it home to show the couple’s toddler. The police soon found the rest of Fye’s body in the oil field. She appeared to have been beaten to death with a blunt instrument. The police had no leads; the family were left to their grief and the rest of the world moved on. When Miller raised the connection, the police and the local press were, according to Miller, dismissive. “They said Laura was a ‘known runaway’,” Miller says. Thirty-five years later, anger still ripples under the surface of his face. “They said Heide Fye was a ‘known drug addict’.” Miller urged the police to search for Laura in the oil field on Calder Road where Fye had been found. They ignored him, he says, and refused him permission to search the field himself. (The League City police department declined my interview requests.) Two years later, boys riding dirt bikes near the oil field smelled a foul odor. They thought it was a dead animal. It was the decaying body, six to eight weeks dead, of an unidentified young woman, known to this day as Jane Doe. She had been shot. Her body was propped under a tree, about 150 feet from where Heide Fye had been found. While searching the field, police also came across the skeleton of Laura Miller. Tim Miller had already had a tough life before his daughter disappeared. As a child he was abandoned by his parents and lived with a series of abusive relatives. His adult life wasn’t much better; his infant son died in the crib and, a year before Laura was murdered, his brother killed himself. Throughout he’d managed to endure – until Laura. Now his life collapsed. God hated him, he believed, and was punishing him for some reason Miller didn’t understand. He began drinking. He and Janet divorced. He sank into his anger and despair like a strangely comforting cocoon. He spent long hours replaying the circumstances of Laura’s disappearance, thinking about what he might have done differently, fantasizing about revenge. When her body was found, Laura appeared to have been dead longer than Jane Doe, the unidentified woman found next to her. Because of her more advanced state of decay, the medical examiner was unable to identify the specific cause of death. Like the other two bodies found in the oil field, Laura’s was propped against a tree, facing the sky, in a manner suggesting their killer liked to return to admire his work. Miller began staking out the field. Night after night he lay in wait with a gun, drinking and smoking in the dark, watching for Laura’s killer to show himself. He had one idea who might have done it. A man who lived down the road from the Millers when they lived in Dickinson, Clyde Hedrick, had recently served a short stint in prison for a strange incident that occurred the same year Laura was killed. Hedrick was a sociable guy. He was leanly handsome – before a much later bout of jaw cancer, his most striking feature was his jawline – and a good dancer. One July night in 1984, he was hanging out at a nightclub he frequented, the Texas Moon, drinking and dancing with acquaintances, when they introduced him to a 29-year-old woman, Ellen Beason. At some point that night Hedrick and Beason left the club together. The next day she failed to show up to work. When confronted by authorities, Hedrick said that Beason had drowned while skinny-dipping and he’d panicked and hidden the body. The corpse was in a ravine near the Galveston Causeway, under an old sofa. The Galveston county medical examiner ruled Beason’s cause of death indeterminable, so Hedrick was convicted only of abusing a corpse, a minor offense, and sentenced to a year in jail. From Laura’s boyfriend, Miller heard that Hedrick knew his daughter and sometimes talked to her when she passed his house. One time she and some friends even apparently visited his house to buy pot. Miller took his research on Hedrick to law enforcement officers. They were unimpressed by the rather circumstantial case he sketched for them. In 1991, five years after Laura’s body was discovered, horseback riders on a path through the Calder oil field came across another female body. The fourth woman discovered there, she appeared to have been killed with a blunt instrument. Like Jane Doe, this victim could not be identified, so police dubbed her Janet Doe. Unlike Jane Doe, Laura Miller and Heide Fye, Janet Doe was laid out in the open, face-down, leading investigators to speculate that she was killed by a different person. Miller still thought Hedrick might be responsible for the first three victims. By this point the 25-acre plot had earned the name locals had taken to calling it: “the killing fields”. Miller accused the League City police and Galveston county medical examiner of incompetence, noting that Laura and Jane and Janet Doe had all probably died after authorities knew a killer was in the area. It was time, Miller decided, to open his own investigation. He tracked down the owner of the oil field and persuaded him to let Miller lease it for $10 a year. Miller was convinced that out there, somewhere in the clay, was the clue to his daughter’s killer. He organized volunteers to canvass the land for bodies and evidence. He drained a pond. He combed the land with cadaver dogs; he attacked the land with a backhoe. Every time a dog signaled, or a volunteer noticed a piece of litter, or he had any kind of hunch, he dug another hole. Soon the field was pitted with craters. It began to seem as if he was at war with the earth itself. But by then there was a new development. Police finally had a suspect, and it wasn’t Clyde Hedrick. It was Robert Abel, the retired Nasa engineer, and he owned a ranch right next to the killing fields. Robert Abel was a “strange character”, Miller says, though not one who would strike most people as menacing. “A slightly built 60-year-old with thinning brown hair and a mustache, Abel walks stiffly because of a bad back, wears reading glasses, and takes pills for his high blood pressure,” journalist Skip Hollandsworth wrote in 1999 in Texas Monthly. He seemed “almost shy”, Hollandsworth added, someone who “tends to put his hands in his front pockets when he speaks”. Abel was the scion of an old Texan ranching family, and a brilliant engineer. He was recruited by Nasa shortly after graduating from university, and helped design the Saturn rockets that got the Apollo astronauts to the moon. In 1983 Abel moved to League City. He leased a thousand acres of pasture on Calder Road, adjacent to the oil field, and in 1990, shortly after retiring from Nasa, he bought another 11 acres next to the oil field. He transformed the property into “Stardust Trailrides”, a recreation center where companies could hold western-themed employee days and people could take photos of their children riding ponies. Investigators approached Abel after they discovered Janet Doe, the fourth body in six years, in the oil field. They were surprised by Abel’s enthusiastic, almost overenthusiastic, interest. He asked lots of questions about the investigation; he offered to help any way he could; he even loaned horses and a backhoe to aid the police search of the nearby land. Of course, wouldn’t anyone be interested if four dead bodies were found right next to his property? Wouldn’t he ask lots of questions? Wouldn’t he offer to help any way he could? But something about Abel struck police as off. Then League City detective Gary Bittner received an unexpected phone call from Abel’s third ex-wife, Paula Myers. Abel had a sinister side, she said, and explosive bouts of anger and cruelty. He had never hurt her, but she’d witnessed him beating his horses, a claim corroborated by Cindy Jacobs, another of Abel’s ex-wives. Jacobs’ marriage to Abel had ended after only 41 days, and their friends and acquaintances had always wondered what happened. Now investigators learned the reason. Jacobs had declined sex with Abel one evening and, she said, he flew into a frightening rage. Myers told police another strange detail: when livestock died on Abel’s ranchland, he left their bodies out to be eaten by scavengers. Hearing that, one couldn’t help but think of the four bodies posed and left to rot in the oil field. But who would dump multiple bodies next to his own property? The League City police and the Houston FBI asked the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit in Quantico, Virginia, for assistance in compiling a profile of the killer. Results came in: the killer would be highly intelligent, arrogant about his intelligence, and given to outbursts of anger. He would have a history of bad relationships with women and cruelty to animals. He might live near the crime scene. He would closely follow news coverage of the killings and, if presented with the opportunity, he might try to infiltrate the investigation under the guise of assisting. Although the police had no evidence linking Robel Abel to the murders, in 1993 they used the FBI profile to convince a judge to grant a search warrant. Investigators searched Abel’s house and property for 12 hours. They took a gold tooth they found, in case it was a souvenir Abel had taken from one of the victims; they took his guns, to check them against a bullet found in Jane Doe; they took news clippings he’d collected about the killings; they took his collection of amateur photography, in case he’d photographed the victims; they even took the cords from his window blinds to see if they could have been used for strangulation. The police tested everything and arrived right back where they started. The tooth was Abel’s. The bullet from Jane Doe was too corroded to match to Abel’s guns. The photos yielded nothing. There was still no physical evidence linking Abel to the killings. But Tim Miller had been following the investigation carefully, and now he, too, believed Abel had killed his daughter. Miller decided that if the police couldn’t prove Abel had done it, he would. “I made Robert’s life pretty miserable,” Miller told me. “To say the least.” He began parking his car outside Abel’s house, making no effort to conceal his surveillance; he wanted Abel to know he was watching. “I would go by his house so much it was nuts,” Miller said. “Two, three times a day.” He left threatening messages. Abel got a restraining order. Miller kept watching Abel’s house anyway, parking his car a few feet past the property line. One day, according to the 1999 Texas Monthly article, Miller called Abel and told him he planned to kidnap him, drive him to Nevada, and bury him alive in the desert. He didn’t. But he did confront Abel outside his house, put a .357 to Abel’s head, and demand he confess to killing Laura, before driving away and checking himself into the hospital. (Abel later denied the gun incident occurred, possibly, according to Miller, because Abel was embarrassed.) In the years that followed, Miller threw his energy into helping missing-person searches across the country, and became a frequent guest on unsolved-crime shows like America’s Most Wanted. One of the lessons he’d learned from Laura’s disappearance was the importance of stoking attention on cases: keep the media interested, and the police under pressure. Then it happened again. In April 1997, 12-year-old Laura Smither disappeared while jogging near her Friendswood home. Her body was found later that month in a retention pond in Pasadena. Four months later, 17-year-old Jessica Cain disappeared, and her empty car was found on the side of I-45. People wondered if the killer was back or it was a new one. After Cain disappeared, Miller and two hundred local people decided on a unilateral search of Abel’s property, without a search warrant and without his permission. They marched on to the ranch and raked it over, looking for bodies. They found none. By this point, Abel was a lonely man. His once-prosperous trail-rides business was going under for lack of customers, a blow that struck particularly hard. “Robert was a rocket scientist, literally, but a country boy at heart, and he loved Stardust Trailrides,” Miller says. A disturbing realization began to nag at Miller. What if Abel wasn’t guilty? And then another. What if it was Hedrick all along? Miller told me he deeply regrets his role in rallying people against a man he believes in retrospect was not guilty. The two men reconciled a few years before Abel died. They passed each other driving and Miller hailed him. They pulled their cars over and Miller approached him. “I said: ‘I’m gonna ask for forgiveness, and I know I do not deserve it.’” He asked Abel if he could hug him. They both cried. In 2005 Miller was working a search in Aruba when an FBI agent called. “Did you hear the news?” the agent said. “Robert Abel is dead.” A train struck Abel as he drove an ATV over a rail crossing near his family ranch in Bellville. The train engineer later told Miller that Abel was braked next to the rail crossing, watching the train, waiting. In 2010, Miller approached Richard Rennison, an FBI agent, and Tommy Hansen, a lieutenant with the Galveston sheriff’s office, to urge them to investigate Clyde Hedrick as a suspect. The timing was good; Hansen had recently retired but stayed with the Galveston sheriff in a special part-time position, working the office’s cold cases. Miller persuaded them to look at the research he’d compiled, and they agreed to form a taskforce. The first item on their agenda was taking another look at the case of Ellen Beason, the woman who supposedly drowned in Hedrick’s company in 1984. Hansen and Rennison learned something interesting. In 1993, the police had quietly exhumed Beason’s body and sent it to be evaluated by Harrell Gill-King, a forensic anthropologist at the University of North Texas. During the original investigation, the Galveston medical examiner, William Korndorffer, had declared Beason’s cause of death indeterminable; but Gill-King took one look at her remains and saw that her bones had never been properly cleaned. After cleaning her skull he found a long fracture, the kind that could only have been inflicted by considerable force. In the spring of 2012, Rennison and Hansen ordered Beason’s remains again exhumed, and again sent to Gill-King for autopsy. A new cause of death was issued – homicide. On 4 April 2013, 28 years after he was convicted of tampering with Beason’s corpse, Clyde Hedrick was arrested for her murder. Shortly before trial, three inmates in jail with Hedrick contacted the prosecutor’s office. They claimed that during a jailhouse conversation Hedrick had not only admitted to beating Beason to death with a table leg but also to murdering Laura Miller and Heide Fye. He’d bragged about having sex with Laura before killing her. During the trial the prosecutors filed a document, State’s Notice of Intent to Use Evidence of Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts, containing a number of allegations apparently sourced from Hedrick’s ex-wives, ex-girlfriends, jailmates and others. Although the allegations, most of which are unproven and speculative, have no legal bearing, they paint a dark pattern. In addition to accusing Hedrick of physically assaulting former partners and molesting their children, the document alleges that in 1984 “the Defendant had sexual intercourse with the deceased body of Ellen Beason”; that between 1991 and 1993 he “would come back home with a different shirt and would be saying repeatedly that he had ‘done it again’”; that “on or about 1996” he “came home with a bloody knife”, asked his then wife to “get rid of it” and “dyed his hair and shaved his beard”; and that in 2013 Hedrick “stated that he has murdered four to five women during the course of his life”. Miller sat in the courtroom every day of the trial, staring at Hedrick. “We had a lot of staring contests,” Miller told me, “and I won every fucking one of them.” Miller never spoke, but the jury probably got the message. The facts of the case were too hazy to prove Hedrick intended to kill Beason, however, so he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The letter arrived in a plain envelope addressed in tight, careful cursive. A little salutation – “God Bless Always” – was scrawled over the back flap, perhaps as a greeting to the prison censor. The sender’s return address was Terrell prison in Rosharon, Texas. Four weeks earlier, I had contacted Clyde Hedrick to hear his side of the story. In his letter, he was steadfast that he never killed anyone, and he accused Miller of leading a campaign of persecution against him. “Two trials two times for the same thing,” he complained: “One not Guilty, one Guilty, because of Miller and his friend[s]!! I get 20 years, I’m on my sixth year now. My wife and daughter and friends still come to see me for a little moral support and pray that I’ll come home soon. They [know] I didn’t do it I had no contact with Miller girl at all anytime, so help me God, I didn’t do anything to anyone.” Hedrick argues he couldn’t have caused Ellen Beason’s death. For one, he wrote, it wouldn’t have made sense for him to kill Beason, given that numerous witnesses had seen them together that night. (“All know where we are going so why would I go and kill her. Bullshit!!!”) He also reiterated his claim that his decision to hide Beason’s body was motivated by fear of being wrongly accused of her death. In response to a key point raised during trial – that drowned bodies sink, rather than float, as Hedrick described Beason’s body doing to investigators – he suggested that Beason actually died in the water of a drug overdose. “Miller got alot of people to think I’m the League City Killing Field Serial Killer,” he added, describing Miller as a vindictive man with a compulsive need to point blame. “I’m the fourth man he sayed got to be the one. All of us caused his daughter death. Come on. [I want] this nightmare over and behind me!” In a phone conversation, Hedrick’s common-law wife, Gladys McKnight, told me Miller had ruined her life. “That was one of my biggest fears all my life, growing old alone, and that’s what looks like is happening. I was used to Clyde taking care of me. I still miss him, and still love him. I’ve been in abusive relationships, and Clyde was kind to me. He never raised a hand to me.” “Most 71-year-olds are sitting on La-Z-Boys, watching Oprah with their friends in the nursing home,” Miller said, grinning, or perhaps grimacing, at the image. “I ain’t ever had bedsores.” He leaned against his pickup. It was a hot afternoon on his small, seven-acre ranch in Santa Fe, Texas. His horses grazed in a pasture. Behind us was the barn where he houses EquuSearch’s fleet of boats and trucks. Inside, the barn was cool and smelled like soil. Hanging from the wall were several huge sieves; on searches he uses them to sift bone fragments from dirt, like panning for gold. Miller prefers his hands, and mind, occupied with a task. On the rare moments he’s still, he has time to think – and when he thinks, he says, he gets into “trouble”. So he works. When he isn’t working a search operation, or his daughter’s case, or managing his construction business, Miller is out on the ranch, tending to the horses or repairing outbuildings. If Clyde Hedrick really did kill Laura Miller, he might find forgiveness from an unlikely quarter. It took him at least 25 years, Miller reckons, to come to a point where he could forgive his daughter’s killer, but he has. Rape-murder is a capital offense in Texas, meaning Hedrick could face the death penalty if convicted of killing Laura. Were it up to Miller, however, he’d grant full immunity to Clyde – as he always calls him, although they’ve never met – in exchange for a confession and the identities of other victims. He wants to give closure to their families, even though, he knows from experience, true closure is a myth. Are monsters born, or made? That question – nature versus nurture – is the most fundamental in criminology, and it cuts to the heart of questions about human nature and the assumptions underlying our justice system. Forensic psychologists believe serial rapists and killers develop an obsessive need for control as a response to humiliation and shame in childhood. In a sense, they are products as well as transmitters of trauma. Clyde Hedrick had a traumatic childhood, according to Miller, who, at this point, probably knows more about Hedrick than almost anyone. Hedrick’s father went to prison and his adoptive stepfather allegedly abused Clyde and his siblings “physically, emotionally, and sexually”. Yet Miller did not become an alleged killer, and his own childhood was arguably just as bad. His father, a gambling addict, walked out on the family when he was a child. One day when he was six months old, his mother put Tim in a dresser drawer and set the house on fire with him and his brother inside. One good thing did happen to him, though. After a string of horrible experiences, the teenaged Tim was taken in for five years by a farm family in Ohio. “They gave me that little bit of structure, little bit of unconditional love that I needed,” he said. “If they hadn’t taken me in, I truly believe I would be dead or in prison today.” Miller claims he’s bought a Bible for Hedrick and underlined passages in it about forgiveness. He told me he plans to give it to him if he ever has the opportunity. I wondered if he’d underlined the Parable of the Lost Sheep: Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the 99 in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/jun/04/concussion-loris-karius-liverpool-goalkeeper-champions-league-final-massachusetts","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-04T19:40:26Z","webTitle":"Concussion may have led to Loris Karius’s calamities, says US hospital","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/04/concussion-loris-karius-liverpool-goalkeeper-champions-league-final-massachusetts","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/jun/04/concussion-loris-karius-liverpool-goalkeeper-champions-league-final-massachusetts","fields":{"headline":"Concussion may have led to Loris Karius’s calamities, says US hospital","bodyText":"Loris Karius’s calamitous performance in the Champions League final could have been a result of concussion he sustained against Real Madrid, a doctor who assessed the Liverpool goalkeeper in Boston has said. Liverpool sent Karius for a head scan at Massachusetts General Hospital last Thursday amid concern at his reaction to a collision with Real’s captain, Sergio Ramos. The 24‑year‑old made two major errors that contributed to Real’s 3-1 victory. The first presented Karim Benzema with the opening goal and came soon after he received a blow to the head from Ramos as they challenged at the near post. Later Karius allowed Gareth Bale to put the contest beyond Liverpool with a long-range shot that squirmed through his hands. The German flew to the US on holiday after the final but Liverpool’s medical department was sufficiently concerned about the impact of Ramos’s challenge that it arranged a scan in Boston. Karius had a consultation with Dr Ross Zafonte, an authority on head-trauma injuries suffered by NFL players and the chief of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Massachusetts General. A statement released on Monday by the hospital on Dr Zafonte’s behalf and with the player’s permission confirmed that Karius had been concussed. It read: “On May 31, 2018 Mr Karius underwent a comprehensive examination by Dr Ross Zafonte and Dr Lenore Herget in Boston at Massachusetts General Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. After carefully reviewing game film and integrating a detailed history – including his reported present and immediate post-contact subjective symptoms – physical examination and objective metrics, we have concluded that Mr Karius sustained a concussion during the match 26 May 2018. “At the time of our evaluation Mr Karius’s principal residual symptoms and objective signs suggested that visual spatial dysfunction existed and likely occurred immediately following the event. Additional symptomatic and objectively noted areas of dysfunction also persisted. It could be possible that such deficits would affect performance. “We also note that Mr Karius has reported significant and steady improvement since the concussive event, and we expect him to make a full recovery based on the results of the examination. We expect that with treatment and by following prescribed activity protocols he will continue to improve. We have encouraged vigilance and an emphasis on safety in his eventual return to full activity.” Karius has continued his holiday in California following the assessment in Boston and is due to return to pre-season training with Liverpool on 2 July. The Anfield club have been fined €20,000 (£17,567) for disturbances at the Champions League quarter-final first leg in April, which included an attack on the Manchester City bus, Uefa announced on Monday. They were also fined €9,000 (£7,904) over the setting off of fireworks in the second leg with City and in the second leg of the semi-final at Roma."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/01/inside-grime-true-history-dan-hancox-dj-target-wiley-dizzee-rascal-stormzy","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T05:00:41Z","webTitle":"'You can't escape its inspiration': inside the true history of grime","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/01/inside-grime-true-history-dan-hancox-dj-target-wiley-dizzee-rascal-stormzy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/01/inside-grime-true-history-dan-hancox-dj-target-wiley-dizzee-rascal-stormzy","fields":{"headline":"'You can't escape its inspiration': inside the true history of grime","bodyText":"Since emerging from London as a harsh, lyrically dextrous, hybrid rap music in the early 00s, grime has had the three-act narrative of a Hollywood movie: the plucky underdog who gets to the top, blows it, and is then redeemed. But from its garage- and jungle-inspired gestation to the breakthroughs of rapper-producers Wiley and Skepta, and on to the Brit-award winning majesty of Stormzy, it is easy to forget how it all actually happened. Two people who have been reimmersing themselves in grime’s story are Dan Hancox, a journalist and die-hard fan with hundreds of hours of interviews with those in the scene, and BBC 1Xtra’s DJ Target, AKA Darren Joseph, whose Pay As U Go crew pointed the way from garage to grime, and whose Roll Deep crew later went to the top of the charts. Both are publishing grime history books this summer, and in conversation, they explore the genre’s real story. Dan Hancox: When I tell people that my passion is grime, if they’re from outside that world their response is still: that’s British rap music, right? Darren Joseph: That’s the simplest way of explaining what grime is, a super-shorthand way. But then trying to take them into what 140bpm is, what clashing is … DH: Talking to your auntie at a wedding: “You’ve got your quick sixteens, but you’ve got your eights as your reload bars …” It’s complex! DJ: The early influences were Jamaican in particular, even if not everyone was Jamaican – a lot of MCs and DJs were influenced by soundsystem culture, plus we would listen to jungle and UK garage, and hip-hop and R&amp;B from America. DH: There’s such a strong British African-Caribbean heritage there. Even fast chat reggae from the 80s, people like Smiley Culture, seems to be so important. According to Geeneus [DJ who founded key radio station Rinse FM] grime was junglists trying to make garage and getting it wrong. They fucked it up and accidentally created grime. DJ: It was accidental. We never said: “right, we’re going to start making songs that are not like UK garage so we can separate”. It was bringing the high energy of jungle mixed with a garage tempo, but now you’re getting street reporting over these beats. DH: I wonder if that corresponds with the history of hip-hop, where MCing was originally just the voice as an instrument, and over time, becomes something that’s a great communication vehicle. DJ: There’s loads of similarity. Hip-hop started to reflect the lives of the streets in America, and that’s what grime was doing as well. And hip-hop was also originally DJ-led – the MCs would just rap “my DJ is the best!” Same thing in garage: the word DJ got said about 1,000 times in a set. Whereas with grime you’ve got to properly listen out to hear who’s on the decks – you’re not even going to see them behind 30 MCs! DH: It wasn’t until 2005 that people were accepting this was a genre: 140 bpm tracks, with a particular emphasis on sub-bass from that reggae or jungle tradition, with quickfire MCing over it. But in 2003, you’ve got a lot of MCs saying: Why would you call it grime? Why would you tarnish us with that dirty word? DJ: Jungle didn’t get named jungle by the artists either – there were some dodgy connotations. As soon as we had this new genre, journalists coined the name – first it was “grimy” then cut down to “grime”, and we were like: What are they trying to say? That we’re dirty? Then we realised they were talking about the sound of the music, and we just let it go. DH: I found an interview with the rapper Nasty Jack from 2004, and he’s owning it – he’s saying most grime is made on a grimy council estate, there are social problems, and his part of London is not a nice place to be. He was happy to be called grime, because it was a grimy music talking about grimy goings-on: “Shottas, plotters and HMP,” in the words of Dizzee Rascal. Dizzee’s album Boy in Da Corner is probably unrivalled as a document of how a teenage lad feels about the area he was growing up in and the lack of opportunities he had. DJ: You hadn’t had harsh reality over music from the UK in such a current, relatable way before. The UK rap scene just wasn’t connecting to our world; a lot of it was Americanisms. There was nothing that was directly drawing us in. Jungle did that, musically, but there hadn’t been that real reporting on what is really going on in the streets; grime MCs were telling you what was going on that week. DH: There’s a Tinchy Stryder song from his first mixtape where he just describes a day walking round Bow with his mates. One of the things I did in my book was compare Bow E3 by Wiley with Empire State of Mind by Jay-Z – in Empire State of Mind, they’re talking about Yankee Stadium, Broadway, all these places you’ve heard of wherever you live in the world. And then in Bow E3, Wiley’s referencing a takeaway called Moon Lee. It has 2.2 stars on Google – maybe it’s not the best. But these are the places that are important in Wiley’s world. DJ: There’s no one even close to deserving the title of godfather of grime than Wiley. Anybody who argues otherwise, you have other motives behind your argument. I might be seen as biased [Wiley was a member of Pay As U Go and Roll Deep], but ask anyone in the scene. There’s no one more prolific, no one with a better ear; for him, there’s no day when making music is out of the question. DH: [Journalist] Chantelle Fiddy told me he called her up on Christmas Day morning, and was like “Oh it’s Christmas? Sorry, I was going to send you some tunes”. His importance is impossible to underplay. As well as his influence as an artist, producer and MC, I don’t think people realise how much support he has given to other musicians: paying for people’s studio time, paying for Skepta to be flown out to Australia to tour with him, bringing through every young talent he sees as an MC, when no one asked him to. DJ: Another important part of grime was clashing, where MCs would battle with each other back and forth on the mic. It was a great way of MCs testing each other, having a bit of sport, proving they were really good. If it’s a pirate radio set and someone is saying bars about how bad your trainers are, you had to be ready! DH: You realise now how constructed a lot of the beef was. Take Wiley and Lethal Bizzle: their beef is hilarious. Wiley said “Your mum’s got athlete’s foot”; Lethal B’s response was dissing Wiley over Kylie’s Can’t Get You Out of My Head, Wiley’s middle name being Kylea. But they’re grinning, finishing each other’s bars that are supposed to be criticising them. It’s a performance. DJ: Grime’s beefs started in music and usually stayed in music, whereas the current beefs around drill [a more recent London rap style, the videos of which YouTube has been removing], some are a bit out of hand, and the back and forths are real life situations with real friction. But drill has become a scapegoat – you can’t just blame a music genre. If these guys weren’t rappers, they’d be having these problems anyway. DH: Come 2007, people are starting to drift off to funky house and dubstep; grime seems like it’s had its chance and that has passed. DJ: Around 2008 people would say: “You’re still doing grime? Isn’t that a silly kids thing?” And a few of us were having big chart hits with dance tracks, so people were looking at that and thinking: Hang on, what if I do one of those tunes? DH: Skepta, who later went back to grime, had a defence of that pop period – he said that was music he didn’t have to make, but it was part of who he is, because he’s British. It’s the Ibiza thing, of going to the club and smashing it. DJ: Exactly. We grew up listening to this kind of music. People weren’t doing stuff they hated. DH: Wiley would always make pop, too – he would chop Roisin Murphy vocals up and make them into grimy pop tunes, although they’ve never seen the light of day. DJ: But some people were definitely jumping on the bandwagon, because it looked like it would take you to the promised land. And that’s when grime was left unattended. DH: Abandoned in the shopping centre. DJ: Meanwhile pirate radio was still going, but not the vibe of 2004 when it was super exciting, and form 696 was introduced by the Met police, which was killing the clubs. DH: The original wording of form 696 – which you had to fill in if you wanted to put on a rave – included two really dodgy questions: what ethnic group is attending, and what kind of music are you planning to play. It then listed four different types of black music as examples – there was no “oboe solos”. So instead, you had grime fans building their own infrastructure, with Grime Forum or Grimepedia – devoting their time to this music they are so passionate about, and that is drifting away from mainstream attention. DJ: While London was all over the place, Birmingham had a real scene, and pirate radio – they kept the lights on for that energy. Skepta, meanwhile, was planning to go and stay in the US. He was sick of it here – he was like: I’ve had enough of it, there’s nothing left. And then, in 2013, German Whip by Meridian Dan dropped. DH: He was someone only grime fans would have known about – you had to ask the nerds about him. DJ: It was a grime record, and it had all the energy of a grime record. And it just blew up, reaching No 13 in the charts, and the rest of the scene was like: “Oh shit, we can be ourselves again!” It was an epiphany. DH: The track That’s Not Me is the culmination of Skepta’s own epiphany, made on the same Korg Triton keyboard that all his classic early beats are made on. He rang up Jammer, who told him he’d given it away to a kid on the estate, but they tracked it down. It’s like something from a movie: go and find the holy golden tablet that is hidden in the mountain, and you can reclaim the crown. DJ: There was also a new wave of MCs – Stormzy, AJ Tracey – who grew up on the first wave of Roll Deep and Dizzee. They’re the first set of grime artists who actually grew up on grime. They’re pure! DH: Stormzy’s got that line: “I was on the roads when Dizzee made I Luv U.” I did some maths around that and was like: you were seven, in a sandpit. But the principal is correct, this was the music he heard when he was a kid. DJ: So in 2014, it really started surging again: German Whip, That’s Not Me, Stormzy’s freestyles, it felt like the energy of grime was back. And when the grime reset button got hit, it didn’t just get hit in grime. It was like: we want the truth now, be your real person, whatever music you’re doing. People aren’t just going to be jumping on pop records like they did eight years ago. DH: That’s the great victory of the grime resurgence: to make young British artists realise that they can be true to themselves, and succeed. The message of self confidence and believing in yourself, but also that you can build something yourself, is incredibly inspirational. DJ: If you took grime out of the equation, I don’t think these current black British musical genres – drill, Afro bashment – would have been able to flourish. Whether you make grime or not, if you didn’t see Dizzee or Skepta or Stormzy, you wouldn’t want to go to the studio and make an Afrobeats song. Grime has opened the door for you to be able to do any of this. DH: I’ve got the new EP by Yizzy and the title track on that is called SOS, standing for Save Our Sound. It’s kind of interesting that a young MC thinks grime needs saving. DJ: Well, I don’t think people should be worried that there’s too many artists who are making non-grime music. The whole culture has progressed. DH: There are kids who are 12 and listening to Stormzy and Skepta, who going to be 18-year-old grime MCs coming through in five years time. DJ: And there’ll be more of them, too. Kids are now turning on the Brit awards on TV, and the best male and best album is grime, is Stormzy. You can’t escape the inspiration – it’s everywhere.

That alone suggests he’s alright. There is, of course, plenty of other evidence indicating Sterling is a force for good – his thrilling play, for starters, or his philanthropic acts or the bright-shining example he offers of a youngster from a tough background achieving success through talent and discipline. But certain grubby newspaper editors don’t want you to read about that. We have to read between the lines to figure out why. There was, of course, an eye-rolling inevitability to the Sun’s decision to devote its front page today to commentary on the new tattoo that Sterling decided to reveal to the world yesterday. The Sun most righteously disapproved of it and, in fairness, few creatures are better qualified than the editors of The Sun to offer analysis of abominations committed to ink. Sterling’s tattoo appears to be of a M16 rifle. Getting it done was obviously a vile deed too far from a man whose previous form includes buying a house and driving a car. This time the Sun had to take a stand, especially as the dozing Daily Mail seemed to have fallen asleep on the job. The organ duly found an anti-gun campaigner to blast Sterling’s “sick” drawing, demanding he be axed from England’s World Cup squad unless he gets the offending image lasered off. The Sun’s anger was presumably intensified by the fact that they forgot to barf something similar last week when one of Britain’s feudal overlords got married in full military regalia (although not German, this time). Sterling has shown in the past that he is strong enough to ignore tabloid hypocrisy but this time he decided to educate, one of the best ways of eradicating prejudice. “When I was 2 my father died from being gunned down to death,” the 23-year-old explained on social media. “I made a promise to myself I would never touch a gun in my life. I shoot with my right foot so it has as deeper meaning [and] still unfinished.” Sterling’s leg is his weapon, then. And he uses it a lot better than certain grubby newspaper editors use their arms.

But I always say that it goes to show, even Beckenbauer can talk some amount of sh!te” – RIP Neale Cooper, a fine footballer with a nice sideline in self-deprecating humour.

Gary Cahill has admitted he feared the worst when Gareth Southgate’s name flashed up on his phone earlier this month. “I thought potentially it could be bad news because in my experience you usually don’t get the call – you just receive the information that you’re going to meet up and what times,” Cahill swooned.

Bob Higgins, 65, has denied 50 counts of indecent assault between 1971 and 1996 in relation to 24 boys. Potential jurors were asked on day one of the trial if they had any close connections with either Southampton or Peterborough United football clubs. They were also given a long list of complainants and witnesses connected to the case and asked if they recognised any of them.Higgins was told to sit while the list was read out. The judge at Salisbury crown court, Jonathan Fuller QC, told the potential jurors they should not undertake their own research into the allegations because they could only try the case on the evidence heard in court. “You must not research on the internet anything about this case: the witnesses, the defendant or anyone else associated with it,” he said. They were asked to give any details about national media coverage they had seen of sexual abuse in football. The jury is to be sworn in on Wednesday when the prosecution case is due to open. It is expected to last until Thursday and the first witness is likely to give evidence on Friday. The trial is due to last six to eight weeks but could run for longer. Higgins was a coach in Southampton’s junior system in the 1980s and worked as Peterborough United’s youth team manager from May 1995 until April 1996, as well as running his own soccer school."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
