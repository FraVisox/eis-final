Facebook announced last month that it would start requiring political ad buyers in the US to verify their identities in an effort to combat fake news and misinformation and avoid a repeat of the 2016 election when it allowed Russia-backed posts to reach millions of Americans. Because users must now confirm their social security number and submit their US driver’s license or passport, millions of undocumented people in America are also no longer able to post political ads. “This is Facebook telling undocumented people you’re not allowed to participate in this part of the political process,” said Justino Mora, co-founder of advocacy group UndocuMedia and an undocumented immigrant currently protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. “They are essentially banning a certain political view from being expressed … They are going to allow anti-immigrant xenophobes and racists to have more power.” The controversy over the new ad vetting system highlights the complex policy challenges facing Facebook and the potential unintended consequences of new restrictions as the company grapples with its immense power and influence in elections. The effect of the new policy, first reported by Vice News, also illustrates the ways in which undocumented people continue to be excluded from politics and democracy in the US, a problem that social media sites can amplify. Rights groups argued this week that Facebook has an obligation to allow ads from undocumented people, with some pointing to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s stated support for Daca recipients. Jess Morales Rocketto, political director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance, said Facebook had been critical to educate immigrants about their rights and organize against harmful campaigns – and that many undocumented activists were buying and designing ads to support their efforts: “This will make it extremely difficult for them to do their jobs.” A Facebook spokesperson said the new authorization system was designed to increase transparency, but added in an email: “We fully understand that the process, as currently designed, presents challenges for some groups and we’re exploring solutions now to address those concerns.” Under federal regulations, undocumented people are prohibited from donating directly to candidates, but some have argued that Facebook is going a step further by blocking this population from buying ads related to “national issues of public importance”, which the company says includes immigration. “This has the markings of a decision made in a room with a handful of executives who may not have fully thought through the implications,” said Brendan Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. “That’s the distinction between public policy crafted by democratic institutions and policy crafted by private corporations.” Many of the Russia-backed ads targeted “issues”, often aiming to sow division on topics like race and immigration. Still, Fischer said, Facebook could find an alternative way to verify undocumented activists and allow them to promote issues. Morales Rocketto suggested Facebook partner with a trusted organization to authorize people’s identities. Under the current rules, Mora could probably still buy ads since he has a social security number from Daca and a driver’s license in California, which allows undocumented people to get IDs. But given the uncertain future of Daca, which has consistently faced threats under Trump, some fear they could lose their protections and thus lose their ability to advocate on Facebook at a crucial moment. Millions of undocumented immigrants without Daca or who lack licenses are immediately affected by the new policy. “It’s really important to have a platform that reaches people to let them know they are not alone,” said Melody Klingenfuss, a 24-year-old undocumented activist with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (Chirla), a group with a large undocumented staff. “Facebook must continue to allow undocumented folks in the United States to participate in the flow of ideas. Mr Zuckerberg must understand the power of his platform.” Chirla regularly posts Facebook ads, said communications director Jorge-Mario Cabrera, adding: “I believe this may even go to court if folks feel their first amendment rights are curtailed.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/16/marseille-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-match-report","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T20:47:04Z","webTitle":"Antoine Griezmann fires Atlético past Marseille to Europa League glory","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/16/marseille-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-match-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/16/marseille-atletico-madrid-europa-league-final-match-report","fields":{"headline":"Antoine Griezmann fires Atlético past Marseille to Europa League glory","bodyText":"Another success for Diego Simeone and Atlético, and another success for Spain in the Europa League. Eight of the past nine winners of European competitions have been Spanish – and Real Madrid could made it nine out of 10 in Kiev next week. La Liga has also provided nine winners of the Europa League in the past 15 years and this was a third in nine seasons for Atlético, two of them under Simeone – although he was confined to the stands after he was sent from the touchline during the first leg of the semi-final against Arsenal. It was not a final that will live long in the memory. Atlético played as they tend to at their best, holding their opponents at arm’s length, spoiling when they need to, and winning comfortably without really seeming to extend themselves. Marseille gifted them the first and were not without blame for the second, while the third was the result of a smart counter against weary opponents. The first two also involved ruthless finishes from Antoine Griezmann. The boyhood Marseille fan is likely to leave Atlético for Barcelona in the summer, which perhaps leaves a bittersweet note, but Atlético are familiar enough by now with the selling-on reality. There is much sniffiness about the Europa League but there is a sense in its later stages that it is what the European Cup used to be. These are big clubs but not superclubs, teams crafted through careful work in the transfer market rather than epic splurges every summer, teams for whom success is not a given, a privilege of rank, but must be scrapped for and is perhaps appreciated rather more as a result. And Atlético, as Rudi Garcia pointed out, are bigger than his Marseille side, far more experienced in major games. “This season was a tough one,” said Simeone, “but this Europa League represents more than the Europa League trophy – it shows the value of hard work and persistence, or keeping at it and working hard. We lost two Champions League finals [in the recent past]. We didn’t start the Champions League very well [this time] but reinvented ourselves in this competition. All that hard work will bear fruit in the end.” And let nobody suggest to Marseille fans the Europa League does not matter. In the stands, their white shirts outnumbered the red-and-white of Atlético by around three to one. They were noisy and raucous and before a kick-off delayed by the overrunning of the pre-match entertainment, set off dozens of red flares, swaddling the arena in thick smoke that lingered for most of the game – certainly for longer than Marseille’s hope of success. Valère Germain missed a great early chance after being slipped in by Dimitri Payet but after that Atlético were rarely threatened. With German Burgos, promoted to a starring role because of Simeone’s touchline ban, glowering from the edge of the technical area, Atlético slowly squeezed the life out of Marseille. Burgos is also a former Atlético goalkeeper and, like Simeone, seems to embody the club’s self-image. He ended his first Madrid derby spattered with blood after saving a Luis Figo penalty with his nose, and was the front man for a rock band called The Garb. In 2003, he was diagnosed with cancer but survived. A mulleted, bearded barrel of a man, he paced back and forth with an oddly lethargic gait, pointing and shrugging, hands flicking from his hips to sweep through his still lustrous dark hair. Vitally, his frustrated gesticulations got Atlético pressing high enough to disrupt Marseille as they sought to pass out from the back. That induced the opener as Steve Mandanda played an awkward ball to the holding midfielder André Zambo Anguissa who miscontrolled. With the two centre-backs split, Gabi could not have had an easier pass to play in Griezmann for a straightforward finish. Worse followed for Marseille as they lost Payet to what appeared to be a tweaked groin just after the half-hour. It later emerged he had broken the cardinal superstition and had touched the trophy on his way on to the field. He was in tears as he left the pitch and received a consolatory hug and kiss on the cheek from Griezmann, his France team-mate. The possibility of a Marseille comeback was significantly diminished four minutes into the second half, moreover, with Griezmann sending a bouncing ball infield for Koke, whose return pass found a gaping hole between the centre-back Adil Rami and the full-back Jordan Amavi. Griezmann ran on and deftly clipped his shot over Mandanda. In an age in which it can seem as though no lead is ever truly safe, there is a welcome solidity to Atlético. There was a minor scare as the substitute Kostas Mitroglou headed against a post but no Simeone side were ever going to give up a two-goal lead. Gabi’s slick third merely confirmed what had long seemed inevitable."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/16/whistleblowers-fears-revealed-uk-sport-report-olympic-athletes","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T23:01:13Z","webTitle":"Whistleblowers’ fears revealed in landmark UK Sport report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/16/whistleblowers-fears-revealed-uk-sport-report-olympic-athletes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/16/whistleblowers-fears-revealed-uk-sport-report-olympic-athletes","fields":{"headline":"Whistleblowers’ fears revealed in landmark UK Sport report","bodyText":"The optimistic tone of the UK Sport hierarchy as they presented the results of what they called a “culture health check” has rarely been heard over the last two years as they lurched from one duty-of-care crisis to another. Barely a corner of the system has been left untouched by allegations of bullying, discrimination and favouritism – from cycling to gymnastics, canoeing and bobsleigh, to mention just a few. Now Chelsea Warr, the performance director of UK Sport, has claimed this survey of more than 2,000 elite athletes and staff across the Olympic spectrum is proof that those problems are not endemic in the system. Some results do reflect favourably on the funding body, with more than 90% of the 682 athletes who responded to a 45-question survey reporting they felt proud to be part of the “world class programme”. Similar numbers said they felt individuals operating within their sport have the best intentions. But this does not tell the whole story. The partially celebratory vibe could not obscure the more grim findings, notably that 30% – almost one in three athletes – had experienced or witnessed unacceptable behaviour. James Bell, a psychologist at UK Sport, said what was deemed unacceptable varied vastly between athletes, noting that one respondent had complained they were not allowed to train because they showed up with the wrong kit. Perhaps even more stark was that 31% feared reprisals, whether this be missing out on selection or being punished in another way, should they give negative feedback. The athlete welfare crisis in Olympic sport was ignited by the sprint cyclist Jess Varnish in the run-up to the Rio Olympics in 2016. She alleged the former British Cycling performance director Shane Sutton told her that her bum was “too big” to cycle certain roles on the team and after dropping her from the squad that she should “get on with having a baby”. The Guardian has since revealed a host of issues infecting other sports with allegations of racism in British Bobsleigh and abuse in British Gymnastics and British Canoeing. The staff and athletes who have blown the whistle often have one thing in common and that is that they have recently left the system. Liz Nicholl, the UK Sport chair, conceded the apparent fear culture within some sections of the system still existed, preventing some active athletes from speaking out. “That is a concern,” she said. “It is a significant number fearing the consequences. That’s something we’ll follow up with the sports. It’s about having an open relationship based on mutual respect.” UK Sport, which will invest up to £345m of exchequer and lottery money in Olympic and Paralympic sport from 2017-2021, has also pledged an extra £1m to the British Athletes Commission. The body is run independently and represents athletes but has been massively under-resourced, struggling to cope with a growing number of athletes with grievances. The results of the survey, which athletes were allowed 12 weeks to respond to, did not suggest any marked difference in the contentedness of female athletes compared with their male counterparts. But anecdotally, coaches say they have modified their style to work with women’s teams. Danny Kerry, who led the women’s hockey team to Olympic gold in Rio, said in a previous review he had been criticised for being overly aggressive. “It’s not very PC to say this but in my experience there are differences between working with large groups of elite male and elite female athletes,” he said. “Women can sometimes take things to heart. Men can be like that too but generally they have the ability to depersonalise it. “In the Beijing cycle I made one athlete’s experience pretty brutal and really miserable and they nearly left the programme. “I don’t think I’d be facing a tribunal but I got it wrong. One of the several lightbulb moments was when the chief executive and performance director brought me in here after Beijing and showed me slides from the athletes’ debrief. They said I was tactically bang on but they hated me. “I was ready to throw it in because I thought I had given my all for them and they had shoved knives in me. I spoke to my wife about it and said: ‘I’m not that person, why am I doing this?’ She told me I wasn’t that person but I had to make the shift.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/17/criminals-on-board-georgia-governor-candidate-begins-deportation-bus-tour","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T19:13:45Z","webTitle":"'Criminals on board': Georgia governor candidate begins deportation bus tour","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/17/criminals-on-board-georgia-governor-candidate-begins-deportation-bus-tour","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/17/criminals-on-board-georgia-governor-candidate-begins-deportation-bus-tour","fields":{"headline":"'Criminals on board': Georgia governor candidate begins deportation bus tour","bodyText":"Bus tours have become a staple of the American political campaign, but one candidate for governor in the state of Georgia, Michael Williams, wants you to know that his is different: “It’s not going to be one of those pansy political bus tours.” In a video released on Wednesday, emerging from a grey, prison corrections-style vehicle, the self-proclaimed “fearless conservative” Williams said he planned to “fill this bus with illegals and send them back to where they came from”. The video coincided with a campaign tour beginning on Wednesday to a handful of Georgia so-called sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with the federal government’s efforts to enforce immigration law. On the bus’s rear it reads: “Murderers, rapists, kidnappers, child molestors [sic] and other criminals on board.” Just below, the lettering adds: “Follow me to Mexico.” He’s dubbed it the Deportation Bus Tour, but the easy conflation Williams makes between the undocumented people in the US he calls “illegals” and violent crime is unsupported by the facts. Multiple studies have shown that immigrants commit less crime than native-born Americans on balance. The stunt was just the latest escalation in a Republican primary contest for the gubernatorial race, where anti-immigrant rhetoric, specifically that targeting Hispanic residents, has been a featured and enduring trope. Williams’ “deportation bus” is effectively just a one-up of fellow challenger Brian Kemp’s campaign ad last week in which he boasted: “I’ve got a big truck in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take them home myself.” Azadeh Shahshahani, the Legal and Advocacy Director of the Georgia-based civil rights advocacy organization Project South, said the focus “is not unusual in Georgia at all. It is something we’ve seen year after year”. But the talk has undoubtedly become cruder and more crass as insulting notions of “political correctness” have become a virtue in conservative circles. “The standard has been lowered so much in this election that it’s truly horrifying,” she added. The frontrunner and current lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, hasn’t been as theatrical as Kemp or Williams, but has pushed a hard line on the issue from his office and on the campaign trail too. In campaign ads he’s described himself as “Leading The Fight Against Illegal Immigration In Georgia” and he has also pushed hard against so-called sanctuary cities in the state – municipalities which do not allow local law enforcement to collaborate with immigration officials in order to deport undocumented people in their custody. The difference between Williams’s bombast and Cagle’s, by comparison, muted anti-immigrant sentiment is mostly academic for Aline Mello. She is a 29-year-old local Dreamer, or recipient of the Daca program, which protects eligible undocumented youth from the threat of deportation but was ordered scrapped by Donald Trump last year and is a huge part of the agonised, ongoing national immigration debate. “People already hate us. So what, now you’re just hating us in a funnier way? That doesn’t really change anything,” she said. Mello came to the US from Brazil when she was seven years old, and her parents worked jobs cleaning homes and delivering car parts to give Mello and her sister the possibility of a better life. Like most Daca recipients, the US is the only country she’s ever properly known, but ever since Trump made immigrants into a campaign heel for his “America First” platform, she’s been feeling more and more under siege in her home. “During the presidential campaign I had to start taking antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication,” Mello said. “And since then I’ve had to up my dosage several times,” in response to the barrages of vitriol and the uncertainty that followed when Trump rescinded the Daca program that gave her legal status in the country. Trump’s decision has since been reversed by three separate courts and legal wrangling is ongoing. The same day Williams set off on his deportation bus tour, Trump was in California for a roundtable discussion on the state’s sanctuary provisions for undocumented people. “We’re taking people out of the country – you wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people. These are animals,” he said of deportees. Williams has admitted that his bus tour isn’t actually planning to round anyone up, nor could it legally, of course. The Georgia American Civil Liberties Union’s Sean Young noted that any such effort would raise serious fourth amendment and equal protection constitutional concerns. But literal or not the message to immigrant Georgians like Adelina Nicholls is loud and clear. Nicholls is the co-founder of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights and condemned the campaign as shocking and irresponsible. “There are many things that they can base their campaigns on and yet they are using us again to [compete over] who is the most racist. It is insulting to us as a community. But we will fight back,” Nicholls said. Williams took his bus to two of three scheduled Georgia sanctuary cities on Wednesday, but cancelled a third stop due to schedule disruptions from protests. The campaign blamed “Antifa protesters and radical liberals who blocked the bus” from leaving its second stop outside Decatur, Georgia. Williams also claimed that Antifa activists shoved and spat on the candidate’s staff and supporters. DeKalb county police said they received an “anonymous 911 call about alleged ‘violent’ protesters”, but that “upon arrival, DeKalb Police did not observe any violence or criminal activity and no reports were made by Williams’ campaign or other attendees”. The Republican primary vote is on Tuesday 22 May. Williams is polling in fifth place among Republicans, with 3% of the vote."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/16/trump-north-korea-nuclear-summit-john-bolton","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T10:12:11Z","webTitle":"Trump faces North Korea dilemma after Bolton infuriates Pyongyang","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/trump-north-korea-nuclear-summit-john-bolton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/16/trump-north-korea-nuclear-summit-john-bolton","fields":{"headline":"Trump faces North Korea dilemma after Bolton infuriates Pyongyang","bodyText":"North Korea’s denunciation of John Bolton has forced Donald Trump to decide whether to stick with his national security adviser and his hardline tactics, or push ahead with a summit with Kim Jong-un that will provide historic spectacle but an uncertain outcome. Underlying the plans for the Singapore summit was a fundamental ambiguity over what “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula” means. For Pyongyang it is a fluid term that means a long-term process of disarmament, involving all major powers, in whose ranks North Korea would henceforward be counted a member. The Trump administration thought it meant – or wanted it to mean – that Kim was ready to give up the arsenal he had declared complete and operational in January. For his part, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who was tasked by Trump to set up the Kim summit, was ready to live with the ambiguity, at least until 12 June, when the unprecedented encounter is due to take place. In weekend television appearances, Pompeo seemed to blur the US negotiating position, suggesting the aim was to prevent North Korea threatening the US mainland with nuclear weapons, a lower bar that would theoretically permit Pyongyang to retain some warheads as long as they did not build intercontinental missiles. Ambiguity is not Bolton’s style, however. In his own, competing, TV appearances, he was adamant that North Korea would have to take all its weapons apart and ship the fissile material to the US. It was this, coupled his earlier reference to the “Libya model” – which for Pyongyang summons up the memory of Muammar Gaddafi’s brutalised body being paraded on a truck – that got the regime’s attention. “It was quite deliberate. We all know how Gaddafi died,” said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia nonproliferation programme at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies of Monterey. “You don’t bring up a man’s grisly murder as an inducement.” Vipin Narang, an associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said it was likely to be the bragging that Kim had been forced to the table by Trump’s successful use of “maximum pressure” with sanctions and threats that had stung the Pyongyang regime most. Kim has portrayed his diplomatic opening as a natural consequence of completing the decades-long project to build a nuclear arsenal. “The North Koreans were prepared to ignore a lot of what the administration said before the summit, but it was the victory lap before the race that has really set them off,” Narang said. Bolton has a track record with the North Koreans, who blame him for persuading the George W Bush administration to quit a 1994 nuclear deal, the Agreed Framework. In his memoir, Surrender is Not an Option, Bolton boasts about his success in torpedoing state department efforts to keep talks with Pyongyang alive, deriding the diplomats as appeasers. At the time, the regime denounced him as “human scum” and a “bloodsucker”, banning him from any bilateral talks. On Wednesday, the first deputy prime minister, Kim Kye-gwan, made it clear that the regime’s antipathy had not mellowed with time, noting “we do not hide our feeling of repugnance towards him”. Earlier in the week, a western diplomat had predicted that the inevitable compromise at a Kim summit could force a parting of the ways between Trump and his third national security adviser. Trump, who has basked in suggestions he might be eligible for the Nobel peace prize, is clearly keen to keep his appointment in Singapore. The weekend row could now bring his looming dilemma forward. The White House on Wednesday was hedging its bets, with its spokeswoman pointedly distancing Trump from Bolton’s “Libyan model”. “Sarah Sanders threw Bolton under a bus this morning,” Lewis said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/16/kim-kardashian-instagram-advert-lollipop-appetite-suppressing-scandal","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T20:05:39Z","webTitle":"Kim Kardashian West shocks fans with ad for appetite-suppressing lollipops","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/16/kim-kardashian-instagram-advert-lollipop-appetite-suppressing-scandal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/16/kim-kardashian-instagram-advert-lollipop-appetite-suppressing-scandal","fields":{"headline":"Kim Kardashian West shocks fans with ad for appetite-suppressing lollipops","bodyText":"Kim Kardashian West has angered fans, and been accused of promoting disordered eating, after advertising appetite suppressants on Instagram. On Tuesday Kardashian West, who has more than 111 million Instagram followers, posted a photo of her sucking a Flat Tummy lollipop, which promises to curb food cravings. In a promotional caption she described the product as “literally unreal” and offered a discount code. Following immediate backlash, she deleted the post on Wednesday morning. Unlike most of us, Kardashian West isn’t just screaming into the void when she posts on social media; she exerts immense influence. Indeed, last week the Council of Fashion Designers of America announced it was honouring the reality TV star with its first ever Influencer Award, such is her ability to dictate taste and get people to buy things. But with great power comes great responsibility and, as many people pointed out, promoting appetite suppressants sends an incredibly unhealthy message. Kardashian West’s post is particularly tasteless considering it is currently Mental Health Awareness Week. It is estimated that about 20 million women and 10 million men in America will have an eating disorder at some point in their lives. The actress Jameela Jamil, who campaigns around body positivity, described Kardashian West as a “terrible and toxic influence on young girls”. And in a tweet that went viral, one social media user asked how it was possible celebrities were still promoting appetite suppressants in 2018. Kardashian West is far from the only celebrity to have promoted dubious diet products on social media. Kylie Jenner has also plugged “detox teas” on Instagram, claiming in one post that the teas are “so good for your tummy area”. And last month Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential nominee and Alaska governor, shared a photo of “skinny tea” along with a 15% discount code, with her 25,000 Instagram followers. While Kardashian West at least included #ad in her post, to indicate she was being paid for the content, Palin did not. Detox teas and appetite-suppressing treats often exist in a regulatory grey area. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, dietary supplement firms do not need FDA approval prior to marketing their products. But regulators have warned that “just because you see a supplement product on a store shelf” or, indeed, on a celebrity’s Instagram page, “does not mean it is safe”. The FDA says it has received numerous reports of harm associated with the use of weight-loss products."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/16/harry-angel-york-royal-ascot-give-and-take-oaks","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T17:04:20Z","webTitle":"Harry Angel runs back into winning form at York and prepares for Royal Ascot","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/16/harry-angel-york-royal-ascot-give-and-take-oaks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/16/harry-angel-york-royal-ascot-give-and-take-oaks","fields":{"headline":"Harry Angel runs back into winning form and gets ready for Royal Ascot","bodyText":"Harry Angel brushed aside one quirk on his record at York on Wednesday when he made a winning start to a new season for the first time in his career. He will now address another anomaly when he lines up for next month’s Diamond Jubilee Stakes at the Royal meeting at Ascot – the track where he has suffered all four of his defeats. “People say he hasn’t won at Ascot but I think that’s just a fluke really,” Clive Cox, Harry Angel’s trainer, said after watching the four-year-old give 5lb and a two-length beating to the useful Brando. “I don’t think there’s anything to read into it too much.” Possibly not but the nagging suspicion among some punters that Ascot does not play to Harry Angel’s strengths should at least keep his price at or around the 3-1 that is still available after his latest success. Tasleet, who took the Group Two Duke Of York Stakes 12 months ago, was ruled out of the race on Wednesday morning and Harry Angel started at 4-9 as a result but Cox is confident his colt will find significant improvement for the run. “He was just a little bit fresh,” Cox said, “but then he’s not been off the bridle [when exercising] at home. With the ground we’ve had and the weather we’ve had, I know he’ll improve for today. He had to work in the last half furlong and that was what we couldn’t do at home. It will be Ascot next and then the July Cup [at Newmarket].” Give And Take showed a useful turn of foot to finish in front of a promising field for the Group Three Musidora Stakes but neither William Haggas, her trainer, nor James Doyle, who steered her to a one-length win, seems convinced she will appreciate an extra quarter-mile in the Oaks at Epsom next month. “She’s a three-year-old filly and she’s won a recognised trial,” Haggas said. “Her breeder [and owner, Nicholas Jones] always thought the one thing she would do is stay, so if he would like to have a crack at the Oaks, I’m not here to stop him. “But I’m not convinced she’s going to be better at a mile-and-a-half. She’s super-game and really wants to win, and I thought they looked like a nice bunch, but we’ll see.” Give And Take can be backed at 25-1 for the Oaks, a market headed by John Gosden’s Lah Ti Dar at 5-2."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"law/2018/may/16/khurshid-drabu-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"law","sectionName":"Law","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T16:50:03Z","webTitle":"Khurshid Drabu obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/may/16/khurshid-drabu-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/law/2018/may/16/khurshid-drabu-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Khurshid Drabu obituary","bodyText":"Khurshid Drabu, who has died aged 72, was Britain’s first Muslim judge, holding senior posts on immigration and asylum tribunals between 2000 and 2016. He was among those who helped to found the Muslim Council of Britain, the largest cross-sectarian umbrella body of mosques and related organisations in the UK. However, it was also important to him that his work should extend to the wider community, as an adviser to the Ministry of Defence; as a trustee of the Joseph Foundation, promoting interfaith understanding between Muslims and Jews; as a member of the Mental Health Review tribunal; and as a magistrate. In 1984, when he took on this honorary post, he was deputy director of the UK Immigrants Advisory Service (UKIAS), advising immigrants on making the most of their rights, and he went on to become deputy legal director and head of litigation at the Commission for Racial Equality (1990-97), giving assistance to hundreds of people. These were formative years for the development of Muslim and other faith identities that often complemented ethnic identity in Britain, and Drabu encouraged the CRE to seek to ensure all faiths were equally protected from discrimination. In 1997 he became a special adjudicator of immigration appeals. In the same year the Muslim Council of Britain came into operation. Drabu had advised on its constitution, and went on to oversee its elections. As a result of the heightened political and religious climate that followed 9/11, the MCB found itself the target of criticism, but Drabu focused on governance and democracy, responding to attempts to delegitimise the institution by saying: “It is the same old story – we will only accept that a nation or people has gone through a democratic process in electing its leadership if the leadership that it delivers sings from our hymn sheet.” In 2007 he helped create the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, with the aim of promoting good governance in mosques and higher standards for imams. It also looked to build bridges between Sunni and Shia communities. Drabu’s honorary work with the armed forces from 2001 led four years later to the appointment of a full-time imam. After establishing with scholars the legitimacy of military service as an expression of loyalty to the nation, he encouraged Muslims to join the forces and supported roadshows taken to mosques around Britain. He downplayed his role in raising the number of serving Muslims to more than 800: “All I told them was to provide halal food and the rest just happened.” A native of Srinagar, India, in the northern region of Kashmir, Khurshid was the only son of Ghulam Nabi Drabu, a tax commissioner, and his wife, Zarifa (nee Ashai). From Tyndale Biscoe school he went to Sri Pratap College, Srinagar, and gained a BA in political science. Then came a first-class law degree from Aligarh University (1969), alongside first-class cricket as an opening batsman for Jammu and Kashmir (1963-70). A high point came with hitting the Test bowler Bishan Bedi for four fours in an over. In 1971 Drabu travelled to the UK and lectured in law, being called to the bar in 1977. After two years as an advocate at the high court in Kashmir (1978-80) he returned to Britain and established his expertise in immigration law, winning a number of landmark cases. Starting with the UKIAS as a counsellor, he set about the work that in 2010 was recognised in his appointment as CBE. He is survived by his wife, Reefat (also born Drabu), whom he married in 1972, three daughters, Aliya, Farrah and Zayba, and a son, Hamza. Miqdaad Versi Sadiq Khan writes: My friend and mentor Khurshid Drabu was a pioneer in promoting community cohesion and interfaith work in Britain, and it is fitting that his CBE was for “bringing communities together”. He spent his life bringing people from all walks of life together – young and old, rich and poor, Muslims, Sikhs, Hindus, Christians, Jews and people from all backgrounds – all for a better and more cohesive society. • Khurshid Hassan Drabu, lawyer, born 8 March 1946; died 20 April 2018"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/live/2018/may/17/viv-albertine-webchat-post-your-questions-now","type":"liveblog","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T12:30:37Z","webTitle":"'My account isn't the definitive truth': Viv Albertine on the Slits, writing and a sumo wrestler's G-string","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2018/may/17/viv-albertine-webchat-post-your-questions-now","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/live/2018/may/17/viv-albertine-webchat-post-your-questions-now","fields":{"headline":"'My account isn't the definitive truth': Viv Albertine on the Slits, writing and a sumo wrestler's G-string","bodyText":"Thanks for all the questions – see you later! CaptainBlack says: Watching Here to Be Heard, it struck me that the women who were punk pioneers aren’t all that well-off – Tessa particularly.

Nijinska says: I loved your most recent book: it carried many echoes of my own family relationships. In particular it really made me consider my own personal blind spots. Do you feel that writing it taught you anything about your own? Vosstrent asks: What music do you listen to these days? Or have you stopped? fergus48 asks: How do you feel about the current tendency of people towards being outraged and/or offended? philipphilip99 asks: Have you ever had a favourite guitar or were you interested in them as things? ID444829 says: I was nearly your new drummer girrl in 1978 instead of Budgie and have some regrets about not running for it from my teen home life and jumping into a new life of music &amp; gigs. You lot were braver than me and we’re an immense influence on my girl gang of teenage friends. Been waiting for more stories from the women of Punk about their experiences.

Have you ever thought of doing a VLog? el0villano says: I love it every time you’re on the radio … you’re incredibly articulate … admit it - you’ve had elocution lessons … wot is your favourite song from the punk era? and your favourite song ever? alexito asks: Why didn’t the Slits release a record until late 1979, long after punk was over? I’d have bought it. WordsmithForHire replied: No one would sign them! Jai R Emmett said: Partly down to record company reticence to get involved with them &amp; them holding out for a proper record deal Eyan60 said: Punk was a word, it was not over by 79 but had changed. John Peel played the “punkier” versions of the Slits songs so when the album came out it took us by surprise in a good way. MsChips asks: Your first memoir had a huge impact on me. I read it as I was about to turn 40 and found it completely inspiring, so much so that I’ve named a character after you in a play that I’m writing about some exceptionally cool and creative women. If you could choose your legacy and the lasting influence your life/career might have on other creative women, what would it be? Benko asks: Who was your favourite teacher at Creighton school? Why? ID3852111 asks: Have you ever had a job? What was it? Daniel Prendiville asks: Would it be unfair to think that many people in the punk scene had issues relating to dysfunction? rubyskye said: Maybe dysfunction gives you the freedom to be a punk. That kind of raw, honest, original creativity could only erupt because of the bad experiences and lack of help or understanding that people had lived through. Jai R.

MoznMarr asks: I loved your first autobiography and I was really struck by the colourful and vivid descriptions of a drab and moribund England in the late 70’s. Punk injected a much needed dose of agitation and rebellion for me and many others at that time. Do you think that a similar music driven cultural revolution is possible in these days of downloads, privately educated pop stars and a risk averse, conformist media? Benko says: Did you lie when you spoke to me? LawrencePoole asks: It occurs to me that the three chief obsessions of your younger self - ie clothes, music and boys – haven’t brought you a great deal of happiness and fulfilment (apart from perhaps clothes!?). With the benefit of experience – what three things has experience taught you are more important than clothes, music and boys? Viv Albertine is in the building! Viv Albertine resists comparison. As a member of the Slits, she was responsible for forging the sound and spirit of British punk – and then documenting it as nobody had before in her first book, 2014’s riotous, unsparing and moving Clothes Clothes Clothes, Music Music Music, Boys Boys Boys, which put punk’s tired war stories through a revivifying acid wash. The memoir also chronicled the latter half of Albertine’s life – a toxic marriage, miscarriages, IVF, cancer – before she eventually rediscovered herself with the release of solo album The Vermilion Border in 2012. The book was named one of the year’s best by the likes of Rough Trade, Sunday Times and Mojo but its success was tinged with pain: as Albertine prepared to celebrate its release, she got a phone call to say that her mother was dying and left to be at her bedside. Her latest book, this year’s To Throw Away Unopened, is a forensically frank look at her mother’s death and her familial relationships. “Her conversational style of writing is lullingly deceptive, allowing the revelations, when they come, to explode like well-placed time bombs in the narrative,” wrote the Observer’s Sean O’Hagan. Albertine has spoken frankly about the collateral damage of such severe honesty: “I’ve burned all my bridges for the sake of getting as near as I can to the truth.” That’s your cue – Albertine will be taking your questions from 12.30pm BST on 21 May.

Rupert Murdoch will serve as co-chairman of the new Fox entity, which will maintain ownership of Fox’s existing news, sports and business channels. “We have worked through the winter ‘standing up’ a reimagined independent Fox,” Lachlan Murdoch, 46, said in a statement. Rupert Murdoch, 87, added: “The new Fox will begin as the only media company solely focused on the domestic market; focused on what Americans love best – sports, news and entertainment, built and delivered for a US audience.” The shift marks an actual and symbolic shift in the Murdoch empire, which has long been roiled by questions of succession. The new Fox company will be without 21st Century Fox’s film and television studios, entertainment cable channels, a stake in streaming service Hulu and regional sports networks. The formal annointment of Lachlan Murdoch comes as younger brother James Murdoch, 45, is reported to be looking at starting a venture capital fund to invest in digital and international media businesses once the $52.4bn Fox-Disney deal is completed. The younger son, who currently serves as chairman of Fox as well as the UK’s Sky, had been expected to take up a senior position at Disney. But reigning Disney CEO Bob Iger has conspicuously failed to offer specifics of any potential role. However, James Murdoch will not walk away empty-handed. His share of the Fox-Disney mega-deal will be worth roughly $1bn. John Nallen, who previously served as chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, will now serve in the same role at the new company. “The opportunity to reshape a business strategy and an operational approach uniquely tailored to the new Fox is truly compelling,” he said. But the creation of the new company could be more than a year away as US regulators must first work their way through AT&amp;T’s $85bn bid for Time Warner. In a further complication that would test Rupert Murdoch’s power over Fox shareholders, cable giant Comcast could make its own play for Fox assets."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/18/from-the-internet-to-vampire-weekend-can-a-band-survive-the-splinter-project","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T12:00:58Z","webTitle":"From the Internet to Vampire Weekend: can a band survive when members go solo?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/18/from-the-internet-to-vampire-weekend-can-a-band-survive-the-splinter-project","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/18/from-the-internet-to-vampire-weekend-can-a-band-survive-the-splinter-project","fields":{"headline":"From the Internet to Vampire Weekend: can a band survive when members go solo?","bodyText":"Odd Future are like the rap equivalent of an Amway pyramid scheme. Having started as a branding umbrella for its many members’ solo talents, it has reached the stage where the multiple groups it spawned have all started their own potentially lucrative sub-pyramids. Case in point: the Internet, who began as Odd Future’s Syd tha Kyd and Matt Martians, but enlisted friends to make a band. Since 2015’s Ego Death, each of the group’s five members has made a solo album. Now they’re back, with a new track – Roll (Burbank Funk), featuring Steve Lacy on vocals for a change – plus a new album on the horizon. “Once we all drop our solo projects I know we’ll all feel free to do whatever is best for the band,” Syd told the Fader, of the band’s solo-project leave of absence. “So there’s no more: ‘Ugh, I really wanna do this in a song and this [album] is my only chance to do that.’” That’s one theory. The other is that you can’t please both a wife and mistress. Nick Valensi spelled out his gripes with his solo-fixated bandmates in 2011, when the Strokes were making Angles. “If there’s leftover material and time, then sure, by all means [make a solo album]. But if you’re playing material that you haven’t shown to your main band and you’re just keeping it for yourself, I’m not a big fan of that,” he told Pitchfork. As well as weakening the day job, going it alone often doesn’t reveal a new you anyway. Syd’s theory of a creative sloughing-off is rebutted by …the Strokes, all five of whom eventually produced their own records. The band apart turned out not to be less than the sum of their parts; they were precisely equivalent to that sum. Albert Hammond Jr’s fuzzy-choppy rhythm guitar. Julian Casablancas’s louche baritone. Valensi’s bright cod-metal solos. All made themselves available in individual sachets. Bloc Party, similarly. For a fan, this can be an opportunity to play detective. Vampire Weekend’s solo adventures helped us figure out that Rostam was the man for the heartsore yet hopeful melodic touches, while bassist Chris Baio is apparently the font of all the oily Ivy League smarts. Elsewhere, Killers drummer Ronnie Vannucci’s Big Talk project showed him as the anthemic heart of the band. And when you return from your shore leave? Critics loved Syd’s record, Fin, but the other Internet solo efforts were met with relative underwhelm. Such varying levels of success might shift the group dynamic. Still, that won’t stop the wingmen from dreaming. In truth, few solo projects live up to the fantasy of international stardom. The reality instead often involves sitting alone in a dark room, hammering their unique genius into an unforgiving tape recorder and reminiscing about the good old days."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/may/17/bad-boys-bulletproof-and-the-rebirth-of-the-british-buddy-cop-show","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T05:00:21Z","webTitle":"Bad boys: Bulletproof and the rebirth of the British buddy-cop show","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/may/17/bad-boys-bulletproof-and-the-rebirth-of-the-british-buddy-cop-show","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/may/17/bad-boys-bulletproof-and-the-rebirth-of-the-british-buddy-cop-show","fields":{"headline":"Bad boys: Bulletproof and the rebirth of the British buddy-cop show","bodyText":"Most TV cop shows seem to be in love with the “cold open”, where viewers witness a horrible crime and the lead characters enter the story only after the opening credits – usually in a swirl of yellow police tape, white forensic coveralls and pained expressions. Sky1’s new armed police drama Bulletproof, which launched earlier this week, bucks that trend. If most shows start cold, it comes in hot, kicking off with its plainclothes heroes Pike (Ashley Walters) and Bishop (Noel Clarke) exchanging blows in a boxing ring. The sparring continues even after they hit the showers. Pike jabs at Bishop over his obsession with his hairline; Bishop responds with some below-the-belt banter about Pike’s fondness for cakes. Within that first minute, we get the picture: these guys are proper buddy-cop partners, their constant bickering just the inevitable bubbling over of a deep wellspring of bromantic love. It also feels more in line with the priorities of the big screen than the small: a common Hollywood screenwriting tenet is to introduce and establish your central characters as quickly as possible. That all seems to chime with the inspirations that helped to shape Bulletproof. Walters and Clarke themselves came up with the original concept and have cited Bad Boys as an early inspiration. It is easy to see the appeal: Michael Bay’s quip-heavy, logic-light 1995 explosion-fest was instrumental in turning Will Smith and Martin Lawrence from TV staples to bankable movie stars in their own right. The third creator credit on Bulletproof goes to Nick Love, writer/director of notorious hooligan drama The Football Factory and the slick 2012 remake of The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone. Love has made no secret of the fact that his intention with Bulletproof was to direct a UK series that could compete with US shows in terms of bang for your buck, ditching the usual UK procedural trappings in favour of high-octane action. Unlike his two co-writers and stars, Love claims to have never seen Bad Boys but he does point to the original Lethal Weapon – the violent 1987 blockbuster that minted the modern buddy-cop blueprint thanks to Shane Black’s crackerjack script – as a major influence during the making of Bulletproof’s six-episode first season. The bonnet-sliding antics of Starsky and Hutch are always going to be a more pulse-pounding prospect than, say, Morse and Lewis. So, there is nothing wrong with Bulletproof wanting to be part of the Uzi-waving, quip-firing screen continuum popularised in the US. In the opening brace of instalments, Love cranks up the thrills, staging a large-scale, screeching car chase, an ingenious robbery and various crunching punch-ups. It is big and brash stuff that is matched by the occasionally cocky swagger of its leads. Yet for all its US-style emphasis on gunplay, Bulletproof is at least as successful when it leans into its Britishness – whether that is a raucous family roast-chicken dinner where the patriarch (in this case, the magnificent Clarke Peters from The Wire) has hit the wine a little too hard – as the relatable street style of its leads. Perhaps it will even find some of the terseness and grit that gives the UK offshoot of buddy-cop TV – typified by shows such as the original Sweeney, The Professionals and Life on Mars – a harder edge than the US original. In any case, it is gratifying to see two young actors take control of their careers by successfully creating their own vehicle, especially one that positions black men as both leads and positive role models. Bulletproof feels as if it has a decent chance of finding a receptive audience (especially at a time when non-Sky viewers might have renewed a fairweather Now TV subscription to keep up with Westworld). Bulletproof has also arrived in better shape than its most closely comparable US rival. The producers of the TV adaptation of Love’s beloved Lethal Weapon – which screens on ITV on Fridays – recently fired Clayne Crawford, who for two seasons had grown an increasingly wayward moustache, as Riggs, the volatile cop originally played by Mel Gibson. Crawford will be replaced by Seann William Scott, who will have to try to cook up some chemistry with co-star Damon Wayans from a standing start. If season three of Lethal Weapon begins with Wayans and Scott sparring in a boxing ring, the circle will be complete. Bulletproof is on Tuesdays Sky1 at 9pm; also available on Now TV"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/20/as-facebook-becomes-better-policed-bad-actors-are-turning-to-whatsapp","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"As Facebook becomes better policed, bad actors are moving to WhatsApp | John Naughton","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/as-facebook-becomes-better-policed-bad-actors-are-turning-to-whatsapp","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/as-facebook-becomes-better-policed-bad-actors-are-turning-to-whatsapp","fields":{"headline":"As Facebook becomes better policed, bad actors are moving to WhatsApp","bodyText":"Jeremy Paxman, who once served as Newsnight’s answer to the pit-bull terrier, famously outlined his philosophy in interviewing prominent politicians thus: “Why is this lying bastard lying to me?” This was unduly prescriptive: not all of Paxman’s interviewees were outright liars; they were merely practitioners of the art of being “economical with the truth”, but it served as a useful heuristic for a busy interviewer. Maybe the time has come to apply the same heuristic to Facebook’s public statements. An informative case study is provided by the company’s revelations last week that in the first three months of this year it had discovered – and disabled – 538m fake accounts. This was in addition to “the millions of fake accounts we prevent daily from registering with Facebook”. In the same period, the company also took down 21m pieces of adult nudity and sexual activity, 3.1m pieces of violent content and 2.5m pieces of hate speech. Facebook divides fake accounts into two categories: ones that are misclassified by users who create profiles for businesses, organisations or even pets rather than a proper personal profile; and “undesirable accounts” – user accounts created for antisocial purposes such as spamming, fake news, hate speech etc. The problem with the figures released last week is that they don’t tell us what proportion of the 538m were in the “undesirable” category. Why is this interesting? Answer: it seems to suggest either a dramatic change in external circumstances or that the company – wilfully or unknowingly – underestimated the problem of fake accounts in the past. An analysis of Facebook’s SEC filings, for example, suggests that in 2016 the number of fake accounts was about 18.6m. In 2017, the figure had grown to somewhere in the region of 64-85m. But now it’s more than half a billion. Of course, there may be an innocent explanation for all this. Candidates that come to mind include: a significant uptick in political polarisation; the war in Syria; Isis’s pivot from land warfare to cyber; the forthcoming Irish abortion referendum; and Russia’s growing sophistication in weaponising social media. But if Facebook fails to provide more detail the temptation will be to assume that it’s just being economical with the actualité. Faced with the torrent of hate, filth and propaganda that floods on to its platform, Facebook is betting the ranch on artificial intelligence (AI) as the solution to the problem. The figures released last week suggest that AI works well against some pestilences – detecting spam (nearly 100% success), terrorist propaganda (99.5%), fake accounts (99.5%) and adult nudity and sexual activity (95.8%). But it struggles with hate speech, where AI only caught 38%, which is no surprise to either the company or the rest of us. All of these numbers apply only to what happens on the Facebook platform as its owner, belatedly, struggles to police it. As it gets a grip on the problem, however, it will run into what is known in the real world as “the CCTV effect”: while surveillance cameras reduce the level of street crime in the spaces that they monitor, criminals move to places where there are no cameras. And this is exactly what is happening to Facebook: as its main public space becomes better policed, the bad actors are moving to WhatsApp, which Facebook also owns, but that is more difficult to police because everything on WhatsApp is encrypted. Cue the fiercely contested election in the Indian state of Karnataka, in which Narendra Modi’s BJP tried to oust the Indian Congress party from power. The end result, announced last week, was a hung assembly and the likelihood that a coalition of the Congress party and the Janata Dal (Secular) party will form a government. What’s significant about this campaign was the extent to which it was fought not on Facebook but on WhatsApp. Politics in Karnataka, which is predominantly Hindu like most of India, traditionally involves pitting Hindus against the Muslim minority, and various Hindu castes against one another. A perfect environment for weaponising social media, in other words. Which, as the New York Times reported, is exactly what happened. Rightwing Hindu groups used WhatsApp to disseminate a grisly video that was described as an attack on a Hindu woman by a Muslim mob but was in fact a lynching in Guatemala. One audio recording on the service from an anonymous sender urged all Muslims in the state to vote for the Congress party “for the safety of our women and children”. And of course there were the usual fake polls, including one purportedly from the BBC predicting a BJP landslide and other staples of populist propaganda. So even as Facebook catches up with what’s being going on under its corporate nose, we find a new can of (encrypted) worms opening. So when Facebook offers its next “explanation”, let us – in the spirit of Mr Paxman – ask: why are these tech bastards lying to us? What I’m reading Now you’re talking… Remember when robotic voices sounded like Stephen Hawking? No longer. Last week, Google demonstrated what its AI-powered bots sound like and the kinds of conversations they can handle. The domains are very specific (for example, making a restaurant reservation or booking a hairdresser’s appointment) but they caused the audience to gasp when Google’s CEO unveiled them.

What could he mean, I wondered. When I discovered that he used this phrase to indicate that the economy is past its peak and “no longer potent”, I was astonished. As a “mature” woman, I found the comments offensive and demeaning. Not only are these stereotypes dangerous, they are utterly wrong. In fact, millions of menopausal women are in, or are yet to enter, their prime. Ben Broadbent has now apologised, and no doubt he is truly sorry, but the fact that he made these comments clearly indicates these are his views. This type of bias, whether conscious or unconscious, has no place in modern thinking. Such language signals an attitude to older women that should have been consigned to the history books by now, but clearly persists. Indeed, as a champion for older workers, I am aware that these comments are a classic example of the gender bias that permeates the workplace all too often, and prevents many older women from achieving the status they deserve. In some industries, women are locked out of promotions, and career progression stops once they reach their late 40s or 50s. This is not the first time the Bank of England has been in hot water for its attitudes to women. Of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee, only one is female. Its gender pay gap report last year showed that men at the Bank are paid 25% more than women on average. And five years ago it decided to withdraw the only female face on sterling currency notes, without planning to replace her with another woman. Let me explain more precisely why these remarks are so worrying. They send out a signal to women in business – from younger women who are trying to build a career to older ones – that such derogatory attitudes may still permeate the business world from the very top. To be clear, the idea that the menopause signals that a woman has passed her peak productivity must be rebutted in the strongest terms. They are not past their peak at all – they are just moving into a new phase of their life, which can often be more dynamic. They have more wisdom, maturity and life experience, which can make them more productive and energetic. Each woman experiences menopause differently, but the idea that it signals some kind of female slowdown is simply not true. As business champion for older workers, when writing my report calling for greater support for people over 50 in employment I described the menopause as the “last taboo” of health issues in the workplace. Women don’t talk about this, and the fact that so many women do not discuss it openly means there may be an element of shame. If women talked about it, perhaps men might understand it more. There is nothing to be ashamed of; this is just a temporary health issue, with no significance for work or performance. Mental health is discussed openly now, whereas it used to be hidden away, so come on, ladies – let’s show the men that we will not tolerate being unfairly stigmatised in this way. Menopause hot flushes are actually what I call “power surges” and the body changes can even be liberating. It’s time to shout out about the value of women of all ages and get rid of the old-fashioned, damaging gender biases that have held sway at the top of the male-dominated business world for far too long. • Ros Altmann is the UK government’s older workers’ business champion"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/16/emily-thornberry-assad-popularity-syria-interview","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T16:21:20Z","webTitle":"Emily Thornberry cites popularity of Syria's Assad in interview","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/emily-thornberry-assad-popularity-syria-interview","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/16/emily-thornberry-assad-popularity-syria-interview","fields":{"headline":"Emily Thornberry cites popularity of Syria's Assad in interview","bodyText":"The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has a greater “depth and breadth of support than is recognised in the west”, the shadow foreign secretary has said. Emily Thornberry’s remarks to the magazine Prospect are likely to be controversial among those who regard Assad as a brutal dictator who has killed tens of thousands of his citizens and driven millions of refugees over the border. Thornberry is likely to argue that she was merely saying a segment of public opinion do not recognise that Assad has greater popular following inside Syria than the opposition forces suggest. Thornberry is quoted as saying: “There is an argument that if [Assad] had been as overwhelmingly unpopular as the rebels told the west at the outset, then he wouldn’t be there. I think there has been a depth and a breadth of support for Assad that has been underestimated.” In the interview, Thornberry, who has been accused of taking a lenient approach towards Assad before, called for political talks to end the civil war, and said Russia could bring Assad to the negotiating table in Geneva. She urged all foreign troops to leave Syria. Thornberry also suggested that the UK should support the peace process backed by Russia in Astana, or Sochi, as well as the one conducted through the UN in Geneva. She said: “I think we should be working with whatever works, for the sake of the Syrian kids. None of this is revolutionary.” Thornberry refused to condemn Russia in the interview for repeatedly vetoing UN security council resolutions aimed at ending the civil war in Syria, or investigating the responsibility for chemical weapons attacks. She said: “People will always block resolutions. If you look at the number of resolutions America has blocked, I mean that’s the way of politics.” Thornberry has previously denied that she in any way defends the Assad regime, but sees it as her role to challenge the government to explain its thinking given the reality that Assad is winning a military war and is unlikely to be dislodged. The shadow foreign secretary in the interview also refused to say whether the Baltic states of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, currently members of Nato, should have joined. Asked whether it was right for the alliance to expand, she said: “There is a feeling in Russia that they don’t like the current status quo.” She adds: “Putin is taking advantage of that by his bellicose language and his behaviour.” Prospect says she declined to back Nato’s dispatching of troops, 800 of them British, to protect the Baltic states from any future Russian attack. There are, she says, “more pressing current issues”, citing cyber-attacks on Estonia. Thornberry has said she is a supporter of the former Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook’s foreign policy. She has also said that she backed the military interventions in Kosovo and in Libya. Thornberry told Prospect that she questions the future of the so-called doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect, the legal basis to intervene in other countries for humanitarian purposes. She said: “I think the doctrine of Responsibility to Protect is … well, I don’t want to say it’s dead, because I want it to be alive.” She then says it is “on life support”. Libya, Thornberry says, helped to finish it off. She said military intervention in Libya “has been such a disaster. Responsibility to Protect is not [supposed to be] a cover for ‘Those people are being treated badly, let’s go and bomb, everything will be fine.’ It didn’t work – look at Libya now.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/16/water-shortages-to-be-key-environmental-challenge-of-the-century-nasa-warns","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T17:00:05Z","webTitle":"Water shortages to be key environmental challenge of the century, Nasa warns","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/16/water-shortages-to-be-key-environmental-challenge-of-the-century-nasa-warns","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/16/water-shortages-to-be-key-environmental-challenge-of-the-century-nasa-warns","fields":{"headline":"Water shortages to be key environmental challenge of the century, Nasa warns","bodyText":"Water shortages are likely to be the key environmental challenge of this century, scientists from Nasa have warned, as new data has revealed a drying-out of swaths of the globe between the tropics and the high latitudes, with 19 hotspots where water depletion has been dramatic. Areas in northern and eastern India, the Middle East, California and Australia are among the hotspots where overuse of water resources has caused a serious decline in the availability of freshwater that is already causing problems. Without strong action by governments to preserve water the situation in these areas is likely to worsen. Some of these hotspots were previously undocumented or poorly understood: a region in north-western China, in Xinjiang province, has suffered dramatic declines despite receiving normal amounts of rainfall, owing to groundwater depletion from industry and irrigation. The Caspian Sea was also found to be showing strong declines owing to similar forces, which is resulting in a shrinking shoreline. Previously, this change had been attributed to natural variability, but the new report demonstrates it was caused in large part by the diversion and extraction of water from rivers that feed it, for agriculture and industry. This depletion mirrors the well-known fate of the disappearing Aral Sea in the same region: because the Caspian Sea is much bigger it would take millennia to disappear altogether, but its shrinking shoreline and pollution will cause major problems throughout its borderlands. The comprehensive study, the first of its kind, took data from the Nasa Grace (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission to track trends in freshwater from 2002 to 2016 across the globe. “What we are witnessing is major hydrologic change. We see for the first time a very distinctive pattern of the wet land areas of the world getting wetter, in the high latitudes and the tropics, and the dry areas in between getting drier,” said James Famiglietti, of the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, and co-author of the paper published today in Nature. “Within the dry areas we see multiple hotspots resulting from groundwater depletion.” Climate scientists, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have predicted such a global trend. The new paper’s authors said it was too soon to confirm whether their observations were definitely the result of global warming, but said their results showed a “clear human fingerprint” on the global water cycle. The study is unprecedented, as the Grace data allowed the scientists to see in detail the changes in freshwater resources around the world, even where locally amassed data has been scarce or unavailable. By linking the satellite data with local monitoring, they added another crucial dimension. Marc Stutter, of the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen, who was not involved with the study, said: “Such new data add insight into how we manage both obvious surface waters and hidden subsurface water stores [as] the satellite techniques see vital hidden water reserves under our feet, much like an x-ray to see the health of our unseen water reserves.” He said it provided an early warning that could allow better management of water resources across the world, which was needed. In northern India, groundwater extraction for irrigation of crops such as wheat and rice have caused a rapid decline in available water, despite rainfall being normal throughout the period studied. “The fact that extractions already exceed recharge during normal precipitation does not bode well for the availability of groundwater during future droughts,” the authors said, adding that the much-discussed melting of Himalayan glaciers was of only minor significance in the period studied. In Iraq and Syria, widespread over-reliance on groundwater has resulted from the construction by Turkey of 22 dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, over the last three decades. This has made the area the biggest hotspot identified by the study, outside of sparsely or uninhabited regions such as Antarctica and Greenland, with water resources nearly a third below their normal state. Jonathan Farr, senior policy analyst at the charity WaterAid, said governments must take note of the findings and increase their role in preserving water resources and providing freshwater to people in a sustainable manner. “This report is a warning and an insight into a future threat. We need to ensure that investment in water keeps pace with industrialisation and farming. Governments need to get to grips with this,” he said, pointing to estimates that between $30bn and $100bn of investment was needed per year to provide freshwater where needed. Sustainable solutions were available, he said. “We have been solving the problem of getting access to water resources since civilisation began. We know how to do it. We just need to manage it, and that has to be done at a local level.” Providing access to clean water provides knock-on benefits to health, education, equity and the economy, he added, so investment in water assets yields both economic and social dividends."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/the-week-in-radio-mental-health-minute-chris-hawkins-jo-whiley-simon-mayo-daniel-kitson","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"The week in radio and podcasts: Mental Health Minute; Chris Hawkins; Jo Whiley and Simon Mayo; British podcast awards and more","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/the-week-in-radio-mental-health-minute-chris-hawkins-jo-whiley-simon-mayo-daniel-kitson","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/20/the-week-in-radio-mental-health-minute-chris-hawkins-jo-whiley-simon-mayo-daniel-kitson","fields":{"headline":"The week in radio and podcasts: Mental Health Minute; Chris Hawkins; Jo Whiley and Simon Mayo; British podcast awards and more","bodyText":"Mental Health Minute Chris Hawkins (BBC 6 Music) | iPlayer Jo Whiley and Simon Mayo (BBC Radio 2) | iPlayer A Reason to Wake Up (Daniel Kitson) Resonance FM British Podcast Awards At the 2018 Radio festival at the British Library in London last Tuesday, much hoo-ha was made of a 60-second message that was broadcast across almost as many networks as you can think of (300-plus) at precisely 10.59am. This was the Mental Health Minute, a plea for listeners to make time for those suffering from mental health issues, whether themselves or friends. The message – ask someone how they are, and really listen to the answer – was delivered by various luminaries, including Lady Gaga, Prince Harry and Judi Dench. At the British Library there was a countdown to the broadcast, and we were informed that #MentalHealthMinute was trending at No 1 on Twitter. There is something uncomfortable about such hooray-for-radio self-congratulation, I find, though the project is obviously highly commendable. On Twitter, many shared their own tips to reduce stress. The hashtag also revealed some off-message tweets, including mild pornography from tone-deaf bots. Other tweeters wondered whether a minute was helpful at all, given the current state of mental health care in this country. More interesting – and important – was the on-air talk. Chris Hawkins, who presents 6 Music’s early-morning breakfast show, branched off in an odd direction: he decided to appear in a couple of episodes of Doctors, the daily soap, and to take us on a tour around the set. Hardly helpful to anyone’s mental health, I’d have thought. However, Hawkins’s interviews with an actual real-life medical person, neuropsychologist Dr Catherine Loveday, were on the money. They focused on musicians, many of whom suffer from anxiety and depression with devastating results, as evidenced by the recent deaths of Scott Hutchison and Avicii. Hearing a life that seems impossibly romantic described in mental health terms was sobering. Loveday quoted a musician: “You’re either smashing it or you’re a failure.” I once talked to a therapist about such feelings. She told me that it’s safest to regard life as somewhere in the middle. On Radio 2 on Monday, Jo Whiley and Simon Mayo began their new late-afternoon show. It was somewhere in the middle. They are both immensely likable presenters, with egos robust enough to cope with co-hosting. But at the moment the show doesn’t quite work. Their first gambit – a jokey, low-key chat about how to open the show, which track to play – seemed lackadaisical rather than relaxed. And their interview with Benedict Cumberbatch wasn’t up to much, though this wasn’t anyone’s fault: he was in to talk about Patrick Melrose, a TV series that involves a lot of drug-taking and also child abuse, none of which he could discuss at 5.20pm on a Monday. Later in the week they kept talking over each other during phone interviews. None of this is insurmountable, – I expect it will only take a few weeks – but for now, Mayo and Whiley are not quite there. Here’s another newbie… on Resonance FM, for three weeks (there’s one left), offbeat standup Daniel Kitson is hosting the breakfast show. His choice of music on A Reason to Wake Up is impeccable, from Nadia Rose to Tricky to Tune-Yards to Janelle Monáe, and his presenting has shambolic charm. “As you can tell, I haven’t really given these bits much thought,” Kitson said on Tuesday, before recounting an anecdote about small boys playing in his street, segueing into whether he should swear on the radio (he did, just for the punchline), and singing a ditty about getting a coffee and riding his bike. It all reminded me of GLR (Greater London Radio) back in the late 90s, when off-duty comedians would rock up to the office and burble into the microphone without any production or preparation at all. I enjoyed it a lot. Finally, at the British podcast awards last night, everyone was happily smashing it: bright-eyed, bushy-miked and full of ideas. There were some well-deserved winners, three of which are in the podcast list below. Three winnners from this week’s British podcast awards The Allusionist Winner of smartest podcast. Helen Zaltzman, its presenter and producer, also won podcast champion, quite correctly. Zaltzman is a podcast ninja, and The Allusionist, about the origins of words and language, is a consistently funny and informative listen – sharply edited, impeccably researched, wittily presented. Just the ticket for when you want to learn without being lectured. Zaltzman is also the co-presenter, with Olly Mann, of Answer Me This!, and has spoken on more “what is the future of podcasting” panels than anyone else, ever (probably). The Two Shot Podcast Craig Parkinson’s actor-talking-to-actor show – best culture podcast – is revealing precisely because it doesn’t really try to be. He concentrates on the technical and emotional side of the profession, rather than trying to tease out personal disclosures, usually spending quite some time on the slog of non-success, rather than the glory years. Over the past couple of years, hHe has interviewed more than 40 actors: mostly people you vaguely know, rather than household names. All have been interesting, and this is down to Parkinson’s charismatic interviewing. Carousel Radio Carousel Radio won this year’s Represent award. It’s a Brighton-based podcast that is planned and presented by a group of learning-disabled DJs and radio presenters. These are voices you just don’t hear on the airwaves very often, and their perspective is very different: they highlight problems with transport, they interview musicians, they “tell bad jokes”. They also offer their own creative works, often music and spoken word. Engaging and surprising, and a new favourite for me."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/17/diane-lockhart-the-good-fight-in-praise-of","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T10:00:26Z","webTitle":"The Good Fight: in praise of Diane Lockhart, one of TV's greatest characters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/17/diane-lockhart-the-good-fight-in-praise-of","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/17/diane-lockhart-the-good-fight-in-praise-of","fields":{"headline":"The Good Fight: in praise of Diane Lockhart, one of TV's greatest characters","bodyText":"The Good Fight has been so relentlessly delightful to watch lately that it can be hard to reconcile the seriousness of its subject matter – the turmoil of the Trump era and the rise of violent populism – with the uproarious filter through which it’s being examined. The most unlikely thread running through it has been my hero Diane Lockhart’s increasingly untethered reaction to a political world turned upside down, which began with a bartender offering her a microdose of psilocybin mushrooms at a funeral, and continued through an occasional glimpse of hallucinatory news stories, that may or may not be real, which certainly speaks to the unnerving unpredictability of unstable times. Time and again, Diane has been one of the most satisfying characters on television. She is capable, wry, and rarely loses her grip on anything, though this political climate has been testing. The Lockhart laugh, clipped and steady, often employed to devastating effect in The Good Wife, has appeared with more frequency in The Good Fight, which has seen her slowly evolving evaluation of and response to the Trump presidency. The absurdity seemed to paralyse Diane for a while; the unreality brought her to a point of near-apathy that has surely tempted many over the last 18 months. But at last, as the second season moves into its home stretch, she has flushed away the psychedelics, and is focusing on the attack with renewed vigour. Last week, when challenged by a young woman in charge of a #MeToo-ish website called Assholes to Avoid, who accuses Diane of betraying young women’s feminism for assisting in the site’s takedown, she finally snaps back. “Women aren’t just one thing,” she insists, “and you don’t get to determine what they are.” Leaving aside the intelligent portrayal of the case itself, which had the whole office arguing to the point of fury about the lines between a bad date and sexual assault, if ever there was a manifesto of Diane Lockhart, then surely it’s that. In the series finale of The Good Wife, when she slapped Alicia Florrick, having been betrayed by both a friend and a work rival – get you a woman who can do both – she offered a glimpse of her emotional side. For a long time, Diane was a professional in the plainest sense of the word. We knew little about her other than through her career and ambitions. She didn’t have a family; any wrangling over work-life balance was left to Alicia. She was brilliant, and allowed to be so, without apology or regret. She was The Good Wife’s moral backbone but she was also its light relief. She could clink a whisky tumbler as well as she could demolish a district attorney. In a show stuffed with obscenely strong performances, the incredible Christine Baranski, tough as iron yet somehow malleable enough to be surreal and silly, seemed to be having the most fun. And that is to say nothing of that wardrobe, and her impossibly immaculate hair. (To see her with wet hair recently, slicked back after her impromptu martial arts training – a bizarre and welcome replacement for the mushrooms – was a rare vision.) In 2015, Baranski explained why Diane is such an appealing character. “I love her intelligence, I love that she’s in command of the facts. I think it’s great to see a woman who’s not just an emotional self or, at times, not an emotional being at all – she’s an intellectual being.” I admire Diane for that as much as I admire The Good Fight for now beginning to push her beyond it. While her icy command of any situation has long been a cooling balm, that slap allowed us in a little more. Her on-off relationship with Kurt has been a mature portrait of a marriage in which neither person is desperate for the other but would like to work out an honest way of being in each other’s lives. For all of Colin and Lucca’s goofy to-ing and fro-ing, or Maia’s impulsive infidelity, the romantic heart of the show, never overdone, is Diane figuring it all out. She is in the middle of a pleasingly grownup dilemma, and it is unusual, more’s the pity, to see a picture of a woman not in her 20s (Baranski is 66, but Diane is ageless) making a mess of love. But only, of course, if she can find the time. By the end of The Good Wife, Alicia Florrick had become an admirably complex character, though not necessarily someone you would always choose to spend an hour with each week. The slap had been a long time coming – and with it, Diane ended a friendship, and took over Chicago."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/16/respect-for-the-mabinogion-set-in-stone","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T16:06:09Z","webTitle":"Respect for The Mabinogion set in stone | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/respect-for-the-mabinogion-set-in-stone","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/respect-for-the-mabinogion-set-in-stone","fields":{"headline":"Respect for The Mabinogion set in stone","bodyText":"Jim Perrin proves he is in the zeitgeist by devoting his column (Country diary, 12 May) to a speed retelling of the fourth branch of The Mabinogion, for he has published it smack between a Radio 4 In Our Time programme on the Mabinogion and Wales’ forthcoming storytelling festival, Beyond the Border, which this year features retellings by some of Wales’s best storytellers of all four branches over one weekend, a feat only ever attempted, to my knowledge, once before (at least in living memory). I would like to reassure Jim Perrin about the change that has taken place at Bryn Saeth, the site of Llech Ronw. Although he laments that the eponymous stone has “been set upright, concreted into a plinth”, he is wrong about it being surrounded by wire, and his heart might be lighter had he had the same conversation that I had with the farmer in whose field the stone once lay, and now stands. He told me he did this at his own expense, and surrounded it with a little wooden fence out of respect for the story, and to protect the stone from his sheep. Neither the Welsh assembly nor Cadw, our national heritage organisation, were interested in giving him a grant to do so, he told me. It was heartening to learn that the landscape and its natural features are still alive with Blodeuwedd’s story to ordinary people in Gwynedd. Paid a becso, Jim bach (don’t fret)!

They’re long gone","bodyText":"At the weekend, I sat in a Parisian cafe, sipping a coffee and reading the reminiscences in Libération about the events of May 1968. Fifty years ago to the day, more than 300,000 people had marched through these streets demanding the resignation of President Charles de Gaulle, one of the high points of the rebellion. One of the banners held high in the crowd announced: “Those in power are in retreat! Now they must fall!” Today, the thing that needs saying about 1968 is that it was indeed a liberation, but that it was also a failure. In 1968 it felt as if the European world had come alive again after a long hibernation. Society, ideas and culture changed for the liberal better afterwards. Above all, women’s equality flourished. But political and economic power did not change. Those in power may have been in retreat in 1968, certainly so in De Gaulle’s case. But they did not fall. Mostly they were soon re-elected. May 1968 was followed, in the main, by the electoral victories of the right, not the left. Georges Pompidou, Richard Nixon and Ted Heath were all in power by 1970. Franco survived in Spain. The Andreotti era began in Italy. Leonid Brezhnev’s tanks crushed the Prague spring. Only in West Germany, where 1968 expressed a very particular reckoning with the post-1945 era, did the social democrat Willy Brandt come to power as an agent of change. The political failure of 1968 was not just reflected in subsequent elections. The failure was also historic on a larger scale. Half a century on, it is perhaps hard to understand how intensely 1968 felt at the time like a political rebirth – and how intensely that rebirth was sought on the postwar left. Across Europe, but particularly in France, the events were an often conscious reaffirmation of a form of revolutionary left politics with deep 19th- and early 20th-century roots and echoes. This politics aspired to spark the frustratingly contented working class into a new era of militancy. It took place in the streets and in the factories. It attacked the police and other institutions of power. It sometimes used and consistently romanticised violence. It drew directly on the legacies of 1789 and 1917. Part of this was further energised by what were then called third world movements, especially in Cuba and Vietnam. In the end, though, this revolutionism overthrew almost nothing. The Paris events were not the French or the Russian revolution reborn. May 1968 was less the beginning of a new form of politics, and more the end of an old form. It had more in common with the defeated Springtime of the Peoples in 1848 than with the dubious achievements of the Jacobins or the Bolsheviks. We all live with that legacy still. After 1968, the revolutionary tradition in Europe was largely spent. No democracy, then or subsequently, was overthrown. Clandestine groups, principally in Germany, Italy and the Basque country, turned to more extreme violence. The IRA revived in Northern Ireland. Yet even this did not last. The guns eventually fell silent. Instead, the nations that changed most radically in Europe were the authoritarian states – not the supposedly repressively tolerant democratic ones. In 1968, many of us young people on the streets of western Europe called ourselves revolutionaries. No one serious says this any longer. Yet as the era of Jeremy Corbyn shows, a romantic attachment to aspects of that old revolutionism still has an allure to some. What I still retain from Britain’s minor 1968 experience is the era’s Europeanism. The films we watched were European. So were the political authors who excited us. Paris was still the greatest city in Europe. In 1968 we bounced down Whitehall doing the Ho Chi Minh hop to the chant of “Paris, London, Rome, Berlin / We shall fight and we shall win.” Four European reference points, please note. In fact we fought a little but we didn’t win. In 1968 I was scandalised when the revered Italian communist Giorgio Amendola denounced student revolutionaries as enemies of the workers’ movement. Today I am much closer to Amendola’s view. He understood that the revolutionary moment had gone. He saw that the future for the left lay with reformism and alliances. He grasped how progressive movements have to work in democracies. After 1968, Amendola spent the rest of his political life pressing for principled compromises within the left to enable it to govern. That has not changed. Arguably it is not just the romance of the barricades that has gone now. Even the idea of the popular movement itself is questionable. Extra-parliamentary politics means little, and even peaceful demonstrations do not shift governments. The Chartists used to argue about whether to use “physical force” or “moral force” to achieve their aims. 1968 marked the death of physical force politics. They should not be mourned. Our real problem today is that moral force politics is so weak too. • Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/16/prince-charles-roayl-wedding-chatter-sustainable-fashion","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T15:35:44Z","webTitle":"Prince Charles avoids wedding chatter to talk sustainable fashion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/prince-charles-roayl-wedding-chatter-sustainable-fashion","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/16/prince-charles-roayl-wedding-chatter-sustainable-fashion","fields":{"headline":"Prince Charles avoids wedding chatter to talk sustainable fashion","bodyText":"When Prince Charles met British fashion designers, retailers and editors on Wednesday, he succeeded in steering conversation away from wedding dresses and on to clothes made from salvaged plastics and the prospects for reviving Scottish wool production. The royal has long been a connoisseur and patron of traditional British menswear, but his interest in sustainability aligns him with the more hipster end of the fashion spectrum. This visit was in support of the work of the Positive Fashion initiative, which promotes sustainability, best social and environmental practice, equality and local production. Over sandwiches and mini Victoria sponge cakes at this spring’s most fashionable new London venue, the new White City outpost of the members’ club empire Soho House, the prince declined the modish cocktails made with Seedlip non-alcoholic “gin” and cucumber in favour of a cup of tea. He admitted he was looking forward to the wedding on Saturday but preferred to discuss offering the use of his nettles (“I’ve got lots of those”) to Vin and Omi, a “responsible luxury” brand that produces organic fabric from plants from the Cotswolds and plastic bottles salvaged from cleanup projects. The prince discussed how to bolster the British wool industry with Amy Powney, who has invested the prize money she was awarded last year by the prestigious British Fashion Council/Vogue Fashion Fund in making her east London label, Mother of Pearl, environmentally friendly and sustainable. He also met Bethany Williams, a young designer using clothes to support women’s rehabilitation. For her latest collection, waste materials were woven into fabric by women at a drug rehab facility in Italy, before being constructed by prisoners at HMP Downview in Sutton in a scheme designed to teach women workplace skills. The prince’s look was pure Savile Row – double-breasted suit tailored by the 112-year-old house Anderson &amp; Sheppard, silk tie with a miniature elephant motif, striped Turnbull &amp; Asser shirt – but the message was in tune with the mood of modernity and diversity being championed by a royal family who, from Saturday, will include a mixed-race woman with a successful career, a previous marriage and clear political views as a (de facto) princess. Coming soon after the Queen’s surprise front row turn at London fashion week in February, it appears to signal a change in direction from the palace. Royal strategists have latched on to the fashion industry as a public platform because it is seen as modern and dynamic – and less likely to stir up any fractiousness between royals and the media. In a pre-wedding week dominated by publicity around Thomas Markle Sr’s staged paparazzi photos, the White City event, in support of an industry that contributes £29.7bn in GDP to the UK economy and supports 850,000 jobs, hit a welcome positive note."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/16/an-unlikely-idea-for-middle-east-peace","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T16:06:44Z","webTitle":"An unlikely idea for Middle East peace? | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/an-unlikely-idea-for-middle-east-peace","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/16/an-unlikely-idea-for-middle-east-peace","fields":{"headline":"An unlikely idea for Middle East peace?","bodyText":"In 1902, Theodor Herzl wrote a book, Altneuland (OldNewland), presenting the laughable – at the time – idea that Palestine, then over 90% Arab, should be turned into a Jewish state. The sheer improbability of the proposal at the time did not prevent the predicted events coming to pass. This week, on the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Israel, we published a short book, A Modest Proposal To Solve the Palestine-Israel Conflict, in which – perhaps equally laughably – I summarise the benefits to Palestinians and Israeli Jews of setting up a democratic state between the Jordan and the Mediterranean in which all people living in that area have equal rights and to which those Palestinians who want to can return. Increasingly frequently it is being admitted in public that the two-state solution is dead in the water, and another solution is needed. Two months ago, 60 review copies of A Modest Proposal… were sent out to newspapers, periodicals, and radio and TV programmes, so it is puzzling that none of them, including the Guardian, has reviewed this book, published an article based on it, or even addressed the issue at all. Perhaps the world will have to wait another 46 years before the only fair solution to this running sore of world politics is finally put in place. Karl Sabbagh Managing director, Skyscraper Publications • The logic of those, like the numerous and distinguished signatories to the letter (15 May) headed by Prof Tony Booth who argue that the two-state solution is dead, is irrefutable. But I believe it is wrong. Despite all that has gone on, it is still the only game in town. The advocacy of a secular state with equal rights for all is an attractive proposition but an illusion which does not measure up as “the reality” it is claimed to be. However implacable the odds against it appear to be, those who work for it on both sides of the divide should be campaigning for two states, which, I submit, with goodwill from Israelis and Palestinians, is realisable, particularly now when Palestinians have their backs against a hostile world and Israel is featuring characteristics of a neocolonial, quasi-fascist regime.

Govia Thameslink Railway, which operates Britain’s largest rail franchise, covering a quarter of all journeys, has rescheduled every train as it brings in more than 400 extra services a day. Unions have claimed the infrastructure will struggle to cope, while passenger groups have expressed dismay that many services used by regular commuters will be withdrawn. GTR, which operates Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern trains, said the new timetable would ensure a more efficient and reliable service, and overall capacity would be dramatically increased – with space for an extra 50,000 passengers into London in the morning peak, and 80 more destinations served directly from stations in the capital such as Farringdon and Blackfriars by next year. The bulk of a £7bn Thameslink upgrade programme has been completed, allowing for more of the new, longer trains to cross the capital at higher frequencies. Many journeys will now be routed through London Bridge station, which was officially reopened last week. GTR admitted some passengers and stations across its network faced altered and reduced services as it tries to maximise its capacity. Passengers in some locations have complained that they will now be left with fewer or slower trains, including in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Kent, East Sussex and Surrey, where many commuters pay thousands of pounds a year for annual season tickets. Emily Ketchin, the founder of the campaign group Harpenden Thameslink Commuters, accused GTR of cutting key Harpenden services by a third without consultation. “This is going to have a real impact on people’s ability to get to work, especially working parents who already struggle with juggling childcare and work commitments,” she said. A GTR spokesman said the new timetable had been developed with careful analysis over many years, and had been under consultation for 18 months with 28,000 responses. He said a doubling of passenger numbers meant the old timetable no longer accounted for the time needed at busier stations, contributing to delays on every service and causing disruption. GTR said Harpenden services were being reduced temporarily due to upgrade works of the neighbouring Midland mainline, but more trains would be restored in 2020. Some other destinations should see more trains by December 2019 as the company gradually builds up the frequency of trains running through central London. Some disruption is expected while trains and crews are redeployed over the coming weeks. Anthony Smith, the chief executive of the passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said: “Many passengers will have a greater choice of services; however, there will also be some who lose out. Those who haven’t seen the warnings will get a surprise when they go for their usual train on Monday morning.” The RMT union, which remains in dispute with GTR over the role and responsibilities of onboard train crew, said the new timetable would place massive strain on the infrastructure and staff. The unions’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said the company was “winging it with potentially disastrous consequences”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/16/un-human-rights-council-special-session-gaza","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T15:46:53Z","webTitle":"UN human rights body to hold special session on violence in Gaza","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/16/un-human-rights-council-special-session-gaza","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/16/un-human-rights-council-special-session-gaza","fields":{"headline":"UN human rights body to hold special session on violence in Gaza","bodyText":"The UN’s top human rights body will hold a special session to discuss “the deteriorating situation in the occupied Palestinian territories” after the killing of 60 Palestinians by Israeli troops at mass border protests on Monday. The meeting came as the office of the prosecutor of the world’s permanent war crimes court on Wednesday expressed “grave concern” about escalating violence in Gaza, and said alleged crimes could be investigated. “Any new alleged crime committed in the context of the situation in Palestine may be subjected to the office’s legal scrutiny,” a statement said. “This applies to the events of 14 May 2018 and to any future incident.” Dozens of Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire during protests on Monday, the day the United States relocated its Israel embassy to Jerusalem. On Wednesday, a senior Hamas official, Salah Bardawil, claimed 50 were members of the organisation. Amid the continuing international fallout from the killings, which coincided with the ceremony to mark the transfer of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the Palestinian foreign ministry announced it was also recalling its ambassadors to four European countries, to protest against their participation in a party held by Israel’s foreign ministry celebrating the opening of the new embassy. In a rare concession, a senior Israeli military spokesman said the killings by Israeli soldiers had handed a PR victory to Hamas. According to a report in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli military spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus, told members of the Jewish Federations of North America: “We haven’t been able to get that message out of how it is from our side, what we are defending – and the ‘winning picture’ overwhelmingly, by a knockout, unfortunately, have been the graphics from the Palestinian side. “The amount of casualties has done us a tremendous disservice, unfortunately, and it has been very difficult to tell our story.” On Wednesday the Palestinian foreign ministry said its ambassadors to Romania, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria were being called home for consultations. The European Union objected to the embassy move, but the four European countries broke with EU policy to attend the celebration. “We highly value our relations with all EU member states. Those relations are based on the commitment to international law, UN resolutions and human rights. Therefore we consider the participation in this event a contradiction to such values,” Amal Jadou, a Palestinian foreign ministry official, told the Associated Press. The move came as Israel and Turkey traded tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions after the deadly violence along Israel’s border with Gaza. A day after it expelled the Israeli ambassador, Turkey asked Israel’s consul general in Istanbul to leave as well. Israel, in turn, summoned a top Turkish diplomat to be reprimanded for the humiliation of Israel’s ambassador, Eitan Naeh, as he was kicked out of the country. The ministry accused Turkey of subjecting Naeh to a particularly severe security screening at the airport in Istanbul and inviting local Turkish media to capture the humiliation of him being frisked and forced to remove his shoes and jacket. The exchanges came less than two years after the countries reconciled and exchanged ambassadors after six years of animosity. Although a relative calm has descended on Gaza itself since Monday, the Israeli military reported that its tanks shelled a Hamas military post in the Gaza Strip after it said its own forces came under fire. More than 100 people have been killed by Israeli fire since the protests began on 30 March, drawing international accusations that Israel is using excessive force. Israel says it is rightfully defending its sovereign border."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/16/paddy-power-betfair-in-talks-to-buy-fanduel-after-us-sports-betting-ruling","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T10:10:45Z","webTitle":"Paddy Power Betfair in talks to buy FanDuel after US sports betting ruling","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/16/paddy-power-betfair-in-talks-to-buy-fanduel-after-us-sports-betting-ruling","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/16/paddy-power-betfair-in-talks-to-buy-fanduel-after-us-sports-betting-ruling","fields":{"headline":"Paddy Power Betfair in talks to buy FanDuel after US sports betting ruling","bodyText":"Paddy Power Betfair has made the first move in an expected wave of takeover activity prompted by the legalisation of sports betting in the US, as it launched a bid for fantasy sports league company FanDuel. Shares in UK gambling companies soared earlier this week as investors responded to the US supreme court’s decision to overturn a law known as PASPA, a ban on sports bets that had stood for 26 years. Many analysts believe London-listed firms are well placed to grab a slice of the US market, where some estimates say nearly $150bn (£111bn) in illegal wagers are placed every year. While US states will have to draw up their own gambling laws, a process that could take years in some cases, the shift in the US landscape is expected to encourage British firms to seek takeovers or become targets themselves. Paddy Power confirmed it was already in talks with FanDuel “to create a combined business to target the prospective US sports betting market”. FanDuel is a web-based fantasy sports game with 6 million registered users, who can put together virtual teams in sports such as American football and win cash prizes based on their success against other players. Such websites have slipped through the net of the US ban on sports betting because they are seen as games of skill rather than of chance but an alliance would help Paddy Power push betting products through the site. If a deal goes ahead, it is likely to be worth considerably more than the $48m (£35.6m) that Paddy Power paid for FanDuel’s smaller rival Draft last year. FanDuel, which was blocked from merging with its main competitor DraftKings by the US competition regulators last year, has been valued at $1bn by some analysts. Paddy Power Betfair’s shares jumped by more than 12.2% in a day when the supreme court announced its decision earlier this week, signalling analysts’ belief that it is well placed to launch an assault on the US market. They closed up a further 6% on Wednesday at £82.15 as markets digested the potential for the company to add FanDuel to its existing US operation. As well as its fantasy sports presence via Draft, Paddy Power Betfair owns horseracing TV channel TVG and an online casino in New Jersey, the state that challenged the ban on sports betting and has made the most progress putting preparations in place for the industry to grow. However, while Paddy Power hopes to be the buyer in this case, analysts at the stockbroker Goodbody said European betting firms could find that they are tempting targets for US companies looking to purchase expertise. “Given the regulatory and taxation headwinds that European operators are facing in their home markets over the next few years, [the repeal of PASPA] is a very attractive long-term positive for the companies under our coverage and as such is supportive of their long-term growth prospects,” they said. “It also could see European operators speculated as potential M&amp;A targets, given the unique sports betting skill set they possess,” said the analyst Gavin Kelleher. Shares in the online casino 888 and the high street bookmaker William Hill jumped by 15% and 11% respectively on the repeal of PASPA. Both have a US presence and have previously explored options for consolidation before ultimately rejecting them. William Hill and Canada’s Amaya called off a £4.6bn merger in 2016, while the British bookmaker turned down a tentative approach for a three-way merger with 888 and the Mecca Bingo owner, Rank."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"the-guardian-foundation/2018/may/16/a-wake-up-call","type":"article","sectionId":"guardian-foundation","sectionName":"Guardian Foundation","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T14:45:47Z","webTitle":"A wake up call?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/the-guardian-foundation/2018/may/16/a-wake-up-call","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/the-guardian-foundation/2018/may/16/a-wake-up-call","fields":{"headline":"A wake up call?","bodyText":"...thoughts from a conference on Media Freedom &amp; Pluralism in Bulgaria... As I sit here in a hotel conference room in Sofia, something occurs to me. I’ve been hearing the same thing for 3 years now. Independent media is dying out across Eastern Europe and the Balkans. There is no money, the political pressure is unbearable, quality media organisations and journalists are harassed, slandered and sometimes killed. And every year it is getting worse. A story Reporters Sans Frontier’s excellent World Press Freedom Index shows. If this trend continues there is a very real chance there will be almost no quality, independent media left in a third of Europe soon. And let’s be honest, if all the media is controlled and manipulated by the state, there is only one word for that…. There is only one independent daily newspaper left in the whole of Bulgaria and its circulation is dwindling. It is time we woke up and realised that Media Freedom is not just a good thing for society. It is vital, essential if democracy is to be maintained in Europe. As we in the UK know all too well, democratic processes like elections and referendums can only work when the public have access to accurate and balanced information. Whose responsibility is it? Major media organisations around the world must show more solidarity. It’s time journalists got over their queasiness for writing about journalists. It is not indulgent, it is about a threat to democracy itself. The EU must show consistency, must stop turning a blind eye to countries where it is politically inconvenient, like here in Bulgaria. Journalists across the Balkans and Eastern Europe must organise and build robust networks. Finally, willing academics must ensure standards of journalism education are maintained and the latest digital innovations taught - even under these most challenging of circumstances."},"isHosted":false},{"id":"money/2018/may/22/fabletics-sportswear-drained-teenager-account-vip-membership","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T06:26:29Z","webTitle":"Leggings firm drained my 16-year-old daughter’s bank account","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/22/fabletics-sportswear-drained-teenager-account-vip-membership","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/may/22/fabletics-sportswear-drained-teenager-account-vip-membership","fields":{"headline":"Leggings firm drained my 16-year-old daughter’s bank account","bodyText":"My 16-year-old daughter bought a pair of leggings from the Fabletics website. She was totally unaware that, in clicking to receive a first-time discount, she had signed up to become a VIP member, costing £44 a month if you do not buy anything. She rarely has £44 in her bank account but, following some babysitting, she did, which Fabletics has taken from her account. I immediately phoned the company, which claims to have cancelled her membership, but it will not refund her without me emailing her birth certificate as proof she is a minor. She says she had no warnings that this money was due to be taken. This manner of trading is disgraceful. EW, Crawley Who in their right mind would want to agree to a membership that automatically deducts £44 from your bank account unless you log in and opt out of that month’s payment? All you get for your money is a promised discount on further purchases. And yet, that is how the Fabletics website operates: big discounts on sports clothing are promised – leggings from £77 (yes £77) down to £26 – if you sign up for the VIP membership at checkout. The firm, which claims it has more than 1.4 million active VIP members globally, says customers have to be 18 to make a purchase or to join the programme, but admits that a date of birth is only optional at sign-up. It also states that it is clear about how it operates. “The key features of the VIP membership programme are explained on the Fabletics home page and are repeated through the checkout process and on the dedicated ‘how it works’ page of the site,” it says. The company has now apologised and your daughter has had her £44 returned. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

According to a new study by researchers from North Carolina State University, chimpanzees have cleaner sleeping arrangements than humans – and that may be precisely because we insist on using the same sheets over and over. More than a third of the bacteria found in human beds is from our own bodies, be it skin, oral or faecal. PhD student Megan Thoemmes, the lead author of the paper, which was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, said she and her colleagues “wanted to know how this compares with some of our closest evolutionary relatives”. Chimpanzees build fresh beds from branches and leaves every day. Thoemmes led a team of researchers collecting swabs from 41 such chimp nests in Tanzania and found they contained significantly fewer body bacteria than a bed in the average human household. “We found almost none of those microbes in the chimpanzee nests, which was a little surprising,” she said. Even when they searched for arthropods such as fleas, lice and ticks in 15 of the nests, the scientists came up almost empty-handed. “There were only four ectoparasites found, across all the nests,” Thoemmes said. “And that’s four individual specimens, not four different species.” It has been estimated that up to a third of the weight of a person’s used pillow could be comprised of dead skin, dust mites and their feces. A standard household’s duvet could contain some 20,000 mites, while a typical used mattress may hold anything up to 10m of them. Although the chimp nests were found to contain a more diverse selection of microbes, those microbes appeared to come from the nests’ surroundings, not from the chimps themselves. The NCSU study concludes that humans “have created sleeping places in which our exposure to soil and other environmental microbes has all but disappeared, and we are instead surrounded by less diverse microbes that are primarily sourced from our own bodies”. And that may have increased our vulnerability to allergies and other health conditions. “In some ways,” said Thoemmes, “our attempts to create a clean environment for ourselves may actually make our surroundings less ideal.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/16/konta-brushes-aside-hsieh-in-rome-to-avenge-french-open-defeat","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-16T14:23:24Z","webTitle":"Konta brushes aside Hsieh in Rome to avenge French Open defeat","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/16/konta-brushes-aside-hsieh-in-rome-to-avenge-french-open-defeat","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/16/konta-brushes-aside-hsieh-in-rome-to-avenge-french-open-defeat","fields":{"headline":"Konta brushes aside Hsieh in Rome to avenge French Open defeat","bodyText":"Johanna Konta looks to be loosening up, on and off court, as she heads for the French Open where, despite her talent and ambition, she has gone out in the first round three visits in a row. In the last two of those campaigns she has left Rome for Paris in decent form, and on Wednesday she completed a hat-trick of year-on-year bagels against opponents in what used to be called the Italian Open, defeating the most inventive – if fragile – of players on her tour, Hsieh Su-wei, 6-0, 6-4 in an hour and five minutes. It was a cleansing of the spirit for Konta, who lost to Hsieh, a doubles artist par excellence but de-fanged considerably in singles, in the first round at Roland Garros a year ago. However, because tennis is such a revolving door of glory and disappointment, Konta’s opponent in the third round on Thursday is Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French champion, who advanced the previous day by beating Shuai Zhang in two sets. “She backed her French Open win up significantly the following months,” Konta said of the 20-year-old Latvian. “She made the quarters of Wimbledon, she made Singapore and she has already made the final of Miami this year. She is a big ball striker, so I know I am definitely going to have to work hard at staying strong in some of the points.” She had no problem doing that against the feathered touches of Hsieh but still had to work to unlock the peculiar riddles the Taiwan wizard poses. Her forehand buzzed again but, although she is satisfied with her hitting on both wings, a couple of backhands looked tentative, particularly towards the end when she was striving for a quick finish. “It’s never a straightforward match against her,” Konta said. “The first set was quite quick [19 minutes] but I was fully prepared to play as long as needed. Overall, I’m happy with the way I was playing. I played the way I wanted to play. I was looking to keep her moving forward, trying to take that time away from her, and give her as little opportunity as possible to be as creative as she is. “I learn from each match I play against every opponent. Yes, she’s definitely unique, very talented and a crafty player. I think I had already improved a lot from when I played her at the French, to when I played her at Wimbledon.” Nevertheless, she probably could do without playing her again too soon. Konta has had a cold all week but she is not one to complain. She loves Rome and has visited twice on holidays, indulging her love of food. As she was winding up, Novak Djokovic, looking as if he could do with a hearty meal, interrupted his post-match stroll to the locker-room to ask Konta, “Can I experience your cooking one day?” Konta, who had been elaborating on her love of the kitchen and finding new recipes, replied: “To be fair, it’s my parents and my boyfriend who say it’s good. They are a bit biased but I’ll bring stuff in.” Both winners on day three, which finally let the sun through, they agreed the Konta feast will take place at Wimbledon. Djokovic, famously particular about his diet, suggested anything “gluten-free, dairy-free or sugar-free”. She paused, smiled and said: “I’ll make it work.” It’s not often players get to relax on either tour, given the helter-skelter schedule and the grinding round of media and commercial commitments they have to squeeze in between matches and training. Djokovic – who cannot have used up many calories in the hour and 17 minutes it took him to beat the qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili – looked his old relaxed self. Perhaps, his stuttering comeback will take off soon. Konta, meanwhile, will work on her cooking. “Right now I’m basically going through the monthly Waitrose magazine recipes, and they’re great.” And she is nowhere near as pernickety as Djokovic. “I’m fortunate in that I don’t have any allergies or intolerances. I look to make good choices and right choices for my body. What you put in you get out.” Over the years, she has put plenty in. At 22 in the world after a long spell in the top 10, she is looking to take some more out this summer, starting with Ostapenko in the third round. She won their only encounter, in three sets on the grass of Eastbourne last year. A breakthrough into the fourth round would keep Konta on track for more tough challenges in her half of the draw, which still includes the world No 1, Simona Halep, the Americans Sloane Stephens and Madison Keys, as well as the mercurial Caroline Garcia. Kyle Edmund made it a third-round double for Britain’s best on the men’s and women’s tours when he beat Lucas Pouille 6-2, 7-6 (3) in an hour and 34 minutes under lights on Court Pietrangeli."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"music/2018/may/19/drakes-mates-and-taylor-swifts-cosplay-exploring-the-2018-music-video","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T09:00:23Z","webTitle":"Drake’s mates and Taylor Swift’s cosplay: exploring the 2018 music video","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/19/drakes-mates-and-taylor-swifts-cosplay-exploring-the-2018-music-video","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/19/drakes-mates-and-taylor-swifts-cosplay-exploring-the-2018-music-video","fields":{"headline":"Drake’s mates and Taylor Swift’s cosplay: exploring the 2018 music video","bodyText":"Expensive garbage Before Marvel monopolised blockbuster season and tried to crowbar in some, like, intelligence, you could always count on a mega-budget film experience to sit in front of and unplug your brain. Thankfully, that kind of gloriously empty nonsense still exists in pop videos and it’s mainly Taylor Swift and director Joseph Kahn’s fault. First there was 2015’s feminism-destroying Bad Blood, in which every high-gloss “futuristic” scene screams: “The budget for this one video is more than your entire album campaign!” That was then followed by last year’s Route One dystopian cosplay video ...Ready For It?, which appeared to re-use some of the old Bad Blood sets while borrowing its one aesthetic highlight from Scarlett Johansson’s version of Ghost in the Shell. Worst of all was End Game, in which lavish country-hopping ended up looking like the most expensive (and boring) episode of A Place in the Sun.

Obviously there are bits filmed in black-and-white because all music video directors understand that a lack of colour connotes a lack of ideas, which in turn saves on retouching, which in turn helps with the budget for the album campaign in the long run.

But this is 2018 and extras in videos are now made up entirely of other famous people. Drake’s recent Nice for What video is essentially a showreel for random female actors and models to practise their various #moods. So we get Issa Rae smiling her way through a frustrating business meeting, Jourdan Dunn filmed in black-and-white looking miserable on a horse, and Letitia Wright seemingly stuck up Battersea Power Station.

So, sometimes a music video is the last thing a schedule will allow, and that’s where things get creative, ie everyone panics. Ed Sheeran’s latest slightly pass-agg love song Happier features a puppet rendering of the multi-millionaire, who is in the middle of a world tour, while serial collaborator Selena Gomez used the same excuse for not appearing in a video with Charlie Puth. That must surely have been why Kelela put out the animated, Sims-inspired Frontline video, too, right?

Since then, every other two-bit pop star has tried their supple hand at interpreting feelings and/or emotions via the medium of a crab-like physical contortion. Sia and Maddie, alongside Florence Welch’s billowy arm gestures, also paved the way for Christine and the Queens, AKA Héloïse Letissier, and her slightly more artfully rigid moves. These have, in turn, shown up recently in Dua Lipa’s IDGAF promo, in which Lipa faces off against herself in some sort of besuited dance battle that’s all locked limbs, jagged elbows and – perhaps taking cues from original dance overlord Michael Flatley – fairly blank from the neck up.

It’s a co-ord, which means two matching soft-separate pieces that go together to make an outfit. By soft-separate, I mean a top and bottom in cotton, like this one, or silk or knit, not a tailored suit. And by matching, I mean in the same colour and/or print. (Black doesn’t count.) And, no, not a bikini. Is co-ord really a word? Well, Brexit wasn’t a word. Bromance wasn’t a word. Was quinoa a word before this decade? OK, maybe technically, but not one anyone used, so it hardly counts. And, no, we can’t call them matching soft-separates, because that sounds too 1970s regional department store. So co-ord is a word as of, well, now. A co-ord is cooler than a suit and sharper than a dress. Matched pairs of things veer towards the twee – I am thinking of twinsets, and shoes matched to handbags – but a co-ord does the opposite. It’s as if you took your date dress and consciously uncoupled it. So modern! Also, at the risk of stating the eye-bleedingly obvious, you can wear the two halves… separately. I am a bit allergic to fanciful ideas about how to make clothes multitask, because most of them are idiotic. (“On holiday, why not wear your swimsuit to dinner? Just add a full-length ball skirt and diamonds!”) But even I can see that a co-ord can be taken apart and put back together again. This shirt would work on holiday with denim shorts. And when the summer starts to end, the skirt can meet a rolltop sweater and ankle boots for a summer-to-autumn look. The co-ord is, as I mentioned, cool. So I think it’s fine that the type I am wearing here is the least hipster version. The more rock’n’roll end of the look is happening in festival fashion: a striped knitted bandeau top with matching pull-on miniskirt, or a white denim bustier and matching shorts. There’s loads of that sort of thing around. If that’s your bag, you can accessorise your look with ironically ugly trainers and glitter makeup, and a bum bag worn slung over one shoulder, or whatever. For the rest of us, a pyjama suit, with silky trousers and a wrap or shirt jacket, is about as outre a version as is going to be wearable. (Zara has lots.) Or, a slick tracksuit, the kind you wear with a low heel instead of an ironically ugly trainer (I am obsessed with Ganni’s candy-pink version). It’s cool, it’s wearable, and you can put an outfit together in the dark. Game, set and matching. • Jess wears shirt, £29, and skirt, £36, both topshop.com.

Whoever becomes the Labour candidate is all-but-guaranteed to represent the south London seat vacated by Heidi Alexander, who secured a majority of 21,000 at last year’s general election. Alexander is departing to take up a job as Sadiq Khan’s deputy mayor for transport in the capital. Labour leftwingers are divided about who they will back in the contest. Momentum is campaigning for Sakina Sheikh, who joined the party to vote for Jeremy Corbyn in 2015. But the Unite trade union, which is Labour’s biggest donor, with close links to Corbyn’s office, is supporting the NEC member Claudia Webbe. Sheikh told the Guardian she believed the fact that she has lived in Lewisham all her life – in contrast with Webbe, who is a councillor in Islington, north London – meant she was better placed to understand the local community. “I think Claudia Webbe is a fantastic Labour party activist – I admire her work,” she said, but she added: “As someone who lives in Islington, and comes from Islington, she can’t know what the people of Lewisham need.” Webbe has the backing of the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who has been tweeting enthusiastically in support of her cause, describing her as a “formidable campaigner”. Local Labour sources believe the frontrunners for selection are Sheikh and Janet Daby, the deputy mayor of Lewisham, who have different approaches towards Labour’s Brexit policy. Daby has made clear she will follow the lead set by Alexander, who was co-chair of the Labour single market campaign, urging the party’s frontbench to adopt a softer Brexit position. In a tweet, Daby said she knew “how concerned people are about Brexit” in the strongly pro-remain constituency, and would “put the interest of our community first” by supporting continued membership of the single market and customs union. Sheikh has said she would differ from Alexander and back the leadership over Brexit. “South Londoners don’t have strops, they make history,” she tweeted. Corbyn has suggested he fears key aspects of the single market could tie the hands of a future Labour government. Members of the local Labour party will choose the candidate at a hustings on Saturday morning. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats hope to use the byelection to send a message to the Labour leadership about Brexit. The Lib Dem leader, Vince Cable, said: “We would aim to cut the majority substantially.” “The big picture issue is Corbyn and Brexit; why is he hand-in-glove with Theresa May on Brexit? We will major on that issue,” he said. Cable has already visited the constituency once, and will return at the weekend."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/20/marks-spencer-to-reveal-latest-list-of-store-closures","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T15:53:38Z","webTitle":"Marks & Spencer to reveal dozens of store closures","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/20/marks-spencer-to-reveal-latest-list-of-store-closures","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/20/marks-spencer-to-reveal-latest-list-of-store-closures","fields":{"headline":"Marks & Spencer to reveal dozens of store closures","bodyText":"Hundreds of Marks &amp; Spencer staff will find out as soon as Monday whether their store is closing, as the retailer accelerates its retrenchment from struggling UK high streets. The M&amp;S chief executive, Steve Rowe, is shutting 100 of its large clothing and food shops amid falling sales and profits. It has already closed 20, affecting about 900 jobs, but staff are braced for the axe to fall on another tranche of stores before the announcement of its annual results on Wednesday. The closures are part of a plan announced 18 months ago to slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its ailing clothing ranges. Initially, just 30 out of a group of 105 underperforming stores were to shut but Rowe has decided on a more aggressive closure plan as sales move online. The City is expecting M&amp;S to report a second year of falling profits with analysts pencilling in pretax profits of £573m, down from £614m in 2017. Clothing and home like-for-like sales are forecast to be down 1.1%, with food sales dropping by 0.2%. After several years of disappointing financial results, the restructuring at M&amp;S has entered a more radical phase since Archie Norman was installed as chairman. There have been a number of casualties in the boardroom including Andy Adcock, the boss of its upmarket food halls, who has been replaced, and marketing chief Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne. When the company updated investors six months ago, Norman was frank about the scale of its problems. M&amp;S had been “drifting” for more than 15 years, he said, as he promised to speed up store changes and tackle its misfiring food business. Rowe has been in charge for two years but, with no green shoots to celebrate and a backdrop of weak consumer spending, M&amp;S’s share price has fallen by nearly a quarter over the past year. The decline means the 134-year-old retailer’s place in the prestigious FTSE 100 could now be in jeopardy. M&amp;S has been a member of the blue chip index since its inception in 1984 but could be relegated to the FTSE 250 in a stock exchange reshuffle next week. Relegation would be a symbolic moment for the British institution that has struggled to hang on to shoppers in a digital age. Ocado, the online grocer, and Asos, the fashion website, are now worth more than M&amp;S in market value terms in a sign of the sea change in shopping habits. Ocado surged past M&amp;S on Thursday after it struck a major deal with US supermarket chain Kroger. Rowe will flag price cuts this week in the food and clothing aisles as M&amp;S attempts to fight back against the growth of value chains such as Primark, Aldi and Lidl. He will also announce investment in the warehousing needed to support the growth of its website. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black predicted an improving trend in clothing sales but felt that the food business had fared less well. “It’s the perpetual conundrum of M&amp;S,” he said. “Can it get the stars aligned and both businesses growing at the same time? Not yet.” Other UK retailers are also facing tough trading conditions. Last week Mothercare announced plans to shut 50 stores, putting at least 800 jobs at risk. House of Fraser is also planning store closures, and fashion chain New Look is considering shuttering 60 outlets. Rising competition from online retailers such as Amazon also hit Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia retail empire, where sales dropped 5.6% to £1.9bn last year."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"global-development/2018/jun/26/uganda-girl-trekked-barefoot-escape-marriage-13","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-26T12:09:33Z","webTitle":"The Ugandan girl who trekked barefoot to escape marriage at 13","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jun/26/uganda-girl-trekked-barefoot-escape-marriage-13","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/jun/26/uganda-girl-trekked-barefoot-escape-marriage-13","fields":{"headline":"The Ugandan girl who trekked barefoot to escape marriage at 13","bodyText":"Scholastica Nacap walked barefoot for 60km, across dangerous mountain terrain in north-east Uganda, to avoid getting married. She was just 13. Orphaned at nine, she was told by her father’s relatives she must marry a much older, wealthy man, so Nacap ran. “I had to escape. I couldn’t accept [becoming] a wife and mother at 13,” she says. Five years on Nacap is back in Karamoja, this time leading the way in the fight against early marriage and child pregnancy in this remote region. Child marriage is common in Karamoja, which has a population of about 1 million people, mainly pastoralists, scattered across 27,900 sq km of semi-arid terrain. “Change is a gradual process that takes time,” says Alain Sibenaler, Uganda’s representative of the UN population fund, UNFPA. “However, through awareness-raising and community engagements, communities are beginning to appreciate the need to invest in education.” Globally, an estimated 12 million girls are married before they turn 18. A report by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and the World Bank concluded that child marriage costs nations billions and destroys life prospects for girls.The legal age of marriage in Uganda is 18 (although girls can marry from 16 with parental consent), but UN statistics suggest 40% of girls marry before 18, and 10% before they are 15. The ICRW report said a lack of sex education and access to youth-friendly sexual and reproductive health services contributed to early pregnancies that very often lead to early marriage. The Uganda Demographic and Health Survey 2016 reported that almost a fifth (19%) of girls aged 15 to 19 have given birth – another 5% were pregnant with their first child. Teenagers in rural areas were more likely to have children at a young age. Around 25% of those who drop out of school are pregnant teenagers. Uganda has one of the world’s youngest populations, with 75% of people below the age of 30 and 58% under the age of 20. The country also has one of the highest fertility rates – women give birth to an average of 5.6 children – compared with 4.8 in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. This is attributed to low use of contraceptives and early marriage.Nacap is one of those trying to turn the tide where she lives. She now helps at a club for girls run by Bangladeshi NGO Brac, aimed at 10- to 22-year-olds and offering information on the dangers of early marriage and pregnancy. They also provide training, including tailoring and agricultural skills, and advice on how to manage money. “In club discussions I advise the girls to shun early pregnancy and early marriages. I tell them not to be deceived by boys to ruin their future. I encourage them to go to school to study,” says Nacap, who is back in contact with her family. “Those who can’t manage studies [I encourage] to engage in a particular business activity and earn money for themselves.” There are 250 clubs in Karamoja’s seven districts. “We share our experiences by telling stories, participating in debates, discussion of issues such as rape, adolescent sexual and reproductive health rights, growing up and menstrual hygiene. We talk about HIV, family planning and contraception,” says Nacap. A total of 14,392 of girls have attended since May 2016, and about a quarter of them now run a business or have a job. About 80% have control over their earnings and 59% participate in household decision-making. Nacap now runs a small bakery and restaurant – making doughnuts and selling cooked mixed maize and beans, chapatis and tea. She is not married and does not plan to be any time soon. “Which boy or man can deceive and lure me? No. I have money from business. I am busy trying to expand it. I don’t have time to think about men and marriage,” says Nacap. She uses some of the money she earns to support her two sisters. “I need them to study and become role models. Our [relatives] should stop thinking about marrying them off. They should educate them to become lawyers, teachers, engineers and bankers who can make change in our community,” says Nacap. “I need financial support. I need to expand the bakery and restaurant business to achieve my dreams.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/askjack/2018/may/17/how-can-i-stop-an-unexpected-windows-10-update","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-17T11:05:07Z","webTitle":"How can I stop an unexpected Windows 10 update?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2018/may/17/how-can-i-stop-an-unexpected-windows-10-update","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/askjack/2018/may/17/how-can-i-stop-an-unexpected-windows-10-update","fields":{"headline":"How can I stop an unexpected Windows 10 update?","bodyText":"Yesterday, I intended to take my laptop to visit a client, but when I was about to set off, yup, I couldn’t turn it off without allowing Microsoft to do its upgrades. We all know how long that takes, and I had a train to catch, so I ended up having to wing the whole presentation. The infuriating thing is that I knew there was an upgrade around, so I had checked the power settings that morning to see if one was waiting to be installed. There was no update at 9am. Somehow Microsoft snuck it in without my noticing. I do understand that people need to install updates, but can’t Microsoft give us an escape route? This is my computer and my software and my business, so please can you trust me, just this once? Celia It’s easy to be caught out by Windows updates, and I once left the house carrying an open laptop, confident that the update would finish long before the battery ran down. However, there is a fundamental divide between consumer and business versions of Windows. With consumer versions, such as Windows 10 Home, Microsoft takes a paternalistic view of updates: it tries to do what’s best for people who don’t know what they are doing. Business versions – Windows 10 Pro and the Enterprise and Education editions – are designed to allow IT departments and knowledgeable customers more control. That includes ways to defer some updates for a week, a month or even a year. Many update problems stem from business people using consumer version of Windows, and this is understandable for sole traders and companies that are too small to employ IT staff. I don’t even think the extra features in Windows 10 Pro – BitLocker, Hyper-V, Remote Desktop etc – would be much use to people in your position. However, it doesn’t cost much to upgrade, and could be worth it if being able to delay upgrades helped you win a new client. Otherwise, Microsoft has a Windows Update FAQ and a help page with a troubleshooter that you can download to help fix update problems. Update strategy Laptops that are only used intermittently seem more likely to receive forced updates. Microsoft tries to download updates in the background without users being interrupted or even aware that it’s happening. If you have an always-on desktop PC, the process is almost completely reliable. If you use a laptop for intense work then shut it down when you stop, there aren’t many gaps for updates to be downloaded and installed. You can help by setting your laptop to stay awake for an hour or two while it’s charging. You can also pre-empt some inconvenient upgrades by looking for them. Set aside an hour each week to clean up your PC, tidy away files, check your backups and perhaps run an extra virus scan with something like Malwarebytes Free. During your housekeeping session, run the Settings (cogwheel) app, click “Update &amp; Security” and see if any updates are pending. If there are, you can either install them or click “Advanced options” and pick a time and date when you want them installed. If there aren’t, click the button that says “Check for updates” and see if it finds any. Your PC may appear to be up-to-date, but a search may find updates marked “pending install” or “pending restart”. After you’ve installed those, check again, because there may be even more updates to install. If you need a lot of updates, they tend to come in batches, not all at once. Pay particular attention after the second Tuesday of each month – “Patch Tuesday” – when Microsoft usually releases security fixes. Microsoft is updating almost 700m PCs running Windows 10, and it doesn’t try to update all of them at once. By checking for updates, you can jump the queue and install them at your preferred time, not when Microsoft’s update servers get around to it. Schedule a restart When you have a restart pending, the Settings app provides two options: “Restart now” and “Schedule the restart”. Choose to schedule it and you can enter a date and time for the restart, which means you can put it off for up to six days. Also click on “Advanced options” on the same Settings screen, and select the last option: “We’ll show a reminder when we’re going to restart. If you want to see more notifications about restarting, turn this on.” Instead of simply restarting at the time you entered, Windows 10 will ask again, enabling you to delay it again. Active hours Windows 10 lets you set “Active hours” in the Windows Update section of the Settings app. Click on “Change active hours” to set the times when you usually use your PC. You can reserve 18 hours out of 24 for work. Microsoft will generally not update your PC during these times. If you are using your PC, you should get a “Heads up” notification to tell you that a restart is pending. You can either hit “Restart now” or “View settings” and select a time and date for the restart. I suspect that Microsoft did once restart my PC during my active hours, after I left it unattended for a couple of hours, so always save any work-in-progress beforehand. It takes less than a second to hit Ctrl-S. Metered connections Microsoft knows that not everyone has unlimited broadband, so it allows for “metered connections”. By default, Windows 10 sets ethernet wired and wireless networks to non-metered, and mobile connections to metered. People who have capped broadband and unlimited mobile broadband could switch these around, but the defaults suit most users. If you have a metered connection, Windows Update will only download priority updates automatically, so it will be up to you to download the others. Setting both connections to metered will limit the amount of data Microsoft downloads, making you less likely to get a major update when you don’t expect one. To set metered connections, run the Settings app, click on “Network &amp; Internet” and then select “Change connection properties”. Frankly, I don’t think setting metered connections offers enough benefits to be worth the effort, but some people may find it useful. Windows 10 Pro The business and professional versions of Windows 10 provide more control, even to people who are not IT experts. For example, the advanced options page in the Settings app includes an extra control, Pause Updates. This prevents any updates from being installed for the next week, though when the time is up, you cannot pause it again. If you have Windows 10 Pro, this is the simplest solution to the Windows update problem. You can simply install all available updates on (say) a Sunday then pause updates during your working week. The business versions of Windows also include Group Policies, which allow IT managers to control how their fleets of PCs work. However, you can edit them manually. Type edit group policy in the Windows search box and run the editor (gpedit.msc), then look for Windows Update in the Administrative Templates section, under Computer Configuration. The default setting is “3 – Download the updates automatically and notify when they are ready to be installed”. You can change it to “2 – Notify for download and notify for install”. That will reduce the chances of Windows 10 installing downloads when you’re not ready for them. GPEdit also allows you to defer “quality updates” for up to 30 days, and “feature updates” for up to 365 days. This is useful for businesses that need to test applications before installing updates. It doesn’t prevent your PC from restarting to install security updates, but usually this doesn’t take very long. Disable updates Windows geeks know that you can do all sorts of things with its Administrative Tools. For example, double-click Services, and find Windows Update in the list. Yes, you can control how this service starts up, and you can stop it from running until you next reboot Windows. People shouldn’t mess with Services unless they know what they are doing. However, a small utility called Winaero Tweaker provides easy access to all sorts of tweaks, one of which is Disable Windows 10 Updates. This is not something I recommend, but there are times when it could be a useful short-term expedient. At least Winaero Tweaker is safer than people changing Services or editing the Windows registry directly, where ignorance can lead to unfortunate results. Have you got a question?

Here you feel that an eerily compelling novel, with its multiple narration and Hitchcockian voyeurism, has been turned into a workmanlike thriller and you focus more on what is missing than on any minor gains. Rachel Wagstaff and Duncan Abel, who have done this version, may have jettisoned Hawkins’s triple narrators and ingenious time-scheme but they remain true to the basic events. The main character, Rachel, is alcoholic, unemployed, divorced and obsessively interested in what she sees through train windows. She finds herself inexorably drawn to the case of a missing woman, Megan, about whom Rachel has fantasised and whom she has glimpsed kissing a man palpably not her husband. Given that Rachel was seen in the neighbourhood on the night of Megan’s disappearance, might she have vital clues to the case? When the book came out, Rachel was wrongly dubbed “an unreliable narrator”: in fact, she was the victim of drink-befuddled memory rather than calculatedly misleading. Wagstaff and Abel, however, seem determined to clean up her act. Here she is less an alcoholic than a mild tippler and, far from being neurotically concerned by her haphazard recollections, turns into an amateur sleuth always one step ahead of the investigating cop, Gaskill. You can see what the writers are trying to do, which is to get away from the idea of the hapless, helpless, psychologically wrecked heroine, but while I admire their social purpose, it doesn’t enhance the story. It’s one thing to give female protagonists agency, but it doesn’t need to be detective agency. It’s also not just the mysterious Megan who goes missing: so do vital characters from the book. Presumably for reasons of economy, the writers have dropped the figure of Cathy in whose flat Rachel lived and who was deeply censorious about her house guest’s booze-guzzling. Without Cathy, however, there seems no logical reason why Rachel should keep up the pretence of commuting to work every day and even her drinking loses its guilty furtiveness. I not only wanted Cathy to come home but I also yearned to see more of Rachel’s ex-husband and his new wife, who are an essential part of the heroine’s muddled memories. Joe Murphy does a decent job of staging the action and Lily Arnold’s design suggests we are glimpsing events through an enlarged carriage window. The use of dazzling lights and express-train sounds to evoke Rachel’s memories is, however, misleading: the whole point of the story is what she sees when a train is at rest rather than in hectic motion. On the plus side, Jill Halfpenny captures well Rachel’s dogged determination to get to the root of the truth, Colin Tierney is sympathetic as the cop who never seems sure whether he should believe Rachel or book her and Florence Hall lends Megan the right touch of raffish glamour. Everyone works with a will but I sense that, having been turned into a so-so Americanised movie and now a humdrum stage version, Hawkins’s book resists adaptation and should be left in the hands of enthralled readers. • At West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, until 9 June.

Her latest, One-Seventeen, deals as much with grownup as with adolescent Sarah, and tells not one long story but several interconnected short ones. Their connectedness is the point, at least according to Kendall’s closing tale, which invokes wonder at how lives (and stories) interrelate and overlap. But I’m not sure the show quite bears that philosophic weight: it’s absorbing from one moment to the next, but adds up to no more than the sum of its parts. It’s introduced as “a show about luck”, and begins in 10-year-old Kendall’s garden, where her family gathers at night to watch Halley’s comet race across the sky. Stargazing is a recurring theme in a show that opposes two viewpoints on chance and mischance. To Kendall’s mum, almost everything can be construed as a bad sign. But her dad is phlegmatic: bad luck is often good luck in disguise. These arguments recur throughout but aren’t really dramatised by the show, which leads us from astronomy via teenage friendship to hamster care, from infancy past adolescence to life as a middle-aged mum. Kendall is a skilled raconteur: it’s beguiling to follow her tales as they flow into and splinter off from one another. There are gripping moments, as she wrestles with her son’s autism diagnosis or retells the tall tale of her gran’s abduction by aliens. But One-Seventeen lacks the forward propulsion of its predecessors, and the connective tissue between its stories (notwithstanding the claims made by Kendall’s climactic section) is weak. Occasionally, as when her brother reacts to a real-life car crash as if he were in The Dukes of Hazzard, the relationship between humorous form and serious subject matter feels awkward. Elsewhere they dovetail smoothly, and it’s easy to be seduced by a show that at least grapples with some big ideas about how fate, fortune and family connections ripple through the ages.

Few can boast Jones’s verbal flair. And in court his voice moved from calm and measured to bristling with anger as he told stories about Grantham flood victims, at one point pausing to fight back tears. There was a defiance in his familiar voice. This sort of indignation is what he does best. He said the people of Grantham “could most probably handle the loss of assets and homes and property”. “They simply weren’t able to handle the fact that no one believed them.” • Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Jones did. And his series of broadcasts in 2014 and 2015 have led him to the Brisbane supreme court, where he is being sued by the Toowoomba-based Wagner family for defamation. Jones sat and listened to himself, on air, describe the Wagner family in one of those shows as “selfish, insensitive grubs”. He denied that statements he made about the Wagners were “vicious”, but agreed they were “savage” and justified”. Before the lunch break, barrister Tom Blackburn SC began his cross-examination of Jones. It represented a turning of the table. The shock jock on the other end of an interview. Jones became angry at the dogged repetition in Blackburn’s questioning. He refused to answer questions he thought were “hypothetical” or that lacked context. “You’re talking definitionally, I’m talking factually,” Jones said at one point. The session was peppered with memorable exchanges. “Mr Jones, we’ll get through this a lot more quickly if you just concentrate on my questions,” Blackburn interjected as Jones provided his own lengthy uninvited context. At one point, Blackburn accused Jones of lying in a broadcast. “Excuse me,” Jones thundered, the loudest moment in an afternoon session where the 77-year-old spoke with increased volume and speed and pitch. “We’re not in the business of telling lies, Mr Blackburn. We leave that to other people.” The broadcaster become indignant at Blackburn’s repeated suggestion that the Wagner family was not given an opportunity to respond to the substance of the allegations against them relating to the deaths of 12 people in the town of Grantham during the 2011 floods. “For goodness sake, I’ve got a lot to do in a day, I won’t waste time making phone calls to people who say ‘you are blackballed, I won’t speak to you’,” Jones said. “So they actually they buy silence, by indicating that they won’t speak to you. Now that proposition is untenable in any journalistic place.” “I was saying what I wanted to say, which was indisputable fact. The Wagners didn’t seem to be remotely concerned.” The Wagner family refused to be interviewed on air on Jones’s terms. The broadcaster now has no choice but to be grilled on theirs, in a courtroom.Questioning is expected to continue until Monday.

Either way, the heroine of this fine Parisian drama is impossible to stop watching. Laetitia Dosch is a revelation as Paula, whom we first meet banging her head against her ex-boyfriend’s door. As she enters her 30s, cast adrift with no prospects to speak of, we’re genuinely concerned for her fate. Deadpool 2 (15) (David Leitch, 2018, US) 119 mins Post-Infinity War, the world might not be ready for another superhero struggle against Josh Brolin, but this Ryan Reynolds-starring sequel delivers in terms of adult-oriented spectacle, pop-culture gags and cartoonishly gory violence. It’s funny without being silly, although the story does skew heavily towards the white males of the ensemble. Revenge (18) (Coralie Fargeat, 2017, Fra) 108 mins Coolly stylised and relentlessly gory, this update of the notoriously dodgy “rape-revenge” genre benefits from a female perspective, even if it is more concerned with visuals than characters. Matilda Lutz plays our victim-turned-avenger, along for the ride on a desert hunting trip and left for dead by her male abusers. They’re destined to have the tables turned and the telescopic sights trained on them. Tully (15) (Jason Reitman, 2018, US) 96 mins A Mary Poppins for our times? Not exactly, but this smart, Diablo Cody-scripted tale gives us the unvarnished truth about modern motherhood, with an added dose of wish fulfilment. The latter comes in the form of Mackenzie Davis’s sunny, too-good-to-be-true young night nanny, who arrives to fix everything for Charlize Theron’s careworn mother of three when her life has become an exhausting treadmill of childcare and chores. Lean on Pete (15) (Andrew Haigh, 2017, UK) 121 mins British film-maker Haigh (45 Years, Weekend) heads to the American west for a tender but unsentimental tale of a boy and his horse that doubles as a survey of the modern landscape, its wide-open vistas and hardscrabble survivors (including Steve Buscemi and Chloë Sevigny).

Roundhouse, NW1, Thursday 22; SWX, Bristol, Friday 25; touring to 27 May Rina Sawayama Sawayama’s music is a little studied in its attempt to rouse a strand of tacky nostalgia. But with her futuristic aesthetics (tiny sunglasses) and 90s and 00s chart sound (inspired by producer She’kspere and the turbo hits of Britney and J-Lo), she makes it all feel fun. She and her crop top-wearing dancers provide the ideal antidote to the statuesque Dua Lipa approach to live pop. The Garage, N5, Friday 25 May Snail Mail The term “college rock” gets pinned on any sadsack with issues and a fuzz pedal. But for Lindsey Jordan, an 18-year-old who started writing four years ago – ie before and during college – the label is legit. Weaving melodies sulky and summery, she gets extra points for having been in a Liz Phair covers band. Manchester, Sun; Bristol, Monday 21 May Beck, Yeah Yeah Yeahs Back in 2003, Beck was basking in the afterglow of his mellow breakup masterpiece Sea Change, while the Yeah Yeah Yeahs ambushed NYC’s rock resurgence with the frenetic Fever to Tell.

Schiele died 100 years ago of the influenza that swept a war-wounded world. He left a sensational body of art that proves him one of the last century’s supreme talents. Tate Liverpool Thursday 24 May to 23 September The Roman Dead If you suspect the TV drama Britannia may be a very slightly fanciful account of Roman Britain, here is a chance to see that lost world for real, from the bones of ancient people to the jewels, glassware and games buried beside them. The remains and skeletons of 30 people are on display in this eerie encounter with the past. Museum of London Docklands, E14, Friday 25 May to 28 October Killed Negatives How is history assembled? Who chooses what is remembered, and why? This is a rare chance to see the making of modern memory in action. The 1930s pictures of rural poverty in the US that photographers including Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange took for the Farm Security Adminstration have helped to shape how the Great Depression is seen. Yet their pictures were edited by the FSA to tell a particular story. What were its criteria? Whitechapel Gallery, E1, to 26 August Teeth Artists have put sharks in art galleries. They have plunged the unwary into darkness in unsettling installations and even displayed the human dead. Yet surely nothing is as scary as the story of dentistry. This exhibition shows how people have suffered toothache and sought a cure in all places and times. Modern dentures are displayed alongside ancient amulets to ward off oral agony and drills to chill your heart. One to put you off the sweeties. Wellcome Collection, NW1, to 16 September Francesca Woodman The gothic vision of this tragically short-lived photographer suited Providence, Rhode Island, where she studied art and which is also associated with Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft. Woodman’s black-and-white pictures portray her haunted self, often glimpsed at disconcerting angles in empty, atmospheric old rooms. She uses the camera to tell stories that are not finished, yet whose ghostly vibrations linger in the imagination. Tate Liverpool, Thursday 24 May to 23 September JJ Five of the best ... theatre shows Othello Gemma Bodinetz scores full marks for boldness in this revival, which casts Golda Rosheuvel as a female, lesbian Othello, underscoring male attitudes and misogyny towards women. The production is uneven but the central conceit is neatly handled, with Rosheuvel on top form as a woman negotiating power in a man’s world. Everyman Theatre, Liverpool to 10 July Mayfly Very funny and very sad, Joe White’s debut play, set in a tiny Shropshire village, is something special: a delicate examination of grief in the wake of tragedy and a reminder of how easily life – and hope – can be snuffed out. Directed by Guy Jones, it’s unassuming and truthful, and exquisitely acted by the likes of Niky Wardley and Simon Scardifield. A real pleasure. Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, to 26 May A Streetcar Named Desire Kelly Gough, sister of Denise, is a very fine Blanche in Chelsea Walker’s intriguing revival of Tennessee Williams’s play. Gough is initially the reason to keep watching a production that can seem rather ordinary, but then Walker offers a sharp change of gear that makes you reassess what has gone before, stripping away the artifice of theatre to show that it is not just Blanche but all women who are the victims when men like Stanley Kowalski triumph. Theatr Clwyd, Mold, to 2 June The Writer It is always fascinating when a play really divides the critics, and Ella Hickson’s story about a female writer negotiating the perils and pitfalls of a theatre culture dominated by men has done just that. It’s a play of real passion that works through form as much as argument as it dissects the nature of creativity; the challenges faced by women as they make art; the male gaze; gender and power. An all-female creative team – director Blanche McIntyre and designer Anna Fleishle – ensure that this provocative evening really sings. Almeida Theatre, N1, to 26 May The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart After the mighty Black Watch, David Grieg’s play with live music, directed with real vim by Wils Wilson, must be the most successful National Theatre of Scotland production of all time. It’s a sly little charmer as it tells the story of buttoned-up academic Prudencia who discovers that the devil has all the best tunes.

He was rampant as of old, fit and fired again with ambition to crush all-comers on his favourite surface. Nadal won again in Rome on Thursday – easily – and then the communal gaze switched to Alex Zverev. On Sunday he beat Dominic Thiem, who had beaten Nadal in the Madrid quarter-finals two days earlier. Nobody could have predicted the struggle he would have in extending his run of victories to 11 as Britain’s No 1, Kyle Edmund, took him down to the wire in the third round of the Italian Open. They traded blows of breathtaking power, Edmund saving seven match points before Zverev eked out the most dramatic of wins, 7-5, 7-6 (11). He now has every chance of still being there on Sunday, probably against Nadal, to defend the title he won a year ago. If Nadal reaches the final here, Edmund will automatically be seeded in the top 16 at the French Open, which starts on Sunday week. “I’ve not been a seed in any of the grand slams but I guess it avoids playing a top guy like Rafa or Novak [Djokovic],” he said. “And it’s good to see I’m going up the rankings.” Sunday’s final in Rome could be one to savour and Nadal, if he makes it, should have more in the tank than Zverev after dismissing Denis Shapovalov, 6-4, 6-1 in an hour and 22 minutes. But they are not the only actors in this play. Fabio Fognini, finally made the quarter-finals of his home tournament after beating the unseeded German, Peter Gojowczyk, 6-4, 6-4. His prize is … Nadal in the first match on Friday. The most thrills yesterday arrived when Zverev and Edmund brought their contrasting personalities together on the tournament’s glorious second court. Broken in the opening game, Edmund was back in business after several robust exchanges half an hour later, only to drop serve a second time. Zverev, whose serve frightens ballkids and dozing spectators, was banging them down at 128mph (207kph), 13mph faster than Edmund. Zverev, the world No 3, sealed the first set with a swinging ace down the T, his second, after 42 minutes. Edmund had to save three break points in the third game of the second set, but overcooked a crosscourt forehand. Zverev, getting ahead of himself, hit rashly on key points, then somehow rescued his serve for 3-1. Edmund would not lie down and, when his cause looked lost under a fusillade of booming serves, he doggedly got back to four-all. Two double-faults in the ninth game nearly scuppered his fightback but it was Zverev’s racket that was shaking more obviously and, after losing three games in a row, he found himself serving to stay in the set, With the court at his mercy on deuce, Edmund butchered a volley, but hung on to force set point as Zverev wobbled. Edmund made three astonishing gets in a row but could not reach Zverev’s clinching winner, and they were back on level terms. It was now a test of Edmund’s nerve and his serve. Both held. They went to the tie-break, where the drama intensified. Edmund saved for 11-all and a sixth match point. Zverev pushed him across the baseline for 12-11 and match point number seven. At the end of one final high-grade exchange, Edmund pushed a weary forehand just wide, and it was done. If they meet again in the French Open it would be reasonable to expect a repeat of these heroics. Both push themselves to the limit, Edmund with inscrutable calm, Zverev eyes bulging. Their rivalry is set. When Nadal, Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray do leave the stage, they will have a pair of excellent understudies in place. Johanna Konta leaves Rome for Paris mildly encouraged but also perhaps concerned after blowing a first-set lead against a top-10 player for the fourth time in a row when tJelena Ostapenko won their engrossing third-round match. Konta, who has slipped to 22 in the world looked to have put her early-season torpor behind her as she sought to build on decent wins this week over Magdalena Rybarikova and Hsieh Su-wei. However on a mild, overcast morning and coughing from a heavy cold, she found the step up beyond her to lose 6-2, 3-6,4-6. Konta broke her fingernail (on her bag) then Ostapenko’s serve in a bizarre opening to their second Tour encounter. After a brief delay to repair the digit, she was blasting the fifth seed off the court, and looked to be within sight of an early finish as her opponent complained of dizziness. Ostapenko got her first break point at the start of the second set – and Konta survived four deuces, saving a second break point with her fourth ace in the longest struggle of the match – but the world No 6 powered on to level at a set apiece. She held to love to stay in the match but Ostapenko’s shaky serve stood up and the 20-year-old forced a final wayward forehand out of Konta after two and a quarter hours."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/may/29/brexit-vote-uk-economy-may-verdict","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T11:57:54Z","webTitle":"How has the Brexit vote affected the UK economy?

This month's verdict","bodyText":"Sterling drops to lowest level this year The big news over the past month was the Bank of England delaying raising interest rates, triggering a sharp fall in the value of sterling to the lowest levels this year. The pound has slumped by almost 6c against the dollar, as traders in the City bet against Threadneedle Street raising the cost of borrowing as much as previously thought over the course of this year. While the economy was knocked off course by snow earlier this year, the fading inflationary impact from the fall in the pound straight after the Brexit vote may also have deterred the Bank. The pound has fallen 4% over the past month. Easing trade tensions help drive shares higher The easing of tensions between China and the US over Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs, as well as the weaker pound, provided a fillip for the FTSE 100 over the course of the past month. Most of the firms in the index of top UK companies make substantial profits in dollars and export around the globe, meaning a weak pound helps boost their earnings. Meanwhile, the US said it had put “on hold” its proposed tariffs on Chinese imports, although Trump later quelled speculation a deal between Washington and Beijing had been struck. Fears over the creation of a new Italian government also threatened to unsettle markets. The FTSE 100 has risen almost 5% over the course of the past month. Better than expected Lower airfares trigger surprise fall for inflation Inflation unexpectedly fell further in April, as lower airfares provided some relief for cash-strapped Britons. The consumer price index (CPI) fell to 2.4%, according to the Office for National Statistics, against economists’ forecasts for inflation to remain unchanged from the previous month at 2.5%. Lower airfares provide the biggest downward contribution, although the ONS admitted the early timing for Easter this year could have influenced the reading. Observers said the rate would probably rise in coming months as rising global oil prices drive up the petrol costs for British motorists. Worse than expected Trade deficit unexpectedly widens Thanks to a drop in imports of ships and aircraft from non-EU countries, Britain’s trade deficit narrowed in March. The difference between what the country brings in and sells abroad in terms of goods and services fell by £700m to £6.9bn in the three months to March 2018. However, when excluding services, Britain’s trade balance grew to £12.3bn, which was worse than analysts’ forecasts for a deficit of £11.3bn. The figures are likely to disappoint Brexit supporters looking for greater support for the economy from world trade. Worse than expected Activity fails to bounce back from snow disruption The British economy showed signs of having failed to bounce back from disruption triggered by the snow earlier in the year, with key barometers of business activity in the UK showing a muted recovery. The reading on the IHS Markit/Cips all sector purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.2 in April, up from 52.5 in March when the “beast from the east” caused diggers and cranes to fall idle and shoppers to stay home. While that showed some progress, it was below the consensus estimate of 53.7 predicted by City economists on a gauge where 50 splits the difference between growth and contraction. Meets expectations Employment rate hits fresh record high Despite the slowest growth for the economy in five years, Britain’s employment rate reached a fresh record in the first three months of the year, as the UK added 197,000 more jobs to the workforce. However, there was a mixed picture for wages. Growth in total pay was up by 2.6% on a year earlier, which was slower than the 2.8% recorded in the three months to February. Excluding bonuses, earnings were up by 2.9% from the 2.8% annual increase reported the previous month. Both readings met forecasts made by City economists, while some experts said pay should gradually begin rising amid the lowest levels of unemployment since the mid 1970s. Better than expected Retail sales come in from the cold Having come under significant pressure from the cold snap earlier this year, retailers enjoyed the biggest jump in sales for 18 months during April. Shoppers hit the high street again as the sun came out, helping to drive up sales by 1.6% on the volumes seen in March, according to the latest figures from the ONS. The increase comfortably beat City forecasts for a rebound of 0.7%, stoking speculation that the economy may be stronger than at first feared. The figures will cheer retailers going through a tough patch as British consumers come under pressure from rising prices, including Marks &amp; Spencer, which announced plans to close 100 stores by 2022. Better than expected Financial year begins with good news for Hammond Philip Hammond was handed good news from the government borrowing figures in the first month of the new financial year, as the budget deficit for April came in well below forecasts, boosted by stronger tax receipts and reduced spending. The figures showed public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, was £7.8bn last month, versus an estimate of £8.6bn. The government’s annual spending shortfall for the last financial year to the end of March was also revised down by almost £2bn to £40.5bn, with the figures raising the prospect of the chancellor moving to loosen the purse strings at the budget later this year. Worse than expected House price growth continues to slow Uncertainty triggered by Brexit, coupled with tax changes and consumers coming under pressure from inflation and weak wage growth have played havoc with the housing market since the referendum. Over the past month, the closely watched Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) gauge of house prices dropped to the lowest level since 2012. The index, which measures the balance of surveyors expecting price rises fell to -8 in April from zero in March. That was worse than a Reuters poll of economists for a reading of -1. And another thing we’ve learned this month … Brexit has left UK households £900 worse off British households are more than £900 worse off since the Brexit vote, according to the governor of the Bank of England, who also warned the economy has failed to grow as much as forecast before the referendum. Speaking before MPs on the Treasury select committee, Mark Carney said the economy was as much as 2% smaller than forecast before the Brexit vote. “Over the course of the last year and a half, there has been an impact [from Brexit] relative to what we would’ve expected – even with some pretty good tailwinds at the back of this economy,” he said. His comments come after the “beast from the east”, as well as a slowdown for consumer spending triggered by Brexit, led to a sharp fall for GDP growth during the first quarter of 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/18/waiting-on-a-dream-a-right-royal-photo-essay","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T13:35:12Z","webTitle":"Waiting on a dream: a right royal photo essay","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/18/waiting-on-a-dream-a-right-royal-photo-essay","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/18/waiting-on-a-dream-a-right-royal-photo-essay","fields":{"headline":"Waiting on a dream: a right royal photo essay","bodyText":"An estimated 100,000 people are expected to descend on Windsor for the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal couple.

There had been rumours that this was because a few sexy contenders from Netflix had been scheduled close to the first weekend, which had to be pulled because of the streaming giant’s dispute with Cannes, and so some rather more sombre world-cinema offerings had to be slotted in, and the order shuffled. In the first week, however, Pawel Pawłikowski’s Cold War was a stunning period drama, set in 1950s Poland, an utterly absorbing tragedy-romance in which the director takes incidental aim at the chauvinism and racism of his homeland – very relevant in 2018. The second half then offered a couple of sensationally good films. The first was Matteo Garrone’s bizarre Dogman, a drama, based on a true story, about a small-time gangster and his cringing bully-victim, a dog-groomer. The second was Lee Chang-dong’s Burning, based on the Haruki Murakami short story, an ambiguous mystery thriller about male obsession. Connoisseur taste in Cannes is favouring the undoubtedly brilliant Burning, though I was even more impressed with Dogman. As the festival comes to a close, we have to ask whether the issue of Time’s Up has made any impact. Perhaps it is also worth remembering the residue of an earlier campaign; after #OscarsSoWhite, some were wondering whether #CannesSoWhite might have any traction. Spike Lee’s BlacKkKlansman raucously attacked the issue of racism and Trumpism. But in a larger sense, that still appears to be a campaign for another day or year. This year, before the screening of Eva Husson’s passionate, underrated film Girls of the Sun, the jury president Cate Blanchett led a spectacular #MeToo protest display of 82 women on to the red carpet – producers, stars, writers, directors – to symbolise the fact that only 82 of the competition films in the festival’s 71-year history were directed by women, as opposed to 1,645 directed by men. This year there were three women directors in competition. The ratio has remained pretty much constant. My favourite film in competition this year, which looks bound for the Palme d’Or, is Alice Rohrbacher’s sublime and mysterious magic-realist fable Happy as Lazzaro, a parable of how the rural population of Italy has been exploited and betrayed. Nothing is more tiresome than people airily dismissing positive discrimination, smirking at the very idea while assenting to the rigid gender quotas of “best actor”, “best actress” etc. In any case, Time’s Up campaigners are not asking for positive discrimination but an end to deep-seated, subconscious negative discrimination. This will take time. This year, the festival welcomed, with an out-of-competition slot, that talented but cynical serial prankster Lars von Trier, and his giggling gorefest The House That Jack Built, which trolled his critics with misogynist slayings and deadpan Nazi references. This film could have appeared in Cannes at any time in the past 20 years. There was no obvious sign of a change in the culture there, nor in David Robert Mitchell’s deeply disappointing LA mystery noir Under the Silver Lake. (Like The House That Jack Built, this was a film that slavered over the naked body of Riley Keough, an excellent performer who was badly and boringly directed in both films.) Two films about the poor and the dispossessed, AB Shawky’s Yomeddine and Nadine Labaki’s Capurnaum, though they had their qualities, were rather quaint fantasies from the bien-pensant international arthouse about how poor people behave. Christophe Honoré’s Sorry Angel was a movie with gay themes that was well liked. I found it complacent, mannered and passionless. There were tremendous films from two festival big-hitters. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters was a fascinating deconstruction of the idea of family and Jia Zhang-ke’s Ash Is Purest White was an absolutely intriguing and novelistic story of a young woman’s Dostoevskian prison sacrifice for her uncaring gangster boyfriend. And the biggest hitter of all was here, the silverback gorilla of the Cannes jungle, Jean-Luc Godard. He was back, at the age of 87, with his essay film The Image Book – a gripping piece of conceptual art with the body language of a horror movie. How extraordinary – how moving, in fact – that this key figure in the history of film-making is still with us, making movies. So here are my awards predictions. There is a convention that the jury does not “double up” with prizes: that is, give more than one prize to the same film. That rule was broken last year and I have broken it here. I have also offered imaginary prizes in categories that the Cannes jury does not address: cinematography, production design, music, best supporting male and female actor.

Joining the single currency was made easy at the end of the 1990s. As one of the original signatories of the treaty of Rome, Italy desperately wanted to be in monetary union’s first wave. But there was no real examination of whether a country like Italy – with its inflationary tendencies – could actually cope with the rigours of single-currency membership. There was no equivalent of Gordon Brown’s five tests that the then chancellor said had to be passed before Britain could join. On the contrary, when it became clear that Italy would not meet the criteria, the rules were bent to make sure it did. The result: two lost economic decades in which living standards have stagnated, which is why Italy has given up on mainstream politics. A coalition government of two populist and euro-sceptic parties – the Five Star Movement and the League – appears imminent. Although neither wing of the coalition has any love for the euro, they have already discovered the truth of Hague’s words. Their draft policy agreement included the proposal that the EU should establish a procedure for countries to leave the euro where there was “popular will” to do so, but this has now been dropped. It’s not hard to see why. Were the financial markets to think that the new populist government was serious about leaving the single currency, Italian government bonds would become riskier. Investors would demand a higher return for holding them and that would drive up market interest rates. The European Central Bank could help by buying Italian bonds, but would have little incentive to help a government in Rome intent on undermining – if not destroying – monetary union. A financial crisis would envelop the new government. Italy’s shaky banking system would collapse and the country would descend into a deep recession. Unemployment would rise and the Five Star Movement and the League would be blamed. The populists would quickly become unpopular. So the new Italian government is in the same position as all the other governments the country has had over the past two decades: membership of the single currency is a curse but trying to leave the euro would be even worse. Like Greece, Italy is discovering that it is a bit late to say that it would have been better to have constructed the euro with a few fire escapes. It is actually easier for Britain – with its own central bank and its own currency – to leave the EU than it is for Italy to leave the euro. But even if Italy shies away from monetary independence, the new government still has plans for tax and spending that pose a challenge to the way the eurozone has been run hitherto. These involve a new citizens’ income, more generous pensions and lower taxes. Estimates suggest these measures will cost around €60bn a year – some 3.5% of Italy’s GDP. This would drive a coach and horses through the eurozone’s fiscal rules, which impose strict limits on the size to which a budget deficit is allowed to run. It would also send Italy’s debt ratio – the size of the country’s public debt in relation to the size of its economy – up from just over 130% of GDP to around 150% of GDP. The prospect of a marked loosening of policy scares the financial markets and won’t go down well in other European capitals either. But actually, the coalition’s fiscal policies make sense. The real problem lies with the eurozone’s absurdly deflationary fiscal rules. As Dhaval Joshi of BCA Research has pointed out, Italy is in some respects similar to Japan. Both countries faced difficulties because their zombie banks proved incapable of lending to the private sector. Japan solved this problem by getting the public sector to do the lending, even though this meant a big increase in its debt ratio. Italy is in a worse position because the eurozone’s fiscal rules mean it has not been allowed to run bigger budget deficits. Italy has lower total indebtedness – private and public combined – than Britain, France and Spain, but as far as the EU’s fiscal rules are concerned only public debt matters. Joshi notes: “Hence, the Italian government was prevented from recapitalising its banking system, and the Italian economy stagnated for a decade.” Those in charge of the single currency know that as it stands the euro is an unfinished project. It could be completed by the reform package proposed by the French president Emmanuel Macron, which would involve fiscal union as well as monetary union, presided over by a eurozone finance minister. There is not the remotest possibility that Macron could get the new government in Rome to sign up to his plan even if he could secure the full-throated backing of Germany. One alternative to Macron’s scheme is to allow members of the eurozone more freedom to run fiscal policies that meet their own needs, which is what Italy’s populist coalition is demanding. At present, the rules mean that any struggling country can only make itself more competitive through internal deflation – cost cutting and austerity. The other is to allow things to drift on as they are and hope for the best. This has seen the euro through one crisis – just – but would not see it through another. The risk is not that one country will jump out of the burning building but that the building will eventually collapse with everybody in it."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/19/vinnies-blasts-cruel-cut-in-benefits-to-asylum-seekers-on-medical-treatment","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T23:59:38Z","webTitle":"Vinnies blasts 'cruel' cut in benefits to asylum seekers on medical treatment","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/19/vinnies-blasts-cruel-cut-in-benefits-to-asylum-seekers-on-medical-treatment","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/19/vinnies-blasts-cruel-cut-in-benefits-to-asylum-seekers-on-medical-treatment","fields":{"headline":"Vinnies blasts 'cruel' cut in benefits to asylum seekers on medical treatment","bodyText":"The federal government’s decision to strip income support and housing from asylum seekers transferred to Australia for medical treatment “beggars belief as an unprincipled act of cruelty”, the head of one of Australia’s largest charities has said. The comments from the chief executive of the St Vincent de Paul Society, Dr John Falzon, came in response to the Department of Home Affairs targeting a cohort of up to 100 people on Thursday, transferring them to six-month bridging visas, which come with work rights, and withdrawing housing assistance and income support of about $200 a fortnight. A group of single adults who were moved on to bridging E visas (BVEs) last year had their visas rolled over for another six months. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Most of those targeted this week were families with young children, who were given six weeks to find new accommodation and a source of income. Others were given three weeks to find accommodation but lost income support immediately. Legal groups said those affected were very worried. “Obviously this is going to hurt individuals very profoundly,” Falzon said. “Already the payment level was clearly inadequate when you consider it’s less than the inadequate Newstart level, so people were struggling, facing a daily battle for survival from below the poverty line. “To pick on this group of people and use discretionary powers by the minister to take away the little that they were entitled to just absolutely beggars belief as an unprincipled act of cruelty towards people who already bear an enormous burden of inequality.” The Department of Home Affairs confirmed it was ending financial assistance to “transitory persons” who had not returned to Nauru or Papua New Guinea after coming to Australia for medical treatment. “With the exception of the most vulnerable or those who represent a security concern, transitory persons will be granted a final departure bridging E visa which requires that they must support themselves until they depart Australia,” a spokesman said. “Individuals are expected to have departed by the time their final departure BVE expires, which is six months from its grant date.” The spokesman said accommodation and living expenses for the affected people had been $120,000 each every year. In recent years, the cost of holding someone in offshore detention has been estimated at more than $500,000 a year. Falzon said the department’s move was part of a pattern by the government to outsource its responsibility for vulnerable people to charities and community groups, which would now have to step in and support those who struggled to find housing or work - whether because of illness, language skills, age, or the fact they had only a six-month visa. “On a policy level, it’s profoundly disturbing,” he said. “This is a whittling away of the universality of our safety net using quite overtly discriminatory criteria for denying people access to the social security system that we should not be conceptualising as a privilege for some, but as a right for all.” A spokeswoman for the UN high commission for refugees in Australia said the government’s move would leave refugees and asylum seekers “at serious risk of destitution”. “Any removal of such basic and fundamental support could wrongly coerce the most vulnerable to return to Papua New Guinea, Nauru, or their countries of origin.” The Labor spokesman for immigration, Shayne Neumann, said the move would not fix anything and “could lead to increased crime and poverty”. “Purposefully making these people destitute and homeless can only exacerbate the health conditions for which they were originally transferred to Australia,” he told Guardian Australia. Neumann said the situation could be avoided if the home affairs minister would allow people to apply for US resettlement from here, instead of making them return to Nauru and Manus Island – a rule that has kept some of them in a legal limbo. “Peter Dutton is the only thing standing in the way of legitimate refugees making applications to resettle in the US.” he said. The Greens spokesman for immigration, Nick McKim, said the move was “deeply unfair” and could force people into poverty, homelessness, and exploitative work. “Unfortunately, it is a continuation of Peter Dutton’s determination to punish migrants, particularly refugees and people seeking asylum,” he said. “To retrospectively punish people in this way is unconscionably cruel.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2018/may/19/boris-johnson-to-lay-falklands-wreath-in-argentina-latin-america-trip","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T23:01:11Z","webTitle":"Boris Johnson to lay Falklands wreath in Argentina","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/19/boris-johnson-to-lay-falklands-wreath-in-argentina-latin-america-trip","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2018/may/19/boris-johnson-to-lay-falklands-wreath-in-argentina-latin-america-trip","fields":{"headline":"Boris Johnson to lay Falklands wreath in Argentina","bodyText":"Boris Johnson will lay a wreath to commemorate the Falklands conflict in Argentina this weekend as part of a five-day visit to Latin America. The foreign secretary will also travel to Peru and Chile during the trip, which is aimed at showcasing Britain’s internationalist credentials after Brexit. Relations with Buenos Aires over the Falklands, which Argentina calls the Malvinas, and to which it still lays a territorial claim, have thawed under the regime of Mauricio Macri, whom Johnson will meet. The first talks about fishing rights since the 1982 Falklands conflict recently took place, and Britain has been helping relatives of some of the more than 600 Argentine casualties to identify remains on the islands. Speaking ahead of the visit, Johnson said: “This will be my first visit to the region since becoming foreign secretary. Latin America is a vibrant and dynamic part of the world that works closely with the UK on a number of issues including trade, security, science, infrastructure and education. “I am looking forward to strengthening the UK’s relationship with countries in the region.” After a week in which he was forced to make concessions in the cabinet battle over the Northern Irish border, Johnson also hopes to get back on the front foot by highlighting the trading potential for British companies in Latin America. Just 1% of imports to the region currently come from the UK, and Johnson shares the belief of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, that distance is less of a drag on international trade when much of it is in services, such as consultancy and finance. However, Argentina has been rocked by a sell-off in the currency and debt markets in recent weeks, and earlier this month was forced to open negotiations with the International Monetary Fund about a potential emergency credit line. Buenos Aires is also unable to strike independent bilateral trade deals, as it is part of Mercosur, a trading bloc that also includes fellow agriculture giant Brazil. Mercosur has been trying to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the European Union for 20 years: the EU hopes to sell more cars into the region, while Mercosur’s farmers are pushing for lower tariffs on their beef. Johnson will also attend the G20 foreign ministers’ summit in Buenos Aires. The trip comes after a bruising week in which Johnson lost the argument over how far Britain should be prepared to go to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"news/2018/may/19/this-weeks-corrections-most-reverend-michael-curry-royal-wedding","type":"article","sectionId":"news","sectionName":"News","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T23:04:40Z","webTitle":"For the record","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/19/this-weeks-corrections-most-reverend-michael-curry-royal-wedding","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2018/may/19/this-weeks-corrections-most-reverend-michael-curry-royal-wedding","fields":{"headline":"For the record","bodyText":"The Most Reverend Michael Curry is not the first African American bishop in the Episcopal church in America.

But while there is a genuine sense of a fresh start being made, the shows raise serious questions about the idea of approaching Shakespeare without a governing directorial concept. I have grown impatient with ego-driven directors. At the same time, I believe that, at their best, directors can shed new light on familiar texts, recent examples being Nicholas Hytner’s Julius Caesar and Blanche McIntyre’s Titus Andronicus. Here two directors are credited, Federay Holmes and Elle While, but they are clearly not the determining factor. The result is that big issues are not always addressed. In the case of Hamlet, there is no sense of Elsinore as a place of eavesdropping corruption, no hint of reckless sensuality in the relationship of Claudius and Gertrude, no awareness that Polonius is a wily politician rather than a prattling buffoon. If I sometimes pined for a more questing exploration of the meaning of these plays to us today, I was relaxed about the impact of gender-fluid casting. Surprisingly, perhaps, it works better in the tragedy than the comedy. We are used to female Hamlets and, in this production, Shubham Saraf also invests Ophelia with a dangerous anger and Bettrys Jones is a brisk and intemperate Laertes. In As You Like It, I was less persuaded by Jones as an Orlando overthrowing the court wrestler and found the role-switching confusing, with Catrin Aaron doubling as Corin and Phoebe. What does work in the comedy is the casting of a deaf actor, the vivacious Nadia Nadarajah, as Celia and the use of sign language as a means of communication between her and her fellow actors. But, however much we sing the virtues of ensemble, there is no denying that many of Shakespeare’s plays have a pyramidal structure and Hamlet is one of them. Terry is the fourth female Hamlet I have seen and she brings to the role all the qualities one might expect. She speaks the verse intelligently, initially conveys a sense of bereft solitude – her voice cracks on the implication that she “seems” to be affecting grief – and is very good at suggesting bottled rage. The most controversial touch is her later appearance in a clown costume: a slightly too obvious way of signalling Hamlet’s assumed madness and, with its stiff-sided pants, disconcertingly reminiscent of Eric Morecambe doing a funny turn as a period aviator. But I was glad to have seen Terry’s Hamlet even if the production rarely shocks one into a new awareness. Much the same might be said of As You Like It. For all the ensemble unity, I shall remember it chiefly for Laskey’s overpowering Rosalind. Following in the footsteps of Adrian Lester and Ronald Pickup, he shows that a man is perfectly capable of capturing Rosalind’s quicksilver temperament. He explodes with anger at Orlando’s tardiness and hurls himself seductively on the ground to simulate a “coming-on disposition”. Tall, rangy and mercurial, Laskey reminds us that this is a play about the madness of love. He suggests that he could one day be a fine Hamlet. Pearce Quigley is an amusingly laid-back Jaques, Tanika Yearwood sings melodiously as Amiens and Helen Schlesinger switches in a second from a gruffly tyrannical duke to his benign, banished brother. Despite that, I never got a strong sense of the play’s shift from court to country or of its transition from winter to spring. It remains, like the Hamlet, a perfectly decent production and a welcome relief from the work of the previous Globe regime, which seemed to assume that the plays were a bit boring unless jazzed up. The Globe ensemble is a worthwhile experiment but I’m not convinced it provides a pattern for the future. The brute fact is that Shakespeare’s plays benefit from star performers and the inspirational vision of a first-rate director. At Shakespeare’s Globe, London, until 26 August.

Under proposals being floated by French diplomats, the powers of the world’s chemical weapons watchdog could be expanded to include attributing responsibility for the use of chemical weapons, rather than merely investigating whether they have been used. The previous UN-recognised system collapsed amid disagreements with Russia, with the west accusing Moscow of killing off the investigatory body in an attempt to cover up repeated war crimes by the regime of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. The proposal to extend the powers of the Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is due to be discussed on the margins of the Paris conference, which is being attended both by the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, and the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The OPCW oversees the chemical weapons convention that came into force in 1997. An impasse developed at the UN last year between Russia and the west over chemical weapons, with Moscow repeatedly vetoing the renewal of a mandate for the UN body charged with attributing responsibility for their use. As a result, since last November no internationally recognised body has existed empowered to identify a group or country that has used chemical weapons. The previous body, known at the UN as the joint investigative mechanism (JIM), was condemned by Russia as loaded in favour of the west after it found that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhun in April 2017. Western powers in turn accused Russia of shamelessly undermining the JIM in an attempt to cover up the war crimes being committed by the Assad regime. The use of chemical weapons has become a hallmark of the brutal Syrian civil war. Russia said it would only allow the renewal of the UN body’s mandate if its findings could be put before the UN security council for endorsement, a proposal that would have handed Russia a veto as a permanent member of the council. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has been working behind the scenes to break the deadlock, saying the lack of an accountability mechanism risks wars “spiralling out of control”. In an attempt to show that France would not tolerate impunity for those that used chemical weapons, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, convened a conference in January to underline its determination to pursue anyone guilty of breaking the convention. The gathering in Paris on Friday will bring together countries that have agreed to exchange information about individuals and entities involved in the use of chemical weapons. Before the conference, France froze the assets of seven entities based in Syria, Lebanon and China for their alleged involvement in the Syrian chemical weapons programme. France had already frozen in January the assets of 25 entities and leaders of Syrian companies but also those of French, Lebanese or Chinese entities suspected of fuelling the programme. The companies targeted included importers and distributors of metals, electronics and lighting systems. The OPCW has yet to determine whether a chemical attack occurred in Douma, near Damascus, on 7 April. The attack killed approximately 40 people and led to cruise missile strikes by the US, France and Britain against Syrian regime installations."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/18/chinese-doctor-jailed-for-calling-traditional-medicine-poison-issues-apology","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T06:25:02Z","webTitle":"Chinese doctor jailed for calling traditional medicine 'poison' issues apology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/18/chinese-doctor-jailed-for-calling-traditional-medicine-poison-issues-apology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/18/chinese-doctor-jailed-for-calling-traditional-medicine-poison-issues-apology","fields":{"headline":"Chinese doctor jailed for calling traditional medicine 'poison' issues apology","bodyText":"A Chinese physician who spent almost 100 days in jail for criticising Chinese traditional medicine has issued an apology for “not thinking clearly”. Tan Qindong, an anaesthesiologist in Guangzhou, emerged as a public hero earlier this year for going up against a traditional Chinese medicine company over its marketing of a tonic to Chinese retirees. He was detained for three months before being released on bail in April, in a case that sparked outcry among Chinese doctors and the general public. Hongmao Pharmaceutical, the maker of the tonic, said in a statement on Thursday it is dropping its lawsuit against Tan. The doctor published an apology earlier on Thursday for “not thinking clearly” about the words he used in a December essay describing Hongmao’s tonic as “poison”. “After research, our company decided to accept Tan’s apology. At the same time, our company withdraw the case from Liangcheng’s public security bureau, and withdraw the suit from People’s court in Liangcheng county,” Hongmao said, referring to the county in Inner Mongolia where the company is based. In Tan’s December essay, which circulated widely on the social media platform WeChat, Tan cautioned that the curative abilities of Hongmao’s tonic’s were unclear at best and could actually harm those with diabetes or high blood pressure. Hongmao’s “medicinal liquor” contains more than 60 kinds of herbs and animal products. It is advertised as a cure for everything from rheumatism to kidney dysfunction, joint pain, and Alzheimer’s disease. China’s traditional Chinese medicine industry is growing, with support from the central government, even as it has come under scrutiny from researchers. Tan’s case is also a rare win for public opinion and criticism of close links between local police and businesses. Tan was detained at home and taken more than 1700 miles to Inner Mongolia. He was charged for violating a little-used part of China’s criminal code that bars the fabrication or spread of claims that seriously damage a company’s reputation. But a Chinese court ordered his release. After his release Tan told Caixin, a Chinese financial news publication, he did not regret writing the article or going to prison, “It taught me how to interact with all sorts of people, and also taught me how precious freedom is. I’ve learned to cherish the present ... I suppose this was just one of life’s trials.” Still, Tan appears to have suffered from the experience. Last week, his mother posted on the microblog Weibo that Tan was suffering from PTSD and had been hospitalised."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"community/2018/may/20/million-paws-walk-share-your-photos-and-videos","type":"article","sectionId":"community","sectionName":"Community","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T02:12:45Z","webTitle":"Million Paws Walk 2018: share your photos and videos","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/community/2018/may/20/million-paws-walk-share-your-photos-and-videos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/community/2018/may/20/million-paws-walk-share-your-photos-and-videos","fields":{"headline":"Million Paws Walk 2018: share your photos and videos","bodyText":"Now in its 24th year, the annual Million Paws Walk is the RSPCA’s largest fundraiser and helps the animal welfare charity rescue thousands of animals a year.

Over more than five years, Ecuador put at least $5m (£3.7m) into a secret intelligence budget that protected him while he had visits from Nigel Farage, members of European nationalist groups and individuals linked to the Kremlin. Rafael Correa, the then Ecuadorian president who approved of the operation, later defended the security measures as “routine and modest”. However, his successor, Moreno, appears to differ in his view. His government said in a statement: “The president of the republic, Lenin Moreno, has ordered that any additional security at the Ecuadorian embassy in London be withdrawn immediately. “From now on, it will maintain normal security similar to that of other Ecuadorian embassies.” Moreno has previously described Assange’s situation as “a stone in his shoe”. Ecuador suspended Assange’s communication systems in March after his pointed political comments on Twitter. Assange had tweeted messages challenging Britain’s accusation that Russia was responsible for the poisoning of a Russian former double agent and his daughter in Salisbury.

The article implies the patients were forcibly returned to Nauru and this was opposed by Taiwanese medical personnel. In consideration of Taiwan’s high-quality medical facilities and longstanding medical cooperation with Nauru, Australia and Taiwan signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2017, in which refugees and asylum seekers staying in Nauru who require urgent medical treatment can be transferred to Taiwan, with valid medical visas and confirmation from medical personnel for the requirement of such treatment. The arrangement is temporary, and the two refugee patients were fully informed of this prior to their arrival in Taiwan and agreed to leave the country once they completed their treatment. According to Taiwan Adventist Hospital, which oversaw their medical treatment, the patients had completed their treatment prior to leaving Taiwan, thereby honouring the terms of the MOU. The implication that the patients were forcibly returned to Nauru by Australian officials or that their transfer was opposed by Taiwanese medical personnel is therefore incorrect. As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan remains committed to cooperating with like-minded countries to provide high-quality medical support and humanitarian assistance. Taiwan also firmly believes that health transcends national borders. This case illustrates that Taiwan fulfils these commitments.

The Department of Health and Human Services will announce the proposal on Friday, an administration official confirmed to the Guardian. The move would revive a policy first implemented by Ronald Reagan in 1988, which effectively barred reproductive health organizations that received federal grants from providing or even discussing abortion with patients. The policy has been derided as a “gag rule” by abortion rights supporters and medical groups, and it is likely to trigger lawsuits that could keep it from taking effect. “This is an attempt to take away women’s basic rights, period,” Dawn Laguens, the executive vice-president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. She added: “Everyone has the right to access information about their health care – including information about safe, legal abortion – and every woman deserves the best medical care and information, no matter how much money she makes or where she lives. No matter what. They won’t get it under this rule.” The Reagan-era rule never went into effect as written, although the US supreme court ruled that it was an appropriate use of executive power. The policy was rescinded under Bill Clinton, and a new rule went into effect that required “nondirective” counseling to include a range of options for women. Federal funds are already barred from being used for abortion services under current US law. The move will galvanize activists on both sides of the abortion debate ahead of the congressional midterm elections. Doctors’ groups and abortion rights supporters say a ban on counseling women trespasses on the doctor-patient relationship. They also believe such rules would prevent patients from being able to obtain birth control or other preventive care from reproductive health care providers, and undermine access to safe, legal abortion, particularly among low-income women. Abortion opponents have long argued that a taxpayer-funded family planning program should have no connection whatsoever to abortion. “The notion that you would withhold information from a patient does not uphold or preserve their dignity,” said Jessica Marcella of the National Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health Association, which represents family planning clinics. “I cannot imagine a scenario in which public health groups would allow this effort to go unchallenged.” She said requiring family planning clinics to be physically separate from facilities in which abortion is provided would disrupt services for women across the country. Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life of America also backed the move. She said: “Abortion is not healthcare or birth control and many women want natural healthcare choices, rather than hormone-induced changes.” Abortion opponents claim the federal family planning program in effect cross-subsidizes abortion services provided by Planned Parenthood, whose clinics are also major recipients of grants for family planning and basic preventive care. Hawkins’s group is circulating a petition to urge lawmakers in Congress to support the Trump administration’s proposal. Known as title X, the nation’s family-planning program serves about 4 million women a year through clinics, at a cost to taxpayers of about $260m. Planned Parenthood clinics also qualify for Title X grants, but they must keep the family-planning money separate from funds used to pay for abortions. The Republican-led Congress has unsuccessfully tried to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood, and the Trump administration has vowed to religious and social conservatives that it would keep up the effort. In one of his first acts as president, Trump reinstated a “global gag rule” policy that restricted the US government from providing funds to international family-planning organizations offering abortion-related services or information about the procedure. Global health advocates have since bemoaned the closure of abortion facilities overseas, with developing areas the most acutely impacted. Trump later expanded upon the action, affecting nearly $9bn in funding to combat global health issues such as HIV/Aids, Zika and malaria.

High-profile brawls at Goodwood and Ascot over the last two weekends, footage of which has been widely shared on social media, will ensure that Saturday’s Lockinge Stakes meeting will be closely scrutinised for any hint of trouble. Serious disturbances at racecourses on consecutive Saturdays can be seen as a wake-up call for the sport. Three in a row could suggest that the situation is already getting out of control. Many of Britain’s biggest tracks, on the Flat in particular, have concentrated their marketing efforts on Saturday cards in recent years as they look to bring a fresh audience to the sport. Two of the summer’s biggest festival meetings, at York and Newmarket, have shifted from a Friday finish to conclude on Saturday – controversially so in the case of Newmarket’s July meeting, as its new slot was already occupied by big days at York, Chester and Ascot. It has worked, with tracks seeing big surges in attendance, from organised coach parties in particular. But in a country with a deep-seated drinking culture, there are many who intend, and expect, to drink all day, and some racecourses at least have been accused of chasing the profit from alcohol sales too aggressively and turning a blind eye to the possible consequences. Newbury is, in a sense, paying the price for events at tracks beyond their control, involving spectators who have probably never been to Newbury and never will. Yet a brief clip of brawling at Ascot last weekend was streamed more than a million times on Twitter. It falls to Newbury to convince all those who watched it that violence – drunken, drug-fuelled or both – is not a standard part of the Saturday racing experience. The track has had a heightened awareness of the potential for trouble in a big racecourse crowd since July 2012, when a pre-planned brawl between rival football fans from Swansea and Cardiff erupted on a lawn near the main grandstand. About 50 men were involved in the fighting and four were subsequently convicted of affray. “Newbury has done a lot over the last few years since that trouble in terms of implementing measures to try to prevent any forms of antisocial behaviour,” Harriet Collins, Newbury’s head of communications, said this week. “It is preventative measures which are really important. Things like bar-spotters are really helping and have been in place for a couple of years. They are experienced and they cover all the bars, looking for the early signs of antisocial behaviour. “They speak to the bar staff to see if there is anyone they are uncomfortable about, they assess those situations and if they are concerned then they will contact security. We are also being very diligent in terms of assessing possible weak spots around the course, where we perhaps need more hi-vis security.” The possibility that the use of illegal drugs, and cocaine in particular, might be fuelling recent outbreaks of violence at racecourses is also being addressed. In the aftermath of the disturbances over the last two weekends, anecdotal evidence on social media and internet forums has suggested that cocaine use is increasing at some tracks, with long queues for the mens’ toilets highlighted as evidence of the problem. “We always assess the challenges of each raceday on a case-by-case basis,” Julian Thick, Newbury’s chief executive, said this week, “and give thorough consideration to any additional factors in the build-up to each raceday. As is the case across all our major fixtures, we will have sniffer dogs, drug amnesty bins and bag searches in operation across all our entrances on Saturday and an increased number of security staff wearing high-visibility clothing throughout the site.” Collins confirmed that Newbury operates a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal drugs. “We won’t accept it,” she said. “If there are signs of it, people will be asked to leave and escorted out if necessary. That’s why we have the sniffer dogs and amnesty bins and if that also means having security going in [to the toilets] then that’s what we will do.” Racing is Britain’s second-biggest spectator sport with almost 6m paying fans annually, and effectively the biggest from the middle of May until the start of the new football season. Every Saturday from now until the beginning of August will stage at least one, and possibly two or three, meetings with a five-figure crowd, and John Smith’s Day at York in mid-July will be one of the biggest. In the past, it has been an afternoon with a reputation for heavy drinking in a crowd that can reach 40,000, more than double the number that attended any of the three days of the course’s Dante meeting this week. John Smith’s will sponsor the card for the 59th time this year – it is the longest continuous sponsorship in the sport – and in the days when the brewer had an extensive network of “tied” pubs across the north, many would organise a coach party to York for an annual day out. The feature race is a handicap, making it a day for punters as much as purists, and coach parties still account for a substantial proportion of the crowd on what is usually York’s biggest day of the year in terms of attendance. Managing such a big crowd is always a challenge, but as William Derby, York’s chief executive, pointed out this week: “Last year on John Smith’s Day, we had 38,000 people here and not a single arrest.” The course’s procedures on big summer Saturdays have developed over time, and Derby insists that York remains “vigilant and never complacent”, having also introduced police sniffer dogs to the security setup in recent years. “We employ drugs dogs as a deterrent,” Derby said, “and we’ve used social media extensively in recent years to make it very obvious that if you come to York with drugs, we will have dogs to greet you at the entrance. “We are aware of the issue with toilets so we send police into the toilets, and as with the alcohol side, it’s not something that we’ve woken up to two weeks ago. It’s been an ongoing, detailed programme in conjunction with North Yorkshire police so every dog will have two officers with it. The main thing is that it’s a deterrent, but it sets a standard and people will be caught.” Drunkenness and antisocial behaviour at racecourses is hardly a new phenomenon. When Sandown Park, near Esher in Surrey, opened in 1875, it was the first track in Britain to charge a fee for admission. It did so as a reaction to events like the annual free-for-all at Epsom on Derby day, where contemporary reports and paintings such as Frith’s Derby Day from the mid-1850s depict wholesale debauchery at an event that drew hundreds of thousands to the Surrey Downs. Derby Day on 2 June will again draw a huge crowd to Epsom in a fortnight’s time, but this weekend the focus will be squarely on Newbury as racing hopes to show that the scenes at Goodwood and Ascot were an aberration and not a trend. “You’ve got to be diligent and careful, but you’ve got to be positive about it as well,” Collins said. “We assess the potential issues at every raceday well in advance, and we decided many weeks ago, for instance, that we would not be showing the FA Cup final [which starts 10 minutes before Newbury’s last race] on Saturday. “We want everyone to come and have a really enjoyable day and so we’re doing all we can. We’re looking forward to it. It’s going to be a really good day.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"books/2018/may/27/never-anyone-but-you-rupert-thomson-review","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:00:18Z","webTitle":"Never Anyone But You by Rupert Thomson review – arrestingly accomplished","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/27/never-anyone-but-you-rupert-thomson-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/27/never-anyone-but-you-rupert-thomson-review","fields":{"headline":"Never Anyone But You by Rupert Thomson review – arrestingly accomplished","bodyText":"“Madness looks at me with fixed eyes,” whispers a character in Rupert Thomson’s arrestingly accomplished 10th novel. Dangerous psychic territory is Thomson’s speciality. Writing with an eerie command of precise detail, he slips beneath the skin of characters who experience a crisis and learn, painfully, how to come to terms with catastrophe. In The Book of Revelation, a young man is captured and tortured by three women whose identities remain concealed. In Death of a Murderer, a troubled father is called upon to help oversee the funeral arrangements for a notorious child killer (Moors murderer Myra Hindley). Staccato sentences and sharp, unexpected images add to the uneasy sense of being drawn into a danger-filled dreamworld from which there’s no way out. Based on actual historical characters, Never Anyone But You is narrated by the voice of Marcel Moore. Born Suzanne, Moore changes her name to Marcel to honour Marcel Schwob (the avant garde writer), a favourite uncle of Moore’s female lover. Young Lucie Schwob, febrile, death-obsessed and poignantly exposed to her own mother’s insanity, simultaneously transforms herself into the androgynous Claude Cahun. The girls’ passionate love affair goes undetected in provincial Nantes because of their relationship as stepsisters. When the two young women move to Paris in the 1920s, Cahun emerges as an artistic pioneer, one who helped blaze the trail that would later lead to the conceptual work of artists such as Cindy Sherman. Cahun’s gender-challenging self-portraits – as a dandy, a vamp, a bodybuilder or a pierrot doll – win her a place of prestige in Paris alongside André Breton and Salvador Dali. Only in the tricky task of reanimating this celebrated cafe-based art world does Thomson occasionally falter. (A casual information-delivering aside about Alice Prin: “They call her Kiki of Montparnasse.” A hasty nod towards Gurdjieff: “That Armenian mystic?”.) It can feel at moments rather like entering a scene being filmed in an old bar for Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris, another artful homage to that culture-crowded era. In 1937, the two women retreat to the privacy of a new home in secluded Jersey. Briefly, they find bliss: “an Eden with two Eves, no Adam”. Back in prewar Paris, Cahun had become a follower of the anti-patriotic, non-militaristic beliefs of André Breton. Thomson’s novel – in its second, far more powerful half – confronts that idealism with the Nazi occupation of the Channel Islands. Shocked by the introduction of slave labour from eastern Europe to fortify Jersey (Hitler became convinced that the island was key to an invasion of England), Cahun and Moore begin a heroically naive propaganda crusade. Their targets are the hearts and minds of the occupying enemy; their aim is to undermine what they staunchly believe to be “a questionable fidelity” to Hitler of the average German soldier. “We liked to think that beneath every Nazi there was an ordinary decent human being... if we could present him with arguments that were sufficiently convincing, we might be able to change his mind.” Sticking closely to historical fact, Thomson leaves Moore to describe the quixotic risks taken by herself and Cahun to sneak subversive messages (“Hitler doesn’t care if you live or die”) into open cigarette packets and even into the uniform pockets of German officers. Informed on by an anonymous islander, the dissident pair are arrested, imprisoned and eventually condemned to die. No spoilers here – Thomson has always been masterly at communicating suspense – except to say that the madness that Cahun had always feared was in her heritage produces one of the novel’s most terrifying and eerily convincing episodes. Thomson is at his brilliant best when communicating the psychological damage inflicted upon the lovers during a long and cruel captivity. (Both women, while being held in isolation in separate cells, attempt to take their own lives.) But the greatest strength of this taut and absorbing novel lies in Thomson’s exquisitely tender portrait of Moore’s enduring passion for Cahun. “I am the rock,” Moore declares as – again and yet again – she struggles to protect the elusive and emotionally fragile younger woman from a self-destructive and invincible obsession with death. Peaceful only in her final annihilation, the dying Cahun murmurs a line from a song by their old friend in Paris, Robert Desnos: “You may cut the rope of this anchored ship.” Thomson leaves it to Moore to acknowledge that these words express the frightening sense of impermanence that has always threatened the couple’s 40-year love affair, a journey made dreadful by war and feverish by jealousy: “Her desire to be with me could never outweigh her desperation to be gone.” As with all of Thomson’s elegant and troubling novels, Never Anyone But You exerts a menacing – but never histrionic – power. Like the revenant ghost that Cahun eventually becomes to Moore, this quietly passionate coupling of Eros and history lingers on to haunt the darkest recesses of the reader’s mind.

Somerset county council has been told that large overspends on children’s social services, coupled with reduced government funding and the erosion of its reserves, have left its finances “in a very challenging position”. A formal peer review says any failure to meet its ambitious financial savings targets for the current year would leave the council at risk of being unable to set a balanced budget within months – in effect leaving it at risk of insolvency. The county, which has already announced unpopular plans to close two-thirds of its Sure Start children’s centres, more than half of its libraries and make big reductions to its learning disability services, must now find further cuts. There has been heightened concern over the sustainability of local authority finances since Northamptonshire county council declared effective bankruptcy in February. It was subsequently taken over by government commissioners. A spokesperson for Somerset county council said: “There are clearly pressures on our budgets, as there is on local authority budgets up and down the country as government funding falls and demand grows. “The recent peer review report found many positives and areas of success. It also concluded that we understand the financial challenges we face and that we can meet them. “We believe the system by which local government is funded is broken and call on the government to address this as a priority as part of its fair funding review [of local government finance].” Somerset says it is confident that it will not follow Northamptonshire into insolvency. Despite serious challenges – including a target of £17m in cuts for children’s social care this year – it says it is committed to meeting savings targets. But the review makes it clear that the county has struggled to deliver planned savings for two years, and has been reliant on reserves to patch up its budgets. “For the last two years only 65% of agreed savings have been delivered and whilst there may be specific reasons for this, this level of delivery is simply unsustainable in the future.” Somerset, which has an annual budget of around £316m, has made around £130m of savings since 2010. It believes the forthcoming green paper into social care funding and the fair funding review hold the key to its survival. The National Audit Office warned this year that several councils were using up “rainy day” reserves to prop up services. It estimated up to 15 councils are at risk of going bust when their reserves are exhausted. Jane Lock, the leader of Somerset’s opposition Liberal Democrat group, blamed the council’s predicament on its decision to freeze council tax for six years after 2010, despite swingeing national cuts in funding, and at a time when austerity measures were increasing demand on services. She said: “The reason Somerset has got to here is quite simply the political ideology that they would refuse to put up council tax. That’s left a £26m hole in the budget.” Simon Edwards, the director of the County Councils Network, said: “County authorities face a toxic cocktail of having rising demand for services, being the lowest funded upper-tier councils, and the impact of having the sharpest reductions in government funding by the end of the decade.” He added: “With demand continuing to rise amid funding reductions, the reality is that councils of all sizes and colours will face similar situations in the future, unless a sustainable solution is found by government.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/18/publish-all-vote-leaves-data-campaign-chief-challenges-facebook-dominic-cummings","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T14:00:25Z","webTitle":"Publish all Vote Leave's data, campaign chief challenges Facebook","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/publish-all-vote-leaves-data-campaign-chief-challenges-facebook-dominic-cummings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/publish-all-vote-leaves-data-campaign-chief-challenges-facebook-dominic-cummings","fields":{"headline":"Publish all Vote Leave's data, campaign chief challenges Facebook","bodyText":"The chief strategist of Vote Leave has called on Facebook to publish all the data it holds on his Brexit campaign group, challenging the social network to adopt a policy of radical transparency on the impact of targeted online adverts during the EU referendum. Dominic Cummings said he “wouldn’t mind if Facebook wanted to take ALL of Vote Leave’s Facebook data” and put “the whole lot on its website available for download by anybody”. He used a lengthy blogpost to explain that while such information is “normally considered very sensitive and never published by campaigns”, he now supported the publication of all the confidential data Facebook holds on Vote Leave. Facebook has until now released only parts of the data on the online advertising tactics used by Brexit referendum campaign groups, often in response to specific questions from MPs on the parliamentary select committee investigating fake news. Cummings said he believed publishing the data would invite “serious academic scrutiny” of Vote Leave’s tactics and prove his campaign did not use data gathered improperly by the collapsed internet campaigns group Cambridge Analytica. “We never saw/used/wanted the data improperly acquired by CA,” he said. “We did practically no ‘microtargeting’ in the normal sense of the term and zero using so-called ‘psychographics’.” The Conservative MP Damian Collins, the chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, agreed with Cummings’s call for Facebook to release the data in its entirety. However, he said it should be provided to MPs: “Transparency is essential if the public is to regain trust in political advertising on social media platforms. I would encourage Facebook to hand over any data it has on political advertising during the EU referendum to the committee.” Cummings also called for the Electoral Commission to establish a public register of all online adverts, updated daily during elections, which would show exactly what all registered groups and political parties were doing online. “This would add only a tiny admin burden to a campaign but it would ensure that there is a full and accurate public record of digital campaigning,” he said. Cummings, a former adviser to Michael Gove, will be played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a forthcoming TV series about Brexit. He rejected a formal summons from Collins’s select committee to give evidence in front of MPs on his campaign’s online activities. Cummings said he had no time for parliament’s demands and would not be publicly shamed by parliament into answering questions against his will: “If you think I care about ‘reputational damage’, you are badly advised.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/18/boy-arrested-over-fatal-stabbing-of-16-year-old-in-sutton-coldfield","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T10:45:23Z","webTitle":"Boy arrested over fatal stabbing of 16-year-old in Sutton Coldfield","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/boy-arrested-over-fatal-stabbing-of-16-year-old-in-sutton-coldfield","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/boy-arrested-over-fatal-stabbing-of-16-year-old-in-sutton-coldfield","fields":{"headline":"Boy arrested over fatal stabbing of 16-year-old in Sutton Coldfield","bodyText":"A teenager has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of a 16-year-old boy who was found stabbed in a town centre in the West Midlands.

That same afternoon, Wylie decided to send a PE class she was supervising outside to see if they could run around the playing field. “By the end, most of them were doubled up and had a stitch,” she says. “It was a shocking sight.” Afterwards, Wylie asked the class how they thought they had done. They admitted that they were terrible – a pivotal moment because, from that point on, the children took ownership of the problem. Together, they decided that they would go outside for 15 minutes every day and see if they could build up their fitness. That was in February 2012. A month later, almost all of them could run for 15 minutes without stopping. By the summer, every class was doing it and, soon afterwards, the nursery children joined in, too. The Daily Mile had been born. Since then, this concept of sending children outside during normal lesson time to run or walk laps of the playground for 15 minutes a day has spread to more than 3,600 primary schools in 35 different countries. Yet, while there has been plenty of anecdotal evidence about its benefits, until now hard data has been lacking. Earlier this month, a study was published that looked at 391 children at two Scottish primary schools. Seven months after starting the Daily Mile, children who had been doing it could run 5% further during a timed shuttle-run test than the other children. They had increased their moderate/vigorous physical activity by nine minutes a day and had cut their total sedentary time by 18 minutes. The children also experienced a 4% reduction in the size of their skin folds, suggesting that they were becoming leaner. This is important because 30% of children between the ages of seven and 11 in England and Scotland are overweight or obese; this is associated with a greater risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in later life. “Children often learn about healthy eating and the benefits of physical activity at school, but the kids who are doing the Daily Mile aren’t just learning it in their minds; they are learning: ‘This is something I do every day, as part of my day, and this is how it makes me feel,’” says Naomi Brooks, a senior lecturer in sport at the University of Stirling, who led the study. Even so, initiatives such as the Daily Mile are only part of the solution. The Department of Health says that children over the age of five should be engaging in at least an hour of moderate to vigorous exercise every day – yet only a fifth of children aged between five and 15 achieve this. Moderate activities could include walking to school, riding a scooter, or cycling, while vigorous ones include playing chase, football, dancing or swimming. If that sounds like a lot to you, you are not alone: in a recent nationwide survey, a third of parents underestimated how much exercise children need. “Parents and children felt that the biggest barrier to being more active was a lack of time,” says Susan Coan at Leeds Beckett University, who led the study. “From our research in this area, the main piece of advice would be for families to find ways of being active together that work for them. Small changes are more sustainable and can make a real difference – for example, walking part of the way to school or playing active video games as part of children’s screen time.” One reason exercise is considered so important for children is because it helps establish lifelong habits. “If you are generally active as a youngster, it has a moderately positive effect in terms of your intention and commitment to being active as an adult,” says Prof Craig Williams, director of the children’s health and exercise research centre at the University of Exeter. There are also other long-term consequences. Late childhood and early adolescence are critical times for laying down bone, which reaches its peak density in our 20s, declining thereafter. The higher your bone density during youth, the lower your risk of fractures and osteoporosis in later life. “The idea is that we try to put as much bone as possible ‘in the bank’ as youngsters,” says Williams. “The mechanical stimulation of our body weight going through our bones, muscles and tendons when we jump up and down, stimulates our bone cells to grow and lay down new bone.” There is also some evidence that the fitter you are when you are 18, the less likely you are to have cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks, in later life. Even so, some question the logic of reducing children’s lesson time by 15 minutes each day; surely they could find ways of being more active at other times? Yet, according to a consensus statement released by Williams and 23 other child-health experts in 2016: “Time taken away from lessons for physical activity is time well spent and does not come at the cost of getting good grades. Physical activity has been found to boost young people’s brain development and function, as well as their intellect.” Indeed, in a previous study, Brooks found that a single bout of exercise left children feeling more awake, increased their attention and verbal memory and improved their feelings of wellbeing. The fact that the Daily Mile takes place outside could enhance these effects further. “Bright light directly influences and activates areas of the brain that control alertness and cognition,” says Dr Rachel Sharman, a sleep researcher at the University of Oxford. It can also tweak the timing of the body clock – exposure to bright light during the morning tends to advance the clock, meaning people wake and feel sleepy earlier. “In primary schoolchildren, exercising outdoors for 15 minutes is unlikely to have much effect because they are already relatively early birds. However, at puberty, the circadian clock delays,” Sharman explains. “In teenagers, an early morning mile could pull the clock a little earlier, waking the teen up, when their bodies are – from a circadian rhythm perspective – still asleep. In terms of learning, we would then expect the teen to be in a better place, cognitively, to learn in those first few lessons of the day. Equally, by pulling the clock earlier, a teenager may then find that their body clock signals when it’s time for bed earlier the next night, meaning they get more sleep.” In the six years since its launch, the Daily Mile has been adopted by half of Scottish primary schools and a quarter of English ones. Such is its success, that the Daily Mile Foundation has just launched an adult version, with the hope of inspiring even the busiest of people to incorporate 15 minutes of self-paced walking, jogging or running into their daily lives. As for the children of St Ninians, they continue to run outside for 15 minutes a day in all weathers, even though Wylie left the school two years ago. Last year, the primary 6 girls (the equivalent of year 5 in England and Wales) won the Scottish schools cross-country championship. Wylie’s intention was simply to get the children fit, but what has pleased her most is the levelling effect it appears to have: “It seems that the less fit and more overweight the kids are at the start, the more they benefit,” she says. Given that obesity is more prevalent among lower socioeconomic classes, interventions such as the Daily Mile could help to close the gap in health inequality between rich and poor. If true, 15 minutes a day would be a small price to pay."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/23/indian-study-male-sexual-abuse-film-maker-insia-dariwala","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T11:00:22Z","webTitle":"'The mindset is that boys are not raped': India ends silence on male sex abuse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/23/indian-study-male-sexual-abuse-film-maker-insia-dariwala","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/23/indian-study-male-sexual-abuse-film-maker-insia-dariwala","fields":{"headline":"'The mindset is that boys are not raped': India ends silence on male sex abuse","bodyText":"A film-maker asked by the Indian government to conduct a study of male survivors of child sexual abuse has said there is a culture of indifference in the country about “what happens to men as boys”. Insia Dariwala is investigating links between unresolved male trauma and its impact in later life, after an online survey of 160 Indian men showed that 71% of respondents had been sexually abused as children. Last month, India’s minister of women and child development, Maneka Gandhi, amended legislation to make the protection of children from sexual abuse gender-neutral for the first time. She has invited Dariwala and her Hands of Hope Foundation, along with another non-profit organisation, to begin an in-depth study of male sexual abuse. The last government research in India to touch on the issue was carried out in 2007, when 53.2% of children reported having experienced some form of sexual abuse. Of those, 52.9% were boys. “Child sexual abuse is gender-neutral,” Gandhi said. “Boys who are sexually abused as children spend a lifetime in silence because of the stigma and shame attached to male survivors speaking out. It is a serious problem and needs to be addressed.” Prabhat Kumar, an adviser on child protection with Save the Children, welcomed the move: “There has never been a specific study of adult male survivors of child sexual abuse.” Campaigners are hoping the study will lift stigma around the issue. One, a 22-year-old business student from Pune in Maharashtra state, said: “I was five when the abuse started and it went on for two years.” He requested that he should be called a survivor, not a victim. “I didn’t even know his name,” he said. “I didn’t tell anyone out of fear. I was threatened, manipulated and, more than anything, I thought it was my fault.” He wants to end the taboos that prevent boys from reporting such abuse. “It took years to come to terms with for me. It didn’t happen overnight,” he said. “Silence is a perpetrator’s best friend. When I met a lot of other survivors, I realised that I wasn’t the only one who had gone through the trauma. “The biggest problem in Indian society is the mindset that ‘boys are not raped’. People live in denial. We live in a patriarchal society and suffer,” he said. According to Dariwala, of the 71% of men surveyed who said they were abused, 84.9% said they had not told anyone about the abuse. The primary reasons for this were shame (55.6%), followed by confusion (50.9%), fear (43.5%) and guilt (28.7%). Dariwala said her detailed study would look at the long-term emotional, behavioural and mental impacts of child sexual abuse, examining links between male trauma and violence against women and children. “The focus is prevention, so that we can catch all forms of sexual violence at its onset, and if possible eliminate it in the coming generations,” she said. “Various factors come into play. But the most important factor is patriarchy, which forces a boy into believing that his abuse was something that he can get over, without any support. This mentality also forces the child to accept his abuse as a rite of passage in him becoming a man,” Dariwala said. Other factors such as ridicule, a hostile attitude from authorities and lack of trust all contribute. Current legislation does not allow retrospective reporting, but Gandhi has said she would seek a change in the law to allow complaints of child sexual abuse to be filed years after the crime."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/19/harry-and-meghan-to-be-duke-and-duchess-of-sussex","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T08:21:20Z","webTitle":"Harry and Meghan to be Duke and Duchess of Sussex","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/harry-and-meghan-to-be-duke-and-duchess-of-sussex","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/19/harry-and-meghan-to-be-duke-and-duchess-of-sussex","fields":{"headline":"Harry and Meghan to be Duke and Duchess of Sussex","bodyText":"Meghan Markle will graduate from actor to duchess on her marriage after the Queen gave her grandson Prince Harry a dukedom for their wedding gift. The title of Duke of Sussex, bestowed just hours before the ceremony on Saturday, means Markle will carry the style HRH and the title Duchess of Sussex. The announcement by Buckingham Palace read: “The Queen today has been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. “Prince Harry thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and Ms Meghan Markle on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.” Sussex was the bookies’ favourite for the sixth in line to the throne. A dukedom, the highest title in the British peerage, is a traditional wedding gift to senior male royals. But suitable dukedoms – those not already taken, those without taint and unfortunate histories or those with any other living claimants – are in relatively short supply. Several are already used up owing to longevity. Sussex is not controversial. There has only been one previous Duke of Sussex: the eccentric Prince Augustus Frederick, the ninth child and sixth son of King George III. The title became free on his death in 1843 because, although he married twice, both happened without the king’s consent, thus rendering his two children technically illegitimate. Previously and later, Sussex was an earldom. Other available dukedoms had limitations. Connaught is now in the Irish Republic; and Clarence has had a chequered history as previous holders have died young, been drowned in a barrel of Malmsey wine or erroneously rumoured to be Jack the Ripper. It was probably too early to bestow the title Duke of Windsor, as to do so would resurrect the memory of the Duchess of Windsor, Wallis Simpson, the last US divorcee to marry into the royal family, precipitating the abdication crisis of 1936. It is customary that a peerage title is chosen from each of the three kingdoms, so Harry also received Scottish and Northern Irish titles in becoming the Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. The title Earl of Dumbarton, on the north bank of the River Clyde, has not been used since 1749, and Harry will be the third earl of that name in history. Kilkeel, a small town on the coast of County Down below the Mourne Mountains, has never previously been granted as a title. It does mean as well as becoming a duchess, Markle will be a countess."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/2018/may/19/australia-and-us-oppose-un-move-for-independent-inquiry-into-gaza-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T04:35:23Z","webTitle":"Australia and US oppose UN move for independent inquiry into Gaza violence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/19/australia-and-us-oppose-un-move-for-independent-inquiry-into-gaza-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/19/australia-and-us-oppose-un-move-for-independent-inquiry-into-gaza-violence","fields":{"headline":"Australia and US oppose UN move for independent inquiry into Gaza violence","bodyText":"Australia has aligned with the United States as one of only two countries to vote against an independent investigation into the recent killing of 60 Palestinians in Gaza. The United Nations human rights council held a special meeting on Friday night to discuss the “deteriorating human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory”. Twenty-nine countries, an overwhelming majority, voted to urgently set up an “independent, international commission of inquiry” to investigate recent violations of human rights and international humanitarian law there. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Only two countries voted against the proposal: Australia and the United States, although another 14 abstained. Summaries of the meeting reveal that Australian officials expressed “sadness and regret about the loss of life and injury”. But Australia was recorded as holding the “firm view” that Israel had legitimate security concerns and the right to protect itself. Australia, in line with previous statements, again urged Israel to show “appropriate restraint” and said investigations into the shootings had to be independent and impartial. But it opposed the human rights council’s inquiry over concerns that it appeared biased. Australian officials said they were concerned the language in the draft resolution had “prejudged the outcome” . “Australia was of the opinion that the inquiry must also acknowledge the role of Hamas, which was not mentioned at all,” the summary of the meeting read. “Furthermore, the draft resolution did not just cover Gaza where the events had occurred and the time period during which it had occurred, but had an unlimited time period and all areas. Australia was very concerned that it was not independent and impartial. For these reasons it would vote against it.” Australia’s position has already prompted criticism domestically. Oxfam’s chief executive, Dr Helen Szoke, said Australia, through its role on the council, had an “unprecedented opportunity to progress human rights”. She urged it to take its role seriously. “When Australia took up its seat on the council, it promised to act in a principled manner and uphold human rights,” Szoke said. “Voting against a motion to launch an independent investigation into the killings in Gaza and to investigate all violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the context of civilian protests, flies in the face of Australia’s commitment. “It represents a broken promise on Australia’s part and is immensely disappointing.” The Human Rights Watch Australian director, Elaine Pearson, said the federal government’s opposition was “shameful”. “This was a chance to put principle before politics and Australia blew it,” she said. “This was not about targeting Israel but targeting human rights violations. When security forces opened fire on protesters who pose no imminent threat, they must be held to account.” The UN’s senior human rights chief, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, has castigated Israel for the violence. He said 60 Palestinians were killed and thousands injured, while one Israeli soldier was injured by a rock. “The stark contrast in casualties on both sides is … suggestive of a wholly disproportionate response.” The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has been approached for comment."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/19/ed-sheeran-denounces-use-of-song-in-anti-abortion-campaign-in-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T02:25:19Z","webTitle":"Ed Sheeran denounces use of song in anti-abortion campaign in Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/19/ed-sheeran-denounces-use-of-song-in-anti-abortion-campaign-in-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/19/ed-sheeran-denounces-use-of-song-in-anti-abortion-campaign-in-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Ed Sheeran denounces use of song in anti-abortion campaign in Ireland","bodyText":"Ed Sheeran has denounced anti-abortion campaigners after reports they used one of his songs less than a week before Ireland’s referendum on abortion. The British pop star’s song Small Bump was reportedly being played by anti-abortion activists campaigning in Dublin’s city centre. Sheeran distanced himself from those using his song, saying in a post on Instagram that “it does not reflect what the song is about”. Small Bump, released in 2011, is from Sheeran’s debut album +, and his objection comes as Ireland prepares to vote on Friday 25 May in a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment to its constitution, which bans abortion in almost all circumstances. The song’s lyrics include: “You’re just a small bump unknown, you’ll grow into your skin/With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin/Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice, and eyelids closed to be soon opened wide/ A small bump, in four months you’ll open your eyes.” In his Instagram post, Sheeran, who is currently playing a series of concerts in Ireland, said: “I’ve been informed that my song Small Bump is being used to promote the pro-life campaign, and I feel it’s important to let you know I have not given approval for this use, and it does not reflect what the song is about.” Ireland’s referendum has attracted interest from groups from around the world seeking to influence the vote. A significant proportion of Facebook posts aimed at influencing voters were shown to have come from pages managed partly or entirely outside Ireland. Even some groups registered with Ireland’s ethics watchdog, the Standards In Public Office Commission, had Facebook pages managed from abroad. Facebook said it was blocking all foreign spending on advertising around Ireland’s referendum on abortion in an effort to adhere to the “principles” of the country’s election spending laws."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/20/kevin-obrien-ireland-cricket-pakistan","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T07:30:50Z","webTitle":"Ireland’s test of character leaves Kevin O’Brien confident they can compete | Andy Bull","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/20/kevin-obrien-ireland-cricket-pakistan","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/20/kevin-obrien-ireland-cricket-pakistan","fields":{"headline":"Ireland’s test of character leaves Kevin O’Brien confident they can compete","bodyText":"The O’Brien boys used to play at the Ashes in the back garden. During the summer they would stage long one-on-one Test matches, each always taking the same part. Back then Niall was a batsman whose hero was Steve Waugh, so he would be Australia, and Kevin was a bowler who idolised Darren Gough, so he’d be England. “That’s where I learned the game, in the back garden with Nialler,” Kevin says. “Toughest cricket I ever played.” It never occurred to them to pick Ireland even though their father played 50 games for the national team. “Honestly, I never believed Ireland would ever play Test cricket,” Kevin says. “Not in my career.” Last Sunday afternoon Ireland were doing exactly that. It was the third day of their first Test match, against Pakistan at Malahide and the dream had suddenly become a nightmare. They were seven for four, 300 runs behind and belly up. What’s worse is that it was happening on the same day Cricket Ireland had picked for their big party. They had invited every living cricketer who had played for Ireland along to watch. Eighty came. “Which added to the pressure,” Kevin says, “because we knew they were living and breathing every ball along with us.” Kevin was the next man in. He had been playing all his life but had hardly any first-class experience to draw on. Just 40-odd games, most of them for Ireland against the other associate nations, plus a single match for Surrey, another for Nottinghamshire and a handful for Leinster in the new inter-provincial competition. There was nothing there to tell him how to bat when, in your first Test, the team are seven for four and Pakistan are on a tear. But he had played 125 ODIs, more than any other Test debutant in history. So he decided to do what he knew best. “There was nothing left to lose,” O’Brien says. “It already looked like we could be 50 all out so it couldn’t get any worse.” Seven years earlier O’Brien was at the crease in Bangalore when Ireland were 111 for five chasing England’s 327 in the 2011 World Cup. The decision he made now was similar to the one he had taken then. “I decided to try and counterattack, to put some pressure back on the bowlers.” In Bangalore he made 113 from 63 balls; in Malahide it was 40 from 68. But those 40 runs steered Ireland away from the rocks. Belief began to course through the team. Pakistan made Ireland follow-on that evening but their openers, Ed Joyce and William Porterfield, batted through to the close, reaching 64 for nought. “That was the key partnership,” O’Brien says. “It showed us we could compete at this level.” The next day,O’Brien did more than compete. Coming in at 95 for four, by the close he was unbeaten on 118, the first Test century for Ireland. He could not add to that the following day but Ireland made 339 and had Pakistan 14 for three in the chase. In the end Pakistan won by five wickets but Ireland had proved they could handle themselves in Test cricket. “People have asked me which innings I preferred and I’d have to say it was the hundred in Bangalore,” O’Brien says. “Because it was against England, because it was the World Cup and, most of all, because we won.” The Test left him with mixed emotions. “I’m very proud and happy with the century but ultimately I’m disappointed that we couldn’t put Pakistan under even more pressure.” He blames himself. “If I’d just pushed on the next morning and got those few extra runs, even another 30, it could have been different.” Instead, he was caught swinging at his first ball on the fifth morning. “It was a lesson,” he says. “I got too caught up in everything the night before. I was still dealing with all the congratulations, the text messages and that, before I went out to bat. I wish I had left all that till after the match.” That was one of the ways in which Test cricket surprised him. “There were the little things, like at one point Pakistan had a spinner on and seven men fielding on the leg side and I’ve never faced anything like that in my career. But the large thing was just how much concentration it takes to play Test cricket. We played well, bowled well, batted well, in periods, but the best teams in the world do it for seven hours a day, day in, day out, and that’s the next challenge for us.” Whether O’Brien will be the one to take it on he isn’t sure. He is 34 and one of a group of senior players who are coming to the end. “You are going to see a couple of retirements in the next couple of seasons,” he says. “The team could lose six or seven of us, so it’s imperative Ireland blood some new players as quickly as they can.” O’Brien is already thinking of what he can do to help. He is midway through his level three coaching certificate and the day after the Test finished he was in the nets at his old club in Dublin working with the next generation of players. When they were young, the O’Briens had to keep their backyard matches quiet. They went to school in inner-city Dublin and if the other kids knew they played the “English” sport instead of hurling, rugby or Gaelic football, then “we might have come in for a few hidings”. It’s different now. Somewhere in Ireland this summer there will be a couple of schoolkids playing Test cricket in their back garden, one-on-one. They won’t need to hush it up and they won’t have to pretend to be England or Australia any more.

But the long-term aim is still to become a bowler for all seasons and one who lives up to some as yet unfulfilled hype in Test cricket. Unless an emerald green pitch is rolled out at Lord’s when England take on Pakistan from Thursday, and makes the uncapped spin of Dom Bess as redundant as an Argos catalogue in Ikea, then the chief talking point will be whether it is Wood or Chris Woakes – who took 11 wickets in the same fixture two years ago – who gets the final spot. Though Wood is the incumbent, having replaced Woakes for the final Test of the winter in Christchurch, Root and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, will still take a view based on the surface. Grassy, and the Warwickshire bowler could win his spot back; dry with potential for reverse later on, and it is over to Durham’s fast but slightly fragile right-armer. Asked during the launch of the new England kits where his pace is currently, Wood replies: “That’s a question for the speed gun. There’s times I can bowl quickly and times I know I can but don’t like to force it because I’ll leak runs. It depends what the captain wants – if he wants me to rev it up then I’m happy to do that. “I want to be a bowler for all conditions. But I’d certainly be happy if they said Woakes, Jake Ball or whoever is more suited to a pitch – I wouldn’t have a problem. More than anything I want the team to do well. Hopefully I can bring something else when conditions aren’t like that, where it’s drier, reverses or a slower pitch.” Such skills came to the fore during Wood’s first county match of the season when, having called time early on a bench-warming spell in the Indian Premier League with Chennai Super Kings, he used similar conditions to claim a career-best six for 46 in Durham’s run-soaked draw at Derbyshire, which finished on Monday. His dismissal of Wayne Madsen, caught behind failing to evade a searing short ball from around the wicket, was his personal favourite and demonstrated why England have persisted for three years. With 28 wickets at 41 from 11 Tests, the 28-year-old accepts that while injuries are a factor, the Test-watching public are yet to see his best. “I need to get more wickets, I need to be more consistent,” says Wood. “To be honest I’ve got a lot to prove to the selectors, coaches, media, the fans because I’m a guy people probably had high hopes for and I’ve not done it consistently enough. An average of 40 is pretty average to be honest and I definitely want to lower that. “I’ve got a point to prove to myself that I am good enough to do it at that level. Am I really as good as I think I am? Am I as good as the commentators, selectors think I am? Can I live up to that? I’ve got a long way to go.” Such honesty is one of Wood’s endearing qualities, as is the drive to succeed at Test level in an era when, as a fast bowler with a back story of injuries and operations, he could easily jump on the Twenty20 train as a white-ball specialist. The reason why not? “When I was in the back garden as a kid it was never T20 or 50-over, it was Test matches. In my mind all the best players were at Test level and that’s what I wanted to strive to.

But with the perspective of centuries rather than the frenzied 24-hour news cycle, he does make a persuasive case that the present crisis is not unique – or, to put it another way, that there were plenty of causes for panic in the past yet, so long as attention was paid and citizens stepped up, the republic endured. “My fear with this book was that people were going to say, ‘Oh, he’s saying relax, everything’s going to be fine,’” Meacham told the Guardian. “It’s quite the opposite. It’s: ‘Get to work and everything might be.’” The Pulitzer prize winner’s book is called The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Better Angels. He expounds: “It’s natural to think that your own moment is ‘the most this’ or ‘the most that’. It’s the tyranny of hyperbole and the narcissism of the present – which is a phrase I didn’t put in the book but which I now love – and it’s understandable. I mean, nostalgia is a powerful drug. “It doesn’t mean that the present isn’t vital but my view here is, before you decide to set your hair on fire after a given tweet, just take a moment and think: is this really worth a disproportionate view? Is panic a proportional response to Donald Trump? It may be, but I’d like people to read this book and then perhaps at least decide whether or not they want to hit the ‘panic’ button as opposed to the ‘concerned’ button.” Trump’s anarchic, vulgar, fear-mongering and norm-busting style is lapped up by supporters but poses a dilemma for critics. The Women’s March on his first full day in the White House was a resounding clarion call and the liberal billionaire Tom Steyer is agitating for impeachment. But is it paralysing to remain in crisis mode for four years? Conversely, does an attempt to shrug off the madness and get on with everyday life risk normalising the abnormal? Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot includes the line: “The tears of the world are a constant quantity. For each one who begins to weep, somewhere else another stops.” Can the same be said of anti-Trump outrage? From immigration to climate change to the Iran nuclear deal, there is plenty to be outraged about, as MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show and the former Hillary Clinton aide turned tweeter Philippe Reines constantly remind us. Yet the president’s bark has proved worse than his bite on curtailing press freedom (at least so far) or firing the special counsel Robert Mueller (at least so far) and he has not fulfilled the worst prophecy of doom. Unlike George W Bush, he has not started a war (at least so far). Are some of the most hysterical anti-Trumpers going too far? Meacham is measured: “Sure, and some people aren’t going far enough. I think his reflexive opponents are endowing him with superpowers that he doesn’t possess. But his Fox News base believe him to be a messianic figure, a view for which there is virtually no evidence. So what I worry most about is this tribal divide that is reflexive as opposed to reflective and my goal here is: I don’t think we’re being true to the origins of the country if we dismiss reason and proportion on both sides.” Meacham believes that partisan media, while not the cause of the trend, have exacerbated it. “I think from what I have seen of the opinion programming in the pro-Trump cable world, it’s pretty amazing. It’s just an alternative universe and it’s possible that the anti-Trump people will go too far that way. On a human level, it’s all understandable. If you’re prepared to be outraged every day, Donald Trump will outrage you. If you’re prepared every day to defend him, you’ll have that impulse, so it’s not particularly illuminating.” Meacham’s elegantly written book makes clear that we have been here before, one way or another. Fear, strife, division and uneven progress have been the norm, not the exception, of American history. The lurch from Barack Obama, the country’s first black president, to Trump, endorsed by the Ku Klux Klan, should not come as a surprise considering the backlash against immigrants in the first world war, the resurgence of the Klan in the 1920s or Senator Joseph McCarthy’s anti-communist witch-hunts in the 1950s. For Meacham, the “better angels of our nature” prevail in presidents who unify, people who mobilise and institutions that weather the storm. “In our system we have about five forces that are in the arena at any given time: the presidency, the Congress, the courts, the press and the people,” he says. “As long as two or three of those are in the right place or pushing in the right direction, I think we think we’re going to be OK. Right now, I think we have about half of that force pushing in the right direction. “This is a stress test for citizenship, and that can sound sentimental, but it actually has the virtue of being true because the story of our country is that the more generously we’ve interpreted the Jeffersonian assertion of equality, the stronger we become.” ‘Demography is destiny’ The ascent of Trump could make even the most Pollyanna-ish American feel bleak about the state of race relations. He has assembled a cabinet dominated by middle-aged white men. He introduced a travel ban on some Muslim-majority countries, denigrated Native Americans and campaigned for Roy Moore, an Alabama Senate candidate who spoke positively about slavery. When white supremacists marched with flaming torches in Charlottesville, Virginia, and violence erupted, Trump said there was blame on “both sides”. But again, Meacham, from Tennessee, offers reassuring perspective, though not complacency. “Fifty years ago in my native region, we had a functional apartheid, so as a relative matter, things are vastly better. But that’s a white man saying that, so take it for what it’s worth. It is a perennial issue. I think it always will be. “Things are better today than they were yesterday but history does teach us that things can fall apart and slide backwards if we’re not incredibly attentive and devoted to that idea of fair play for everybody. My argument is the best way to guarantee fair play for yourself is to give it to others.” Trump’s bleak and bilious inaugural address promised: “From this moment on, it’s going to be America first.” In March, he pushed ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, threatening a trade war with China and Europe. Diplomatically, critics say, the US is abandoning its leadership role when it is urgently needed. Meacham reflects: “This is an incredibly important moment in the globalisation of the world and it would be great if we had a president like Ronald Reagan, like George HW Bush, like Bill Clinton, like George W Bush, who understood the importance of free trade, who understood that that we’re stronger the more open we are. This is an unfortunate period of reaction. My own view is that the ferocity of the reaction is really a validation of the broader trend. “This is not a partisan point but I would bet a lot of money that in 2038 – the same amount of time that separates us from the last years of Clinton, which is [kind] of amazing – America is going to look a lot more like Barack Obama’s America than Donald Trump’s America. Demography is destiny here. We will have these backlashes – this is not the last one – but you can’t argue with broad historical forces, and the broad historical forces are pushing toward a more pluralistic, more open world.” If there is consolation to be found in the past, the 1860s (civil war) and the 1960s (division over the Vietnam war) are most frequently trotted out as the readiest comparisons to today. Meacham resists the former – “it’s just such an outlier” – but does find resonance in the latter, although he notes: “Fifty years ago, if we had been talking on this date in 1968, an average of 46 Americans died in south-east Asia in combat. Forty-six a day! It’s incredible. Can you imagine that today?” Another Washington parlour game is seeking analogues for Trump in past presidents: the demagoguery and racism of Andrew Jackson, the corruption and mendacity of Richard Nixon, the celebrity and media savvy of Ronald Reagan. Yet the 45th president is by definition sui generis in the sense that he is the first never to have served in government or the military. For once, the term unprecedented is justified. “There are elements of Trump that have precursors but he is in fact unique in the compound that he offers,” reflects Meacham, biographer of Thomas Jefferson and the first Bush. “I think it’s hard to imagine – though we never rule this out – it recurring in exactly this way. But my broader point is we’ve survived presidents who were not commensurate with the task and I think we’ll survive this one. “But [it takes] the paying of attention, the voting. The reason Hillary is not president is because the Obama turnout was not there for her in critical states. It was a perfect storm that elected [Trump] and again, hard to imagine those elements ever coalescing again. But I didn’t think Donald Trump was going to be president, so what the hell do I know?” The author recently delivered a touching eulogy at the funeral of the former first lady Barbara Bush, which Trump did not attend. He saw George HW Bush again last week. Can Meacham foresee the post-Trump Republican party producing a leader in the Bush mould? “I can, because I think what the Republicans have proven is that fundamentally they are a malleable bunch and the right apostle can teach them a new creed pretty quickly. To have gone from a free-trading, Burkean party to a populist rightwing party in a single cycle suggests that it’s a plane that can be hijacked pretty easily.” At 93, Bush himself remains a perennial optimist in the experiment of self-government. When it comes to navigating life, the universe and everything, “don’t panic” is good advice. But in Trump’s America, don’t relax, either."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"science/2018/may/20/shigur-idol-shatters-expert-views-birth-of-ritual-art-hunter-gatherers","type":"article","sectionId":"science","sectionName":"Science","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T06:00:51Z","webTitle":"Carved idol from the Urals shatters expert views on birth of ritual art","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/20/shigur-idol-shatters-expert-views-birth-of-ritual-art-hunter-gatherers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2018/may/20/shigur-idol-shatters-expert-views-birth-of-ritual-art-hunter-gatherers","fields":{"headline":"Carved idol from the Urals shatters expert views on birth of ritual art","bodyText":"On 24 January 1894, gold prospectors were digging in the Shigir peat bog, north of the town of Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains, when they uncovered a strange collection of carved pieces of wood. A total of 10 fragments were found beside each other. When put together, a wooden idol more than five metres high was created, one that had clearly been carved from a single, carefully smoothed plank of larch wood. Its surface was covered with zigzag lines and human faces and hands. This is the Shigir Idol, and according to scientists writing in Antiquity, recent studies of its structure and its date of construction dramatically overturn our ideas about the appearance of art among humans. The idol, it transpires, is one of the oldest pieces of monumental art ever uncovered. “Our analysis indicates that the Shigir Idol is around 11,500 years old,” said archaeologist Professor Thomas Terberger, of Göttingen University, in Germany, one of the authors of the Antiquity paper. “At that time, Europe and Asia were still emerging from the ice age. There were no farmers then. The only humans in this part of the world at this time were hunter-gatherers. Yet they created the Shigir Idol. The discovery of its antiquity therefore changes, dramatically, – our views about the birth of ritual art.” Many examples of early stone age are known: they include the cave paintings of France and Spain, created more than 30,000 years ago, and tiny objects, carved out of mammoth tusks, that depict animals or animal-human hybrids. Many of these are extremely delicate and extraordinarily well crafted. But they are generally realistic in style. The symbol-covered Shigir Idol represents a leap beyond this sort of naturalistic art. When the idol was discovered, the date of its construction was a matter of conjecture and remained so for a century until, in the 1990s, scientists removed a portion and used radiocarbon detectors to date it. It produced an age of about 9,800 years. any scholars rejected the result as implausible. Hunter-gatherers did not have the ability to make such a huge work or have the complex symbolic imagination to decorate it in the way that the idol has been adorned, sceptics argued. As a result, a new, more sophisticated dating was sought and the result of that work is outlined in Antiquity. These show that far from being a younger object than was suspected by the sceptics, the idol turns out to be even older than was indicated by the first dating attempt. “The result was quite a surprise, I admit,” said Terberger. In the past, large-scale complex art was considered to be the handiwork of later, sedentary farming people who started to spread from the Middle East about 8,000 years ago and took over land previously used by hunter-gatherers. These agrarian societies achieved considerable sophistication and were eventually responsible, in Britain, for the construction of great Neolithic works such as Stonehenge and the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney. By contrast, it was assumed hunter-gatherers were not capable of the type of symbolic thinking, nor the organisation, that underpinned the design of these great monuments. However, the dating of the Shigir Idol suggests this is not the case and that the period just after the last ice age was not a cultural desert as some experts have argued. The lack of remains of hunter-gatherer monumental art may simply be blamed on the fact that they used wood which has not survived – unlike the stone works of their farming folk successors. Only the freak conditions of the peat bog of Yekaterinburg permitted the idol’s survival. “We have to accept that hunter-gatherers had complex rituals and were capable of very sophisticated expression of ideas and art,” said Terberger. “These things didn’t start with farmers, they began with hunter-gatherers much earlier.” Analysis of wood from the idol has also revealed much about living conditions. “If you study the rings, you can see trees were growing very slowly as it was still pretty cold then. Europe was still emerging from the last ice age. You can see that in the rings of the wood that makes up the idol.” Over the years, archaeologists have dug up many small tools also decorated with zig-zag symbols in northern Europe, suggesting that society was much less fragmented than previously thought and that there was considerable sharing of ideas. Terberger said: “It is exciting to see these connections being established over huge distances.” But what was the purpose of a monument that would have loomed over any terrain in which it was erected? “From our current perspective, it is very hard to work out what was going on in the minds of the creators of the Shigir Idol,” Terberger said. “However, I am struck by the similarity of the idol with the totem poles of native Americans in the north-west Pacific region.” Such poles often honour gods or ancestors and this could explain the purpose of the idol. Other researchers suggest alternative theories. Mikhail Zhilin of the Russian Academy of Sciences – another of the paper’s authors – argues that the idol might depict forest sprites or demons while Vang Petersen, of the National Museum of Denmark, suggests that the carvings were “keep out” warnings not to stray on sacred land. “It’s intriguing,” Terberger says. “What is certain is that its makers were saying a lot more than just an announcement that ‘I can build a big pole.’” Read the whole academic paper here"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/18/santa-fe-texas-high-school-shooting-saddened","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T13:09:47Z","webTitle":"'It's been happening everywhere': Santa Fe saddened but not surprised by shooting","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/18/santa-fe-texas-high-school-shooting-saddened","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/18/santa-fe-texas-high-school-shooting-saddened","fields":{"headline":"'It's been happening everywhere': Santa Fe saddened but not surprised by shooting","bodyText":"Normally bustling on a Friday lunchtime, Pook’s Crawfish Hole was closed. Where the giant roadside sign might usually promote the restaurant’s specials, it said: “Thoughts and Prayers With Santa Fe.” In the deserted interior, a television mounted on the wall near dangling models of crustaceans was tuned to a local news channel’s coverage of the school shooting that had unfolded that morning just a couple of miles away. Pook’s opens from January to June, when the crawfish from Louisiana, the next door state, are fresh. But on this day it was shut. “Out of respect,” said Gregg Vicknair, the owner. A sign on the door encouraged would-be patrons to attend the candlelight vigil planned for the evening to mourn the 10 dead. Community gatherings are the most natural and common short-term response in the aftermath of such a tragedy; what felt different from the norm in Santa Fe after the latest American school massacre was the sense that despite theshock, such events happen often enough that it would be almost naive to experience disbelief. Even for some children, it seems, it has become a matter of not if, but when and where. A television journalist’s interview with one Santa Fe student, Paige Curry, went viral on social media. “Was there a part of you that was like, ‘This isn’t real, this would not happen in my school?’” the reporter asked her. Curry gave a rueful semi-laugh. “No, there wasn’t,” she replied. “It’s been happening everywhere, I’ve always kind of felt like eventually it was going to happen here too.” Vicknair had a similar reply to a similar question: you never think it’ll happen here, right? “People say that, but I always … ” He paused. “Yes. I think that kind of stuff can happen anywhere.” The father of three added: “It makes you wonder. Like I hear people say all the time, [school is] supposed to be a safe place. But I guess nowadays it’s just not.” Santa Fe high school had been placed on lockdown in response to a potential threat as recently as 28 February, when police were called after reports of popping sounds. The deaths and injuries in Santa Fe happened three months after 17 students and staff were shot dead at a high school in Parkland, Florida, generating an immense amount of activism and attention, but has not so far translated into meaningful political action. On Friday night, several hundred people, many wearing the green colours of the high school’s sports teams, attended a vigil for the victims in the town. The event featured prayers led by local pastors and speeches by Ted Cruz, the US senator from Texas, and the governor, Greg Abbott, who told the crowd that Texas politicians would work to find solutions that return “normalcy” and “safety” to schools. This was the 16th shooting this year at a school during school hours that caused injury or death. Combined, the tally of the previous fifteen incidents is 21 deaths and 46 injuries. “It’s just a shame and hopefully there will be changes nationwide to secure these schools. I’ll leave that up to the professionals,” Vicknair, 39, said. “I think we’ve got officials and stuff that can make those decisions.” Not yet swallowed by Houston’s ever-expanding suburbia, Santa Fe is a spread-out place of about 13,000 people with quiet streets lined with single-storey ranch-style houses, some with front lawns as big as basketball courts. Less racially diverse than other parts of Texas – a large majority of residents are white – and with a slightly higher average household income than the state as a whole, it has a semi-rural character. Still, with the busy Highway 6 running through the centre of town (and past the scene of the slaughter) it is easy enough for residents to commute to Houston, the Gulf coast seaside resort of Galveston or the oil refineries and chemical plants of Texas City. Until now, it was perhaps best known for a case in 2000 in which the US supreme court ruled that the school district’s policy of allowing student-led prayers before football games was unconstitutional. Raymond Doreck’s family has run a meat market in the town for 45 years. His daughter attends courses at the high school but was not there on Friday. As images from rolling news reports flickered on the computer monitor on his desk, he confronted what he fears is a modern reality with no easy solution. “You have to look at it that it could happen anywhere. You just hope that it doesn’t. I don’t know how to stop it and I don’t think gun control’s the answer,” the 56-year-old said in his small office, around the corner from a preparation room where trays of spicy beef jerky were stacked high. “We grew up having guns, hunting, none of that ever happened when we had guns. We went to school, used to have guns in the back of our pickups, on the racks. Long as you didn’t take them inside, you know? Nothing like that ever happened.” Outside the front entrance, at a flagpole next to a life-sized model of a cow, a man lowered the Stars and Stripes to half-staff."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/19/dominic-cummings-is-the-true-cowardly-face-of-the-brexiters","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T16:30:32Z","webTitle":"Dominic Cummings is the true cowardly face of the Brexiters | Nick Cohen","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/19/dominic-cummings-is-the-true-cowardly-face-of-the-brexiters","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/19/dominic-cummings-is-the-true-cowardly-face-of-the-brexiters","fields":{"headline":"Dominic Cummings is the true cowardly face of the Brexiters","bodyText":"Dominic Cummings is just a troll. He may have trolled the whole country and changed the course of British history, but he’s still the man with an egg for a face, who screams everyone must be accountable for their actions – everyone except him. MPs who want to question Cummings about the finances of his Vote Leave campaign are “grandstanding” fools spreading “fake news”. (A rich charge from an operator who told the populace that Brexit would deliver £350m-a-week to the NHS and the EU was about to admit Turkey and flood Britain with millions of jihad-inclined Muslims.) He seems as confident now as he was then. “It’s too late,” he says in effect. “We won and there’s nothing you little people can do about it.” Perhaps he’s right. In an age of Russian infowars and data harvesting, our defences against the manipulation of elections are as obsolete as black-and-white television. For all that, I can see why he may be feeling a niggle of fear. He has become the first person to refuse to co-operate with the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee’s investigation into the referendum and it is easy to guess why. Vote Leave spent millions buying targeted online advertising from the AggregateIQ data company. It also gave £625,000 to a student, Darren Grimes, who ran a second Brexit campaign – BeLeave. Cummings insisted Grimes was not his stooge. But evidence to the committee from Facebook showed BeLeave used AggregateIQ datasets which covered the “exact same audiences”. MPs want to know whether there was collusion between the two supposedly separate organisations and a scam to break the referendum campaign’s spending limits. Cummings says he cannot answer the charge because he is also being investigated by the Electoral Commission. Yet Alexander Nix of Donald Trump’s Cambridge Analytica has given evidence, even though he is facing multiple inquiries. As Damian Collins, the committee’s chairman said, Cummings’s excuse “simply does not hold up”. Cummings is the latest in a long line of Leavers who have shown nothing but contempt for the British institutions they claim to be protecting. After the Mail denounced judges as the “enemies of the people” and Jacob Rees-Mogg talked of “burning down” the Lords, we have the director of Vote Leave refusing to acknowledge the sovereignty of the Commons. The right does not want Britain to “take back control”. It wants to control Britain, and anyone who gets in its way is a fake, a grandstander, an enemy or saboteur. A fair proportion of its bottomless supply of venom has been directed at my colleague Carole Cadwalladr. Her exposé of the Leave campaign is not a model example of dogged journalism but a “conspiracy theory” that offers Remain voters the illusion they did not really lose. Leavers never explain how they know the alleged breaches of electoral law did not swing a tight contest. Nor do they show any concern for the health of British democracy or the rule of law. Vote Leave was the official pro-Brexit campaign. Cummings, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove et al claimed to be the serious Brexiters – a cut above Nigel Farage, Aaron Banks and the other race-baiters. As it has turned out, Vote Leave won by exploiting immigration as cynically as Farage and Banks did. They no more had a coherent plan for Britain’s future than Farage and Banks had. And now there is a prima facie argument – to put it mildly – that they were just as disreputable. What makes the right’s dismissal of the case against the Leave campaign so suspect is that modern elections are about access to and the exploitation of data. Cummings said that Vote Leave “put almost all our money into digital”. Yet the authorities know nothing about the sources of the data. AggregateIQ is based on Vancouver Island off Canada’s west coast. Facebook told the Commons that as far as it can work out “$2m (£1.5m) of AggregateIQ’s entire $3.5m Facebook advertising spend over the last four years appeared to be associated with the EU referendum”. The Commons discovered that, as well as supporting Vote Leave, it was also gearing up to provide support for Michael Gove’s attempt to seize the prime ministership in 2016. Staffed by civil servants rather than the police and intelligence officers needed to protect free elections in the 2010s, the Electoral Commission has been hopeless. So uninterested was it in doing its duty, the pro-Remain Good Law Project sought a judicial review of its failure to investigate the payments to Grimes. It’s as if the Mueller inquiry into Trump’s Russia connections were being run by back-covering bureaucrats rather than investigators with the power to issue search warrants and offer plea-bargaining deals. The hard work has been done by journalists and whistleblowers, who have been treated shockingly. I do not know how Theresa May’s political secretary, Stephen Parkinson, has been allowed to get away with responding to the Vote Leave whistleblower Shahmir Sanni’s revelations about money-channelling by outing him as gay. Sanni is from a traditional Muslim family and the spite behind the attack devastated him. But alongside the viciousness are signs of panic. Leavers are smearing their former friends and Cummings is refusing to give evidence to parliament, because they fear the accusations against them are deadly. In February, the pro-Remain group Best for Britain conducted private polling on what would persuade the public to accept a second referendum. A fall in living standards (and they’ve already fallen) made no difference: a majority would still say we’d had one referendum and that was enough. The NHS suffering (and it is suffering) produced a tie. But when the pollsters asked: “What if there was confirmation of cheating during the referendum campaign?”, 49% wanted a second vote and only 30% opposed. If the trolled public should realise it’s been cheated, the future will be up for grabs. • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/20/survivors-terror-attacks-global-call-for-action-manchester-bali-paris-london","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T07:00:51Z","webTitle":"Manchester, Paris, London, Bali: victims of terror make global call for action","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/survivors-terror-attacks-global-call-for-action-manchester-bali-paris-london","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/20/survivors-terror-attacks-global-call-for-action-manchester-bali-paris-london","fields":{"headline":"Manchester, Paris, London, Bali: victims of terror make global call for action","bodyText":"Dozens of people who have survived terror attacks, and relatives of those who have died in them, have joined together to urge the public to play an active role in the fight against terrorism and to encourage social media companies to take action against those using technology to drive hate. The survivors and family members have signed an open letter, published in the Observer on Sunday, to mark the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack on Tuesday, which will also be the fifth anniversary of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Survivors Against Terror signatories include those who were affected by the attack at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester as well as the attacks carried out in London, at the Bataclan in Paris, at Brussels airport and metro, in Tunisia and Bali, and by the IRA. They are united in their view that any reaction to terrorism should not be used to drive a wedge between people. “Terrorists will only win if we let them,” said Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn died in the Manchester attack. “They commit atrocities, spreading fear and anger, in the hope that they will turn our communities against each other. “That’s why we’re asking people to join the fight against terror, by all playing our part. Most importantly, we’re asking people to take on the hatred that leads to terror – no matter where it comes from, or who it’s directed towards. If we all play our part, we will defeat terror.” Others who have signed the letter include Charlotte Dixon-Sutcliffe, whose husband, David, died in the Brussels metro bombing; Becky Rigby, the wife of Lee Rigby; Travis Frain, who was injured in the Westminster Bridge attack; Mike Haines, the brother of David, who was killed by Islamic State in Syria; Sajda Mughal, a 7/7 survivor; Brendan Cox, whose wife, the MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a far-right extremist; and Justine Merton-Scott and Tony Scott, survivors of the Bataclan attack. Haines said: “It’s very important that people from all walks of life who have been affected by terrorism come together to reject the hatred of terrorism. The key messages of the letter are very, very important, especially with the hatred that is prevalent in society these days.” The letter states: “We are a group of survivors of terrorism. Some of us were injured ourselves, others have lost loved ones. In all cases the scars of those moments are deep. As we know from our own experience, terrorists have targeted the innocent – regardless of faith, ethnicity or politics – for generations. Our members have lost loved ones to nationalists, Islamists and far-right extremists.” It adds: “What binds these extremists together is not any particular belief – it is the hatred of people not like them and the willingness to use violence against innocent civilians. It is this that we must take on and defeat. When terror hits, we all feel an impotent rage. We all want to help the victims and take on the evil that drives the attacks, but how?” The letter sets out five ways in which the public can help. These include giving to appeals to help victims and supporting the emergency and security services. It asks: “If you know something or suspect something, tell them.” It urges: “Please keep your focus on honouring the memory of those who have been killed. Terrorists often attack partly to gain notoriety. We should deny them it; their names don’t deserve to be remembered.” Another request is for people to “ask media and social media organisations to do far more to take on and shut down those driving hate”. “We would welcome any move from these social media platforms to come forward and contact Survivors Against Terror so that we can talk about our concerns and work with them in ways to combat the extremism and the hatred that is sometimes on their platforms,” Haines said. Haines added that he would be thinking about the people of Manchester on Tuesday. “They are in mine and my family’s thoughts, hearts and prayers.

Running on a special pop-up track in Deansgate, Ta Lou, who won 100m and 200m silver at last year’s world championships, made an explosive start to establish a lead she never relinquished before finishing in 16.60 seconds. “It’s my first time to run 150m so I am really happy,” she said. Felix, whose 25 Olympic and world medals is greater than any athlete in history, was second in 16.72, with Britain’s Bianca Williams third in 17.09. Not that Felix was too disappointed. “Obviously she is a fabulous starter in tip-top shape,” she said. “This year for me is about trying to have some fun and stay injury free.” Meanwhile in the 110m hurdles Britain’s Andrew Pozzi could finish only third behind the shock winner Damian Czykier from Poland. Pozzi had been hoping to get his 110m hurdles season back on track after a disappointing Commonwealth Games but he clattered the first, third and fourth hurdles and finished in 13.90 – 0.23 sec behind Czykier. At one stage it looked like the world record holder Aries Merritt was coasting to victory but he tripped on a hurdle and finished last in 14.34 – allowing Czykier to come through. “I was really surprised to win but I was the only one who kept calm in this race,” explained the Pole. “There were so many fatalities.” In the men’s 100m Harry Aikines-Aryeetey beat his close friend Richard Kilty, coming home in 10.35 sec – 0.02 ahead of his 4x100m relay team-mate. However, there was disappointment for Jazmin Sawyers in the women’s long jump when she was pipped by the French athlete Éloyse Lesueur, who won with a season’s best."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/20/a-new-low-in-mansplaining-menopause-as-metaphor-for-failing-economy","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"A new low in mansplaining – menopause as a metaphor for a failing economy | Catherine Bennett","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/a-new-low-in-mansplaining-menopause-as-metaphor-for-failing-economy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/20/a-new-low-in-mansplaining-menopause-as-metaphor-for-failing-economy","fields":{"headline":"A new low in mansplaining – menopause as a metaphor for a failing economy","bodyText":"No offence to my employers, but the continued absence of a menopause cry space, as recently pioneered by Notts police, has not gone unnoticed. Nor – now that a Bank of England official reminds middle-aged women of our extraordinary similarity to once-productive economies, doomed to pitiable decline – have I witnessed any of the workplace menopause openness advocated by the chief medical officer, Sally Davies, such as the taboo-defying “M” for menopause badges. Or “C” for climacteric, as the menopause is known to clinicians, Germaine Greer and, we now discover, the deputy governor of the Bank of England. In an interview that will long be a topic in my bespoke, home cry space, Ben Broadbent told the Daily Telegraph that the British economy is “menopausal”. That means, he elaborated, “you’re past your productive peak, you’re no longer potent”. City analysts fluent in gynaecology/economy parallels would have immediately spotted, looking on the bright side, that Dr Broadbent neither ruled out HRT nor resorted to similes featuring fibroids, stress incontinence or vaginal mesh. But to those unable to interpret Mr Broadbent’s choice of words as anything other than a rare combination of idiocy and unabashed misogyny, he could only, after protests, apologise. Even at the BBC, renowned for its efficiency in purging middle-aged women, most men can be relied on to pretend ignorance of the system. At the Bank of England, colleagues have been tasked, recently, with attributing its massive 25% gender pay gap to the mysterious absence of senior women. Anyway, perhaps Broadbent’s apology will entice more of these failing organisms on board. “I was explaining,” he said, “the meaning of the word climacteric.” Thoughtful of you, Ben. Though maybe, next time, look it up? So as not to conflate the word’s medical definition with climacteric’s primary meaning, in literature unrelated to biology, as a critical moment or period? Rather than explain further, why don’t we substitute “menopause” for “climacteric” in academic titles where Mr Broadbent believes a biological comparator to be involved? For instance: “The menopause of the 1890s: a study in the expanding economy.” And: “Was 19th-century British growth steam-powered?: The menopause revisited.” Similarly: “‘The menopause event in our history’: aspects of Burke’s reception in France.” If, for reasons at which we can only guess, the menopause has become Broadbent’s go-to stagnation metaphor, it is only fair to point out that distaste for women near their own age is shared by many of his middle-aged peers. Look, for instance, at the writing of Rod Liddle or Tony Blair (“the good matrons of the Women’s Institute”); at the 20-year age difference preferred by men who can afford it, when they trade in a climacteric-damaged partner. Naturally, so soon after Toby Young’s surrender of an academic appointment (following exposure of his tweets about women’s “knockers”), and amid the general resentment resulting from #MeToo, Broadbent’s humiliation immediately earned him a place, alongside St Toby of the Tits, in the pantheon of political correctness martyrs. “Did bank boss HAVE to apologise?”, the Mail demanded, of the “PC brigade”. “He was simply using a metaphor.” The Telegraph, having used that innocent metaphor for its headline, now protested the reaction with all the indignation of a tweeting Trump, when he blames the recoil from his own obscenities on “politically correct fools”. Broadbent, the Telegraph said, had been unfairly “hounded” by a “self-appointed Inquisition ready to jump on well-meaning if infelicitous comments”. This is obviously a very busy period for the Inquisition, but as a self-appointed member, an answer to the Mail’s question – did he have to apologise? – given it indicates such deep confusion, might save valuable man-flaying time. Yes, Broadbent did. His curious definition of climacteric, in an economics context, and following that, of the menopause, did not merely advertise his belief in female decline, it also, given his cluelessness as to how the generalisation would be heard, demonstrated why the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee still resembles, with one exception, sex arrangements on Mount Athos. Although credit where it’s due: with Broadbent’s observations being endorsed as “well-meaning”, the scale of Sally Davies’s task, in destigmatising the menopause, becomes easier to appreciate. Next: should a 76-year-old professor Ned Lebow be disgraced for replying, when someone asked “which floor” in a crowded US lift, “women’s lingerie”. It was, as he admits, a distinctly “lame”, Are You Being Served?, elevator pleasantry. He meant, even if it merited some eye-rolling, nothing by it. In fact, this may be the moment for phatic (inconsequential, non-referential) speech, a term that now litters academic papers, to prove its worth. Phatic, one-off asides do not automatically, even when unwelcome, raise questions, as did Broadbent’s and Young’s deliberate observations, about the implications for women colleagues. Are they being recognised as something other than, say, knocker-owners? Or a #grandmaI’dliketoshag (Young on Helen Mirren)? Are they more than a “sexy little slag” (Labour’s Jared O’Mara); “deliberately barren” (Senator Bill Heffernan of Julia Gillard); a “crazy harpy sister” (Jordan Peterson); a “sadistic nurse in a mental hospital” (Boris Johnson, of Hillary Clinton); “very spindly legs and a brittle smile” (Alastair Campbell on Sue Lawley); or fat, calculating, ugly, crazy, a slob, “extremely unattractive” (Donald Trump, passim)? Further illustrating the surgical effectiveness of the PC inquisition, the most garrulous misogynist of the above is shortly expected on his state visit. We know Trump was sexually interested in both Princess Diana and Kate Middleton. But what of Her Majesty? With luck, the president will find her in good shape, like Brigitte Trogneux, and not, like some nasty women, a pig, a dog. Either way, it could be a climacteric event. • Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/18/argentina-forced-to-seek-imf-aid","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T19:54:55Z","webTitle":"Argentina forced to seek IMF aid over fears for economy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/18/argentina-forced-to-seek-imf-aid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/18/argentina-forced-to-seek-imf-aid","fields":{"headline":"Argentina forced to seek IMF aid over fears for economy","bodyText":"Argentina’s struggle this week to prevent a collapse in its currency and soaring interest rates from destabilising its ailing economy appeared to have ended in failure on Friday, leaving it to seek financial aid from the International Monetary Fund. The IMF, the lender of last resort to nation states, said the South American country had formally requested an “exceptional access standby arrangement” that would allow Argentina to pay its foreign bills while the government sought to prevent a repeat of the 2001 crisis. The IMF managing director, Christine Lagarde, said she had conveyed to the IMF board the Argentine authorities’ intention to request the facility, understood to be in the region of $30bn. In a message that Lagarde said showed the IMF stood beside Argentina in its time of trouble, she said the board would support the country to build and maintain social cohesion while it pursued its economic goals amid “significant financial volatility”. A drought that has severely damaged the country’s important agricultural sector was cited by analysts as one of the main causes of the recent troubles. Argentina is a major exporter of foodstuffs, especially to China and the US, and relies on its sales to generate foreign currency. On Thursday, the central bank stopped selling dollars to prop up the currency, which has fallen by 16% this month to hit a series of all-time lows. President Mauricio Macri declared the run on the peso to be over and sent an olive branch to the international money markets by vowing to speed up his deficit cutting effort. But now he has been forced to follow through on his statement on national television on 8 May saying he would seek IMF help. The request is a humiliating U-turn for a country that only last year was considered secure enough to sell a heavily oversubscribed 100-year bond to international investors. Macri is credited with instituting a series of reforms, though his main failure has been to attract funds kept abroad by wealthy Argentines and major domestic corporations Macri is seeking to avoid a repeat of the crisis that enveloped the country 17 years ago, when economic policies backed by the IMF brought Argentina to its knees. Five years later, after unemployment had soared and thousands of businesses had gone to the wall, the then-president Néstor Kirchner severed IMF ties, swearing the country would never again allow the IMF on its soil. In his 8 May speech, Macri said IMF assistance would help “avoid a crisis like the ones we have faced before … [it] will allow us to strengthen our programme of growth and development”. An exceptional access programme is an IMF financing programme worth anything above 145% of a country’s IMF quota per year or 435% over the life of the programme. An IMF quota is the value of a country’s share in the IMF financing system, tied to its impact in the world economy. Argentina’s government requested IMF financing earlier this month after a run on the peso currency."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/18/trump-sign-prison-reform-bill-congress","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T01:44:47Z","webTitle":"Trump promises to sign prison reform bill that could free thousands","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/18/trump-sign-prison-reform-bill-congress","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/18/trump-sign-prison-reform-bill-congress","fields":{"headline":"Trump promises to sign prison reform bill that could free thousands","bodyText":"Donald Trump on Friday promised to sign bipartisan prison reform legislation currently working its way through Congress that could free thousands of prisoners. “My administration strongly supports these efforts and I urge the House and Senate to get together … work out their differences [and] get a bill to my desk. I will sign it,” Trump said at an event the White House described as a prison reform summit. Trump called prison reform an issue “that unites people from across the spectrum”, as he thanked progressive commentator Van Jones and his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner for their involvement in pushing for the bill. The package, which would immediately release 4,000 federal prisoners according to some advocates, passed the House judiciary committee last week and is likely to be brought up for a vote early next week. The bill would also expand compassionate release, giving elderly and terminally ill inmates a path home, and invest tens of millions in re-entry programs. It would also end the shackling of women giving birth behind bars and provide them with necessary hygiene items at no charge. Trump did not address the majority of the bill’s provisions in his remarks, focusing mostly on the elements that deal with recidivism and re-entry. “Nobody wins when former prisoners fail to adjust to life outside or worse, end up back behind bars,” Trump said. “We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities.” Even if it passes in the House, the bill faces an uphill climb in the Senate, not because there isn’t support for it, but because key lawmakers feel the bill does not go far enough. Unlike prior attempts at federal reform legislation which also would have relaxed criminal sentencing, especially on drug crimes, the current bill only deals with policies that affect people who are already incarcerated. “For any criminal justice reform proposal to win approval in the Senate, it must include … sentencing reforms,” the Republican judiciary committee chairman, Chuck Grassley, said in a statement last week. Grassley was one of the chief animating forces behind a much more comprehensive bill that had been building momentum on both sides of the aisle in 2016 but that essentially disappeared from view after Trump’s surprise victory. But advocates like Jessica Jackson-Sloan, the policy director for #cut50, a criminal justice reform advocacy group, are hoping to get lawmakers to see the bill, called the First Step Act, as just that. “Am I disappointed we can’t solve all our problems in one bill, of course,” Jackson-Sloan told the Guardian. “But the fact that we are able to introduce a bipartisan piece of criminal justice legislation at this point in 2018 under these political circumstances is a huge thing that should be celebrated. It is progress and it is the first step.” Kushner, who was tasked with criminal justice reform early on in the administration, also championed the appeal of incremental reform. He noted that for years the two reform issues – sentencing and prison – have been bound together and nothing has been passed. “The reason why this thing was stuck is because of sentencing reform, so we as an administration said let’s focus on prison reform,” Kushner said. “Over time that might help the people who are arguing for sentencing reform.” Reform advocates like Andrea James are not convinced. James is the founder and executive director of the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women, and she said her organization could not support the bill as currently written because it did not assist a large enough segment of the federal prison population. “Anytime we make a decision to oppose anything that could potentially bring even one of our sisters out of confinement in the federal prison system, that decision is incredibly difficult,” James said. She worries that restrictions on which prisoners can receive the credits that qualify them for early release leave too many people out. Conspiracy, firearm possession during a drug crime, and even computer fraud, are some of the convictions that could disqualify an inmate. She also expressed doubt around execution, even for the provisions she supports, given that the justice department would be responsible for seeing it through. “We don’t trust that a Jeff Sessions justice department is going to actually implement what is being suggested in this bill,” James said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/18/prince-harry-meets-another-meghan-on-pre-wedding-walkabout","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T18:36:58Z","webTitle":"Prince Harry meets another Meghan on pre-wedding walkabout","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/prince-harry-meets-another-meghan-on-pre-wedding-walkabout","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/prince-harry-meets-another-meghan-on-pre-wedding-walkabout","fields":{"headline":"Prince Harry meets another Meghan on pre-wedding walkabout","bodyText":"Princes William and Harry greeted well-wishers who gathered in Windsor on a 10-minute walk-around on Friday, the eve of the latter’s wedding to Meghan Markle. Prince Harry told members of the crowd he was feeling “great”, ignoring questions about whether he had any nerves. Markle told reporters she was feeling “wonderful” as she and her mother, Doria Ragland, arrived to meet the Queen at Windsor Castle. During the pre-wedding walkabout, which echoed what happened before his brother William’s wedding, Prince Harry was greeted with shouts of “good luck” and thanked one woman who had travelled from Canada for coming so far. He waved to the public and chatted to his brother, before heading to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside. At one point, the groom-to-be was handed a small teddy bear wearing a red sweater, which he gave a quick hug, before moving on to speak to a young boy wearing a red, white and blue crown-style hat. Meghan O’Shea, aged seven, from Holyport, near Maidenhead, was among those who was chatting with the prince. He noted the “h” in the little girl’s name and she said he remarked: “Is that like the one I’m going to marry? There’s not very many Meghans with an ‘h’ around.” The young girl said of her namesake: “I think she’s very nice.” Prince Harry stopped to chat to two women who were wearing white baseball caps adorned with both the union flag and US flag, telling them: “I like the hats.” On the same afternoon, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh met Markle and her mother. Ragland was introduced to the monarch with Prince Harry and her daughter present, Buckingham Palace said. Markle spoke to reporters as she arrived with her mother at the luxury Cliveden House hotel, following their afternoon tea meeting with the Queen. Fans, many wearing red, white and blue, were camped outside the castle and have been singing loudly. It was announced earlier that the Prince of Wales would step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan down the aisle on Saturday. Kensington Palace said Charles would perform the duty of giving Markle away during the ceremony in St George’s Chapel in the castle – at the request of Markle, according to the palace. Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle, was forced to pull out of performing the duty after undergoing heart surgery just two days before the wedding. Charles previously performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, the then Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Prince Harry and Markle will spend their last night as an unmarried couple in separate luxury hotels, only meeting again at the altar. A large security operation saw police manning the barricades outside the castle, snipers on the roofs of high street buildings and sniffer dogs carrying out checks before Saturday’s ceremony."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/21/support-for-brexit-falls-sharply-in-northern-ireland","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T07:41:19Z","webTitle":"Support for Brexit falls sharply in Northern Ireland","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/support-for-brexit-falls-sharply-in-northern-ireland","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/support-for-brexit-falls-sharply-in-northern-ireland","fields":{"headline":"Support for Brexit falls sharply in Northern Ireland","bodyText":"Northern Ireland would vote overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU if a second referendum was held, a survey has found. The survey comes as the Brexit secretary, David Davis, made a second flying visit to Northern Ireland on Sunday, meeting businesses as part of his cabinet research into the “maximum facilitation” option for a post-Brexit customs system. In 2016, the region voted 56% to remain and 44% to leave, but support for leaving the bloc has fallen 13 points to 31%, undermining the Democratic Unionist party’s continued staunch backing for Brexit. “The proportion wanting to remain has risen since the 2016 referendum as more people have become aware of the possible costs and inconveniences of leaving the EU, as citizens and as employees or employers,” said Brendan O’Leary, a professor of political science at Queen’s University Belfast. The survey also showed significant levels of support for illegal or extreme protests against any north-south border checks, particularly among Catholics, who dominate the border communities. The survey commissioned by researchers at Queen’s and funded by the UK in a Changing Europe thinktank, found that two years after the referendum support for remain had risen to 69% and leave had dropped to 31%. Accompanying research interviews on attitudes in Northern Ireland found “a substantial and intense opposition” to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and to checks in airports and ports between Northern Ireland and Britain. In the most comprehensive piece of research on attitudes to Brexit to date, it also found that there were strong expectations that north-south and east-west checks would attract protests that could “quickly deteriorate into violence”. There was “substantial” support for Northern Ireland staying in the customs union and the single market, something to which the DUP is implacably opposed. Support among Protestants to remain in the customs union and single market was marginally higher at 62% compared with 61% of Catholics. The prospect of a no-deal exit and a hard border would play to Sinn Féin’s political aims of a united Ireland, with 53% of Catholics in favour if this was the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Opposition to border checks was higher among Catholic communities. More than half of Catholics (55%) and 70% of those who support Sinn Féin said customs checks were “almost impossible to accept” while one in five Catholics, and one in three Catholics who voted for Sinn Féin, found camera-based technology “almost impossible to accept”. Both Catholics and Protestants voiced concern in the research over north-south border checks. “I think the ceasefire would go,” said one Protestant, a leave supporter aged 45-59. “I could see it going the way it was before, with roads being closed off in various places because they can’t properly police it,” said a Protestant voter aged over 60 who supports remain. “Protests would start peaceful and then if they don’t get anywhere they would just escalate it,” said a young Catholic remain voter. Some were relaxed about cameras, saying “CCTV is everywhere in Northern Ireland”, but in in-depth discussion groups there was a “prevailing view that they would be vandalised”. There was also a high level of support for peaceful protests against east-west checks and some significant support for illegal protests, with 9% of Protestants and 14% of Catholics supporting protests up to the level of roadblocks to stop traffic. “What may surprise people is the extent to which Catholics oppose all borders within these islands,” said John Garry, a professor at Queen’s. The Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said: “The surge of people in Northern Ireland who would now vote to remain in the EU also provides yet more evidence that there must be a vote on the final deal that provides the option of an exit from Brexit – particularly if that deal is a perilous one for Ireland.” • This article was amended on 21 May 2018. An earlier version said that 51% of Catholics supported remaining in the customs union and single market. The survey found that figure to be 61%."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"football/2018/may/19/gareth-southgate-england-players-world-cup-2018","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T21:29:38Z","webTitle":"England youngsters in ‘matches that matter’ have Southgate looking up | Jacob Steinberg","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/19/gareth-southgate-england-players-world-cup-2018","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/19/gareth-southgate-england-players-world-cup-2018","fields":{"headline":"England youngsters in ‘matches that matter’ have Southgate looking up","bodyText":"Sometimes managers pepper their answers with cliches just to get to the end of a press conference. Yet Gareth Southgate is not being flippant when he responds to a question about the Champions League final by emphasising how Liverpool will be representing England when they face Real Madrid in Kiev on Saturday. With the World Cup looming large, England’s manager makes no attempt to play down the significance of Liverpool’s progress under Jürgen Klopp. “It is big,” Southgate says. “We want our players in those big matches. The experience for the likes of Jordan Henderson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Adam Lallana over the last few months of playing in those matches that matter – and it was the same for the Spurs boys in their games and the Man City boys – you want them in that environment and to experience winning things.” While a knee injury has ruled Oxlade-Chamberlain out of this summer’s tournament and Lallana has had to settle for a place on the standby list after enduring almost an entire season in the treatment room, Alexander-Arnold and Henderson are part of England’s 23-man squad and Southgate makes it clear that his team will benefit from having players taking part in club football’s showpiece occasion. “Then they know what’s needed,” he says. “They know that hurdles can be overcome and they gain belief from those performances. So I think it’s a great thing for English football that Liverpool are representing England in the final. I know that won’t be seen universally by all supporters. But why would we want Real Madrid to win? I can’t see the logic in that.” It can be fashionable to belittle English players but Southgate believes that Liverpool’s success in Europe is something that should make the country feel optimistic about the future. “When I came here to take the under-21s, it was for that purpose,” he says. “I believed young English players could play in that style. What was stopping them from being as good as players around the world? We’re seeing that with some of our youngsters playing abroad and Manchester City having a core of four English players most weeks in their team. “Manchester United have an English core. Liverpool have the same. And they’re working with top European coaches. There’s an assumption that European coaches will come here and pick foreign players. But Mauricio Pochettino has gone with an English core. That’s a great message for our players. They’re performing in one of the most competitive leagues in the world and doing really well.” It is worth listening to Southgate. For all his inexperience at the highest level of management, he is an intelligent man who played in one of England’s finest teams and he gave a lot of thought about how to structure his squad announcement. Some of his predecessors preferred to select 30 players before gradually trimming the numbers. Southgate, however, was wary of making his youthful team unnecessarily anxious. Lewis Cook, Tom Heaton, Lallana, Jake Livermore and James Tarkowski have been given time to adjust to being named as standbys. “We could have picked 30 or how we’ve done it,” Southgate says. “My experience of this way was that it’s cleaner. The guys on standby have a clear understanding of their role. They have some time to get over the disappointment but they will play a crucial part in what we’re doing over the next few weeks and there’s always an opportunity they may be with us beyond that, which is what happened with Trevor Sinclair in 2002.” The then West Ham winger played four matches in that year’s World Cup, having initially flown home from Japan after not making the 23, before injuries propelled him into the squad and then the team. “We had a really interesting discussion with Stuart Lancaster [the England coach at the 2015 Rugby World Cup] on this. They have to have a bigger squad in rugby because of the bigger numbers and the number of injuries they get, plus they’re together for eight or 10 weeks. “But he made the observation that there’s a difference between a selection and a performance camp and when there’s an uncertainty between – ‘Am I in or am I not in?’ – then it becomes a selection camp and you don’t only have the five that are likely to be out but another five who think it might be them. “Of the group of 28, you could have 10 or more working with uncertainty. You can be less specific on positions and tactical work. Now we know where players are going to be in training sessions. The players can have less tension around what’s coming and can start to bond a bit tighter.” Southgate has spoken about a tight-knit squad. But while he believes that the camp will not be riddled with cliques, the competition for places up front is fierce. Dele Alli, who has had another fine season, was a substitute in the recent friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy, with Jesse Lingard and Raheem Sterling preferred in the deep-lying attacking roles. Yet Southgate was impressed that Alli responded by scoring twice in Tottenham’s 3-1 win against Chelsea a week later and he made the point that Michael Owen and David Beckham were left out of England’s opening game at the 1998 World Cup. Both went on to make an impact at the tournament. “You perform in a World Cup and that announces you to the world,” Southgate says. “That’s the beauty of playing in an England shirt. “Dele is already an outstanding player and he’s going to get better because of his age and desire. We also have some exciting players coming around. It shouldn’t be that anybody is a guaranteed starter. What gets the best out of you? It’s the games you play but it’s also the competition in training.” It is lucky that Southgate has Steve Holland, the former Chelsea coach, as his number two. “Steve Holland is a legend. He’s won the Champions League, the Europa League, the league, the FA Cup,” Southgate says. “I think the bastard’s won the League Cup as well. With his coaching background in developing young players right through to working with some of best managers in the world, he is the most experienced English coach in the country. He will challenge my thinking and speak his mind. We have complete trust in each other. It’s a critical relationship. Terry Venables had that with Don Howe. He would challenge Terry, who would take it on board.” Between them Southgate and Holland already have an idea of their starting XI to face Tunisia in Volgograd on 18 June. “But also there is opportunity for people to play into that thinking,” Southgate says. “We know tomorrow what we would select. But that’s always a slightly movable feast.

His failure on the age of consent proves it","bodyText":"On 16 May, France’s parliament passed an eagerly awaited bill meant to tackle sexual and gender-based violence. Vaunted by President Macron as a political victory and a step towards “making women feel safer on the streets”, the sexual violence bill has however been slammed by feminist organisations and children’s protection groups. The reason? Article 2 of the new bill, which, in cases where coercion by an adult can’t be proved, classifies sex between an adult and a minor as sexual assault instead of rape. In doing so, the new law falls short of establishing a minimum age of sexual consent, breaking a promise Macron made last November. Not without fanfare, Macron announced gender equality would be the “national cause” of his five-year term in late 2017, and his campaign promises included the creation of a ministry dedicated to women’s rights. Once elected, the president urged women to stand in local elections under his party’s banner, raising the proportion of female elected representatives in his party from 27% to just under 40%. After the election, Macron benefited from a “Justin Trudeau effect” when the international press hailed him as a hero of equality for forming a gender-balanced cabinet. For many French women, however, the reality is that Macron’s government is failing on women’s rights. Take the European directive on extended parental leave, which would have given employees the right to four months of parental leave paid at 50% of the parent’s salary. Macron refused to back it, describing it to the European parliament as a “good idea” that was, however, “very expensive” and “could be unmanageable”. Meanwhile, the promised ministry for gender equality was also quickly shelved. Instead, Marlène Schiappa was appointed secretary of state in charge of equality between women and men, a cabinet post with a far smaller budget than a fully fledged ministry. Another campaign pledge – that employers who do not implement gender parity could be “named and shamed” – stopped at two companies. Schiappa herself has proved controversial. A former advertising executive who made a name for herself writing self-help books for working mothers, Macron’s youngest minister recently described her compatriots as a “romantic people” who, for “quasi-Freudian” reasons, need to be “governed by a couple”. A previous comparison between Brigitte Macron and Simone de Beauvoir was met with scepticism. In this context, the bill was Macron’s chance to counter his critics and build on the momentum against sexual harassment generated by the #MeToo movement. It had, after all, found strong support in France, where thousands of women rallied under the hashtag #Balancetonporc (“Expose your pig”). Two recent cases had also brought the consent cause to international prominence. In a decision that shocked many, French prosecutors refused to charge two men with rape after they had sex with 11-year-old girls. In the resulting scandal, a poll showed that 69% of French voters support the establishment of an age of consent. Instead we have a new bill that could, feminist groups have convincingly argued, encourage prosecutors to classify cases of child abuse as sexual assaults instead of rape. Admittedly, the bill has taken some steps towards addressing harassment. It allows for on-the-spot fines of up to €750 for catcalling in public, and extends the limitation for child sexual abuse victims to make a claim from 20 to 30 years from them reaching the age of 18. Nevertheless the bill’s failure to establish a new age of consent has dominated the national conversation. An open letter to the president calling for the repeal of article 2 gathered the signatures of more than 200 French celebrities. Feminist Clémentine Autain summed up the mood for many, suggesting that the “mountain” that the #MeToo movement stands for has given birth to a “mouse” in the shape of the sexual violence bill. As Macron’s record-low popularity and the recent waves of protests in France have shown, the president could do with a political boost. Instead, his gender protection policies have so far failed to live up to his liberal promises. • Cécile Guerin is a freelance journalist based in London"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"healthcare-network/2018/may/24/addiction-took-hold-uk-cost-nhs-millions","type":"article","sectionId":"healthcare-network","sectionName":"Healthcare Professionals Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T09:00:14Z","webTitle":"How addiction took hold of the UK – and cost the NHS millions","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/24/addiction-took-hold-uk-cost-nhs-millions","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/healthcare-network/2018/may/24/addiction-took-hold-uk-cost-nhs-millions","fields":{"headline":"How addiction took hold of the UK – and cost the NHS millions","bodyText":"In 1948, the treatment of addiction was not a pressing issue for the fledgling NHS. Even in the 1970s, it was confined mainly to the treatment of a relatively small number of heroin addicts. But in the years that followed, a combination of social change and increased availability of drugs and alcohol meant that treatment became a key strand of the NHS’s work. The latest report by the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System reveals that in 2016-17 some 279,793 people were in contact with drug and alcohol services in England. Just over half were opiate users. It is an expensive business: in 2014 the former National Treatment Agency (NTA) estimated the cost to the NHS of treating drug misuse at around £500m a year. The total cost of alcohol misuse to the NHS in England has been estimated to be as much as £3.5bn a year. However, according to Public Health England, the NTA’s successor agency, there’s a social return of £3 for a every £1 spent on alcohol treatment, and a return of £4 for every £1 spent on drug treatment. About 5,000 people in England were thought to be using heroin in 1975. But numbers soared in the 1980s, in part in line with rising unemployment following the deindustrialisation of the north and midlands, explains Roger Howard, former chief executive of the UK Drug Policy Commission. This coincided with a flourishing supply of heroin from Afghanistan via Iran, after the Iranian revolution. “What you get then is vast areas of the country where a huge male population is kicking its heels,” Howard says. “You’ve got a demand and it’s easily maintained by supply.” Recreational drug use also increased, and the same decade saw the arrival of HIV/Aids and its link to injecting drug users. This prompted investment through the NHS in harm-reduction services such as needle exchange schemes, as well as inpatient treatment alongside intervention schemes run by a vibrant voluntary sector. Much more funding came from the Labour government after 1997, as ministers realised that investment in treatment reaped rewards through reduced crime levels. Howard describes the early 2000s as the “glory years”, with Britain regarded globally as a leader in preventive services. Since 2010, however, the picture has changed again. Under the coalition and Conservative governments, there has been a shift towards abstinence-based treatment rather than prescribed substitutes, such as methadone. Competitive tendering has led to many more services being delivered by the voluntary sector than by the NHS. And, of course, austerity has hit hard. Collective Voice, an umbrella group of UK addiction charities, says spending on drug and alcohol services has been cut by around a quarter since 2013. Meanwhile the alcohol-related burden on England’s hospitals is increasing: a report by the Nuffield Trust health thinktank has suggested that A&amp;E attendance rates due to likely alcohol poisoning doubled between 2009 and 2014, while inpatient admissions linked to alcohol increased by almost two-thirds between 2006 and 2014. As many as one in three GP visits could be related to alcohol, the 2015 report estimated. “Action to reduce harmful alcohol use requires a collaborative effort, involving GPs, community pharmacists, the police, education and licensing authorities,” it concluded.

However, a scheme in Bradford is showing that you can stop such out-of-area placements altogether by strengthening community-based care and support. “You can live in Lancashire and have to go to Cornwall for a hospital bed,” says Chris Dixon, clinical manager of the First Response crisis scheme. “It’s hugely detrimental to people’s mental health because it’s harder to recover when you are hundreds of miles from home and don’t have family and friends around you.” First Response was set up by Bradford district care NHS trust three years ago as a 24-hour crisis service offering fast assessment and support for anyone calling its telephone helpline. It gets an average of 6,000 calls a month, fielded by a professional team whose focus is on enabling people to live independently wherever possible. Some people who use the service just want to talk, but others are in such distress that they require face-to-face assessment and intervention by the intensive home treatment team, which can visit three or four times a day. Rather than turning up in A&amp;E or spending the night in a cell under police section 136 powers to detain them in a place of safety, most people get help tailored to their actual needs. “Since we started First Response we haven’t had any out-of-area placements and that saved us £1.8m in the first year,” says Grainne Eloi, interim head of mental health services at the trust. “We’ve also made big strides in our relationships with the police. They’ve got a direct line to First Response and four of our nurses have trained as special constables, working alongside the police to avoid using section 136. It has helped the police take a more sympathetic approach.” Also involved are the local authority and the voluntary sector, which offers three “safer spaces” for adults and young people in emotional distress. Christina Wilson is a peer support worker at one of them, Haven at the Cellar Trust in Shipley, and as a former inpatient herself she understands what a mental health crisis can be like. “One woman came to me after being hospitalised and still feeling incredibly fragile and vulnerable,” Wilson recalls. “She’d tried to kill herself but had been unable to communicate with family and friends about it afterwards because they found it too painful. When I explained that I had had similar feelings, she burst into tears and it opened the way for her to talk about what she was experiencing. It made her feel more hopeful and less alone.” Haven sees itself as an alternative to A&amp;E, which is where Wilson’s client would probably have gone previously. A&amp;E is chaotic, busy and clinical, she says, and no place for a mental health crisis. “We’ve got sofas, calming pictures and a mindfulness room – it’s a completely different experience.” In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

But history records that at least 45 men drawn from countries all over the world were killed on 30 May 1937 when their ship, the Ciudad de Barcelona, was torpedoed off the coast of Catalonia by a submarine. The men were among 300 International Brigadistas heading to Spain to fight for the Republican cause against Spain’s fascist-led Nationalist forces. Fishermen living near the coastal town of Malgrat de Mar in Barcelona province helped save more than 120 men, but scores were trapped below as the ship went down. Witness accounts say the brigadistas sang the Internationale as they sank. At least 23 of the survivors were later killed in the civil war. “It was late afternoon,” recalled Alun Menai Williams, a Welshman who wrote a book about his experiences, From the Rhondda to the Ebro. “I was leaning on the ship’s rail taking in my first view of Spain and its shoreline, some one and a half miles in the distance, when there came one hell of an almighty bang. The ship shook, tried to get airborne, before settling down at a crazy angle.” “It was a pretty dirty business,” another survivor, an American named Jack Freeman, said. “Some fellows were killed while they were asleep, some were trapped below decks.” Memory of the tragedy, as with many other stories from the Spanish civil war, was suppressed under General Franco. But now a British-born sculptor based in Catalonia is to create a lasting memorial to the brigadistas and the rescuers. When finished, Solidarity Park will consist of 60, half-metre tall sculpted figures, carved in local limestone. The figures, representing the brigadistas, will be portrayed singing aboard an abstract interpretation of a ship which has seating designed as waves and will be situated on top of a stone patio map of the world. Its creator, Robert MacDonald, originally from Rugby in Warwickshire, said the sculpted figures will be identical in form, representing “the unity of the struggle of the Brigadiers, but each will have individual carved features thus expressing the diversity of us all”. The project, which MacDonald hopes will be completed by the end of May next year, to mark the 82nd anniversary of the sinking, will be a collaborative effort involving students, historians, local people and the families and friends of the brigadistas. Public workshops will encourage people to help carve the sculpture which will be displayed in a small park on the beach at Malgrat de Mar. So far more than €13,500 has been raised via a crowdfunding campaign towards the estimated €20,000 costs of the project. “This is a memorial and a project for everybody,” MacDonald said. “That’s why I don’t want to go into my workshop, tap away and present something. I want people to say ‘I helped make that, that’s my history.’ “Participation is really important. Art in a sense is slightly in jail in society. It’s behind locked doors. For me community art isn’t like pottery class on Tuesday night. It’s about people creating something that has political and cultural significance. I don’t think art exists like this in the true sense these days.” MacDonald said the project was about using art to expose the truth. “This project is also about uncovering the history and the more noise we make, the more we find out.” He had decided on the project after reading about his namesake who died when the ship went down. “It blew me away. Here’s this guy, Rob Macdonald, who was 23 years old, who didn’t get to the Spanish civil war, who put his life on the line. He had pretty much the same politics as me. One of the journeys for me with this project was finding his family and learning a little bit about him. He’s an individual I have a really powerful connection with.” MacDonald hopes the work will encourage people to think about the treatment of foreigners, immigrants and refugees at a time when tensions appeared to be rising. It’s a story that is relevant to many situations in the world at the present time. “For me as an artist, our job is to say things in a different way to help people to actually see it,” he said. When asked if there was a shortage of memorials to the civil war in Spain, MacDonald said: “I would say there’s a shortage of understanding of what took place. That’s why I’m opening up the memorial process. If it’s going to be a memory of the people then people should do it. How do you think Easter Island was done? The whole community was involved.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-north-korea-no-art-as-trump-seeks-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T16:18:11Z","webTitle":"The Guardian view on North Korea: no art as Trump seeks deal | Editorial","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-north-korea-no-art-as-trump-seeks-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-north-korea-no-art-as-trump-seeks-deal","fields":{"headline":"The Guardian view on North Korea: no art as Trump seeks deal","bodyText":"It is not clear whether Donald Trump set out to threaten Kim Jong-un with Muammar Gaddafi’s fate. It is not even certain that he realises he did so. In his rambling remarks on Thursday he appeared to confuse Libya and Syria. He took his national security adviser John Bolton’s remarks on the “Libya model” to refer to the military intervention of 2011, rather than the negotiated removal of its nuclear programme in 2003. It is even possible that he intended to reassure: “That model would take place if we don’t make a deal, most likely. But if we make a deal, I think Kim Jong-un is going to be very, very happy,” he said. So making sense of this administration’s pinball trajectory towards next month’s possible summit is a fool’s errand. Yet that is what Pyongyang, and the rest of us, must do. North Korea had already warned that it might not attend, but in calibrated terms, taking aim at Mr Bolton for pushing the Libya model and insisting on “abandoning nuclear weapons first, compensating afterwards”. Intentionally or not, Mr Trump doubled down by spelling out the prospect of regime change and “total decimation” if no deal is reached. This is precisely why the North wants its WMDs: leaders without them are more easily removed. The advance of Mr Bolton and Mike Pompeo, and then the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, have made it still less likely that the North can either achieve or trust a security guarantee. Libya is a poor comparison: its nuclear programme was barely at base camp; North Korea’s is fast closing in on the peak. Yet Mr Bolton has promoted it keenly. Perhaps he hoped to provoke Pyongyang to scuttle any prospect of an agreement, fearful that Mr Trump’s eagerness for applause might otherwise lead him to sign up to pretty much anything. Perhaps he was seeking to lower Mr Trump’s expectations, to avoid rage when failure ensued. The North may filter out the bluster and focus on other moves, such as the recent decision to scrap US-South Korean training exercises involving B-52 bombers. But the Nobel peace prize remains a long way off. Ignorance about North Korea and relief that Mr Trump was talking about talks, instead of talking about war, has made many too ready to give credence to White House triumphalism. The most obvious problem is the gulf over what constitutes denuclearisation. Clue: Mr Kim does not mean handing it all over and hoping for the best. The danger is that this administration has convinced itself that maximum pressure and the threat of annihilation works, and will keep working. The truth is that there could be no summit, or that one could go badly awry. The US is unlikely to achieve the same buy-in from Beijing again – particularly given the wild vacillations in bilateral relations. What then? At best, these diplomatic manoeuvres may have made the space for a less seismic but still significant inter-Korean deal (albeit one hard to sustain in the Trump era). At worst, Mr Trump’s words have left no space between peace and war."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/23/nevada-brothels-shut-down-old-west-campaign-petition","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T08:00:17Z","webTitle":"'This is a moral issue': the campaign to shut down Nevada's old west brothels","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/nevada-brothels-shut-down-old-west-campaign-petition","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/23/nevada-brothels-shut-down-old-west-campaign-petition","fields":{"headline":"'This is a moral issue': the campaign to shut down Nevada's old west brothels","bodyText":"In Pahrump, Nevada – a desert enclave famous for its “live and let live” spirit – you can openly carry a gun, race sports cars, buy marijuana, own lions, gamble and purchase sex. But there’s a movement under way to rein in the frontier town’s freedom-loving ways. Activists, lawyers and Christian pastors are leading a petition drive to ban brothels in two Nevada counties, Nye and Lyon, and if successful the potential ballot initiatives would close nearly half the state’s bordellos. A relic of the old west, the brothel industry dates back to the Silver State’s origin as a mining territory and is featured often in movies and television shows, making the “cathouses” a fundamental part of Nevada’s iconoclastic image. State leaders like the former US senator Harry Reid have long suggested that counties ban prostitution, which they say hurts Nevada’s ability to attract mainstream industries. (Sex work is already illegal in the counties home to Las Vegas and Reno.) But licensed brothels put towns like Pahrump on the map and were quietly tolerated until now. The latest prohibition effort aims to let the public decide the cathouses’ fate and is seen by both sides as a fight for the very soul of the west. On a road between the Heritage Bible church and two brothels, Sheri’s Ranch and Chicken Ranch, a sign reminds drivers: “The wages of sin is death.” “This is strictly, from this standpoint right here, a moral issue,” Pastor Budd Hawk, one of the campaign’s chief advocates, told his congregation at the Pahrump church during a recent Sunday sermon. “I’m not going to get into the politics of it.” But Madam Sonja, a manager and courtesan at the Love Ranch, said outlawing brothels would displace women, leading some to ply their trade illegally in places like Las Vegas, where street prostitutes and escorts are vulnerable to trafficking, rape and abuse by pimps. In legal brothels, she pointed out, women had a freedom to set their own schedules and prices in a more safe, controlled environment that included security cameras, “panic buttons”, and the ability to vet clients who booked through the internet. The University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociology professor Barb Brents echoed that point. “The individuals with fewer resources are going to hit the streets. You still got to pay for rent, you still got to pay for food … It’s sad to see the Nevada brothels potentially closing right when the #MeToo movement has women standing up to say: ‘I have the right to work without being harassed no matter what job I do.’” More than anything, women in the Love Ranch fretted over the potential loss of income. “This is a way for a single mom to make as much or more money than a man might make to be able to support a household,” Madam Sonja said. “We have the right to use our bodies to make a living. To have somebody because of a particular dogma that they’ve bought into decide for me what it is about myself that I can use or not use is ridiculous.” Nevada’s brothel industry is already shrinking due in part to competition from escort services marketing through the internet. In the 1980s, 35 cathouses played host to miners, truckers, local residents and tourists alike. Now, just 18 remain, 12 of which are owned by the “Trump of Pahrump”– the reality television star and state assembly candidate Dennis Hof. “This is totally politically driven,” said Hof, wearing a gun on his waist and speaking from the parlor of his Love Ranch brothel, adding: “This is the Mormon mafia in the political establishment trying to throw me off my game while I’m running for office.” He described a recent Saturday night in which a building inspector came and shut the business down at 2am because it allegedly wasn’t up to code. A meeting to restore his license was two weeks away at the time. “I’m the anti-establishment guy, and they can’t buy me, so they want to ruin me,” he said. The Citizens Against Brothels in Nye County campaign and No Little Girl, the parallel effort in Lyon, are only about halfway toward their signature goals, with the deadline to put the brothel bans on November ballots just weeks away, on 15 June. The Pahrump Valley Times has reported that its readers “overwhelmingly slammed the proposal” on social media. But Salli Kerr, the Nye group’s spokesperson, said it would canvas door-to-door. Under the bright desert sun, paved roads disappear on the horizon, adding a mirage-like atmosphere to their goal. “This is about the victimization of women,” said Kerr, who runs a battered women’s outreach center in Pahrump. She quoted a study that said the majority of sex workers were recovering from childhood abuse. “[Prostitutes] are basing these choices on previous experiences of trauma. That trauma literally affects the physiological responses of the brain. It’s difficult to say if she made her own choice, when what we did was allow victimization early in life to impact choices that she made later.” Conceding that for some women it would be difficult go from six-figure earnings to minimum wage at a hamburger restaurant, Hawk, the pastor, admitted that “from a strictly economical standpoint, [prostitution] makes sense. But from a human and moral standpoint of course it makes none ... I trust 100% in the lord. Everything that I have is a blessing from God. I don’t worry about whether the bills are going to be paid at the end of the month because I know they will.” There were 44 churches in Pahrump, not including Mormon and Catholic churches, Hawk said, implying that its population of 40,000 was strongly devout. But there are also those casinos, 24-hour gaming taverns and marijuana dispensaries. “They want to shove everyone into a Judeo-Christian mold and we don’t all fit,” said Madam Sonja, who is a former schoolteacher and reiki master in addition to being a porn star courtesan. “I have a finely tuned sense of morality. It just doesn’t fit into a church.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/25/country-diary-cowslips-shakespeare-fairy-favours-coombs-dale-derbyshire","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T04:30:37Z","webTitle":"Country diary: Shakespeare called these delicate touches 'fairy favours'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/25/country-diary-cowslips-shakespeare-fairy-favours-coombs-dale-derbyshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/25/country-diary-cowslips-shakespeare-fairy-favours-coombs-dale-derbyshire","fields":{"headline":"Country diary: Shakespeare called these delicate touches 'fairy favours'","bodyText":"How to explain such intensity of colour? Derbyshire’s dales were rich with it, banks of red campion set against pale blue drifts of forget-me-nots at a scale I don’t remember ever seeing before; butterburs hazy with insects, patches of paper-white stitchwort. Perhaps the spring, so long coiled, and the run of fine weather that greeted its late arrival had squeezed more vibrancy than usual into these last few days. Looking down into Coombs Dale it was the same story. The night had been cold, and long after dawn the sun was still stripping the last shreds of mist from the valley. On the far side, where the hawthorn thinned near the crest of the slope, banks of bluebells lingered on against patches of yellow gorse. The real treasures were closer, the grass at my feet peppered all around with clumps of early purple orchids, still with their first fresh scent, even now, deep into May. Coombs Dale has a strange energy, especially towards its top at Longstone Edge, where grazing and quarrying have left the landscape wearied and bare. Yet the cowslips are thriving on patches of restored land that are fenced off from the ravenous sheep. Above me was a broad sweep of them, lemon yellow at a distance, like a cheerful children’s hymn, more complex up close, the inside of the flowers spotted orange. Shakespeare, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, called these delicate touches “fairy favours”, the secret of the flower’s scent. Best of all were the small patches of cuckooflower (Cardamine pratensis), a name it shares, in some districts, with campion and stitchwort. It may be common, but it has a simple delicacy, four white flowers deepening to pink, the thin stem and spare flourish of its leaves. It’s also widely known as lady’s smock, which would have earned a knowing wink from Shakespeare’s audience, since “smock” means a woman in the way “skirt” does, and who knew what might happen in the warm spring sunshine after the dark days of winter. Further south it flowers long before the cuckoo’s return, but here it seems about right, though there was no cuckoo calling, just a stopping of the breeze and the rich song of a blackbird to fill the sudden quiet. • The main picture on top of this article was changed later in the day on 25 May 2018."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/20/ernest-hemingway-letters-reveal-torment-teenager-adriana-ivancich","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T23:05:40Z","webTitle":"Poignant letters reveal Hemingway’s torment over young muse","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/20/ernest-hemingway-letters-reveal-torment-teenager-adriana-ivancich","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/20/ernest-hemingway-letters-reveal-torment-teenager-adriana-ivancich","fields":{"headline":"Poignant letters reveal Hemingway’s torment over young muse","bodyText":"Previously unpublished letters are to shed light on the passionate relationship between Ernest Hemingway and an Italian teenager 30 years his junior. Hemingway was married when he met Adriana Ivancich but said he felt as if “lightning had struck”, and a friendship developed between them over eight years. A new book by the Italian author Andrea di Robilant, Autumn in Venice: Ernest Hemingway and His Last Muse, explores their friendship. Di Robilant makes public for the first time a dramatic letter in which Ivancich writes to him about her torment in having to cut off all ties. In a letter dated April 1956, she told Hemingway that the man she hoped to marry “doesn’t want me to write to you any more and he doesn’t want you to write to me”. She underlined those words, adding: “[That has] made me suffer … and always will make me feel sad … I tried everything (you know how much I love you …). No tears, no words could make his mind change … I never thought that there could be a goodbye between you and me.” There has been extensive speculation about whether Hemingway and Ivancich, who first met in 1948, were lovers. Di Robilant believes that, far from being a passing infatuation with a much younger woman, the friendship played a crucial role in regenerating Hemingway’s creative powers. “She brought joy to his life, inspired him,” he writes, “leading to a remarkable literary flowering in the late season of his life.” Hemingway went on to write masterpieces such as The Old Man and the Sea, for which he won the Pulitzer prize. In another previously unpublished letter, Hemingway wrote to Ivancich: “When I am away from you I do not give a damn, really, about anything … I miss you very much. Sometimes it is so bad that I cannot stand it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/may/26/should-have-saved-instead-of-going-on-sailing-holidays","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T05:30:47Z","webTitle":"'I've been stupid.

I should have saved instead of going on holidays'","bodyText":"I am 56 years old and I recently took out a £5,000 loan and moved to Prague, to take up a position as a wealth manager for high net worth clients. Before that, I was working as a cab driver in Gateshead in Tyne and Wear. I was working between 65 and 70 hours a week, sometimes more. My salary now is commission-based. I haven’t earned any commission yet, but I am hoping it will enable me to achieve my dream of building up a £300,000 pension pot in the next 10 years. I’ve been stupid in my life and not saved like I should have. I was always waiting for a big payday. I got a shock at 55 when I realised that, even though I had worked all my life, I had less than £4,000 saved up in pensions – I had no other savings. As a cab driver, I would start work every day at 5am. I often worked 12-hour days, seven days a week. I would contribute £1,000 gross into my pension each month, plus whatever I could afford at the end of the tax year. In my spare time, I would vlog about what I have learned about money on a website I set up called Stupidisthenorm. It was thanks to my vlog that I was offered my current position as a wealth manager. At the moment, I have got £13,000 in my pension. If I achieve my £300,000 target, my plan is to withdraw £80,000 to £100,000 as a lump sum and buy a 50-foot yacht. I know I may have to pay tax on such a large withdrawal but it will be worth it. The other £200,000 I will use to live on while I sail around the Med with my wife. It will be easy to live frugally on a yacht that’s at sea – there is no council tax or mooring fees to pay. When I was young, I never thought about enjoying my retirement. My life stretched before me and I thought I was eternal. I wanted to look good, buy things, feel rich. I worked hard but I lived beyond my means and got into credit card debt to the tune of £10,000. My family and I are having to make sacrifices now because of the way I behaved then. I only had three days off last year and Christmas Day was one of them. I haven’t seen my wife or my children for several months and I miss them. I would do things differently if I had my time again. I would save my money right from the get-go instead of going on yachting holidays and buying a BMW 5-Series on credit. If I had invested the money I spent on the finance and insurance for that car, I reckon I would have more than £300,000 saved up by now. Instead, I have £9,000 of debt and have to spend £211 on loan repayments each month. I also contribute £200 a week towards my UK household bills, including my mortgage, and spend £50 a month on my phone. Other than that, I spend very little on myself nowadays. I buy myself a cup of coffee in the mornings and I always get the Financial Times on Sundays. I like doing the crossword. I don’t spend frivolously. I will go to an Irish pub at the weekend for a few beers – a pint in Prague costs as little as £1 – but I travel to my appointments with high net worth Prague nationals by metro and do my weekly grocery shop at Lidl for £12. I have stopped consuming now. One of the lessons I have learned is not to spend more than I’ve got. I just wish I had learned it when I was younger.

As a teenager, his school’s physics lab was inaccessible so he had to travel to a neighbouring college for physics lessons. In his first full-time job, his boss used to pat him on the head when she stood next to his wheelchair. Now 45, and almost a year into his role as chief executive of Disability Rights UK, Mallick’s experience of racial and disability discrimination is shaping the charity’s future. “I want to change the experience of disabled people younger than me, so they don’t experience the same barriers,” he says. “I want to make sure that we are as loud a voice for disabled people from our country as possible.” Mallick is contacting local black and minority ethnic, faith-based and youth groups for disabled people in order to understand issues “from the grassroots”. In the coming months, he will appoint additional ambassadors reflecting “a diverse range of people”. Disability Rights UK, the UK’s largest user-led organisation for disabled people, has faced criticism for being closer to the government than to the 13.9 million people with disabilities whose rights it seeks to champion. This stems partly from Mallick’s predecessor, Liz Sayce, who led a controversial government review into disability employment, resulting in the closure of sheltered factories. Mallick says he received social media messages accusing him of “leaving the movement” when he was appointed, But he believes that a dialogue with authority does not preclude links with the grassroots. He says he often disagrees with the ideology of organisations he talks to, but his approach is “I need to work with you to convince you to make changes to benefit local disabled people”. With activists, his message is “our end goal is the same – rights and equality for all disabled people”. That’s why DRUK is part of a charity coalition to highlight “the deteriorating quality of life” among disabled people that was exposed by a United Nations’ damning inquiry last year into the UK government’s failure to fulfil its commitments to disability rights. It found that the government was failing to uphold disabled people’s rights across a range of areas from work to housing, social security and health. A recent NHS review into the deaths of people with learning disabilities found that poor care had contributed to the deaths of 13 people. Mallick says the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England are “uninterested in tackling the systemic discrimination that learning-disabled people face”. Mallick developed polio as a child in Karachi, Pakistan. The family moved to the UK with his father’s job in banking. His special school – where he was racially abused by a classmate – lacked “academic drive”, so he moved to mainstream education. At secondary school, the labs and PE facilities were inaccessible but Mallick says he was too young to challenge the status quo. After A-levels, he spent a fruitless year visiting recruitment agencies for office-based roles. At a couple of agencies his wheelchair was too wide for the entrance so staff lifted him inside. He never got an interview, despite decent grades. Through a friend, he finally got a job as a development officer at Hounslow council in west London. (This is where his patronising boss patted his head and he was automatically handed any projects about disability.) Motivated by leaving the council rather than working in disability issues, he did a secondment at a local disability charity and never looked back. Given his own experiences, he is sceptical about the government’s plan to get a million more disabled people into work by 2027. “It’s good to have that target, but where’s the mechanism to make that happen? It’s all about sanctioning disabled people, but there’s no evidence to say if you reduce someone’s income they will naturally think ‘I need to get a job’,” he says. Mallick believes that the barriers to getting more disabled people into jobs “lie not with the person, but the world around them that prevents them from working”. But a report released today by the charity Scope and the National Centre for Social Research, shows the prevalence of outdated public attitudes towards disabled people: with 75% of 4,000 respondents questioned thinking that disabled people need care for some or most of the time. What is needed to change perceptions, he believes, is “good, inclusive education … If disabled people are part of society and have support to enable them to contribute to society, then over time this starts to change perceptions.” Mallick says the government should have an overarching policy for addressing disabled people’s needs: “There’s no joined-up thinking between departments,” he points outs. For him the priority is always about “protecting and securing the rights of people with disabilities”. Curriculum vitae Age: 45. Lives: North London. Family: Married.

The president was echoed on television by the former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, his lawyer, who said Trump’s accusations “may turn out to be closer to the truth than people thought”. “For a long time we’ve been told that there was some kind of infiltration,” Giuliani told CNN. “I don’t know for sure, nor does the president, if there really was one.” If the accusations seemed strangely backwards-looking, given Trump’s election victory, they dovetailed with an ongoing campaign by congressional Republicans to impugn the special counsel, Robert Mueller, and telegraphed the president’s increasing determination to turn the page on the investigation into Russian election interference and alleged links between Trump aides and Moscow. Former justice department officials warned that that determination was increasingly reckless. “When you’re out of cover ups to hide your guilt, you attack the legitimacy of the investigation,” tweeted former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance. The Mueller investigation received a potential boost on Thursday with the announcement that the former son-in-law of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was cooperating with federal investigators. Prosecutors appear to be seeking the cooperation of Manafort, who has pleaded not guilty to multiple federal felonies, in the investigation of the Trump campaign. With Mueller’s every advance, Trump and his proxies have increased the volume of their declarations that he has gone too far. “I would like to see it get wrapped up,” the retiring House speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday, of the Mueller inquiry. He added: “It’s been a year.” Giuliani claimed on CNN that Mueller had agreed to narrow the scope of a potential interview with Trump, which has been under negotiation for months, from five topics to two. “The main focus we want is Russia,” Giuliani said, seeking to foreclose an apparently central area of Mueller’s inquiry, potential obstruction of justice by Trump. The most potent line of attack, however, may be the one Trump pursued on Friday: that the FBI had infiltrated his presidential campaign. The Washington Post reported earlier this month that a “top-secret, longtime intelligence source” provided information to the FBI about the Trump campaign and Russia. The status of the source in relation to the campaign was unclear. Whatever the unlikely merits of the “infiltration” charge – in March 2017, Trump falsely accused Barack Obama of undertaking “to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process” – the charge itself adds to pressure on the justice department to explain the FBI investigation of the Trump campaign. Republicans in Congress led by the House intelligence committee chairman, Devin Nunes, have demanded the department release documents laying out the origins of the FBI inquiry. Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the Mueller investigation, has fiercely resisted, warning earlier this month that “the justice department is not going to be extorted”. On Thursday, the department complied with a federal judge’s order to hand over a sealed August 2017 memo written by Rosenstein that outlined Mueller’s purview. A showdown over any such documents that led to Rosenstein being sidelined of ejected could be more damaging to the Mueller investigation than the removal of Mueller himself, former FBI special agent Asha Rangappa and others have written. “Removing Rosenstein and replacing him with a deputy attorney general who is at the very least more sympathetic to Trump could have drastic repercussions for the investigation,” Rangappa wrote last December. “This explains why the GOP is pushing hard to release Rosenstein’s memo granting authority to Mueller, in violation of DOJ policy,” former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti tweeted on Friday. “But it’s hard to believe this will actually lead to Rosenstein’s resignation. He had to know his memo would be highly scrutinized when he wrote it.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/24/jeffrey-tambor-the-problem-with-his-post-metoo-comeback","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T19:29:31Z","webTitle":"Jeffrey Tambor: the problem with his post-#MeToo comeback","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/24/jeffrey-tambor-the-problem-with-his-post-metoo-comeback","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/24/jeffrey-tambor-the-problem-with-his-post-metoo-comeback","fields":{"headline":"Jeffrey Tambor: the problem with his post-#MeToo comeback","bodyText":"Earlier this week, it was announced that Jeffrey Tambor, an actor whose name was one of many mentioned in the post-Weinstein rush of sexual misconduct allegations, would be returning to this year’s Emmys race. The 73-year-old star, who has previously won two awards for his role as a trans woman in Transparent, was submitted by Netflix for his work in the latest season of Arrested Development launching at the end of the month. It felt like the beginning of a comeback, a slow crawl back to the top after being ousted from the Amazon drama. But his good luck was short-lived. Later that same day, the New York Times launched a roundtable interview with Tambor and the rest of the Arrested Development cast. It was a surprisingly candid chat and once talk of the new season was completed, the conversation moved on to Tambor’s misbehaviour. In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter earlier this month, he had mentioned a “blowup” with his on-screen wife, played by Jessica Walter. It was brought up in the roundtable and she spoke for the first time about the incident. After her male co-stars tried to defend him, she started to cry, audio of which has been going viral. “It’s hard because honestly – Jason [Bateman] says this happens all the time,” she said. “In like almost 60 years of working, I’ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set. And it’s hard to deal with, but I’m over it now.” After outcry online, Bateman apologised for his unwavering defense of Tambor. “Based on listening to the NYT interview and hearing people’s thoughts online, I realize that I was wrong here,” he tweeted. “I sound like I’m condoning yelling at work. I do not. It sounds like I’m excusing Jeffrey. I do not. It sounds like I’m insensitive to Jessica. I am not.” Since the article was published, Netflix has announced that all future interviews supporting the show will be cancelled. It’s a stark reminder of the other behavior Tambor has been accused of over the last year, something that he, and Netflix, were trying to move past. In November 2017, Tambor, who had been experiencing a new career high playing Maura Pfefferman in Jill Soloway’s critically acclaimed drama Transparent, was accused of sexual misconduct on set. His former assistant Van Barnes and co-star Trace Lysette both accused him of harassment. Barnes claimed he had propositioned her, made lewd comments, groped her and threatened her if she shared her story, while Lysette released a statement on Twitter alleging similar impropriety and “multiple uncomfortable experiences”. “He came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrusts back and forth against my body,” Lysette wrote about one experience in particular. “I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas.” Tambor denied any sexual harassment but said he was “deeply sorry” for any actions that might have been misinterpreted. Yet he also criticized the “toxic politicized atmosphere” on set and the “flawed” investigation led by Amazon to uncover the veracity of the claims against him. In February this year, Tambor was officially dropped from the show, with Soloway “heartbroken” over any damage caused to the trans community. While he still denies any sexual misconduct, he has since been more upfront about his difficult behavior. “I drove myself and my castmates crazy,” he said to the Hollywood Reporter. “Lines got blurred. I was difficult. I was mean. I yelled at Jill – she told me recently she was afraid of me. I yelled at the wonderful [executive producer] Bridget Bedard in front of everybody. I made her cry. And I apologized and everything, but still, I yelled at her. The assistant directors. I was rude to my assistant. I was moody. Sometimes I didn’t talk at all.” Tambor’s performance in the show, while praised by many, was also a bone of contention for many in the trans community who were disappointed with the hiring of a cisgender man in the role. Soloway, who identifies as non-binary, had expressed regret over the casting. “It definitely started in a different time,” they said to Vulture in 2016. “And my ignorance, I lead with my ignorance, is that I really didn’t understand anything with the trans civil-rights movement when I created the show.” The show is set to go forward, for one final season, without Tambor, who calls the removal of his character “a death”. His return in Arrested Development was seen as a lifeline, a way of maintaining his presence in the industry after losing his biggest role to date. The press surrounding it has certainly been pushing it as such. “In making and promoting seasons four and five of Arrested Development Jeffrey has always been totally professional,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said. There have been similar sentiments from those involved with the show. Creator Mitchell Hurwitz pointedly said that “accusations are very different than proof”. David Cross said that he would “stand behind” him. Jason Bateman said that he has “always just been incredible” on the set of the show. Portia de Rossi said that she would “support” and “adore” him. It was only Alia Shawkat, who also had a small role in Transparent, who remained more muted. “I support him being on the show, but I also support the voices of the victims at the same time,” she said. Tambor was last seen in Armando Iannucci’s 2017 comedy The Death of Stalin although his face was removed from some posters after news of his firing emerged. The press tour was similarly plagued with a cloud of related questions. “It’s one of those things where I just don’t know what the situation is, and I don’t think I would help if I commented on it,” Iannucci said to the Hollywood Reporter. His next role in Disney family comedy Magic Camp, alongside Gillian Jacobs, was yanked from the schedule last year and in February, it was announced that it will instead premiere on the studio’s new streaming network in 2019, a decision reportedly unrelated to any allegations. Tambor is not alone in his attempt to revive his career, with other men also accused of misconduct making a slow creep back into the spotlight. In March, it was announced that the actor and film-maker Nate Parker would be making a new fact-based drama based on the memoir of a high-profile LAPD detective. The Birth of a Nation, his directorial debut, was swarmed wth controversy after the resurfacing of a rape charge, of which he was acquitted in 1999. It has also been reported that the veteran news anchor Charlie Rose, accused of serial sexual harassment, is being pitched as the host of a new show that would see him speak to other men accused of similar misconduct. For now, it seems that Tambor is out of gas on his road to redemption and given the new landscape he is now a part of, it seems fitting. While he is yet to admit to any sexual wrongdoing, he has confessed that he has been difficult on set with behavior that could be easily described as bullying, something that’s finally becoming less acceptable, and more reported, in the industry. “You gotta laugh about the ‘but everybody behaves like this on set’,” director Lexi Alexander tweeted. “No. White men do. White men are the only ones who get away with this shit. Ask Isaiah Washington. And imagine any woman on set behaving like Jeffrey Tambor.” Tambor insists he is a new man. “People change,” he said earlier this month. “It’s already changed my behavior on set.” But is it enough? Given the flurry of allegations hitting every week, do audiences want to see alleged predators and bullies on screen? A string of petitions to remove Johnny Depp, accused of assaulting ex-wife Amber Heard, from the upcoming Fantastic Beasts sequel suggests that a vocal portion have had enough. What the industry seems more focused on is ensuring that the accusers are receiving the comebacks they deserve. Annabella Sciorra, who alleged that Harvey Weinstein raped her, has nabbed a role as the lead villain in the new season of Luke Cage while Salma Hayek, who also alleged that Weinstein harassed and threatened her, has just scored an Amazon comedy series with Paul Feig. The disastrous yet enlightening New York Times roundtable showed that much of the trauma attached to figures such as Tambor remains unresolved. The pain, anguish and regret that have all been pushed underneath the surface are slowly making their way out, and no matter how many apologies might follow, the scars aren’t going away."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/24/farrow-family-truth-trauma-mia-dylan-moses-woody-allen","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:34:13Z","webTitle":"We may never know the truth, but Moses Farrow is clearly a victim too | Suzanne Moore","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/farrow-family-truth-trauma-mia-dylan-moses-woody-allen","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/farrow-family-truth-trauma-mia-dylan-moses-woody-allen","fields":{"headline":"We may never know the truth, but Moses Farrow is clearly a victim too","bodyText":"In 2014, there was a hashtag on Twitter #IbelieveDylanfarrow. She had written an open letter detailing allegations of being abused by her father Woody Allen. I wrote at the time that I was “inclined to stand alongside Dylan’s howl of pain” but was concerned that opinion was being tweeted as fact and worried that the rush to judgment may end up not helping victims of sexual abuse in the end. Today, if I was so inclined, I would use the hashtag #IbelieveMosesFarrow. Moses has written a weary and disturbing blog about the physical and emotional abuse he says he suffered as a child. But he claims that the abuse came from his mother, Mia Farrow. He says Dylan was not abused by his father, rather that she was coached from a very young age into making these allegations. Mia Farrow has responded by saying: “Moses has cut off his entire family – it’s heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up. We all miss him and love him very much.” Morally, Allen certainly betrayed the family through his relationship with Soon-Yi, Mia’s adopted daughter, said to have started when she was 20. This relationship broke boundaries and trust but it is not illegal. Moses writes that Satchel (who would later change his name to Ronan) was only four when he would announce to a nanny “My sister is fucking my father” so often did Mia repeat this. Allen’s penchant for much younger women, “evidenced” by his films, meant that when Dylan Farrow alleged he had sexually assaulted her, Allen was seen as a paedophile who had also groomed Soon-yi. Though the abuse claims against Allen were not upheld in court, his reputation has been destroyed. At the time of the custody case, the judge said: “I am less certain … that the evidence proves conclusively that there is no sexual abuse [of seven-year-old Dylan].” He also damned Allen’s parenting skills. Ronan Farrow has always supported his sister and his mother, and has gone on win a Pulitzer prize for his work exposing allegations of sexual assault and harassment against Harvey Weinstein. There is no doubt that this has been brilliant, and he is partly responsible for the #MeToo movement. Now though, Moses Farrow is deemed “dead” to his sister Dylan for saying #MeToo . He is also a victim, this time allegedly from his mother. The whole sorry mess shows how several truths may coexist in families. Moses writes of the darkness in Farrow’s family: Mia’s brother who molested children, another uncle who killed himself. There is also the the suicide of his adopted brother Thaddeus. Another sister, Lark, died in her 30s from pneumonia after contracting HIV. He talks, as he has before, of Mia’s rages, physical violence and bitterness. In his version, the adoption of seven children from completely different cultures looks like skewed egoism. His entire experience of childhood sounds traumatic, and the interplay between trauma and memory is immensely complicated. Survivors of sexual and other abuse often experience dissociation and then begin to gradually disclose. Moses doubts Dylan’s version of events, and now we have these competing narratives of victimhood. It is possible to believe that Dylan believes she was abused. It is possible to believe that Moses is telling his truth too – that these children were both the collateral damage of a custody battle between adults neither of whom seem to have a clue actually how to be a parent in the first place. There are myriad violations and alleged violations here. Allen violated the family for sure. Mia had violated Dory Previn’s trust when she had an affair with a much older André Previn. She had, at 21, married a 50-year-old Frank Sinatra so knows a thing or two about age gaps in relationships. None of this is to excuse anything, it is simply to point out all this dysfunction. In families where sexual abuse happens , it is indeed common for siblings to have entirely different accounts of what took place. Disgust at Allen’s behaviour has lead him to being described a paedophile and predator. Legally this is not the case, as painful as it is to read Dylan’s story. In Moses’s quiet and resigned account, his childhood seems to have equally painful, with sides having to be taken so young. The truth, as far as we can know, is that damage was inflicted on all these children, and that there may have been more than one type of abuse. Such complexity may be too much for hashtag justice, but again it is not uncommon to encounter multiple levels of betrayal when family history starts unravelling. That this is played out in the court of public opinion makes it even more dysfunctional. But once again I want to listen to the victims, even when they contradict each other. We owe children that. That there is more than one truth may be unbearable to live with, as it is appears to be for these children of this pair of extreme narcissists. How desperately sad for all of them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"education/2018/may/30/classist-cambridge-drinking-societies-should-shut-says-group","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-30T16:00:21Z","webTitle":"Cambridge drinking societies under threat as students reveal darkest secrets","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/30/classist-cambridge-drinking-societies-should-shut-says-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/30/classist-cambridge-drinking-societies-should-shut-says-group","fields":{"headline":"Cambridge drinking societies under threat as students reveal darkest secrets","bodyText":"From bikini-clad female students wrestling in pools of jelly to binge-drinking, extreme-eating contests and regurgitating live goldfish, the exploits of Cambridge University’s drinking societies have long provoked tabloid headlines. Now the future of these groups is under review after a Facebook page dedicated to shutting them down posted hundreds of accounts of inappropriate behaviour allegedly perpetrated by drinking society members, including sexual misconduct, bullying and classism. The anonymous claims on Grudgebridge include members of a male drinking society sexually harassing “attractive fresher girls” after confiscating their keys and phones; a male member of a society saying female students would “be going home in wheelchairs” after an event; and a drinking society member trying to ban someone from entering a bar because they went to a state school. In response to the allegations, Cambridge University Student Union (CUSU) is to draw up a code of conduct for drinking societies with members and student sexual harassment campaigners, Cambridge for Consent, which should be in place by the end of term. The CUSU student president, Daisy Eyre, said the union’s governing body was also expected to vote on whether to campaign for the end of drinking societies. “Personally, I think [drinking societies] are incredibly problematic and disruptive. If you go out to the clubs on a Friday night you will see multiple people wearing drinking society blazers and shirts, making it very clear that they are members of these societies and you are not. And [freshers] can feel really left out if they’re not chosen. And the politics of who is in drinking societies is implicitly and sometimes explicitly homophobic, racist and classist,” said Eyre. However, other senior student representatives said the Facebook campaign amounted to an “online fatwa”, with several allegations removed from the page because they were false. The Grudgebridge page began its campaign after posting a video of a Trinity Hall Crescents society bash at a local pub where a drunken student made a speech criticising inclusivity, which he claimed was the “single biggest problem facing the [society] in the modern age”. Although the student concerned was not a member of the Crescents, the society was disbanded due to the incident, which is being investigated by Trinity Hall. The original administrator of Grudgebridge, who shot the video of the Crescents society, said he then began the campaign to shut down all drinking societies because they reinforced the university’s old boys network and undermined efforts to improve access for working class and black and minority ethnic applicants. The student, who wishes to remain anonymous, said prior to Grudgebridge there had been a passive resignation about the behaviour of drinking societies by the university. He added: “Now it feels like these lads are shitting themselves over what might come out.” The student, who described himself as being lower middle class, added that part of the reason why he had started the campaign was because he went to Eton on a full scholarship. “I know the feeling of being acutely aware of being in a different class,” he said. The page is now administered by two female students who said it complemented the university’s Breaking the Silence campaign, which allows students to anonymously report sexual misconduct and has led to a huge rise in such complaints. “Drinking societies aren’t actually responding to Breaking the Silence until now when they’re at risk – when they’ve been exposed,” said one of the administrators. The other administrator said they had attended one drinking society event in their first term where only attractive white female freshers were invited. “There was the most vile attention and behaviour towards girls by second and third year boys,” she said. “Trying to get girls to sit on their lap. Trying to get them as drunk as possible. We were told that last year three girls had been spiked.” Eyre said Grudgebridge had provoked a “seismic shift” in attitudes towards drinking societies at the university. She added: “It’s like the annoyance that has been bubbling up for years has erupted.” Eyre, who wrote her dissertation on masculinity and the university drinking societies, added: “The norms inside those societies are so warped. It is a crystallised version of lad culture where the jokes are coded in racist, sexist, homophobic deeply intolerant ways. They believe that making jokes - like it’s fine if you slept with the girl who’s passed out - is acceptable and funny.” Andreas Bedorf, who sits on the CUSU council as the president of Downing College’s graduate students, said the Grudgebridge campaigns “reminds me of a witch hunt or inquisition”. Bedorf, who is a member of the college’s men’s rowing and drinking society, Downing Tribe, said he had made several fake submissions to the Facebook page, one of which had been published. The PhD student, who said he would welcome a code of conduct for drinking societies, added: “I know some grudges are definitely true, and [there is] highly problematic behaviours which I totally condemn. [But] I think it would be better to tackle this kind of behaviour rather than drinking societies as a whole when most of them them are not problematic and just trying to have a good time and being with like-minded people.” Grudgebridge’s administrators acknowledged that some false submissions had been posted, including quotes from the play Posh, which depicts a fictionalised version of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club. They added they were unable to verify posts due to the high number of submissions but they did remove them on request. A university spokeswoman said colleges were in discussion with their student representatives on a joint approach to unofficial drinking societies and allegations of distressing behaviour, including bullying, peer pressure to drink dangerously, social exclusion and anything that falls under disciplinary procedures."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/24/donald-trump-lauds-nfl-anthem-policy","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T13:11:50Z","webTitle":"Trump to players who kneel for anthem: 'Maybe you shouldn't be in the country'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/24/donald-trump-lauds-nfl-anthem-policy","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/24/donald-trump-lauds-nfl-anthem-policy","fields":{"headline":"Trump to players who kneel for anthem: 'Maybe you shouldn't be in the country'","bodyText":"Donald Trump lauded the NFL’s new guidelines prohibiting kneeling during the Star-Spangled Banner, saying that “maybe you shouldn’t be in the country” if you don’t stand for the national anthem. The US president spoke to Fox &amp; Friends in an interview that aired Thursday. The policy forbids players from sitting or taking a knee on the field during the pre-game performance of the anthem but allows them to stay in the locker room. Any violations of the new rules would result in fines against teams. “I think that’s good,” Trump said in the interview that was recorded on Wednesday shortly after the NFL’s announcement of the policy. “I don’t think people should be staying in the locker rooms, but still I think it’s good. You have to stand proudly for the national anthem. Or you shouldn’t be playing, you shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country. “You have to stand proudly for the national anthem and the NFL owners did the right thing if that’s what they’ve done.” Trump thrust the issue to the forefront in September when he called on the NFL’s owners to ban any player who followed former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s lead by kneeling during the anthem, prompting an unprecedented wave of protest across the league. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” the president said at an Alabama rally. Trump’s comments spurred a national conversation about patriotism and the nation’s symbols and the use of peaceful protest. The president said in Wednesday’s interview that he thought “the people” pushed for the new policy. “This was not me,” Trump said. “I brought it out. I think the people pushed it forward. This country’s very smart. We have very smart people. You know, that’s something ideally could have been taken care of when it first started, it would have been a lot easier, but if they did that, they did the right thing.” Vice president Mike Pence wasted no time claiming the NFL’s decision as a victory for the administration on Wednesday, posting a screenshot of a news story on Twitter shortly after the announcement with the caption: #Winning. “Today’s decision by the @NFL is a win for the fans, a win for @POTUS, and a win for America,” Pence wrote in a follow-up tweet. “Americans can once again come together around what unites us – our flag, our military, and our National Anthem. Thank you NFL.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/24/stephen-colbert-trump-karma-late-night","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T13:25:36Z","webTitle":"Stephen Colbert to Trump: 'You are living proof that karma does not exist'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/may/24/stephen-colbert-trump-karma-late-night","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/culture/2018/may/24/stephen-colbert-trump-karma-late-night","fields":{"headline":"Stephen Colbert to Trump: 'You are living proof that karma does not exist'","bodyText":"Late-night hosts on Wednesday discussed Trump’s attempts to coin his FBI conspiracy “Spygate”, the gubernatorial primaries in Georgia, and the Trump administration’s move to reverse a hunting ban. Stephen Colbert: ‘Bon appétit, Sean Hannity’ “Right now, as we tape this show, President Trump is in New York City having dinner with supporters,” Stephen Colbert began. “Well, it’s New York, so, supporter. Bon appétit, Sean Hannity.” “Trump is calling the one informant the FBI used to find out if the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russian government ‘a nest of spies’,” the host continued. “And the reviews are in on his new thriller: New York magazine raves: ‘Trump’s FBI Spy Theory is Completely Insane’. CNN says: ‘Donald Trump Turned a Rumor into a Full-Blown Government Conspiracy in just Five Days’. And the New Jersey Star-Ledger adds: ‘Trump stands in middle of 5th Ave, shoots American justice’. “Today,” Colbert noted, “Trump gave his conspiracy a nickname,” showing footage of the president telling reporters: “We now call it Spygate, you’re calling it Spygate.” “No, we’re not,” Colbert replied. “A) a criminal investigation is not “spying”. It should be Investigategate. And b) Spygate has already been used, twice: once to describe the public identification of Valerie Plame as a CIA officer, and for the New England Patriots’ videotaping of New York Jets’ coaches signals.” Referring to Trump’s recent tweet in which he trumpeted his theory and said “what goes around, comes around”, Colbert added: “Donald Trump, you for one should not be talking about what goes around, comes around,” he said. “You are living proof that karma does not exist.” Samantha Bee: ‘Are they that dumb? Remains to be seen’ On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee covered the primary results of Georgia’s gubernatorial election, which on the Democratic side saw Stacey Abrams run against Stacey Evans. Abrams triumphed in the primary, Bee said, making her “the first female African American nominee for governor by a major party in American history”. “Georgia now has an opportunity to elect an experienced, progressive governor and, thank the Lord, because here’s who’s running in the Republican primary,” Bee said, before showing campaign advertisements from the GOP hopefuls. In one, Brian Kemp brandishes his gun and says: “I got a big truck just in case I need to round up criminal illegals and take them home myself.” “Take them home?” the host replied. “Does he know he made an ad for kidnapping?” In another television spot, Republican Michael Williams drives a “deportation bus”. “Both Kemp and Williams focused their campaigns on outlawing sanctuary cities which, funnily enough, are already outlawed in Georgia,” Bee added. “Vote for me, I’m going to do the thing that’s already done. Oh look, I done did it! “That’s how dumb the Republican party thinks Georgia Republicans are. Are they that dumb? Remains to be seen.” Jimmy Kimmel: ‘It’s time to shoot baby bears’ Finally, ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel tore into Trump for his administration’s reversal of Obama-era policies protecting wildlife for predatory hunting practices. On Monday, the National Park Service announced its intent to update the former Obama-era regulations on sport hunting in national preserves in order to align the federal policy with that of Alaska state law. “And I say it’s about time,” Kimmel said sarcastically. “I don’t know about you, but I am sick and tired of not being able to shoot bear cubs in their dens. What are you supposed to do? Wait for them to waddle out adorably and start rolling around? That’s not American.” Kimmel went on: “Trump also eased a ban on importing elephant trophies from Africa after saying he wouldn’t, which is disgusting, but not only isn’t the president backing down, he’s going all in on this.” Kimmel proceeded to air a mock TV ad Trump’s new policy. “It’s time to make America great again,” the voiceover said. “It’s time to shoot baby bears.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/24/dj-culture-became-weaponised-elevator-music-how-despacio-is-fighting-edm","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T15:00:21Z","webTitle":"‘DJ culture became weaponised elevator-music’: how Despacio is fighting EDM","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/24/dj-culture-became-weaponised-elevator-music-how-despacio-is-fighting-edm","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/24/dj-culture-became-weaponised-elevator-music-how-despacio-is-fighting-edm","fields":{"headline":"‘DJ culture became weaponised elevator-music’: how Despacio is fighting EDM","bodyText":"James Murphy is bleary-eyed as he welcomes David and Stephen Dewaele – the Belgian brothers behind Soulwax and 2manydjs – into his Brooklyn home. Jetlagged from a recent flight back from South America, where his band LCD Soundsystem just wrapped another leg on their world tour, he’s already looking forward to the next party: when all three play together, it’s Despacio (Spanish for “slow”), an event unlike any other. “Certain elements are like a house party, where people hang out, but they really go for it later, like a rave,” says Murphy. “People actually dance instead of staring at a DJ and waiting for drops. And it doesn’t hurt your ears.” Which it could easily do, with a sound system powerful enough to cause hearing damage. Having been staged in London, Coachella and New York City and coming back to London this weekend, Despacio is a movable feast, although one that weighs 30,000kg, thanks to its intricately designed system of eight stacks of McIntosh speakers and amps. “Despacio is significantly heavier than the front-of-house PA for an arena tour,” says Murphy. “When Metallica is playing for 70,000-capacity football stadiums, that PA is lighter than Despacio. It’s physically larger, but Despacio is heavier.” Murphy and the Dewaeles can’t quite agree on when they met in the haze of the early-00s electroclash era, but Despacio arose from one of Murphy’s ever-present notebooks, which Stephen recalled featuring prototype designs and queries such as: “Why don’t we make our own tour bus?”, “Why don’t we make our own DJ bag?” or “How about we make our own mixer?” Their ideal sound system was imaginary and theoretical for the most part (although Precious Hall in Sapporo, Japan, and clubs in Tokyo proved inspirational), until Murphy decided to build it himself. “The biggest difference between me and someone else is, they go: ‘I don’t know how to do it’ and I go: ‘I also don’t know how to do it, but I’m sure it’ll be fine,’” he says. Despacio, with its tracks often slowed down to a sensual strut, also stems from frustration at modern club setups and systems built to blast out hyper-compressed dance music. Soon Murphy and the Dewaeles had a simple rule: “If you play AC/DC’s Back in Black and it doesn’t sound fucking good on your sound system, then your system doesn’t sound good. Because that album sounds great.” And Back in Black as well as any number of classic rock tunes (from Heart’s Magic Man to Queen’s Another One Bites the Dust) that you might have heard hundreds of times on the radio turn revelatory on the Despacio speakers, imparting a physicality and headiness that beggars belief. It’s also a neat trick to make a generation of young dance music fans raise their hands skyward and go crazy for a 40-year-old guitar solo. Since Murphy and the Dewaeles grew up playing in bands and were at the fore of getting indie rock kids to dance music, they have a special vantage on the state of EDM and bear some of the responsibility for making club nights overly emphasise the DJ. “As former band people, we would get rock fans out looking to see a show, so we had a visual thing, someone to look at and it was kinda funny at the start,” Murphy said. “But then DJ culture became weaponised elevator music.” Instead, Despacio went against trends. “The people waiting for something really exciting to happen are going to leave,” he says. “And then once you get people going and they dance naturally – after they have stopped waiting for things – then you can have a party. It’s about being patient, where you subvert the crowd’s expectations.” “Despacio is the antidote for that world of EDM,” says Stephen. “The idea between the three of us was: ‘What if we could play that one crazy record?’ It’s like making your own secret stereo.” But for every Despacio that does happen, Stephen and David say there are another 20 or 30 that don’t, due to finances (they decline all alcohol and beverage sponsorships), hectic schedules or other extenuating circumstances. One party, all but set for a museum in the Dewaeles’ hometown of Ghent, fell through at the last minute because, according to Stephen: “It turned out the Ghent Altarpiece – the Lamb of God triptych – was being refurbished in the room next door. And the insurance policy had a polygraph that looks for movement and tremors, so there was no way we could do it because of the seismic activity.” So when Despacio finally goes down, it’s all the sweeter. As Murphy says: “We’re lucky enough to realise that we’re lucky. It’s a miraculous thing to get away with.” Five key Despacio tracks Steve Reich: Music for 18 Musicians (1978) James: “Despacio is about getting to that right vibe for the party from the beginning. None of us are trying to get their ‘moment’. We can just play the weirdest shit, like this as an opening track.” Paranoid London: Transmission Five (2013) Stephen: “We play it slowed down and were like: ‘Fucking hell!’ We thought we didn’t know these guys, but it turned out we knew them from the 303 Club in London. And they heard it one night on the sound system and were like: ‘Arrrrrgh!’” Steve Miller Band: Fly Like an Eagle (1976) James: “That’s a motherfucker of a track on that sound system. Play it on a modern dance sound system and it would sound terrible.” Mr Oizo: Flat Beat (1999) James: “Slowing down the records decreases expectations and anxiety for everybody.” Stephen: “And it’s a physical experience, getting that much more low end on tracks like Mr Oizo.” Dennis Parker: Like An Eagle (1979) Stephen: “We take this disco classic and slow it down to -12 and there’s this moment of the song right at the chorus [all three sing in a slow drunken warble] and it just makes everybody happy.” Despacio appears at All Points East festival, Victoria Park, London, 25-27 May"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"money/2018/jun/01/roam-further-vodafone-daily-fee","type":"article","sectionId":"money","sectionName":"Money","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T06:00:44Z","webTitle":"Vodafone charged me a £6-a-day flat fee for sending one text","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/jun/01/roam-further-vodafone-daily-fee","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2018/jun/01/roam-further-vodafone-daily-fee","fields":{"headline":"Vodafone charged me a £6-a-day flat fee for sending one text","bodyText":"I was on holiday in Thailand and have a mobile contract with Vodafone. I made sure my phone wasn’t on data roaming and was connected to wifi instead. When I inadvertently replied to a text, I triggered Vodafone’s £6-a-day “roam-further” fee. This allows you to use your normal UK allowances, but, of course, its vastly disproportionate if you send one text. AD, Edinburgh Roam-further was introduced in April last year, two months before the EU ban on mobile roaming charges. Crucially, customers can’t opt out. So a single text to announce their plane has landed will trigger the £6 flat fee for a day’s usage. Vodafone, which this month extended the service to cover 152 countries, justifies the deal by claiming that customers use four times as much data abroad and need mandatory protection from bill shock. “We realise it won’t suit everyone but the vast majority of our roaming customers value the certainty of a fixed daily charge,” it says. “All pay-monthly customers are automatically eligible, and we do not offer an alternative for the reasons given.” In December, regulator Ofcom ruled that customers had not been adequately informed of their right to leave their contract without penalty if they objected to this new term. Vodafone had to extend the cancellation period and refund those who had been adversely affected.

A four-storey building opposite Makerere University collapsed in 2016, injuring dozens and killing four people. “Pictures of it showed that the structure columns were bigger at the top and smaller at the bottom,” says Adengo. “They found that once the architect submitted drawings for approval, they were kicked off the project.” Architecture is all the more important in fast-changing environments like Uganda. The country is currently urbanising at a rate of more than 5.3% per year, according to a recent survey by the Commonwealth Association of Architects (CAA). Architects play a critical role in the design of cities, especially nascent ones. “Lack of proper planning often results in problems such as urban sprawl, car dependency and growing inequality,” says Peter Oborn, vice president of the CAA. “When properly trained, [architects and planners] understand the importance of creating mixed-use walkable neighbourhoods together with the value of public open space, culture and heritage.” In which case, the situation in Uganda is acute: there are just 178 registered architects in the country of over 43 million people, which is 18,700 short of the CAA’s optimal number. The association warned this “critical shortage” could leave Ugandan cities vulnerable as they grow rapidly. Some would say they already are. Three years before the Makere University disaster, seven people were injured in a similar incident in downtown Kampala; in July 2012 a building under construction along the city’s busy Lugogo Bypass collapsed, killing two workers. The year before that, seven people were critically injured after a building that was under construction collapsed in the city suburb of Ntinda, and in May this year another four-storey building collapsed, injuring two. The most severe incident came in 2008, when 10 people died after a school building – again, still under construction – gave way. Kampala’s city authority has made valiant attempts at the kind of urban design Oborn describes, but with limited success. Many blame political corruption and nepotism. “There are initiatives that have started, but they always hit a snag wherever it affects politicians or big developers,” says Emmanuel Mugisha, an architect at Studio FH, a firm focusing on environmentally conscious projects in east Africa. “The rules are always adjusted to suit whatever they are doing.” Mugisha says buildings designed in Uganda today tend to prioritise a certain aesthetic over practicality or sustainability, being modelled on the blue glass towers of Dubai rather than planned with Uganda’s equatorial climate in mind. Mugisha and his boss, Studio FH’s German founder Felix Holland, talk animatedly about how well built Uganda’s “tropical modernist” buildings from the 60s and 70s were compared with today’s efforts. “In the postcolonial era I think there was a lot of optimism,” says Mugisha, describing well-shaded and naturally ventilated buildings in the city centre such as the Bank of Uganda and the central post office. “But if you turn to the current market, a lot of architecture schools are focused on globalisation rather than thinking about our climate.” Mugisha is a graduate of Uganda Martyrs University, where the architect and academic Mark Olweny challenges his students to look at architecture as “more than buildings”. “Architects are now collaborators, helping communities achieve their goals – not coming in as gods and being all-seeing experts,” Olweny says. He agrees that Uganda needs more architects, suggesting it might encourage experimentation in the profession. But non-registered professionals designing the city is a concern. “There aren’t enough schools and there’s a very closed, elitist registration process,” he says “We probably have two or three times the number of architects registered.” This speaks to a wider issue of elitism in the industry and its role in Uganda’s increasingly unequal society. Olweny traces this back to the days when Uganda was a British protectorate and architects could only be found in the capital. “Architecture is still regarded as dealing with the small percentage of people who can ‘afford it’, who are only based in Kampala. You get a very skewed reality, which means architects are not really dealing with the crisis – they are just adding more fuel to the fire.” What they could be doing, says Olweny, is “reclaiming” and “decolonising” architecture by putting more resources into secondary cities such as Arua and Tororo, where so much of the population lives. The capital was designed to be unequal under British rule. Kampala, the so-called “city of seven hills”, was racially divided, into white, Indian and British zones. “The infrastructure hasn’t really changed since then,” says Adengo – to this day, wealthy people live in large housing compounds at the top of hills, formerly “white areas”, while the poor build on crowded, often swampy informal settlements at the foot of them. For Adengo, whose main interest is affordable housing, more important than the number of architects in Uganda is a shift in perceptions about their role. As her story about the collapsed building shows, architects need to be contracted for the entirety of a project, not just to imagine it. This way they could play an integral role in solving urban problems such as inequality and buildings that are vulnerable to their surrounding environment. Architects designing the homes of the rich on the hilltops have an impact on the living conditions of the poorest. “If you design a parking lot [on a hill], you should make it porous rather than concrete, or [give] your roof systems to store the water,” Adengo says. “It’s harder for the people at the bottom of the wetlands, because they really have nowhere to go.” The architecture professionals who spoke to Guardian Cities said various factors would need to change before more registered architects could make an impact in Uganda. A good starting point would be a detailed, well designed and properly implemented masterplan from the city authority, suggest architects at Studio FH. “At the moment it’s up for interpretation,” says Mugisha. “You cannot explain why some things are the way they are in Kampala, because there is no valid basis for decision making. You just have to argue case by case.” But first, attitudes need to shift across the board: from the belief that Kampala should aspire to be like Dubai to the idea that the well connected and rich are above the law. As long as it is the architect’s job to give the powerful what they want, would more of them make any difference?

These accomplishments were a vital lesson in expectation versus reality. I thought that once I had these basic skills life would be all spontaneous drives to Cornwall and snorkelling with the cast of Finding Nemo. My life is mainly getting cut up by 17-year-olds in the Sainsbury’s car park, and being too slow for the slow lane at the pool. Mark my words, there will be an entire circle of hell dedicated to people who swim too fast in the slow lane. Don’t these people understand that “slow” is a relative term? If someone (ie me) slows the average speed of the lane, so be it. Either swim slower or move to a faster lane. People must learn to adapt. It’s like the ancient sage Heraclitus once said: no man can doggy paddle in the same lane twice. I am baffled by how angry people can get about moving lanes – but I do have sympathy for the swimmers who move to a lane they can’t keep up with. I catch their desperate, goggled eyes when they pop up for air. “I know,” I mouth. Because I know how they will try to swim as fast as they can, huffing and puffing, kicking with all their might as human torpedoes splash past – big, distracting, passive-aggressive splashes. Worse still, others will swim close behind them before standing up suddenly with a deafening huff. They want you to know that you are so slow they can match your pace only by being stationary. And they want the whole pool to know this. But their aquatic shaming won’t work on me. Oh no – I see through their pettiness and rise above it. “I forgive you!” I think, hanging on to the side, and catching my breath as they douse me in water from a tumble turn. After all, they are just doing what they need to do to survive – to get me out so that they can stay, rather than move over and face a faster lane. It’s the law of the jungle: kill or be killed; splash or be splashed. In comparison, driving has been far less stressful. Yes, you are much more likely to die instantly, but at least you can overtake, do U-turns or pull over for a quick pasty. Now I just need to learn how to ride a bike.

Although this week’s announcement was short on detail, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, said he was ready to legislate to ensure only the “cleanest” domestic fuels would be available for sale. About 10% of UK homes (2.5 million) have an open fire or wood-burning stove. The consultation – part of the government’s 25-year plan to improve air quality – will almost certainly focus on wood burners and fires, not least because Gove says they account for 38% of damaging particulate matter in the UK. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has already asked for powers to curb their use and other councils are understood to be looking at them. So what does it all mean for those who love cuddling up in front of their open fire or stove? The fuel Experts say the burning of wet or unseasoned wood and smoky solid fuels is the main problem. Wet wood contains moisture that creates smoke and harmful particulates when burned. Properly seasoned wood should have a moisture content of 20% or less. One politically easy measure would be to ban the sale of wood that does not have the “ready to burn” logo. This would outlaw poor-quality logs bought from garage forecourts and DIY outlets. It would also force small log providers to become “Woodsure approved”, at a cost of £300-£400. Similarly, basic coal also faces being replaced with smokeless varieties that are approved by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and produce fewer particulates. Briquettes or heat logs that have a moisture content of about 6% are likely to be more in demand. Open fires Although many of the headlines focused on-wood burning stoves, Bruce Allen, chief executive of Hetas, the not-for-profit body that approves fuel and install standards, says open fires produce the bigger problem. One of the newest models of stoves used to burn dry wood will produce a fraction of the particulates of an open fire burning wet logs, he says. The government has also noted this in documents, meaning open fires are most at risk. Will I still be able to use my wood-burning stove? Plenty of people will not take kindly to being told they can’t use their wood burners, which, some say, may explain why Gove plans to shift any ban on to local authorities. London residents look most at risk: the mayor has already asked for extra powers to improve air quality, including measures to tackle wood/solid fuel burning. It is estimated that between a quarter and a third of all of London’s particulate pollution comes from domestic fires. In January, during a period of high air pollution, it contributed half such emissions in some areas of the capital, according to King’s College London research. Those whose stove has been approved for use in smoke control areas by Defra, or who have a clean-burning “ecodesign ready” model, would still be able to use it. About 10% of existing stoves in homes conform, it is thought. Full bans outside major urban areas, where stove and fire use is less concentrated, look far less likely. How can I reduce the impact of my stove or fire? If you want to keep using an open fire, some will argue that installing a wood-burning stove would be a more efficient way to heat your home. The latest Defra-approved stoves pre-heat the air entering the chamber and produce fewer smoky particulates than older stoves, and about 90% less than an open fire. They start at about £600. Also consider switching to briquettes made from waste wood. They are cheaper, deliver more heat and are cleaner-burning. Coal-burning in densely populated areas must now be considered an antisocial activity. I was going to buy a stove – should I hold off? It’s a brave person who spends thousands on a wood-burning stove in London. That said, if you still want one, make sure your model is on the Defra-approved list."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/24/boys-who-plotted-uk-school-shooting-guilty-of-conspiracy-northallerton-north-yorkshire","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T16:45:11Z","webTitle":"Boys who plotted UK school shooting guilty of murder conspiracy","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/24/boys-who-plotted-uk-school-shooting-guilty-of-conspiracy-northallerton-north-yorkshire","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/24/boys-who-plotted-uk-school-shooting-guilty-of-conspiracy-northallerton-north-yorkshire","fields":{"headline":"Boys who plotted UK school shooting guilty of murder conspiracy","bodyText":"Two teenage boys have been found guilty of plotting to kill pupils and teachers at their North Yorkshire school after developing an obsession with the Columbine massacre. The boys, who were 14 when their plans were uncovered last October, intended to shoot pupils and teachers “to clear out the underclass” and had begun stockpiling bomb-making equipment to blow up the school in Northallerton, Leeds crown court heard. The teenagers, who cannot be named because of their age, did not give evidence in their trial, but their lawyers claimed the plot was a fantasy they never intended to make reality. The jury thought differently, finding them both guilty of conspiracy to murder. After the jury heard that one of the boys confessed to officers a month before they were arrested, North Yorkshire police accepted in a statement that its initial response “did not meet those standards that are expected of us”. The older boy was also found guilty of unlawful wounding after he carved his name into his former girlfriend’s lower back, and aggravated burglary after breaking into her parents’ home with a knife. He was the ringleader, the prosecution argued. Much of the crown’s evidence came from his girlfriend. In a police video shown to the jury, she said the boy planned to steal guns from her father, who was involved in game shooting, and would use them to carry out a massacre at his school. She told the officer he was interested in “scarification” and that she reluctantly let him carve his name into her lower back with a penknife. She said she was scared he would harm her or others if she said no. Under cross-examination she said she had loved the boy. “It kills me not being able to see him and talk to him and hold his hand and go to Costa, but I lost that in the most horrible way,” she said, prompting the boy to burst into tears in court. She said he posted videos of live suicides and other distressing and offensive material to social networking sites and enjoyed it when people were frightened of him. Looking up the Columbine killers online was an obsession for the boy, the court heard. In the space of 14 hours last October he made more than 30 internet searches about the 1999 attack, and about building nail bombs, making a sawn-off shotgun and buying ammunition. The jury heard extracts from the boy’s diary where he outlined plans to run away to a nearby garrison. On page three of the journal he had written: “Sorry if this is found I have committed one of the worst atrocities in British history or I killed myself.” In October last year he wrote an entry describing a plan to attack his school, saying: “I will obliterate it. I will kill everyone.” A few weeks later he was caught inside his girlfriend’s bedroom by her mother. He was dressed in a trenchcoat like Eric Harris, one of the Columbine killers. He ran away – his girlfriend’s parents had made it clear he was not welcome in their house – and she looked out of the window to see him carrying a large knife. The boy later admitted he had taken the knife from his parents’ kitchen at some point and had written the word “love” on it, but insisted he had only visited his girlfriend that night because they were going to run away together. The next day, 22 October, the boy’s hideout was discovered behind a branch of Londis in Northallerton. It was searched and officers found a rucksack containing balaclavas, wires, batteries, a big bag of screws, a bag of zip ties and a bottle of petrol-like liquid. He was arrested the following day and denied planning to kill his girlfriend’s parents or anyone at his school. Yet in his diary he had written that he had been planning an attack for more than a year and had been collecting “materials” for months. When interviewed by police, the boy said parts of the diary were written as fantasy in order to impress his girlfriend. Other entries were written as a form of therapy, he claimed. But the psychologist he had been seeing before his arrest told detectives she had never asked him to keep a diary. The boy’s lawyer, Richard Pratt QC, had sought to convince the jury that the diary was the “wildest piece of fantasy”. He said the boy only had £89 in his bank account and so could not have bought the necessary ingredients to make a bomb, even if he wanted to. “Researching the Columbine murderers does not make you a killer,” the barrister said. “Buying guns and explosives – that’s what makes you a killer.” The younger boy blamed his older friend for the plot, saying he had been “manipulated” by him. After voluntarily attending a police station with his mother, he accepted discussing carrying out a school shooting but was adamant that he would never have carried it out. His account was partly corroborated by the other boy’s girlfriend, who said she understood the younger boy had “bottled it” and backed out. But the crown said that was no defence to conspiracy to murder, because the boy had been a willing plotter, even if he subsequently thought better of it. The boy also claimed that he had informed another classmate and a teacher in a bid to stop his co-accused proceeding with the plan. Yet the jury heard that the same boy had made “clear and unvarnished confessions” that he was central to the alleged plot, telling a school friend details of the “secret” in September 2017 on the messaging app Snapchat. In court, the boys bore little resemblance to their portrayal by the prosecution as would-be school shooters. Both asked to sit next to their mothers and appeared overawed as the evidence was outlined. In the earliest days of the trial, the younger boy wore his school uniform – despite not attending school since his arrest in October. Fellow pupils at the school and their parents said the older boy, who was living during the trial in a children’s secure unit 100 miles away from his parents, was “pretty badly bullied” at school and seen as an outsider. After the prosecutor told the court that “you may conclude that the police in North Yorkshire responded inadequately to the threat these two defendants presented”, the force’s head of safeguarding, Allen Harder, was asked repeatedly whether the force had made mistakes but did not answer. He said: “In terms of any investigation, there’s always lessons to be learned – positive lessons and lessons to be taken forward to best practice. We’ll review that and we’ll be taking any learning from that.” The boys will be sentenced at a later date."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"teacher-network/2018/may/26/secret-teacher-history-bias-school-fear-student-future","type":"article","sectionId":"teacher-network","sectionName":"Teacher Network","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T06:31:48Z","webTitle":"Secret Teacher: the emphasis on British history is depriving students of balance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2018/may/26/secret-teacher-history-bias-school-fear-student-future","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/teacher-network/2018/may/26/secret-teacher-history-bias-school-fear-student-future","fields":{"headline":"Secret Teacher: the emphasis on British history is depriving students of balance","bodyText":"The wedding of two people who ostensibly have nothing to do with most people in the country has been the hot topic in playgrounds and classrooms over recent weeks. Despite Prince Harry and Meghan being wholly unrepresentative of the schoolchildren in my area of the UK, pupils have been transfixed by the details. They want to talk about the dress Meghan wore, the car Prince Harry drove to the reception. They’re proud this glamorous, confident American is becoming part of British history. As a history teacher, I’m often struck by the topics students engage with and those they do not. When a pupil asked me how a new module about slavery was relevant to this country, I explained that it was the British who facilitated and spread the slave trade across the world. “That’s nothing to do with me,” he replied. “Why should I be bothered about stuff that happened miles away to people that are long gone?” It’s a different story in lessons about Winston Churchill and the second world war, when that same class will be captivated. Some of the blame lies with a curriculum that focuses on British “wins”, and the politicians that shape the culture of learning in our schools. In 2013, Michael Gove had to backtrack on plans to revise the curriculum after criticism from teachers and academics that his proposals placed too much emphasis on British history. Gove had felt too much history teaching was informed by post-colonial guilt, but his draft was steeped in nationalism – something reinvigorated by the Brexit debate, and by Donald Trump’s presidency in the US (and the popularity of slogans such as “America first”). Although Gove’s curriculum was revised, those calls for more “British history” have not gone away. In 2016, politicians and historians were still arguing that lessons about the British empire were deliberately anti-British, despite research finding otherwise. I have found an inherent bias in the curriculum that runs the other way. Pupils are brought up learning about the strength and heroism of this country and its once “grand” empire rather than about how other countries have suffered under its rule. It’s as if teachers are expected to protect this image of Britain rather than facilitate real learning. My classroom is not diverse. I teach mostly white boys and girls, and the occasional student whose grandparents were immigrants. But I worry about the impact this nationalism could have on them. In a school where exposure to other cultures is minimal, teachers arguably have a greater duty to expose pupils to other world views. Students rarely hear anything about the countries that are in poverty or strife because of the fallout from British actions – Zimbabwe and Palestine are good examples. The recent Windrush scandal has highlighted my pupils’ limited knowledge of Britain’s past actions. Many had previously learned that Britain took great pride in inviting “those poor colonials” to live in this country, but found it hard to reconcile the cruelty that came with it – the low wages, the “No blacks” signs in boarding house windows and the secretive deportations. Some with more rightwing views sought to blame the immigrants themselves. Perhaps with a more balanced curriculum, students would have a better reference point for considering such events. I feel hypocritical in my practice by not providing both sides of the world’s political and historical story. Some schools encourage teachers to go off curriculum – but these are one-off lessons not schemes of work, and student exposure is limited. It shouldn’t be – in my experience, pupils appreciate the less British and Eurocentric lessons as a breath of fresh air. It is terrifying that students who have become so desensitised to the world’s historical journey will one day vote to shape the future of the country. There is a real risk that this will become a single-minded generation that does not care about international issues unless it is directly affected by them. Unless this train of thought is challenged, it will continue. This generation only has one side of the story.

He was a singular figure in French literature whose non-literary claims to fame include having been married to Jean Seberg. Penguin will shortly be bringing out a new translation of his outlandishly memorable autobiography about growing up as the only child of a questing Jewish mother but in the meantime, as an opening gambit, we have this novel Les cerfs-volants – The Kites (first published in 1980, the same year as his suicide) to detain, entertain and introduce us to him. The Kites is set in Normandy during the second world war and its central narrator is Ludo, nephew of local hero Ambrose Fleury, postman and gifted kite maker. Ambrose creates airborne politicians, tiny dragonflies, unruly castles in the air. He is at the service of imagination itself – but with political strings attached. At no point does one lose sight of a kite’s symbolic potential, but Gary keeps ideas (about tenacity and freedom) lightly aloft and makes sure there are no narrative dives into trees. His voice is the equivalent of a cocked hat – the narrator is a beret-wearer – and style is at a consistently jaunty angle to content (although the translation is overworked – the French original is lighter). Ludo’s attitude to the people he describes might seem superficially self-abnegating but Gary busily redresses the balance, glories in the oddity of others and never misses a comic trick. Romance has absurdity at its core: Ludo falls in love, as a young teenager, with a girl he meets randomly in a Normandy forest. Her name is Lila, daughter of an aristocratic Polish tycoon. He waits four obsessed years before re-encountering her and, when he does, life refuses to follow a romantic script. Lila asks: “What’s wrong with you? You’ve turned green.” “I love you,” he whispers. There is a blissful eccentricity about Ludo – he puts glue in his hair when pomade is unavailable. His romancing recalls Nabokov – with jokes. The pleasure of reading is about the double take, the sense that Lila is actually self-involved, insubstantial, unworthy. At one point, Ludo likens himself to a stalk of grass held between her teeth. As the war takes hold and France is occupied, resistance becomes the novel’s subject and it homes in on the efforts of a master chef at the local restaurant, the Clos Joli, for whom French cuisine becomes a form of protest (the novel is a discreet love letter to France). It is a rash, playful book, yet dark too. The second half is dominated by a splendid, larger-than-life character: Madame Julie Espinoza, a Jewish prostitute with a lizard brooch on her bosom (a symbol of her constantly slinking out of trouble) who transforms herself into Princess Esterhazy – she knows about the survival of the sharpest, duping the Nazis with aplomb. It is fascinating to see Espinoza shed her former self and become a fiction. And, meanwhile, Uncle Ambrose confesses to his nephew that he has, all his life, been in love with an imaginary woman. Gary writes wonderingly, as if he cannot quite believe what his characters are getting up to, and points out a connection between “dreaming and rebellion”. What emerges, overwhelmingly, is the sense that, in Gary’s hands, fiction itself is a form of resistance. • The Kites by Romain Gary is published by Penguin (£12.99).

Even the old ones can still be bracing in their dismay (“Wow … ummm … no”), their dismissiveness (“I didn’t think I would like this and I was right”), or the sheer absence of effort expended (“Not so interesting”). One way to draw the sting from these rebukes is to find something that disqualifies the reviewer from holding opinions. For example, I don’t accept criticism from people who put a space before a comma instead of after (“Amusing ,in parts”.) or can’t be bothered to spellcheck a five-word review for errors (“Got bore before the end”). By contrast, the occasional stab at fair-mindedness (“Didn’t like it but it was my choice”) can be surprisingly wounding. The only one that really ever bothered me – from Amazon’s US site – is the one that begins with: “This book made me wish book-burning was a thing.” I long to point out to its author that book-burning is indeed a thing. He went on to heap scorn upon my work with a fury he had only previously expended on a particular model of AC/DC adaptor (“Really sucks”). I shouldn’t have read it, but it was my choice. Tuesday I have never been to the Chelsea flower show, probably because my desire to attend was never quite commensurate with the effort required to figure out how I would go about getting in. I always imagined someone would invite me along one day, but no one ever did. Until now. I was the guest of a cool gardening magazine called Rakesprogress. The main advantage of an evening event is you can see the show after the public have gone home, but I went early so I could see the public. It’s like going to a really big garden centre where the customers dress up. I can’t claim to be an expert after an hour in the flower people’s company, but at least I now know how to behave: on approaching a garden, one should point in the direction of a specific area of planting and say one of two things: either “I like that very much” or “I’m not at all sure about that”. There’s probably more to it, but that’s enough to get you through. I also learned that if you have the money it’s possible to buy a lifesize sculpture of a horse made of almost any material – metal, twigs, driftwood, you name it. And that foxgloves are huge right now. Wednesday New research demonstrates that Britons really do say thank you more often than anyone, coming top of eight cultures studied. In situations where expressing gratitude is an option, the British deploy thank you 14.5% of the time, whereas Russians say it just 3% of the time, and Cha’palaa speakers of Ecuador never do – their language doesn’t even have a ready translation. We all know that in Britain it’s possible to say thank you without conveying any gratitude at all, just as “of course” can sometimes mean “sadly, I am not in a position to refuse you”. As an immigrant to these shores, it took me a long time to realise there was no benefit to be derived from understanding these nuances, and that it was better to play dumb and pretend everyone was being nice to me. Thursday Reports that a team of scientists will use environmental DNA sampling to look for the Loch Ness monster remind me that while we may have advanced scientifically, we have learned very little. Pioneering techniques are being employed in the search for one of the planet’s oldest surviving hoaxes. Doubting climate change counts as scepticism these days, and yet this is happening. But the story wasn’t all it seemed. The man leading the scientific team, the New Zealand professor Neil Gemmell, isn’t really on the lookout for Nessie. “I’m going into this thinking it’s unlikely there is a monster,” he says. “But I want to test that hypothesis. What we’ll get is a really nice survey of the biodiversity of Loch Ness.” It’s not his fault that his forthcoming visit coincides with the release of phone footage captured by an eight-year old girl showing light sparkling on the water in a manner wholly consistent with a giant plesiosaur having a paddle. Last year apparently the highest number of “official” (ie, not official) Nessie sightings were reported in a century. I despair. Friday It’s hard to believe it has finally arrived: the last day I will ever receive an unsolicited email from Greater Anglia offering me 20% off a friends and family railcard. There will be no more special deals on replacement dishwasher wheels from Matt @ eSpares. No daily updates from that bicycle shop I visited six years ago. At midnight it all stops, thanks to General Data Protection Regulation. GDPR may well go down in history as the last nice thing Europe ever got to do for us. I haven’t met anyone who hasn’t throughly enjoyed ignoring weeks of begging emails from companies keen to keep stuffing our inboxes with promotional rubbish. Over the past fortnight these pleas shifted from impersonally official (“urgent – action required”) to something more desperate, like a late-night text from a hard-to-dump ex. “Is this goodbye, Tim?” said one subject line. “Let’s not part ways now” read another. “Don’t throw our love away” ran a third. I was tempted to reply saying “It’s not you, it’s me”, but I think a clean break is preferable. We were never really going out in the first place. I just took a ride on one of your trains once, that’s all. I didn’t even enjoy it. From now on, when I wake up, it’s entirely possible I will have received no emails at all in the night.

Delph’s wife, Natalie, is due on 30 June, two days after England play Belgium in their final group game in Kaliningrad. The Manchester City player has discussed the situation with Southgate. “Gareth’s been absolutely fantastic,” Delph said. “There’s not just me, there’s Phil Jones as well – I think his wife’s expecting. There’s nothing more important than family to me – it always comes first and always will. If I do have the opportunity to get back [home], I will. But if not, she’s tough, she’ll deal with it. We’re not 100% certain [what will occur] – but because the game is on the 28th there might be an opportunity to fly back and then get back fast.” Delph was called by his wife about another matter after he forgot to bring an essential item to England’s St George’s Park training base. “I met her when I was at Leeds – she’s from Yorkshire so there’s only Yorkshire Tea bags in my house but I forgot them. She rang me saying: ‘You’ve forgot your tea bags.’ One hundred per cent, I will take them to Russia.” Delph’s selection by Southgate was a fitting bookend to a personal season of triumph after Pep Guardiola nearly sold him to Stoke City last summer, and he finished with a Premier League winners’ medal. The 28-year-old made 29 appearances in all competitions, becoming Guardiola’s first-choice left-back after Benjamin Mendy’s serious knee injury in September. “It was tricky for me at the start, because I wasn’t sure where I was going to be club-wise, and there was a lot of talk about me moving on and whether I was going to stay,” said Delph, who is listed by Southgate as a midfielder but emphasised that he is happy to play anywhere. “But I managed to stay at Man City. It was unfortunate for Benjamin Mendy, because there were big hopes surrounding him and with him playing in the team it would have been a different style of football, an exciting style. “But I managed to sneak in there at left-back and managed to get quite a few games. I played there as a young kid but not many times. I played there probably one or two times under Gérard Houllier at Aston Villa, but not really.” Delph joined City from Villa in July 2015 after performing two U-turns, first reversing a decision to leave, then changing his mind again. “I was fully committed to staying at Aston Villa,” he said. “The reason I didn’t was because the signings we were going to bring in to strengthen to guarantee we wouldn’t be fighting relegation – that never happened. The opportunity to go and win the Premier League, to compete in or win a Champions League, was too big an opportunity to miss. “It obviously didn’t go down well because I came out and said I was staying. I spoke to the club and the club came out with a statement and it’s okayed [but] a lot of stuff got mixed up. I’ve never had the opportunity to come out and speak about it. The situation basically was, for three or four years, I was fighting week in, week out to help the team not get relegated and it takes its toll on you. “For me it was the fact that staff would lose their jobs – I had a great relationship with them, the kitchen staff, kit men, cleaners, absolutely everyone. I loved the club so for me to then go was hard.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"higher-education-network/2018/may/25/when-i-admitted-i-was-hiv-positive-my-fellow-academics-excluded-me","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T06:30:39Z","webTitle":"When I admitted I was HIV positive, my fellow academics excluded me | Anonymous academic","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/25/when-i-admitted-i-was-hiv-positive-my-fellow-academics-excluded-me","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/higher-education-network/2018/may/25/when-i-admitted-i-was-hiv-positive-my-fellow-academics-excluded-me","fields":{"headline":"When I admitted I was HIV positive, my fellow academics excluded me","bodyText":"When I was diagnosed with HIV, I had no idea that new drugs had transformed the virus from something life-threatening to little more than an inconvenience. Today, a daily pill gives me an average life expectancy and makes it impossible to pass the virus on. But there’s one last major health barrier: the social stigma, and the mental health issues it causes. Worryingly, this is so prevalent that it can even come from those who claim to be experts on the topic. In my case, this happened when I disclosed my status to academic mentors. Three days after my diagnosis, a professor specialising in sexual health contacted me online to share her views about HIV-positive people. She said the virus affected only reckless people, who couldn’t be trusted to take their meds. I replied that her comments were judgmental and ignorant, contributing to an outdated attitude that forces many people to hide their status. She replied: “It’s not irrational to protect yourself. They should be honest, unless they are unethical”, adding that HIV was a “killer” with “a higher probability of death” than other sexually transmitted infections. I had looked up to this professor, and her comments hurt. Framing HIV-positive people as “reckless” and HIV-negative people as “rational” is a binary logic that has roots in the political climate of the 1980s. HIV was seen as the responsibility of individuals, rather than of the state to provide adequate healthcare. The inaction of Conservative leaders at the time inspired queer protest movements. Similar tensions have re-emerged recently over whether the NHS should fund PrEP, a tablet (identical to mine) that prevents HIV infection. The tabloids call it a “promiscuity pill”. Although my PhD supervisor was initially sympathetic about the diagnosis, once I fell out with the professor he began to treat me differently. Until then, we had maintained a close personal and professional relationship, communicating regularly through social media. Our relationship changed quickly from friendly to formal. Where once we had exchanged hundreds of WhatsApp messages, these dwindled to a couple a month. Eventually, all communication was through university emails, focused on work. Until you experience it, indirect discrimination can be difficult to see, let alone prove. I decided to drop my supervisor, given the emotional pain I experienced when he ignored my messages. But other PhD students in the professor’s sphere of influence also stopped talking to me. By falling out of favour with the clique’s matriarch, I was ostracised by the whole gang of scholars, perhaps for the good of their own career prospects or publication metrics. Mine, by contrast, have suffered. While my previous publications have been cited by this group dozens of times, my most recent journal article has not been cited once, despite its relevance to their body of research. In her 1988 book, AIDS and Its Metaphors, Susan Sontag argued that the perception of HIV as a deadly (gay) plague led to “a social death that precedes the physical one”. There may be no physical death any more, but the legacy of the epidemic continues through the social and sexual exclusion many of us still face. My story is not the only example of so-called experts holding discriminatory views. For example, one black woman living with HIV described in a blogpost “an HIV researcher who became disgusted after she revealed her status to him”. We must remember that HIV is an intersectional issue, disproportionately affecting not just middle-class white gay men, but people of colour, trans women and sex workers. While it’s by no means widespread and may often be subconscious, discrimination and disgust towards those of us living with HIV matters. It will be a barrier to wider participation in the academy for as long as its hypocrisy goes unchallenged.

In front of you is an unimpeded vista down the building’s impressive length, which is marked by a giant ruler beneath your feet, in metres (300) and Venetian feet. Natural light enters wherever possible through the old building’s windows. It is all an expression of the beliefs of the curators of this year’s biennale, Shelley McNamara and Yvonne Farrell of Dublin-based Grafton Architects, that architecture should be experienced by both body and mind, by hands and touch as well as eyes and sight, and that what is above and below you is as important as whatever is straight ahead. Their installation also expresses their view that the job of the architect is not always to create something wholly new, but to draw attention to what is already there. Only as you penetrate the Corderie do you start to see the displays, on either side of the central axis, that are the primary purpose of the world’s greatest exhibition of architecture. Here other architects, selected by McNamara and Farrell, interpret the curators’ guidance in their own way, under the open-ended title of “Freespace”. The Catalan Carme Pinós, for example, shows a model and photographs of a tower in Mexico that is conceived as a series of bodily, three-dimensional experiences, not as a singular object of contemplation. Alison Brooks, Canadian-born and British-based, has built a composite of elements of several of her housing projects – a vaulted threshold, a canted roof space, a cloister – in plywood and mirrors, in order to show how an architect can “frame everyday life” with memorable spaces. The Japanese practice Tezuka Architects present a charming model of its Fuji kindergarten, in which animated projections of children run noisily about what is a two-level oval structure. Ricardo Flores and Eva Prats recreate a fragment of their Sala Beckett theatre in Barcelona, excavated with considerable invention out of the ruins of a former social club, plus a bit of the fecund and cluttered studio from which their buildings come. The exhibits are mostly three-dimensional, sometimes habitable, between models and installation, all of which is welcome. The Venice biennale can be hard slog, a soul-sapping hack through dense thickets of images and words. There are years when this celebration of architecture ends up producing some of the least architecturally enjoyable spaces in the entire city of Venice, but not this time. One of Grafton’s contributions is to provide places to sit down and enjoy the environment around you. More than that, it has created something affirmative, a physical reminder that architecture should be a joy both to experience and to make. The biennale has two main centres – the Arsenale, of which the Corderie is part, and its gardens, which include a central pavilion also directed by McNamara and Farrell, and several national pavilions, which follow their theme more or less faithfully. In the central pavilion, as in the Arsenale, they have made the building itself part of the show, removing obstructions, letting in light and letting it breathe. They have also discovered and uncovered a long-forgotten window by the great 20th century Venetian architect Carlo Scarpa. While its tracery of interlocking circles is delightful in itself, it also connects the interior nicely with the water and sky outside. The central pavilion is entered through a grand octagon that the architectural collective Assemble has paved with tiles from the Granby workshops, the business they helped set up as part of their regeneration project in Liverpool. A little irregular and patchy, they make you aware of the ground beneath your feet. Wall mirrors, tilted a little downwards, remind you of your presence in the room. Ahead is a small town of models, abstracted from great buildings of the past by the likes of Eileen Gray and Frederick Law Olmsted, the creator of Central Park in New York. Up and beyond, on a big blue-walled balcony, are the models of the Swiss Peter Zumthor, almost alchemical in their pursuit of the different material qualities. The point here is that the body-and-mind nature of architecture is in its creation as well as its use. In another room there are walls of drawings, recent and historic. “Be careful of computers,” says Grafton: “the hand-eye relationship is very important. There’s something primal about getting dirty with paper and pencil.” The whole is intended as a “treasure trove” that shows how “marvellous” architecture can be. It brings together some unexpected bedfellows, in particular the brick churches of the subtle dead Swede Sigurd Lewerentz with the grand urban speculations of the unsubtle living Dane Bjarke Ingels. The latter’s proposal is to ring Manhattan with a series of barrier parks to protect it from flooding – as Grafton likes to say, the span of architecture runs from keeping the ocean out to the tactility of a brick or tile. In all this the definition of “freespace” is fluid. It has something to do with generosity and openness, with making unscripted places where the unknown can happen, and with both inventing and finding qualities to which no price is attached. The effective motto of the biennale, quoted by Farrell and McNamara, is the statement of a Spanish architect, Alejandro de la Sota, that architects should “make as much nothing as possible”. The plainest expression of the “Freespace” theme comes with the British pavilion, by the architects Caruso St John and the artist Marcus Taylor, a spatial musing on the nature of island life in which the galleries of the neoclassical building are left empty, while a new platform is created on scaffolding above it. Here, among the treetops, with new views of Venice laid out before you, and with the roof of the old pavilion poking through like the survivor of a flood, you can enjoy a lot of De la Sota’s nothing. From time to time you can attend performances and events, some of them in collaboration with other countries’ pavilions. The installation embraces, say its creators, “themes including abandonment and reconstruction, sanctuary and isolation”. It is a thing apart but also connected, welcoming if not easy of access. An accompanying book expands the ideas, with texts by Shakespeare and (with unpredicted relevance) writers of the Windrush generation. If you suspected a Brexit connection in the theme you’d be right, and you can also guess the curators’ sympathies on the subject, but it is non-judgmental, neither hand-wringing nor Pollyanna-ish, nor Panglossian. The Victoria and Albert Museum is also in Venice (it’s not too insular to cite another British project) with a display of Robin Hood Gardens, the brutalist council estate in east London that was recently demolished. A section of its concrete structure has been shipped to an Arsenale quayside, and an exquisite film by the Korean Do Ho Suh, using techniques reminiscent of both architectural cross-sections and the stripping away of the demolition process, records the outer form and inner spaces of the estate on the point of its disappearance. The tragedy of Robin Hood Gardens was that the considerable seriousness and virtuosity of its architects, Peter and Alison Smithson, never integrated with its purpose of providing social housing. Any honest assessment has to recognise that there was alienation between their theories of community and its realities in practice. The message of the biennale as a whole, however, is more positive: you come away with the feeling that there are many architects out there doing delightful and thoughtful work that serves wide publics who might even appreciate what the architects are offering them. • The Venice architecture biennale runs until 25 November • This article was amended on 28 May 2018 because an earlier version referred to “the great mid-19th century Venetian architect Carlo Scarpa”.

At one point, we noticed the rabbi had gone missing. My dad eventually found him sitting in his car outside, listening to the Texas-Oklahoma football game on the radio. Lawrence Wright tells stories such as this in his new book. Wright is a New Yorker writer whose most famous work, The Looming Tower, is about the rise of al-Qaida (it has just been turned into a Hulu/Amazon series). There’s a political undertone to this one, too. Its subtitle is A Journey into the Future of America, and the argument is chiefly that Texas (and not California or New York) is the real bellwether of US life – the most sensitive reflection of what’s changing in it, and also the force most likely to shape it. Wright serves up a campfire stew of memoir, reportage and historical digression. He is a typically Texas storyteller, an anecdotalist who wanders around and stops occasionally to point out the view, but somehow you end up getting where you’re going anyway. You can hear the New Yorker in his voice; his prose has a kind of polished informality. He starts off on a bicycle tour near San Antonio, with his friend and Virgil-figure, the novelist Steve Harrigan. He ends up camping with his wife in Big Bend national park, having a shit in the middle of the night and looking up: “In every generation until mine, most of humanity lived with the night sky. As people began moving into cities and using more illumination, the sky gradually disappeared. There must be a corresponding loss of wonder without the stars to remind us where we stand in creation.” Along the way, he covers a lot of ground: the Texas revolution, the founding of the republic, the introduction of slaves, the civil war, the Kennedy assassination, the oil boom (and bust and boom again), fracking, political in-fighting in the state legislature (over the “bathroom ban”, restricting transgender people’s access to toilets, and sanctuary cities, where cooperation with immigration law is limited), the rapid and almost complete extinction of Texas Democrats (partly engineered by the Republican adviser Karl Rove), immigration and changing demographics, Trump’s Wall, Tea party politics, and the Austin music scene. Not to mention more personal subjects: his Dallas childhood, his marriage, his various professional ups and downs, the screenplay by Wright that Oliver Stone almost made, another play that was supposed to premiere in Houston until Hurricane Harvey hit, his life in Austin and the vague sense he has lived with of being stuck in the provinces, on the fringes of the real action – even though the book is an argument that the real action is here. Wright is a liberal, but his sympathies range across the aisle. “Like many Texans, I harbour a fondness for the Bush family that has nothing to do with their politics.” He knows them personally and blames W’s “complacency and … absence of curiosity” for the failures of his presidency, rather than anything more sinister. Rove sometimes shows up at his breakfast club – and explains to Wright, among other things, how he turned Texas into a “red” state. But the demographics are swinging around again … though the people who show up at the polls haven’t changed as much as the place itself. Texas isn’t a “red” state, as the former Democratic Texas senator from Dallas, Wendy Davis, says, “it’s a nonvoting blue state”. She became famous for her 11-hour filibuster of a bill designed to limit access to abortions. (It passed anyway in the next session.) Even on issues such as gun control, Wright tries to offer a balanced view: “When President Obama said, ‘States with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths,’ he was including suicides, which account for nearly two-thirds of gun deaths nationally.” At one point, Wright signs up for a firearms class, so he can bypass the security queues at the state capitol. I’ve experienced this phenomenon myself at the Texas book festival. The only people who can enter the grand old building (it’s a little taller than the Capitol in DC) unchecked are those with a piece of paper that says they are carrying a gun. Everyone else has to queue behind the metal detector to make sure they aren’t. In Texas, it’s not always easy to separate what you like from what you don’t. There’s an admiring sketch of Joe Straus, the long-serving speaker of the Texas House of Representatives. He’s the kind of moderate Republican who stands for what used to be a Texas virtue – pragmatism, the willingness to get things done, even if it means working with political opponents. Wright follows Straus as he struggles to defeat the “bathroom bill”, which is just the kind of interventionist legislation that Texans and particularly Republicans are supposed to hate. Apart from anything else, it’s bad for business. But the rise of the Tea party has put one set of Texas virtues under threat, in defence of what they consider to be others. The current governor’s “pet issue is fending off the malevolent influence of California”. The centre of that influence, and a city widely resented by the rest of Texas (or at least by their political representatives) is Austin, my hometown. Wright reflects: “When I tell people outside the state that I live in Texas, they often look at me uncomprehendingly. It’s like saying that you cheat on your taxes. But if I say I live in Austin, the nearly universal response is: ‘Oh, Austin is cool.’ For them, living in Austin is forgivable in a way that living in Texas is not.” His book is partly a reaction to this prejudice – in favour of the rest of the state, and sometimes at the expense of Austin, which has become one of the whitest and most “economically segregated cities in the country”. A Texan friend of Wright’s, on moving to California, said to him, “It’s confusing … I’ve never lived in a place where everybody agrees with me.” But Austin is becoming that kind of place. (It was an Austinite, Bill Bishop, who reported on this phenomenon in The Big Sort – about the fact that the US is increasingly arranging itself into homogeneous enclaves.) Wright, though suspicious of this obsession with Californication, “sometimes bridles at the elite disdain that Californians express toward my state”. Yet the Texas model he has in mind isn’t Austin, it’s Houston – one of those Texas cities that gets a bad rap from outsiders; it will soon overtake Chicago as the country’s third-largest metropolitan area, behind New York and Los Angeles. “All the growth has been Latino, African American and Asian,” according to Stephen Klineberg of the Kinder Institute, a local charity. “Houston is now the single most ethnically diverse metro area in the country.” That’s partly because of the absence of zoning laws. Liberal politicians figured that zones were a way of keeping people out, so in Houston you can build pretty much anything anywhere. And it’s worked – Houston routinely tops lists of “best places to live” and has (according to the Washington Post) one of the five best restaurant scenes in the US, not to mention an “excellent opera and … more theatre space than any city except New York”. If only so much of it weren’t built on a flood plain. Which is one reason the centre of the US energy industry is going to have to face the problem of climate change. “The hope for Houston and Texas is that it is in our basic DNA to do what is needed to succeed,” Klineberg tells Wright. And his friend Mimi Swartz, a longtime writer for the Texas Monthly, puts it this way: “This place could be either London or Lagos.” On the whole, Wright is semi-optimistic. Part of the point of the book is to talk about the way the kinds of stories he tells shape people’s sense of where they live. The myths matter, too. “Sanford Levinson, a distinguished law professor at [the University of Texas], compares Texas to Scotland – another formerly independent nation that has never entirely accepted the loss of its independence.” As it happens, I grew up with Sandy, another Texan Jew – he’s a colleague of my parents. There’s a toast Jews make at Passover: “Next year in Jerusalem,” we say, at the end of the service. For me, and my brother and two sisters who live away, the Jerusalem we dream of coming back to is Austin. • Benjamin Markovits discusses his new novel, A Weekend in New York (Faber), at the British Library, London NW1, on Tuesday.

Read through the list of any broadsheet’s arts reviewers and you’ll be faced with a parade of white, middle-class men, almost all of them based in London. No wonder, then, that art criticism is often out of touch and impenetrable to anyone who doesn’t have an MA in art history. Enter: The White Pube. Created by Zarina Muhammad and Gabrielle de la Puente, The White Pube describe themselves as “art critic baby gods” – two 23-year-old women who want to write about contemporary art on their own terms. The name alone, a cheeky play on the White Cube gallery, embodies their fresh, tongue-in-cheek approach to art writing, which doesn’t so much aim to deconstruct the hierarchy of low and high art as shatter it completely. “Keeping things to a minimum and masking the edges felt like the tone of the show, which is danggggerous when white curator is showing female black artist,” runs their review of Sonia Boyce at Manchester Art Gallery. Or as their emoji review puts it: 🌌🔦🎆 The White Pube publish weekly reviews and “baby essays” on their website, but unlike most publications, their Twitter and Instagram posts are as central to their output as long-form writing. The two also host a podcast and put up the occasional YouTube video. Muhammad and De la Puente met in 2015 on the fine art BA course at Central St Martins and bonded over their growing frustration with the art world – which both were beginning to realise they wanted nothing to do with. “So many critics presume that they have the authority to predict your response [to an artwork],” says Muhammad. “It’s all outdated. Art critics are either trying to canonise artworks for the market or actively make contemporary art history. The White Pube, by contrast, is about the immediate encounter we have with the art.” While traditional criticism is a value judgment on art – it’s a one star or a five star; good or bad – The White Pube go with gut instinct. “Feelings are so often seen as inadequate,” says Muhammad. And yet not liking a painting because a brushstroke makes you feel ill is a completely valid reaction, even if it’s one you might feel stupid for saying out loud. Writing in tandem has helped the pair figure out how to eloquently express those immediate visceral reactions in a way that others on the margins of the art world can relate to. “Our reviews are a litmus test or a guide rope to anchor people to certain aspects of an artwork. I think it goes back to the reason we started The White Pube in the first place. We valued the reviews you would give a friend, by word of mouth or Facebook messenger, more than what the Evening Standard had written.” You can tell in the writing where we’ve gotten in relationships, or what we’re going through in terms of mental health. It all seeps in and shapes the text The White Pube’s subjective, personal, almost confessional approach to art criticism has been labelled “embodied criticism” and for Muhammad and De la Puente, it works. A White Pube review consciously takes in everything from the pair’s individual emotions before they enter the exhibition to current social and political concerns (white appropriation of black bodies, say) via private problems they’re facing in their own lives. “I reviewed Marguerite Humeau’s show [last November] at Tate Britain,” says Muhammad. “I wasn’t having a good time of it and I took it out on the art.” In this way, she notes, The White Pube has become a tender, vulnerable journal of their lives over the past three years. De la Puente concurs: “You can tell in the writing where we’ve gotten in relationships, or what we’re going through in terms of mental health. It all seeps in and shapes the text.” This uber-personal approach goes some way to explaining their signature style – a hybrid of emoji-rich text-speech and first person stream-of-consciousness. “We didn’t really know what we were doing,” says Muhammad. “It was just about getting our feelings out – the way the words are positioned isn’t what matters.” While Muhammad’s reviews are hurried and dotted with mistakes (“I commit to the typo” she tells me), De la Puente’s are more carefully crafted. “I’ll go to an exhibition as early as possible in the week and write that same day,” she says. “Then I spend the whole week going back to that text, until it feels representative of my exact experience.” While this might raise the question of legibility, The White Pube’s readership numbers suggest that they’re onto something. Their website has hit 13,000 monthly visits, from predominantly 25 to 35-year-old women. On Instagram, they’ve just reached 10,000 followers and they’re featured among activists and models on Dazed and Confused’s 2018 Dazed 100 list – “your guide to the people whose moment is now”. The White Pube’s subjectivity and their frank political stance is clearly resonating with a younger audience in a way traditional art publications aren’t able to. The pair make an effort to review women and BAME artists who aren’t London-based and to call out hypocrisies. “It’s important for us to be vocal because we don’t look or sound like critics,” says Muhammad. At the opening of Zoë Paul’s La Perma-Perla Kraal Emporium in Bristol, Muhammad and De la Puente used their co-written review to highlight the “BASIC, VIOLENT issue” of a white artist using black bodies in their art. “[S]he’s got a solo show at a big institution ha ha ha ofc no one can say anything now,” they wrote, “except we can and will and did, even tho we are tired of being the only ones to do so.” When I ask them over email about the Paul review, they don’t hold back. “[B]odies of colour should be given the agency to represent themselves,” they say. “N if u wana put a black body in a gallery so bad, commission a black artist instead of a white one.” Likewise, they’re critical of Luke Willis Thompson’s Turner prize nomination for his solo exhibition, Autoportrait – because while the work looks at police brutality in America and black trauma, the artist himself is a New Zealander of mixed European and Fijian heritage. The pair say that they condemn Thompson’s nomination because he is a “white-passing” artist making work about, and therefore profiting from, the violence experienced by African Americans. “[Thompson] hasn’t got the agency to speak on this as an issue in an authoritative way, and he certainly has no right whatsoever to turn black pain into a spectacle (as he has done),” the pair email. “We come from a very specific place where we don’t believe that white artists should ever attempt to represent bodies of colour within their work because of connotations and gaze those representations come with. Critics of LWT’s work are being silenced by liberal voices within the art world who are calling the work a “starter for an uncomfortable conversation” which is violent bollocks. “We’re supported by people who agree that the art world is fucked – but also by people who feel powerless to change that,” they conclude. “I think that’s why it feels like we are a cult success. There are a lot of people in agreement with us about it being a white, cishet, male space for rich middle-class knobs.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/24/first-thoughts-nhs-70th-birthday-tories","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T11:36:55Z","webTitle":"Stop scrimping, Theresa May – or the NHS’s 70th birthday will be its last | Polly Toynbee","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/first-thoughts-nhs-70th-birthday-tories","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/first-thoughts-nhs-70th-birthday-tories","fields":{"headline":"Stop scrimping, Theresa May – or the NHS’s 70th birthday will be its last","bodyText":"This is it. The bailiffs are at the door waving the red-ink bill. Pay up or else. For eight years the government has stuck the NHS bill behind the clock but now the crunch has come. Will July’s NHS 70th birthday be a celebration or a funeral? The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), grand truth-teller of fiscal facts, alongside the Health Foundation, an NHS pulse-taker, declare the service needs – absolutely, unequivocally needs – funds that add another £2000 a year per household in tax over the next 15 years. That’s a sum to drain the blood from any chancellor’s cheek. But this government has only itself to blame for the unpaid bill, with eight years of flat funding, harsher than the NHS has ever known. With social care, it needs 4% more a year: hard demographics show 4 million more over-65s will cause 40% more hospital admissions. Battle rages between the treasury, No 10 and the health department, with the chancellor proffering half what’s required. Look, says the treasury, how the shroud-wavers warned the NHS would implode every year since 2010, but on it goes, each winter the “worst”. OK, so waiting lists soar, cancer waits stretch, a shortage of doctors and nurses cripples services – but frankly, where’s the outcry? We’re even ahead in the polls! Yes, the NHS is getting worse ratings, but so what? We saw off the junior doctors; they won’t try that again in a hurry. People have died in A&amp;E waiting to be admitted – but there hasn’t been any one scandalous case to shock the public. Yes, the Mail sometimes demands a hyper-expensive cancer drug to prolong the life of some dying patient, but we can handle those one-offs. Besides, we can always point to inefficiencies, even after these lean years: why do procurement costs and the number of post-operative bed-days still vary wildly? Tough it out! Austerity forever! Are you MPs true state-shrinking Tories or lily-livered statists? Against that complacency stands the other politically reality: an NHS growing weaker, offering worse and less, failing in modern technology, trailing behind international survival rates. This is the “choice in a generation” says IFS director, Paul Johnson. Politically, the all-party Commons health and social care committee “wholeheartedly endorses” the report: 5% more a year is needed immediately, 4% in future once the damage is repaired. The NHS has survived starvation better than expected, but its demise is a slow slide crisis and a political price will eventually be paid for a squalid service. The prime minister has fixed upon the 70th birthday for its rebirth, but half measures will signal an ending, not a new beginning. These figures are not a negotiating salvo, but a bare minimum. If that £2000 per household by 2034 is an eye-popping sum, that’s still only a quarter of the extra growth households will get by then. In polls people swear they would, personally, pay more for the NHS. But politicians fear that tax-raisers get punished on election day. Every low accounting trick has been tried, with trusts ordered to switch capital funds to current spending, leaving nothing to replace old scanners or fix leaking roofs. Thumb screws are applied to managers, forced to sign impossible “control total” budgets, with high profile executives taken and out and shot to terrorise the rest – none more high profile than Bob Kerslake, recent head of the civil service. Here was a reign of terror indeed if even he could be fired from King’s College hospital. But they can’t fire everyone. This is a national identity question. Is Britain staying in the same league of civilization as the other west Europeans? If so, the NHS needs 9.9% of GDP, instead of the current 7.3% to bring us to their equivalent levels, which Labour did – only to see us tumble back after 2010. Ask what makes people proud to be British and the NHS is forever top, as a fundamental principle of equality for all. We fail miserably to abide by that principle in the rest of life, split by deep political ambivalence on injustices in wealth, income, housing and life chances – but equal care in sickness is a bedrock. Why? For selfish reasons, because everyone uses it, is born in it, dies in it, relies on it to scrape us off the road and save us from crisis. We are proud not to be American – and we know paying privately is cripplingly more expensive. Rightwingers yearning for top-up co-payments and private insurance are rejected utterly by the public: for health, only collectivism works. Will Theresa May finally put her foot down and claim the NHS for her party? If yet again she fudges, ducks and triangulates, then she gifts it back to Labour, its only begetters and its natural guarantors."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"world/2018/may/25/irish-abortion-referendum-explained-what-you-need-to-know","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T06:48:09Z","webTitle":"What you need to know:  the Irish abortion referendum explained","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/25/irish-abortion-referendum-explained-what-you-need-to-know","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/25/irish-abortion-referendum-explained-what-you-need-to-know","fields":{"headline":"What you need to know:  the Irish abortion referendum explained","bodyText":"Ireland’s 3.2 million voters cast their ballots on Friday in a referendum to decide whether to repeal the eighth amendment to the country’s constitution. A yes vote would allow the government to overhaul an abortion law that is among the most restrictive in Europe. What is the eighth amendment? The eighth amendment is a clause inserted into the Irish constitution after a referendum in 1983. It recognises an equal right to life for both mother and unborn child, effectively prohibiting abortion in almost all cases. Why was it introduced? Abortion had been illegal in Ireland since the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861. But with reform under way around Europe and many countries opting to permit abortions on request until 12 weeks or more, anti-abortion campaigners in Ireland sought the greater security of a constitutional amendment. What does the law say now? Two further referendums were held in 1992, resulting in the 13th amendment, which allows women to travel in and out of Ireland to have an abortion (pro-repeal campaigners say 170,000 have done so), and the 14th, which authorises information about abortion services overseas. In 2013, the law was changed to permit abortions when doctors feel a woman’s life may be at risk from pregnancy complications or suicide. Otherwise, a doctor unlawfully performing an abortion faces prosecution and up 14 years in jail. What led to the calls for liberalisation? The 1992 referendums came after the supreme court overturned an order barring a 14-year-old girl (“Case X”) who was pregnant as the result of rape from going to Britain for an abortion. It ruled that the girl’s suicidal thoughts posed a “real and substantial risk” to the lives of both her and the unborn child. The European court of human rights ruled in 2010 that Ireland was violating the convention on human rights because of the lack of clarity over legal abortions. In 2012, Savita Halappanavar died in hospital in Galway after being denied an abortion during a miscarriage, prompting the 2013 Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act allowing abortions in certain very strictly controlled circumstances. In 2016, the UN called on Ireland to reverse its strict prohibition and for the first time the Irish state compensated a woman, Amanda Mellet, whose foetus had a fatal anomaly, for the trauma she suffered from having to go abroad for an abortion. In 2017, a citizens’ assembly established by the government recommended unrestricted access to abortion during early pregnancy, and the referendum – required because the proposal involves changing the constitution – was called earlier this year. What happens if the yes campaign wins? If Ireland votes to repeal the eighth amendment, the relevant article in the constitution, 40.3.3, will be replaced by the phrase: “Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.” The government has published draft legislation that would allow relatively free abortions up to 12 weeks, subject to consultation with a doctor and a short waiting period. Termination will be possible up to 24 weeks if two doctors consider a woman’s life is threatened or there is serious risk to her health. Observers say anything less than a 5% margin for yes could lead to a guerrilla war in parliament to obstruct or delay the new bill. What do the polls say and when will the result be known? Voting begins at 7am on Friday and finishes at 10pm. Ireland’s two main political parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, are not taking official positions, while Sinn Féin and Labour back yes. Politicians are campaigning personally; the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has described abortion in Ireland as “unsafe, unregulated and unlawful”. Polls predict a tightening race, with yes ahead, but as many as 24% of voters undecided. Irish broadcaster RTE will release an exit poll late on Friday, and final results are expected to be clear by early afternoon on Saturday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/24/mi6-recruitment-advert-james-bond-image-shark-aquarium","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T12:43:16Z","webTitle":"MI6 advert seeks to ditch 'mythical' James Bond image","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/24/mi6-recruitment-advert-james-bond-image-shark-aquarium","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/24/mi6-recruitment-advert-james-bond-image-shark-aquarium","fields":{"headline":"MI6 advert seeks to ditch 'mythical' James Bond image","bodyText":"The advert’s opening shot could be straight from a James Bond movie. Sinister music plays as a shark circles. Seconds later, the scene widens to show a startled child being comforted by his mother in an aquarium. But the message MI6 wants to convey is how the spy agency is less interested in recruiting would-be 007s than people who reflect the diversity of the UK – mothers, for example. “We are intelligence officers, but we don’t do what you think,” the ad’s voiceover says. “It is not keeping your cool in the shark tank. It is picking up the silent cues that matter.” Then comes the payoff: “MI6 – secretly, we are just like you.” The ad, to be shown on Channel 4 on Thursday night, marks the first time MI6 has advertised on television, though it has used cinemas in the past. The security service’s chief, Alex Younger, told reporters at a preview event at MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall, central London: “I want this opportunity to dispel the myths that still too often see potential candidates rule themselves out.“My message remains simple,” he added. “There is no standard MI6 officer. If you have what it takes, then apply to join us.” MI6 is looking to take on an extra 800 people by 2021. Figures for 2016 show that the agency, which had a staff of about 2,500 in 2016, has a serious gender imbalance, with women making up 38% of non-senior staff and occupying just a quarter of senior posts. Just under 7% of non-senior staff are from a black, Asian or minority ethnic background and these groups are not represented at all in the senior ranks. There was a jump in applications after the poisoning of the former Russian military spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. MI6 said this was not a direct response to the Salisbury attack but because spies were constantly in the news. The agency has seen similar recruitment spikes at other times when the profile of spies was raised. To help improve diversity, the agency is reviewing some of the nationality criteria. Currently, candidates must be British and have at least one parent who is British or has substantial ties to Britain. Having one foreign-born parent rules out many potential recruits. “We are making our services’ nationality rules slightly more flexible to support our diversity agenda and enable a wider selection of candidates to join us,” a recruitment official said. Younger, who wants greater diversity to be one of his legacies, has previously said that James Bond is a blessing and a curse for MI6: though the action film franchise offers priceless free publicity, it gives a misleading picture of life as an officer. MI6’s head of recruitment said the aim of the new ad was to turn the Bond image on its head. “The concept was to play on the Bond image but to explain very clearly that this was not James Bond.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/21/london-hospitals-to-replace-doctors-and-nurses-with-ai-for-some-tasks","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T09:21:00Z","webTitle":"London hospitals to replace doctors and nurses with AI for some tasks","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/21/london-hospitals-to-replace-doctors-and-nurses-with-ai-for-some-tasks","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/21/london-hospitals-to-replace-doctors-and-nurses-with-ai-for-some-tasks","fields":{"headline":"London hospitals to replace doctors and nurses with AI for some tasks","bodyText":"One of the country’s biggest hospitals has unveiled sweeping plans to use artificial intelligence to carry out tasks traditionally performed by doctors and nurses, from diagnosing cancer on CT scans to deciding which A&amp;E patients are seen first. The three-year partnership between University College London Hospitals (UCLH) and the Alan Turing Institute aims to bring the benefits of the machine learning revolution to the NHS on an unprecedented scale. Prof Bryan Williams, director of research at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said that the move could have a major impact on patient outcomes, drawing parallels with the transformation of the consumer experience by companies such as Amazon and Google. “It’s going to be a game-changer,” he said. “You can go on your phone and book an airline ticket, decide what movies you’re going to watch or order a pizza … it’s all about AI,” he said. “On the NHS, we’re nowhere near sophisticated enough. We’re still sending letters out, which is extraordinary.” At the heart of the partnership, in which UCLH is investing a “substantial” but unnamed sum, is the belief that machine learning algorithms can provide new ways of diagnosing disease, identifying people at risk of illness and directing resources. In theory, doctors and nurses could be responsively deployed on wards, like Uber drivers gravitating to locations with the highest demand at certain times of day. But the move will also trigger concerns about privacy, cyber security and the shifting role of health professionals. The first project will focus on improving the hospital’s accident and emergency department, which like many hospitals is failing to meet government waiting time targets. “Our performance this year has fallen short of the four-hour wait, which is no reflection on the dedication and commitment of our staff,” said Prof Marcel Levi, UCLH chief executive. “[It’s] an indicator of some of the other things in the entire chain concerning the flow of acute patients in and out the hospital that are wrong.” In March, just 76.4% of patients needing urgent care were treated within four hours at hospital A&amp;E units in England in March – the lowest proportion since records began in 2010. Using data taken from thousands of presentations, a machine learning algorithm might indicate, for instance, whether a patient with abdomen pain was likely to be suffering from a severe problem, like intestinal perforation or a systemic infection, and fast-track those patients preventing their condition from becoming critical. “Machines will never replace doctors, but the use of data, expertise and technology can radically change how we manage our services – for the better,” said Levi. Another project, already underway, aims to identify patients who are are likely to fail to attend appointments. A consultant neurologist at the hospital, Parashkev Nachev, has used data including factors such as age, address and weather conditions to predict with 85% accuracy whether a patient will turn up for outpatient clinics and MRI scans. In the next phase, the department will trial interventions, such as sending reminder texts and allocating appointments to maximise chances of attendance. “We’re going to test how well it goes,” said Williams. “Companies use this stuff to predict human behaviour all the time.” Other projects include applying machine learning to the analysis of the CT scans of 25,000 former smokers who are being recruited as part of a research project and looking at whether the assessment of cervical smear tests can be automated. “There are people who have to look at those all day to see if it looks normal or abnormal,” said Williams. Might staff resent ceding certain duties to computers – or even taking instructions from them? Prof Chris Holmes, director for health at the Alan Turing Institute, said the hope is that doctors and nurses will be freed up to spend more time with patients. “We want to take out the more mundane stuff which is purely information driven and allow time for things the human expert is best at,” he said. When implementing new decision-making tools, the hospital will need to guard against “learned helplessness”, where people become so reliant on automated instructions that they abandon common sense. While an algorithm might be correct 99.9% of the time, according to Holmes, “once in a blue moon it makes a howler”. “You want to quantify the risk of that,” he added. UCLH is aiming to circumvent privacy concerns that have overshadowed previous collaborations, including that of the Royal Free Hospital in London and Google’s DeepMind, in which the hospital inadvertently shared the health records of 1.6 million identifiable patients. Under the new partnership, algorithms will be trained on the hospital’s own servers to avoid any such breaches and private companies will not be involved, according to Holmes. “We’re critically aware of patient sensitivity of data governance,” he said. “Any algorithms we develop will be purely in-house.” Questions also remain about the day-to-day reality of integrating sophisticated AI software with hospital IT systems, which are already criticised for being clunky and outdated. And there will be concerns about whether the move to transfer decision-making powers to algorithms would make hospitals even more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Hospital IT systems were brought to a standstill last year after becoming victim to a global ransomware attack that resulted in operations being cancelled, ambulances being diverted and patient records being unavailable. Williams acknowledged that adapting NHS IT systems would be a challenge, but added “if this works and we demonstrate we can dramatically change efficiency, the NHS will have to adapt.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/20/bob-dudley-bp-doesnt-need-drill-russia-real-money-boardroom","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T06:44:30Z","webTitle":"BP boss's pay may be excessive – but protests won't threaten him","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/20/bob-dudley-bp-doesnt-need-drill-russia-real-money-boardroom","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/20/bob-dudley-bp-doesnt-need-drill-russia-real-money-boardroom","fields":{"headline":"BP boss's pay may be excessive – but protests won't threaten him","bodyText":"Just like Napoleon, Leon Trotsky and (presumably by early July) England football manager Gareth Southgate, BP boss Bob Dudley knows all about swift retreats from Russia. In 2008 the veteran oil exec fled the country, and his then post as head of BP’s Russian joint venture TNK-BP, following an “orchestrated campaign of harassment”. Still, having become chief executive of the whole of BP in 2010, Dudley now takes his persecution from more genteel City types, and who would blame him for that? The flight from Moscow – it was provoked by some henchman bugging Dudley’s office, among other things – has always sounded mildly terrifying. But it has been replaced in Dudley’s life by the confected spectacle of the annual “BP pay row”, where a few fund managers politely ask the American each year if he might consider sparing the chaps any embarrassment by not trousering such a vulgar pay packet. Somehow, that lacks similar levels of menace. The recent headlines reveal what a charade a City campaign of harassment can be: “BP risks fresh pay row in 2017 over boss Dudley’s share award” (Sky News); “BP faces investor revolt over chief executive’s pay” (Financial Times, 2016); “BP boss faces investor protest vote against £10m pay packet” (Daily Mail, 2015). With the group’s shareholders preparing for the oil major’s latest annual meeting this week, the same stories have returned again. Shareholder advisory service Pirc has told BP investors: “Performance share awards granted during the year under review are excessive, amounting to 363.7% of salary for the chief executive. Total variable pay for the year under review is also inappropriately excessive, amounting to 581% of salary.” Yet despite all of this noise and common sense, shareholders will get to vote this week on a pay packet of $13.4m (£9.9m) – which has actually risen from the $11.9m that appeared to be causing so much irritation the year before. You’d be forgiven for thinking that Dudley simply has to endure a bit of sniping each May as a condition of earning eight figures. So, maybe he should be asked to take a pay cut by a shadowy figure with a Russian accent who Dudley discovers sitting in his office one morning? At least that would be original. Still, while avarice might be one of the seven Dudley sins, the system looks more culpable. Rival Royal Dutch Shell, which is also facing a “pay revolt” this week, has been criticised by the admirably persistent Pirc too for its “excessive” executive pay. Chief executive Ben van Beurden’s “total realised variable pay” is considered “excessive” at 471% of his base salary and there has been a similarly depressing history of these protests. But all of these huge wage packets are devised by businesspeople – whose own interests are hardly served by suppressing executive pay. On Shell’s remuneration committee is Gerard Kleisterlee, a former Philips boss who the FT says was “unrepentant” when he got caught up in a pay row at the electronics group. At BP, the longest-serving member of the remuneration committee is Ian Davis, the former boss of management consultant McKinsey, a firm which some partly credit with creating the “CEO-to-worker gap” in pay through its efforts in the 1950s with General Motors. Tactics may be more civilised in the City, but when comparing London to Moscow it is tempting to ask one question: which city runs the biggest racket?"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/2018/may/21/see-infinity-using-mirrors-notes-queries","type":"article","sectionId":"lifeandstyle","sectionName":"Life and style","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T10:30:23Z","webTitle":"Using lots of mirrors, can you see infinity?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/21/see-infinity-using-mirrors-notes-queries","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/21/see-infinity-using-mirrors-notes-queries","fields":{"headline":"Using lots of mirrors, can you see infinity?","bodyText":"Given a theoretically perfect set of mirrors reflecting into each other and a perfect set of eyes, can you see infinity?

His books 1491 and 1493, looking at the Americas before and after Columbus, were widely acclaimed. His new book, The Wizard and the Prophet, examines the highly influential and starkly contrasting environmental visions of Norman Borlaug (the Wizard) and William Vogt (the Prophet). Borlaug (1914-2009) was instrumental in the green revolution that vastly expanded the amount of food humanity has been able to cultivate. Vogt (1902-1968) was a pioneering ecologist who argued that humans had exceeded the Earth’s “carrying capacity” and were heading for cataclysm unless consumption was drastically reduced. One believed in scientific ingenuity as the answer to our problems, the other was convinced that it only deepened the crisis. What made you frame this story of humanity’s future in terms of these two individuals? It really started the night my daughter was born 19 years ago. I was standing in the parking lot at three in the morning and it suddenly popped into my head that when Amelia, my daughter, became my age there would be almost 10 billion people in the world. And I believe that centuries from now, when historians look back at the time when you and I have been alive, the big thing that they’ll say happened is that hundreds of millions of people in Asia and Latin America and Africa lifted themselves from destitution to something like the middle class. So not only will there be 10 billion people but all those people will want the same things you and I want – nice homes, nice car, nice clothes, the odd chunk of Toblerone, right? And so I stood there in the parking lot and thought to myself: how are we meant to do this? I’m a science journalist, so when I was talking to researchers, I’d say: “How are we going to feed everybody, how are we going to get water for everybody, house everybody? What are we going to do about climate change?” After a while I realised that the answers I was getting fell into two broad categories, each of which had a name that kept being associated with it: one was Borlaug, the other Vogt. You examine each argument on its strengths and weaknesses without necessarily expressing an opinion. Was that difficult? It was difficult to some extent as I have – like anyone else – a full kit of knee-jerk prejudices and unexamined beliefs. So I thought, let’s be fair here. Partly because I think this is what a journalist should do, and partly because in the age of the internet there are all too many people who are willing to tell you what to think and not nearly enough trying to report what’s going on. And I thought that was a more valuable service. I can contribute something as a reporter. The instant I start spouting out my own beliefs I become just another guy on the internet. How much do you think the respective arguments come down in the end to whether one is an optimist or a pessimist? I think that in the end it has to do with people’s fundamental perceptions of what the good life is like, what the world is like and what people are like. I don’t know where those come from, but people have them. I have them. Once you understand that, you realise there’s a certain type of person who sees people as endlessly inventive, these wily managers and thinkers and doers that can expand endlessly. And other people who see us as fundamentally embedded in the community, as part of something larger, and we shouldn’t wreck that larger thing. You write about how in the past in the ecology movement there was a fascistic desire to control human reproduction. Do you think there is a deep-lying seam of misanthropy among ecologists? It’s certainly a big streak historically. The environmental movement originally came from the upper-crust types who were the same people involved in eugenics. They saw it as a cleaning up and purifying of nature, and that unless human reproduction was governed by wise people, very bad things would result. You do still find that attitude. When I give talks, there’s almost always a guy in the audience, usually a silver-haired, distinguished-looking gent, who says: “The real problem is population and we’ve got to control it.” Then they say we have to reduce the population of the Earth by 50% or something. So it’s still present. Younger people who are involved in the movement are considerably less enthusiastic about limiting the reproduction of poor people and brown people. Do you think it’s possible to make effective international laws governing the environment? Well, there’s a couple of examples of them. The big one is the Montreal protocol, which is the law that limits the production of gases that deplete the ozone layer, and it’s been extraordinarily successful. I’m much more sceptical about things like the Paris agreement. Not because it was badly intended, but conditions in countries are so unlike one another that it’s very hard to come up with a blanket approach that fits everything. Norman Borlaug is known in scientific circles, but he’s not a household name in the way that Albert Einstein is. Giving the profound effect of his work, should he better known? Yes. If you look at it, the average person needs something in the order of 2,200 calories a day to be moderately active. Some time in the 1980s, the average person in the world had that necessary level of calories for the first time in human history and, for the first time, most people on the planet had a regular supply of food. Borlaug and the people he inspired had a huge impact on that. If I were teaching history to teenagers I would say there were two big events in the 20th century. The first was the development of antibiotics and the second was the green revolution, and they have changed our lives unimaginably. Throw in the emancipation of women and you have a really remarkable century. Given that the Earth must have limits, is there a danger of the boy who cried wolf in the continual warnings of impending environmental disaster? I would say that there are two dangers. The first is that while it’s obviously true on some level that the world is finite, and there are only a certain number of molecules, it’s very unclear exactly where that limit lies. And it’s very difficult to find out. The second is that there’s this terrible trap that people fall victim to again and again, the idea that the relationship between consumption and population is simple and straightforward. That’s simply not the case. Having done such extensive research, do you now feel more or less reassured by what the future holds? One of the arguments of the book is that both Vogt and Borlaug essentially had a biological view of our species and our planet. And there’s much to be gained from that – but they were both almost totally ignorant of the human sciences, economics, sociology, psychology, political science. And the conclusion I came to was that you could successfully follow either the Wizard’s or the Prophet’s path and people who feel one way or the other could be quite happy. But the human part of the equation is the real issue. I think that we can succeed, but it’s not at all clear to me that we will succeed. In the United States we’re experiencing a time when the national government is really quite dysfunctional but local governments are doing all kinds of very interesting things. And I don’t know which of those different paths will prevail in the end. If our future depends on our national government, we’re really in trouble. • The Wizard and the Prophet by Charles Mann is published by Picador (£25).

Slowly, but it’s changing’","bodyText":"Karachi is the capital of the province of Sindh, the most populous city in Pakistan and among the biggest in the world. Bordering the Arabian Sea, it is home to more than 21 million people. Here football is the opiate of the people. It comes as no surprise that Hajra Khan first played outside her home with other children, keeping goal in a net chalked out against a neighbouring wall. However, it was not until she was 14, preoccupied with basketball and track and field, that her mother came across football tryouts in the local Sunday paper and told her to give it a shot. Ten years on, Khan’s talent has forced football to transcend the country’s historically rigid gender norms and has proved to be a vehicle for change. Khan was made captain of the Pakistan women’s team at the age of 20. She is the country’s highest-scoring female footballer, a Unicef ambassador and the first Pakistani player, male or female, to be signed by a foreign club. As a child Khan was quiet but she has been anything but when it comes to her national team’s struggle for equality. At the most recent training camp the women were paid $3 a day to the men’s $10. “Dentists, economists, engineers and school girls quit their livelihoods just to be at that camp, a camp that pays a quarter of what they were earning,” Khan says. Demands from the women’s team for more appear to have had an impact. It was announced in April that the wage would be increased to $10 a day – although the men’s pay was doubled to $20. Khan’s fight is part of a global picture, with female footballers across the US, Norway, Brazil, Ireland and most recently New Zealand demanding gender parity. Though there is no ignoring the signs of progress in Pakistan, with a historic transgender rights bill passed this month, sexism is pervasive in the Islamic country – which gained notoriety for arguably being one of the most oppressive countries for women, ranking second-worst on the Global Gender Gap index. Men’s teams are not only paid more but granted priority in pitch bookings over women’s teams, who then have to train on cricket pitches or any surface that suffices. And the problems run deeper. “Say if there’s a photo with the national team on Facebook, there’s going to be 100 negative comments about how she’s not Muslim, how she’s a disgrace to the country,” Khan says. “They don’t care of the skill that the girl has, or the credibility that she holds, or that she’s representing the national team.” In an attempt to improve football in Pakistan, Khan has spent the past few months organising international friendlies and local matches to keep the team active, despite the absence of structural support and a lack of Fifa affiliation, which means they cannot be officially labelled a national side. It is uncertain whether they will be able to participate in the Asian Games, which begin in Indonesia in August. Khan has travelled for trials in Germany with the Bundesliga clubs SGS Essen, FSV Guterslohand and VFL Sindelfingen, appeared in Coca‑Cola advertisements and played in the Maldives National Women’s League but is still assailed with remarks about female fragility and doubts about how a woman could pursue a “man’s game”. Her reply? “If your son can play it, I sure as hell can play better than he can.” Shattering this stereotypical mindset is not straightforward but Khan did recently break a world record: she played the world’s lowest-altitude football match on the shores of Jordan’s Dead Sea, 420m below sea level. The event, organised by Equal Playing Field, a non-profit organisation pushing to end gender inequality in sport, brought together women of 29 nationalities. They hiked through the desert mountains, organised football clinics in local towns and played the record‑breaking match – in which Khan scored the winning goal despite having a broken toe from parading around the Seven Pillars of Wisdom hours earlier. “We spoke about how things work in our country and how each of us has struggled to make a mark whether in our sport or in the work that we’re doing,” Khan says. “And we realised that everyone was paid unfairly, treated poorly, and we kind of figured the only way to make this work was to work together for our cause and raise awareness.” While Khan finishes her degree in international relations from the London School of Economics, she is dreaming of creating an NGO to combat the stigma of mental illness among professional athletes and starting an academy to provide girls with direction from a younger age. We speak just after she has returned home from giving her first TED talk in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, focused on athletes and mental health. She opened up about her clinical depression in an attempt to destigmatise mental illness among professional athletes. “When an athlete gets physically injured, there’s doctors, physiotherapists, everyone’s trying to work on their recovery so the player can get back on the field as fit as possible, but when it comes to their health issues, the treatment is not the same,” Khan says pointedly. “If you have some sort of illness, you’re portrayed as weak and as athletes we’re not supposed to be weak; it’s a complete antithesis of what athletes are supposed to be.” Khan feels there is a lack of female role models and managers. To encourage more girls to play, and in the hope of serving as a mentor Khan has visited players’ houses to convince parents of their daughters’ talents and offer support. “I feel like it’s changing,” she says. “Slowly, but it’s definitely changing.” Change came most recently in Peshawar, in northern Pakistan, with announcements of a first transgender sports league. When she heard the news, Khan beamed with happiness. She plans to contact the league and expand it to other cities. “I have great friends in the transgender community who are fighting the cause day and night. I think football can make a big difference if we work together.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"business/2018/may/18/virgin-trains-east-coast-franchise-passengers","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T16:06:19Z","webTitle":"The bad bet at the heart of the East Coast rail franchise implosion","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/virgin-trains-east-coast-franchise-passengers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/18/virgin-trains-east-coast-franchise-passengers","fields":{"headline":"The bad bet at the heart of the East Coast rail franchise implosion","bodyText":"At the root of the collapse of the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise, confirmed this week, was the expectation that rail passenger numbers could go only one way: up. Two decades of consistent growth had fostered the assumption that demand would keep rising, the only question being how high. That assumption has been proved wrong. Instead, demand has dropped not only on mainline inter-city routes but on commuter rail franchises and London’s tube network, where annual numbers are down 1.5%. Bus journey numbers are also down, dipping under 5bn in 2017 for the first time in a decade. Even on London’s comparatively cheap and regulated network they declined by 0.7%. Passenger numbers usually shadow two broad indicators: population and economic activity. The only previous drop in rail journeys since privatisation came during the financial crisis in 2008/9. Stephen Glaister, emeritus professor of transport and infrastructure at Imperial College London, says it is unclear whether the slowdown is a blip or a longterm trend. “Who knows? That’s a question about Brexit and the state of the economy. Rail travel is particularly sensitive, as it is disproportionately used by higher income bands and people in work.” More people working from home or irregularly, as suggested by falling season ticket sales, could spell a longer-term decline. However, Glaister pointed to the impact of strike disruption and poor performance in the south-east, which accounts for 70% of rail journeys in Britain. An increase in online living – whether shopping, watching films or ordering food – has cut trips to the high street, cinemas and restaurants. The biggest growth sector in transport is in light commercial vehicles, or vans. The transport policy expert David Begg says this has a direct impact on bus travel. “A third of bus passengers are headed to the shops, but retailers are making more and more money online - that’s a structural change,” Begg said. Also, a significant number of those not staying at home for Netflix and Deliveroo are using Uber rather than public transport, when previously they may never have considered a traditional black cab. In London, the number of licensed private hire vehicles has almost doubled in five years and there are now more than 40,000 Uber drivers on the capital’s streets. Another factor cutting public transport use in London is likely to be the number of people moving out of the city, which has risen in the last five years. There are also concerns about personal safety, terror attacks and overcrowding on the tube, which TfL surveys have found are held by a significant minority. In the first three months of 2018 there were 15m fewer passenger journeys on the tube than TfL had budgeted for. Concerns are now growing over how Transport for London will sustain its finances, at a time when central government support has been reduced to zero. Congestion also deters travel, not just in London but in every big conurbation. Begg says: “Congestion is the enemy of the bus. Speeds are declining by 10% a decade on average in conurbations across the UK – and that leads to a 10-14% decline in patronage.” While a mass conversion to cycling, which is increasing, would take vehicles off the road, in the short term the construction of cycle superhighways has worsened traffic around London and hit the travel times and punctuality of buses. Begg, however, blames one particular policy for increasing the number of car journeys and congestion: eight years of freezing fuel duty. “[That] has led to more people travelling by car. Motoring costs have been falling while bus and train fares have been going up and up. To get more people on to sustainable transport, the price signals are all wrong.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"business/2018/may/20/brexit-not-going-to-plan-did-we-ever-have-a-plan","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T06:00:49Z","webTitle":"It’s said Brexit is ‘not going to plan’.

Did we ever have a plan?","bodyText":"Your correspondent is not as well up on social media as his wife and children, but I could not help noticing a slogan posted beneath a London traffic light the other day. It claimed to be from the Instagram project Notes to Strangers – new to me, I must confess – and confidently proclaimed: “Having a Plan B will make your Plan A unsuccessful”. This was on yet another day when the press was full of reports about the chaos within Theresa May’s hapless government about the Brexit “negotiations” – negotiations that seem to be taking place mainly within her warring cabinet rather than with the rest of the EU. And – surprise, surprise – neither of the proposals supposedly being discussed is in any case considered remotely viable by most, indeed all, of the experts I have talked to. But back to the traffic-light slogan. It is of course an absurd statement, if mildly amusing. And, goodness knows, don’t we need some light relief as an irresponsible government proceeds with its apparent mission to tear itself and the country apart? The situation is so potentially dire that I often meet intelligent people who just cannot face hearing about Brexit – a development which may have something to do with an apparent decline in the audience for the Today programme, which commentators like myself have to listen to, however annoying it is that the presenters confuse the referendum result, which happened, with Brexit, which has not and one hopes never will. Also, our much-loved BBC gives far too much scope to the likes of Mr Farage. It is abundantly clear that this dreadful government does not have a Plan B, or even a Plan A that might be rendered unsuccessful by a Plan B. Last week there was even talk of a Plan C, which had already been dismissed by the Irish government. Now, mention of Farage reminds me of one of the more intriguing recent statements from another member of the Dishonourable Company of Brexiters. Daniel Hannan, who, like Farage, draws a comfortable salary from the EU he wishes us to leave, is a veteran Leaver but managed to merit the newspaper headline “Brexiteer Hannan says leaving the EU not quite going to plan”. It wasn’t entirely clear whether my acquaintance Mr Hannan had Plan A or Plan B in mind. But, he tells us: “I had assumed that, by now, we’d have reached a broad national consensus around a moderate form of withdrawal that recognises the narrowness of the result.” At least, unlike the prime minister and the cabinet Brexiters, he recognises that the referendum result was not an “overwhelming” vote to abandon a 45-year achievement in integrating our economy with the rest of Europe. Along with the majority of the Lords, and the more enlightened Tory and Labour MPs, Mr Hannan sees the advantages of access to the single market and the fallback position of Efta, the European Free Trade Association. But why bother? The Brexiters, and those who have caved in to them, keep trying to cherry-pick advantages, such as involvement in the Galileo navigation system, which are threatened by Brexit. But, as the EU’s patient chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, says: “We are not kicking the UK out … The UK decided unilaterally and autonomously to withdraw from the EU. This implies leaving its programmes as well.” The farce deepens. Recently the Department for International Trade had to appeal for funds from the Treasury. Why? Because it was cutting back on services that help our exports to tried and trusted markets in order to waste resources on trying to realise the trade secretary’s fantasy of new agreements elsewhere. The dream of a wonderful trade deal with Trump’s America has been exposed in a study, entitled On The Rebound by Ed Balls and others for the Harvard Kennedy School. It concludes: “All things considered, both US and UK officials are doubtful that a meaningful deal can be reached.” As for the Irish border problem, I have yet to meet any serious person who thinks it is soluble. The incompatibility of May’s “red lines” on the customs union and the single market while somehow preserving the status quo in Ireland was a theme of a high-powered discussion at the Irish embassy last week. As Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said to the audience: “Staying in the single market and customs union would protect jobs, rights and peace. If anyone’s got a better plan, then let’s hear it.” No one has. We definitely need a Plan B, and it is the status quo. I am beginning to think that, however much – rightly or wrongly – they are fearful of a Corbyn government, the Tories are heading for the cliff. I just hope they don’t take the rest of us with them. Brexit is pointless."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"artanddesign/2018/may/20/mapleton-crescent-wandsworth-london-high-rise-built-bedfordshire-prefab","type":"article","sectionId":"artanddesign","sectionName":"Art and design","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-20T07:00:50Z","webTitle":"Mapleton Crescent: the London high-rise factory-built in Bedfordshire","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/20/mapleton-crescent-wandsworth-london-high-rise-built-bedfordshire-prefab","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/artanddesign/2018/may/20/mapleton-crescent-wandsworth-london-high-rise-built-bedfordshire-prefab","fields":{"headline":"Mapleton Crescent: the London high-rise factory-built in Bedfordshire","bodyText":"It’s a beautiful chimera, now more than a century old, that a house might be built in the same way as a car. It has long seemed so practical, so sensible and at the same time inspiringly progressive that the benefits that Henry Ford discovered in the production line – speed, efficiency, cheapness, quality – might be applied to the places where we live. Le Corbusier had a go in the 1920s. So did Buckminster Fuller, with the aluminium yurt he called the Dymaxion. Somehow, their machine-age nirvana keeps on not quite happening. The world is not covered with Dymaxia, nor the many other variations on the theme. The nearest Britain came to living the dream was with the postwar prefab – quick and cheap, for sure, but rationed in their comfort and beauty, modern nostalgic revisionism notwithstanding. In the 1960s, government promotion of factory-built housing tended to produce results that were not particularly cheap, or functional, or good-looking, but were at least numerous. Still, nil desperandum. Since the 1980s, office buildings have been built with extensive prefabrication, or modularisation, to use the preferred contemporary name – facade panels and toilet blocks built under cover, away from the wind, rain, muck and hazards of a building site, and craned into place with the satisfying simplicity of a child’s toy. If Britain’s housing shortages are seriously to be addressed, they will require not only land and funding, but also an expansion of the construction industry’s capacity to build. Which, if it is not to entail limitless supplies of labour coming to Brexit Britain from eastern Europe, will require the aid of factories. As in the 1960s, politicians are urging. Last year the London Assembly published a report arguing that off-site manufacturing (as they called it) would be essential to meeting London’s need for at least 50,000 new homes a year. And, possibly, there are at last signs that this holy grail of housing (or the philosopher’s stone, or Fermat’s last theorem, or theory of everything – take your pick among things and solutions that are legendarily hard to find) might be found. Among the reasons to be hopeful is Mapleton Cresent in Wandsworth, south London, a just-finishing 27-storey development wrapped in aqueous green-grey faience. Billed as “Europe’s tallest modular residential tower”, it is designed by the architects Metropolitan Workshop for the developer Pocket Living, who specialise in reducing the cost of housing by producing flats that are small but, they hope, perfectly formed. They aim to compensate for the reduced dimensions of their units through careful design and by adding such shared benefits as a roof terrace, cycle storage and a residents’ lounge. The tower stands on an awkward little site, in spirit part poetic and part functional. One side is the uncompromising flank of the Southside shopping centre, on another the fast-flowing river Wandle, one of those secondary London rivers that are sometimes mentioned and rarely seen. It’s an unlikely spot for a tall building, even in a city where they can now sprout almost anywhere, but with the help of modularisation the developers and architects found a way to do it. Mapleton Crescent is made up of storey-high units, each the size of half a flat, that arrived on site complete with plaster, paint, windows, doors, wiring, plumbing, bathrooms and tiles, and were then craned into place, one on the top of each other, at the rate of one storey per day. These boxes are structural too, meaning that they hold each other up without the need of an additional frame. The factory-made units, built in Bedfordshire by Vision Modular Systems for their contracting business, Donban, saved time – which, as developers like Pocket borrow to build, is money. By going up almost as soon as they arrive, they reduce the problems that come with a small site, which is that builders have nowhere to keep materials that are waiting to be erected. The units require, say Pocket, 60% fewer truck journeys than conventional construction. They produce 90% less waste, which, as refuse from construction sites accounts for a large proportion of landfill, is no small matter. They are better built in small but appreciable ways – tiles and power points that are well aligned, for example – than conventionally built flats. Their efficient structure enables ceiling heights to be a little higher than the standard. Where Mapleton Crescent differs from past visions of factory-made housing is that it feels no need to proclaim its futurism – indeed it’s all the better for making its mechanical DNA feel both domestic and urban. Early prophets such as Buckminster Fuller thought that a home built like a car should look like a car. Here the flats are of a type basically familiar from conventionally built homes. The exterior faience cladding, its precise shade developed by the ceramic artist Loraine Rutt, is itself a factory-made modular material, but one that has been commonplace on London buildings since the 19th century. The building has architectural qualities that are nothing in particular to do with the innovation in its construction. It has a pleasantly slender profile, with shifting rhythms and a nice balance of verticals and horizontals. There is a considered relationship to the river, and an entrance hall that, by bringing the external materials inside, has a durable and well-made feel. The textured surfaces of the faience give a sense of depth and liveliness you don’t get in most cladding systems. Mapleton Crescent is – and never mind that the bar is low – one of the best-looking examples to come out of London’s boom in residential towers. It is plausible because it doesn’t proselytise. Modular units are used not as prophecy but as the best available means in a given circumstance. It must be said that this project is singular. The cost and complexity of building a tower on this site means that Pocket have included 36 homes at full market price (£600,000-£730,000 for two- and three-bedroom flats) to subsidise its 53 cheaper units (at £225,000-£330,000 for a petite, 38 sq metres one-bed – cheapness in London being a strictly relative concept). The same techniques, however, are now being applied to other tall building projects, with a better proportion of affordability. Mapleton Crescent is not alone. The financial services company Legal &amp; General promise to “revolutionise” housing by investing in factory-built houses, the exact nature of which remains to be revealed. The developers Urban Splash have tried their hand at it in their New Islington development in Manchester. Some of the big housebuilding companies are also having a go. There is formidable inertia to be overcome. Most homes are realised by the big housebuilders, who have well-established ways of building involving fleets of sub-contractors, all of which would have to be reinvented to accommodate modular building. It also requires investment in factories and production lines, which require confidence that future demand will be at least steady, which in the booming-and-busting British housing market is hard to find. Building in factories is not a magic bullet. It will not solve the housing crisis, so long as bigger questions such as the supply of land and public investment remain unresolved. But it’s an eminently sane and beneficial way of constructing homes, with less waste and better quality, whose time might finally be coming."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/18/movie-critics-role-in-promoting-violence","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T15:35:57Z","webTitle":"Movie critics’ role in promoting violence | Letter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/18/movie-critics-role-in-promoting-violence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/18/movie-critics-role-in-promoting-violence","fields":{"headline":"Movie critics’ role in promoting violence","bodyText":"The issue of violence in films is being debated as though the only responsibility lies with the directors.

Acting sergeant Claire Boddie told Judah Adunbi, a community elder in Bristol, that he looked “familiar” and, after he refused to give his name, a scuffle broke out and she discharged the stun gun, hitting him in the jaw. Boddie was found not guilty of assault by one of the country’s most senior district judges on Friday after a one-day trial. The Avon and Somerset officer told the court she discharged her weapon believing Adunbi had taken up a “fighting stance” and said had not known whether he had a weapon. In court, Adunbi, also known as Ras Judah, said he had refused to give his name – as is his right – because he had done nothing wrong. Of the moment the stun gun was discharged, he said: “All I heard was a noise then I felt like my head was frying.” Outside court he said: “I hope the fact that this prosecution was brought will mean that other black people in Bristol will not be Tasered in the face when out walking their dog, and that the police will finally realise that not all black people look or act the same.” Supporters of Adunbi expressed concern that Boddie, an experienced officer, had mistaken him for a wanted man. Desmond Brown, a spokesperson for the Justice 4 Judah campaign, said both men had dreadlocks but were not hard to tell apart. “He [Judah] is a community asset, a respected elder. He should have been known by the police.” Brown – who wore a T-short reading: “I am Judah” – did not question the verdict but said elements of the legal process had hit confidence in the community. There has been anger that the trial was held in Salisbury, 60 miles from Bristol. Judah’s supporters believe it should have taken place close to where the incident happened so that justice could be seen to be done. “Some of the process has been alarming,” Brown said. “Perhaps justice isn’t for us, for our community, for people of colour.” He claimed black people in Bristol were more likely to be stopped by police and more likely to be shot with a stun gun. Adunbi’s solicitor, Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy, said: “Ras Judah now awaits the gross misconduct hearing.” It can now be reported that Boddie’s legal team tried to prevent Adunbi from giving evidence at her trial. At a preliminary hearing this week the lawyers argued that because the whole incident was recorded on Boddie’s bodycam, no other testimony or extra video footage was needed. The judge rejected the attempt, saying Adunbi’s evidence was potentially relevant. Adunbi has sat on Bristol’s independent advisory group, which forges links between the police and the community, and has worked with the Crown Prosecution Service’s local community involvement panel. The incident unfolded last year outside Judah’s house in Easton, Bristol. A video taken by a passerby was widely shared on social media and made headlines around the world. Footage shown in court of the moment Adunbi was shot drew gasps from his supporters in the public gallery. Boddie was heard telling Adunbi: “You look familiar.” Judah refused to say who he was, telling Boddie and a colleague: “I’m an African black individual living in my own city.” Adunbi fell to the ground after he was shot and told the officers: “I’m nearly 70 … here’s my fucking ID.” Clearing the officer, the district judge Tan Ikram said: “The issue for me is whether the prosecution have persuaded me that she didn’t act in self-defence. The prosecution failed to persuade me and she is found not guilty of assault for that reason.” Catrin Evans, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) director with responsibility for Avon and Somerset, said: “The IOPC carried out a thorough investigation into the use of Taser which led to the Crown Prosecution Service decision to prosecute [acting Sgt] Boddie. We have found that [she] also has a case to answer for gross misconduct. “Our investigation considered the actions of two officers, including the circumstances leading up to Mr Adunbi’s arrest and the use of Taser. Both Boddie and a second officer involved had no case to answer for misconduct in respect of allegations that they discriminated against Mr Adunbi on the basis of his race.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/23/thomas-frank-trump-populism-books","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T09:31:19Z","webTitle":"Forget Trump – populism is the cure, not the disease","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/23/thomas-frank-trump-populism-books","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/23/thomas-frank-trump-populism-books","fields":{"headline":"Forget Trump – populism is the cure, not the disease","bodyText":"Why are the traditional parties of the left in the western world being defeated in so many places by outrageous blowhards of the right? The answer most often given is that rightwing politicians have discovered and embraced a diabolical form of super-politics known as “populism”. With its combination of magic words and evil deeds, this populism is breaking rules, beguiling voters and winning elections. Populism is a subject I know something about. In the 1980s I studied the angry American agrarians who, a century before, squared off against railroad monopolists. I became fascinated with the populist culture of the Roosevelt era, with all its Fanfares for the Common Man and its admiration for working people. What I saw around me in the 80s, however, was a sort of inverted populism, in which Republicans used the words of Thomas Jefferson to sell plutocracy and the will of the people was confused with the operation of the market. Later, I wrote about the phony populism that now dominates my home state of Kansas, and I followed the careers of right-populist superstars such as Richard Viguerie and Glenn Beck. I watched the country erupt during the bank bailouts and I was a spectator at gatherings of the Tea Party. In my lifetime, the politicians who have most loudly proclaimed their solidarity with the humble producers have been rightwingers. Hypocritical rightwingers, yes, but by and large they have put the fiction over. Today it is the turn of Donald Trump, the “blue-collar billionaire”, to act as tribune of the plebs. In 2016, he won millions of votes from unfortunate toilers in hard-bitten places. Over the affluent zip codes of the US, meanwhile, a wail of aghastitude hangs in the air, a constant moan over Trump’s unfitness for the high office he holds. Aghastitude’s scholarly analogue is my subject here: the devil theory of populism. Yascha Mounk, the author of The People vs Democracy, is a man of impressive establishment credentials: a lecturer at Harvard, a fellow at the New America Foundation and a columnist at Slate. According to his website, he is “one of the world’s leading experts on the crisis of liberal democracy and the rise of populism”. By “populism” Mounk means the species of nasty rightwing politics associated with Trump and various European bad guys such as the leaders of Hungary and Poland. He uses the word as a kind of synonym for racist tyranny, and in his account populist politicians are villainous in ways that go beyond the profession’s conventions. Populists, he informs us, tell lies. They dislike the press, they shatter “norms”, and they aspire to be dictators. They carry what he calls, in a revealing phrase, “the populist disease”. If Mounk represents social-scientific professionalism coming to cure what ails us, however, I fear we are in big trouble. He repeatedly tells us, for example, that rightwing populism is a new, consensus-smashing thing; that before Trump and co came along the politics of the western world were “frozen”; that things “barely changed”; that leaders respected “norms”. He never divulges who invented this hateful populism thing, but he does inform us that “one of the earliest populists” was Jörg Haider, a far-right Austrian politician who died in 2008. I read all this with mounting incredulity. History wasn’t just a nice centrist monotone before Trump and the gang got started. There was a momentous turn in the west that began about 40 years ago; it involved the triumph of business interests over rivals such as the unions and the regulatory state. You know: Thatcher, Reagan, Clinton, Blair and so on. Take my word for it: the rightward turn was a big deal. And it’s still going. It dwarfs Trump; indeed, it subsumes him. Trump’s presidency is just the latest chapter in this ugly story, not some new thing altogether. As for populism, historians typically trace the populist rhetorical tradition in America back to the time of Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. A radical leftwing political party that called itself “Populist” swept much of the country in the 1890s, and protest movements described as populist have come and gone. Populism’s evil rightwing doppelganger is usually dated to 1968, when George Wallace and Richard Nixon figured out how to turn the language of working-class majoritarianism against liberalism. Rightwing populists have been building movements and winning elections in the US ever since. Mounk barely acknowledges any of this. Instead, he asserts a frightening new vision of populism without discussing the old one. “There can no longer be any doubt that we are going through a populist moment,” he writes at one point. “The question now is whether this populist moment will turn into a populist age – and cast the very survival of liberal democracy in doubt.” Sounds bad, all right. Demonic, even. But the phrase “populist moment” rang a bell. I went to my bookshelf and pulled down my copy of – yes – The Populist Moment by the historian Lawrence Goodwyn, a celebrated study of Populism published in 1978. Here is how it starts: “This book is about the flowering of the largest democratic mass movement in American history. It is also necessarily a book about democracy itself.” What Goodwyn meant was that Populism in its 1890s permutation represented a vision of democratic participation that was actually more advanced than what we settle for today. Far from being a threat to democracy, Populism was democracy’s zenith. To produce a whole book on populism while ignoring this completely opposite interpretation strikes me as a serious oversight. Yes, I think we need to understand why liberal democracy is crumbling around the world. But to describe this process with the unmodified “populism” is a mistake. It is, after all, an American word. And the history of American populism contradicts item after item in Mounk’s devil theory. Populism is simply not what he thinks it is. Take its supposed hostility to “ethnic and cultural pluralism”, a critical point in this and many other recent works on the “populist disease”. Yes, Trump and certain European leaders are bigots. But no, that doesn’t retroactively make all populists into racists. The Populist movement of the 1890s, for example, did lots of things wrong, but it’s also remembered for its effort to enlist black farmers alongside southern whites. The labour-union populism of the 1930s, meanwhile, was flamboyantly anti-racist – “a militant brand of producerism open to everyone but bigots and millionaires”, in historian Michael Kazin’s memorable description. And Jesse Jackson, widely described as a populist in 1988, was the leader of what he called the “rainbow coalition”. Mounk implies that populists fundamentally oppose independent regulatory agencies. Yet two of the four American bureaucracies he names were set up by the bank-bashing administration of Franklin Roosevelt and a third at the behest of the populist Elizabeth Warren, a fact widely reported and extremely well known. Mounk also describes populists as would-be, sort-of dictators, a label that might apply to Trump and various others. How accurate would it be, however, to depict the vacillating Al Gore, who was sometimes described as a populist in 2000, as some kind of proto-Napoleon? Or the genial Jim Hightower (“America’s #1 Populist”)? Or the poet Carl Sandburg, who wrote The People, Yes in 1936? Or the ineffectual pacifist William Jennings Bryan? Nor do the vices supposedly specific to populism turn out to be all that unique. Mounk moans, for example, that populists violate “norms” – but, then, so do elitists: in the private sector their actions are called “disruptions” and admired. Populists are also supposed to deal in “simplicity,” in “glib, facile solutions”, which we know they do because this is what Trump does. But so does nearly every politician. Examples: anti-communism, “free trade”, or the way Barack Obama told us federal austerity was necessary because families were “tightening their belts”. William Galston is a different sort of political scientist, occupying a different sweet spot at the intersection of academia and politics. But his Anti-Pluralism amounts to pretty much the same thing: the devil theory of populism, with a few modifications. Again populists are said to reject “pluralism” and the “liberal democratic order”.And again the technique is to read Trump out onto the world, projecting his characteristics on to all populists, ever. This leads to a series of simple mistakes: not all populists are protectionists as Galston asserts; Bryan and Roosevelt both opposed high tariffs. Nor is populism “always anti-pluralist”, as a glance at any federal arts project mural will confirm. Besides, agrarian Populists of the 1890s were way ahead of the game on women’s suffrage. And on and on. Yet Galston, like Mounk, understands that economic stagnation made Trump possible – that growing inequality and the fraying of the middle class played a huge role. He argues that liberal leaders have been “oblivious” to the sufferings of their fellow Americans and that “this blindness is often tinged with meritocratic snobbery toward those with less education and status”. This is exactly right. Unfortunately, in Galston’s telling, these things are all the result of impersonal forces, of “globalisation” and “technological change” adjusting “the balance between labour and capital, setting in motion the slow erosion of the postwar middle class”. Shit happens, you might say. When things got hairy during the great recession, Galston writes, “established parties and institutions found it difficult to respond to rising public discontent”. What a way to describe the Obama administration’s failure. They found it difficult. Difficult to get tough with their funders on Wall Street, I guess he means. Difficult to help out their taken-for-granted voters in unions. I suspect Galston could tell us a lot more about this problem if he chose. In decades past he was a leading light of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group that aimed to stamp out the Democratic party’s hostility to corporations and the wealthy by neutralising its populist leftwing. The DLC set out to foster “New Democrats” – enlightened politicians who understood the need for trade agreements, welfare reform and a big crackdown on crime. Given they were arguing for such things, it would have been awkward to accuse the party’s leftwing of “anti-pluralist” tendencies. It was the DLC themselves who were constantly trying to outmanoeuvre Jesse Jackson and what the DLC leader coyly called “constituency groups”. Galston’s role, at times, was to make it seem as though the centrist programme was just a response to the tides of historical change. In an article he co-wrote in 1998, he told Democrats that “the new economy favours a rising learning class over a declining working class”. To keep up with “new realities”, he wrote, Democrats needed to understand that labour was in decline, that the New Deal generation was dying, and that the future belonged to a certain group of affluent, well-educated people. The rest is history. New Democrats did indeed defeat populism. High-minded Democratic centrists did indeed abandon their traditional identification with working people in favour of the “learning class”. And Democrats started finding it “difficult” to take action on matters of basic economic fairness. Today Trump is president, and the connection between his rise and the Democrats’ renunciation of their historical identity should be obvious. He squats in their old place in the political ecosystem, pretending to care about ordinary Americans and preposterously claiming to be our instrument for getting even with the rich and the strong. The right name for Trump’s politics is “demagoguery” or “pseudo-populism”. By lumping him together with the genuine reform tradition of populism, we do that tradition a violent disservice. Reduced to its essentials, populism is America’s way of expressing class antagonism. It is a tradition of rhetorical protest that extends from Jefferson to Franklin Roosevelt to Bernie Sanders and on to the guy who just cooked your hamburger or filled your gas tank . It is powerful stuff. But protest isn’t the property of any particular party. Anyone can be the voice of those who work, and when one party renounces its claim the other can easily pick it up. All of which suggests a different answer to the question with which we began. Why is our traditional left failing? It is true that the other side doesn’t play fair any more, but it’s also true that the Democrats are lost in a fantasy of white-collar benevolence. For all their algorithms and their lavishly detailed position papers, their leaders have little personal sympathy any longer with the travails of working people. Populism isn’t the name for this disease; it’s the cure. • The People vs Democracy: Why Our Freedom Is in Danger &amp; How to Save It is published by Harvard (£21.95); Anti-Pluralism: The Populist Threat to Liberal Democracy is published by Yale (325).

Cambridge, Oxford, London and Nottingham universities have opened up bursaries to help students fly to Ireland for the historic poll on Friday, while elsewhere voters have got funding from friends and family to make their voice heard. “I feel so strongly about this. I want my vote counted,” said Amy Fitzgerald, 38, who recently migrated to Canada. Her husband surprised her with a birthday present of a €1,200 return ticket home to vote yes to rid the Irish constitution of a controversial 1983 amendment that in effect made abortion illegal. “I’ve a friend who had an abortion years ago and she didn’t tell anyone. All my pregnancies were happy ones, but I just do not understand why it’s any of my business or anyone else’s to force women to do what she had to do or that they had go through this on their own and in silence,” she added. Kieran McNulty, a postgrad student in the London School of Economics, is also booked to go home. “In studying law in Trinity in Dublin, I realised how difficult it was, because of the constitution, to make the law more compassionate.” Referring to the thousands of women who have to travel to the UK for abortions every year, he added: “We can’t just keep shoving women over to Liverpool. We have to face up to reality and anything I can do to influence the outcome I will do. That’s why I’m going home. If the no campaign won on one vote, I would feel terrible.” The referendum will be one of the toughest tests faced by the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, since he came to power a year ago. He is under pressure to deliver a decisive yes to remove the near-total abortion ban from the constitution and leave decisions on the matter to parliament, as in the UK. The eighth amendment protects “the right to life of the unborn”, and means legal abortion is impossible in Ireland, even in cases of rape or fatal foetal abnormality. Two opinion polls released on Sunday showed the yes campaign increasing its lead, appearing to reverse a trend that had suggested the race had tightened in recent weeks. But the yes-voting Irish diaspora is taking nothing for granted. “We’re all a little bit on edge at the moment because the polls are so close. I think every vote is going to count and I feel privileged that in Berlin I’m close enough to get home and I can afford it,” said Sonja Rohan, a 24-year-old postgrad student who is flying back on Thursday. Emotions are running high among those making the journey. Sharon Canavan, 28, in Warwickshire, was determined to go home to vote yes after experiencing complications in a pregnancy while in the UK. “I have three boys. I experienced some complications in my second pregnancy and was hospitalised for eight weeks. The care I received in the UK was second to none. My life was put as the priority. “I already had a little boy and a husband back home. I was induced early. He was fine, and I was fine. But it made me realise that I don’t want to be in Ireland if it happens again. Or something worse happens,” she said. But it is not just yes voters who have been drawn by the #hometovote campaign. “The constitutional amendment was a very blunt instrument,” said Seánín Mac Brádaigh, a 27-year-old admin worker in Hampshire, who is making a 14-hour rail and ferry journey back to vote no. “There is definitely room for improvement, but I do not support giving complete control of decisions on the protection of unborn children to any government,” he said. Others caught up in the excitement about the referendum include older emigrants who have been out of the country for too long - more than 18 months – to vote. They have launched a #BeMyYes campaign urging younger emigrants to make the journey back and vote. Some have even offered to fund younger voters. “I have been waiting for this referendum all my life &amp; am devastated I can’t get #hometovote,” tweeted Audrey Bowman, now in the Caribbean. On Thurdsay night, more than 200 people gathered in Wapping, east London, to show support for the yes campaign. On Friday, a similar rally for the no side was organised by the campaign group London Irish United for Life. One woman who backs the no campaign said she and a group of people in the British capital had got together last February in anticipation of the referendum. “The perception in the media here is that the #hometovote is all about yes. We believe the unborn should be protected and the [eighth amendment] saved,” said Laoise Ní Dhubhrosa. Bláithín Carroll, 21, a yes supporter, has had her travel funded by an Irish citizen who had lost his right to vote after living out of Ireland for too long. “I set up a GoFundMe page and somebody was kind enough to give me some cash to get home,” she said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"media/2018/may/18/wpp-investor-backs-chairman-over-unpublished-martin-sorrell-report","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T14:57:54Z","webTitle":"WPP investor backs chairman over unpublished Martin Sorrell report","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/18/wpp-investor-backs-chairman-over-unpublished-martin-sorrell-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/18/wpp-investor-backs-chairman-over-unpublished-martin-sorrell-report","fields":{"headline":"WPP investor backs chairman over unpublished Martin Sorrell report","bodyText":"WPP’s largest shareholder has backed the chairman Roberto Quarta’s decision not to reveal the outcome of an investigation into the conduct of the founder Sir Martin Sorrell before an expected revolt at the marketing and advertising company’s annual shareholder meeting next month. The influential shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis told investors this week it had “severe reservations” about a number of issues, including WPP’s failure to publish the outcome of the investigation into allegations of personal misconduct that prompted Sorrell to resign. It recommended voting against Quarta’s reappointment at the meeting in London on 13 June. However, the activist investor Harris Associates, which owns an 8% stake in WPP worth more than £1.3bn, sided with Quarta, saying publication of the report was not important for the future of the business. “We do not agree with Glass Lewis,” David Herro, a partner at Harris Associates, said. “In our view the release of the conduct report is not a critical issue.” Last month, Quarta told investors at the company’s first-quarter results presentation there was “no requirement to disclose or necessity to disclose [the contents of the report]”. It is understood that WPP has received legal advice that it cannot disclose the details of the allegations against Sorrell under data protection law. Chicago-based Harris Associates, an activist investor with stakes in companies including Tesco, Lloyds Banking Group and Credit Suisse, said it was more focused on WPP’s hunt for a new chief executive in order to keep the embattled advertising giant on track. “We are more concerned with an orderly succession process and the selection of an excellent and capable chief executive,” Herro said. Some analysts have called for a break-up of WPP, which has said it will sell off billions of pounds worth of stakes in companies such as Vice and is considering offloading its research arm, Kantar, which has a £4bn-plus price tag. WPP’s share price is down more than 20% over the last year. Glass Lewis also criticised the way Quarta, who is also the head of WPP’s nomination committee, had prepared for the departure of Sorrell, who founded WPP 33 years ago. The advisory firm said: “Despite previous assurances we believe the nomination committee has failed to adequately prepare for the replacement of Sir Martin.” WPP has always maintained there are a number of potential internal candidates, including the WPP Digital chief, Mark Read – who is co-running the business on a day-to-day basis alongside colleague Andrew Scott – as well as a “constantly refined list of external candidates”. Tim Armstrong, the head of Oath, the Verizon subsidiary that owns AOL and Yahoo, has been cited as a potential successor from outside WPP. WPP has said a vote against Quarta would be “against the interests of investors” at a time when WPP has no chief executive and “needs stability”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/18/rugby-league-magic-weekend-changes-calendar-newcastle","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T13:05:44Z","webTitle":"Magic Weekend could move from Newcastle to sustain event’s success | Aaron Bower","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/18/rugby-league-magic-weekend-changes-calendar-newcastle","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/18/rugby-league-magic-weekend-changes-calendar-newcastle","fields":{"headline":"Magic Weekend could move from Newcastle to sustain event’s success","bodyText":"At a time when British rugby league’s long-term future has never felt more uncertain, the return of Magic Weekend should be the perfect break from the boardroom politics engulfing the game. In a way, though, the questions surrounding the event’s future underline the sport’s state of flux. For the fourth successive year Magic Weekend will be staged in Newcastle: no other city has hosted the event for that long. Three years ago Blake Solly, the Super League general manager at the time, told the Guardian that St James’ Park would be the best host yet for the annual jamboree. The crowd figures alone support his claim but, after four years in Newcastle, does Magic Weekend stick or twist? Success has been achieved for more than a decade through well‑timed relocations for the event. This year, though, it may be about more than just where the sport packs its suitcases for next May. With it widely acknowledged that some of Super League’s power brokers are pulling for major changes in the professional game, could Magic Weekend be an obvious place to start for any fixture cull in the domestic calendar? “I think Magic, or a slightly tweaked variation of it, is always likely to be involved in any sort of fixture schedule and calendar the sport may decide to devise,” said Ralph Rimmer, the Rugby Football League’s interim chief executive. Indeed, the fact the National Rugby League has opted to introduce its own Magic Weekend in Brisbane next year is proof of the format’s credentials. Newcastle this year could host a record weekend attendance, including a Saturday figure of more than 40,000 with fixtures such as Wigan v Warrington and Leeds against Castleford taking place. “We’re vindicated by the NRL looking to replicate Magic,” said Jon Wells, the Sky Sports pundit who played in the inaugural Magic Weekend game in 2007 for Harlequins. “We’re a sport that needs exposure and Magic gives us something different – it’s hard to imagine our calendar without it.” The RFL will not decide what – or where – is next until later this year but it is clear that Newcastle will face competition to host it again. With a projected cash injection of £3m into the local economy, it is not difficult to see why the event is in high demand. “It’s fair to say there are a few left‑field options out there – and there are options for going abroad too,” Rimmer said. “We have people coming to the table wanting to host all the time.” Wells, though, is adamant the event now has permanent roots in the north-east. “It transcends the sport, much like the Grand Final and the Challenge Cup final. I think Newcastle is our official home. I know the powers that be will base it on things like revenue, but it’s such a great fit. Critics bemoan the fact it’s the extra fixture in the schedule but take your eyes up from individual club matters and you can see that we need this.” Success this weekend is likely to be monitored closely by two notable figures from outside of the sport. Barry and Eddie Hearn remain in discussions with the RFL about helping to promote the sport on a wider scale and it is not difficult to envisage a scenario where father and son are given a standalone event, such as Magic Weekend, to add their Matchroom company’s glitz and glamour to. Rimmer has invited both of them to St James’ Park – one of several subplots to track over the two days. This Magic Weekend also has an international flavour, with the Championship fixture between Toronto and Toulouse opening up the event on Saturday lunchtime. On Sunday there is a noteworthy story, too, as the Wallsend-born Chris Thorman coaches Huddersfield in their Yorkshire derby against Wakefield, before the weekend closes with the return of the Hull derby. “I’m biased and think Newcastle is the best one by far,” Thorman said. “I think it’s important we spread the gospel but we shouldn’t change it until we have a better alternative.” Can there be too much of a good thing? Probably. But if, as expected, the numbers stack up positively for the RFL come Monday, Magic Weekend is going to be with us for some time yet."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/21/i-went-to-work-in-a-restaurant-that-hates-me-and-the-special-was-roasted-samadder","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"I went to work in a restaurant that hates me – and the special was roasted Samadder","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/i-went-to-work-in-a-restaurant-that-hates-me-and-the-special-was-roasted-samadder","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/i-went-to-work-in-a-restaurant-that-hates-me-and-the-special-was-roasted-samadder","fields":{"headline":"I went to work in a restaurant that hates me – and the special was roasted Samadder","bodyText":"I don’t like to talk about all the charity work I do, because I don’t do any, but I did some this week, so let’s talk about it. Turning Tables is a Leeds Indie Food festival event where food writers cook in the kitchen of a high-end restaurant for paying guests, to raise money for Action Against Hunger. The problem is, I’m working at a restaurant that hates me. I can see why – in my review of Home in Leeds, my companion compared the texture of a potato foam to a certain … gentleman’s emission. Harshly, I thought, but who would shoot the messenger? One of the owners and co-head chef Elizabeth Cottam greets me. “You’ve got a nerve showing your face within these walls.” Then she switches tack, revealing a warmer side. “Nah, we’re gonna bury the hatchet. In your head.” Co-owner and co-head chef, Michelin-recognised Mark Owens is less forthcoming. A huge man – think David Prowse stepping out of the Darth Vader suit to reveal chef’s whites – he mostly just stares at me. I start counting the knives. The situation would be stressful enough. I’m preparing a main: salt-aged duck breast on black garlic with poached cherries, poached salsify, salsify crisps, hazelnut pesto and a confit duck ragu tartlet topped with – of course – salsify foam. It’s a beautiful, complex dish, and I’m buggered if I know how to make it. I stumble through the prep, burning my crisps, cutting salsify into batons so uneven they resemble the random box of nails and dowels my dad kept under the stairs. Once customers arrive, the intensity skyrockets. Luckily, I’m paired with another Home chef, Will Campbell. “Wonder why they put you on meat,” he laughs, as boiling fat spits up my arms and face. I dimly notice him cleaning up behind me, fixing my mistakes and omissions. He blowtorches, sifts the crisps, takes care of the ragu. If he has a free 20 seconds, he’s slicing lamb and ferrying clams for someone else. When the hell do these people sit down? Even with Will as my own personal Jesus, I flounder. Hobs and bodies and stress make for an environment hotter than Venus. Orders pile up, chefs shout timings, pacing themselves off each other. They are a perfect unit, and I am an absolute spanner. Every extra minute I hog the grill, forget to season, or drip foam over the plates, doubles our workload and halves our time. It’s like the final 30 seconds of a game of Tetris. What’s that phrase about too many cooks? To put it another way, it’s a ducking nightmare. I’m overcome with euphoria when the last plate goes out. This is the point the others up their energy, throwing soap around, scrubbing the place down. They work brooms in unison, deckhands on a pirate ship, while Dread Captain Owens figures out how much pearl barley to buy tomorrow. I want to lie down for ever. Cottam picks up on my workshy nature, and teases me relentlessly, as do the front-of-house staff. The special tonight is clearly roasted Samadder. She promises me dinner later, which never arrives; I guess I was asking for that. The abstract admiration I had for chefs is now filled in with calf-burning, brain-spinning specifics. It’s undoubtedly odd, my relationship with Home. But I have to keep coming back, because it’s the best food in Leeds. At the end, Owens shakes my hand and walks off, still without a word. It feels like the gesture of respect a hitman gives you, before he kills you. “I’ve never had one of those,” says Will, admiringly. “He must really … not hate you. As much.” Neighbours’ Felix has to Style it out in more than one direction In other news, Neighbours actor Felix Mallard is to star in a new sitcom, based on Harry Styles’ early life in One Direction. Happy Together specifically portrays the 20 months Styles spent sleeping on a mattress in the attic of producer Ben Winston’s house, while the band was taking off. As rock’n’roll redoubts go, it’s hardly Iggy and Bowie in Berlin. Bowie lived off peppers milk and cocaine, but never had to sleep between boxes of golfing magazines, pool inflatables and tinsel. As far as we know. I’m left wondering how Harry makes these leftfield career choices. Does he pick tickets out of a tombola? No 43: launch your solo career with a soft rock epic. No 68: be commendably anonymous in a bigscreen second world war epic. No 77: produce a network sitcom about the time you spent being luxuriously homeless. I love a sitcom, but it is the least mythic of entertainment forms, with the exception of juggling. This one already sounds so 1970s. Happy Together? Please God, let it have an Eric Idle theme tune, laugh track, and prominent swanee whistle. Maybe this curveball is the artistic expression Harry has been yearning for all along. Styles used to work in a bakery, which is very sitcom. I read that the band hid in a bread van once, in order to visit the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Brazil, which is so Last of the Summer Wine, if you take away the bit about Christ. The X Factor also-ran “Tesco” Mary is a shoo-in for a supporting role. But who else will feature? Cara Delevingne as a rage-filled traffic warden? Simon Cowell as an oily stepdad? All we know is that to portray this jack of all Styles, Mallard will need to prove himself able to take more than one direction. Hummus, the anxiety-inducing dip Hummus was introduced to the UK almost exactly 30 years ago by Waitrose, which now sells a pot a second, according to reports. It has clearly been embraced by the masses, not just Guardian subscribers, but I avoid it because I do not know a more anxiety-provoking dip. How is it meant to be spelled? Houmous? Humous? I’ve seen homos. If I ever open a restaurant, it will be listed as “culturally contested chickpea mix” and people can pick their variant of how to spell it. The customer is always right.

Comments are open on our series recap blog. We begin where we left off: with Offred – or June, as she is becoming once more – being bundled, pregnant, into a van and driven away. Into the darkness within, or else the light; we don’t – and she doesn’t – know. Light is streaming through a metal grille when a viewing hatch is opened, but it is slammed shut again. Audible clues offer no comfort: shouting, dogs barking. On the soundtrack – used sparingly and so effectively – is the signature falling glissando of doom. The hope drains from June’s eyes. Elisabeth Moss can say more with her eyes and her face than most actors can with 1,000 words. It is 10 minutes before she makes her first utterance, but in that time she displays hope, dread, defiance, defeat and strength again. She says very little in the whole episode (mostly in the flashbacks), yet she is mesmerising. June is pulled out by guards with snarling dogs. She – and the other handmaids – are muzzled and herded along a tunnel. What hell is this where the dogs are not muzzled, but women are? Well, Gilead. Fenway Park, to be specific, home to the Boston Red Sox; a place of recreation in happier times. Now? A place of execution. Like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran, Guinea in 2009, Chile after Pinochet’s coup in 1973 ... the death knell resonates with reality and with history. A massive scaffold has been erected and a row of nooses are lined up. One is placed over each handmaid’s head, as This Woman’s Work by Kate Bush is played. It is one of those moments in this show that somehow manage to find beauty in the darkest trauma. It turns out to be a mock execution, a lesson to be learned. Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd on song) shows up with her interpretation of the Christian message and her instruction to love God. “Walk with him and fear him and cleave unto him and you shall obey his word and the word of his servants here on Earth.” Finally, June speaks, offering her own prayer – in her head, at least. “Our Father, who art in heaven. Seriously? What the actual fuck!” It is a moment to gasp for air – of levity, even – and a reminder that humanity still exists. Because the opening is about as intense a TV experience as it is possible to have. I felt it physically, a tightness in the stomach. And that is not the end of it. After the first flashback, to a decision by June and Luke to try for a second child, it is straight back to the nightmare of the present. Aunt Lydia has the handmaids kneeling in the rain, holding rocks out in front as punishment for refusing to stone Janine to death. Filmed from above, it is more beautifully choreographed horror. Janine, incidentally, is on her way to the Colonies. We – the series – will be going, too. And further back, before Gilead, to see how it came about. The first flashback is not all about love and the joy of further procreation. There are warning signs of what is to come. Taking the pill is not a woman’s decision; Luke has to sign off on it. “It’s ridiculous,” he says, casually, before signing. Next time – if they had not decided to stop – he would probably have said nothing and signed. There it is, the creeping normalisation. In the next flashback, June is getting a hard time for not picking up her daughter from school the moment she felt ill … for having a job, basically; abandoning her child and her duties for her selfish pursuits. In the final flashback, it has begun to kick off: shooting from the gallery in the Capitol building, an explosion in the White House. You are left wondering just how big a leap it is from the Handmaid’s Tale flashbacks to the actual present. It may have been best to leave the show at one season, with Margaret Atwood, open-ended, a hint of better things to come. And with no chance of it becoming diluted or losing the plot. But that was never going to happen – successful doesn’t walk away from an audience. This is next best, exploring not only forward, but backwards, looking at how it came about. No dilution or loss of plot yet, in an extraordinary first episode that will ring on in your nightmares like Aunt Lydia’s bell. Also, think about what has happened since the first series: #MeToo, mass shootings, you-know-who still in the White House, an abortion referendum in Ireland this week … dong, dong, dong, dong. It is not just Aunt Lydia’s bell that continues to chime. While The Handmaid’s Tale continues to be relevant, it needs to be told. Praise be."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/may/18/ikea-halts-new-preston-store-as-uk-profits-fall","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T16:01:53Z","webTitle":"Ikea halts new Preston store as UK profits fall","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/18/ikea-halts-new-preston-store-as-uk-profits-fall","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/18/ikea-halts-new-preston-store-as-uk-profits-fall","fields":{"headline":"Ikea halts new Preston store as UK profits fall","bodyText":"Ikea has reported a sharp fall in UK profits and pulled out of opening what would have been its second-largest store in the country. The Swedish retailer blamed higher wages and the cost of investments in its stores and website for a near-40% slump in profits in the year to 31 August 2017. Pre-tax profits slid from £140m to £87m, according to accounts filed at Companies House. The figures coincided with Ikea’s decision to abandon a plan to open one of its famous blue sheds in Cuerden, near Preston. The company said the store, which would have created 350 jobs in 2020, was no longer viable. The decision is another blow for the retail sector, which is reeling after a string of chains including Mothercare, Carpetright, New Look and House of Fraser announced plans to close stores. Richard Rands, the property manager for Ikea UK and Ireland, said: “Our decision is due to increased development costs and delays outside of Ikea’s control which no longer make this location viable. We will continue to look for new sites and opportunities in this region.” Despite the fall in profits, UK sales rose 6% to £1.8bn with the retailer winning market share from rivals during the period. Ikea, whose founder, Ingvar Kamprad, died in January, opened its first UK store in Warrington in 1987, but its expansion has been slow. After a seven-year hiatus Ikea has recently opened several stores in quick succession, including in Reading, Sheffield and Exeter. It is also planning a fourth London store in Greenwich and another in Lancing, near Brighton. However, the retailer is also experimenting with small Argos-style stores in town centres that are basically order and collection counters. Earlier this week the company announced that after a five-year stint as the UK boss, Gillian Drakeford would be succeeded by her deputy, Javier Quiñones, in June. Drakeford is moving to a role at the parent company, Inter Ikea Systems."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/19/harry-meghan-republican-royal-wedding","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T05:00:19Z","webTitle":"It’s not Harry and Meghan.

It’s the monarchy I oppose","bodyText":"The royal wedding, as we now know it, was born in 1922. The marriage of Princess Mary to Viscount Lascelles was, it is said, less an arranged union than a forced one. Lascelles bet his friends that if he asked King George V’s only daughter to marry him she’d say yes. Mary was not keen. But the king insisted. Whatever private anxiety there might have been was buried deep beneath the public ceremony. Monarchies elsewhere had fallen foul of popular uprisings; Britain’s royals felt they had to work for their privileges. Five years earlier, during the first world war, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had rebranded itself the House of Windsor to establish some distance from their German lineage. Mary’s wedding was another opportunity to connect with the public. For the first time in a long time a royal wedding was held at Westminster Abbey, with a full procession and coverage by Pathé News. “It is now no longer Mary’s wedding,” wrote her brother, the future George VI. “But (this from the papers) it is the ‘Abbey Wedding’ or the ‘Royal Wedding’ or the ‘National Wedding’ or even the ‘People’s Wedding’.” Royal weddings are no more about two people being in love than a presidential inauguration is about a politician’s first day in a new job. That doesn’t mean the couple in question don’t necessarily love each other. Only that it is not a prerequisite for the ceremony. When it comes to royal events it is not individuals but the institution – the monarchy – that really counts. So the nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are a private ceremony only in the formal sense that it is not an official state occasion. It will be televised, has received acres of newspaper coverage, has 600 guests, costs £32m, and 1,200 “commoners” have been nominated to “join in”. I wish it was private. Then they could have their seclusion and I could ignore it. But then what would the point of that be? “To be invisible,” wrote the 19th-century constitutionalist Walter Bagehot, “is to be forgotten … To be a symbol, and an effective symbol, you must be vividly and often seen.” I for one have already seen enough. I’m a republican for all the obvious reasons. A monarchy establishes inherited privilege at the heart of government and embeds patronage at the centre of power. The royals are a class act. And that’s the problem. I’m not a very passionate republican – many things bother me more than the monarchy. But as principles go it is unwavering. We have a class problem in Britain and the monarchy exemplifies it. If it’s a guilty pleasure I’m after, I don’t turn to betrothals in real-world feudal dynasties: I have Netflix. The political scientist Benedict Anderson described countries as imagined communities. Call me a misery guts, but I’d rather imagine one in which I am born a citizen, not a subject, and others are not born to govern me. I’d be fine leaving the whole thing alone; the trouble is it won’t leave me alone. Last week Harry and Meghan showed up in both my kids’ book bags – they’d been invited by their schools to celebrate their wedding by wearing red, white and blue or buying cupcakes or both. This is propaganda through tasty pastry. The purpose of these highly scripted and tightly choreographed weddings is twofold: to renew the monarchy’s sense of legitimacy and to establish its relevance. Those who claim God has ordained that they should rule over everyone else will always have to worry about credibility. The Russian tsar executed by the Bolsheviks was the Queen’s grandfather’s cousin. Her husband, Prince Phillip, was evacuated from Greece as a baby on a warship in a cot made from a fruit box. So she knows a thing or two about what can happen when legitimacy is lost. It is worth noting that the wedding in which the most royal PR capital has been invested – between Prince Charles and Lady Diana – was for the marriage that failed most publicly and calamitously. The uncertain response to Diana’s death was the one occasion in recent memory the institution looked vulnerable. For all that, the monarchy seems safe. Half of Britons think it is good for Britain and even more believe it should continue. Given the parlous state of our political class, the polarised nature of our political culture and the absurd figure we cut on the world stage following the Brexit vote, institutions such as the monarchy can be reassuring for some. A royal wedding provides a semblance of stability and the hope of unity for those who’d favour the certainties of a benign dictatorship over the vagaries of democracy. The royals’ relevance relates to their ability to adapt their elite entitlements to the popular mood. The Queen, for example, used clothing ration coupons to pay for her wedding dress (the government gave her £200 extra). Meanwhile both the Duchess of Cambridge and Markle have university degrees, the first royal brides who can claim such erudition. Being black, Markle is the first who can claim such melanin. These attributes, we’re told, illustrate the institution’s capacity to evolve. If anything they reveal the opposite. Women with university degrees and interracial marriages are neither recent nor rare in Britain. The fact they are remarkable at this level of the aristocracy is itself remarkable. Asked in a survey which words best describe their feelings about the wedding, 46% said “indifferent”, the most popular answer, followed by 29% who described themselves as “happy”. Those who prefer their matrimony with a dose of class deference mistake this ambivalence for curmudgeonliness. That is incredibly self-serving. Weddings are my favourite life-cycle event – particularly British ones. Multi-generational, diasporic, boozy, flirty, with dad-dancing and simmering family drama – I’m more fond of them than the institution of marriage itself. But the weddings I enjoy are the ones where I know the people getting married. I have no more inclination to be interested in this wedding than to wander into a random church on a Saturday afternoon and become engrossed in the ceremony of anyone else I don’t know. I don’t begrudge anyone feeling differently. I understand that all sorts of people see all sorts of things in her, him, them and it. And I get the intrigue over Charles’s late entry as the candidate to walk Markle down the aisle. “A princely marriage is the brilliant edition of a universal fact, and, as such, it rivets mankind,” wrote Bagehot. “A royal family sweetens politics by the seasonable addition of nice and pretty events.” Once upon a time maybe. But at this stage the appeal for many seems to lie in a cross between Red Nose Day and the Eurovision song contest – a camp and kitschy licence to be lowbrow on a national scale. If they can derive pleasure from the elite marriage of strangers, that’s great. I bear no animus towards the happy couple on their big day. I am a republican and a humanist. Indeed, I am a republican because I am a humanist. I wish the individuals well and the institution ill. • Gary Younge is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/20/tax-cuts-to-help-women-on-lower-incomes-but-taper-effect-will-trim-gains","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-19T19:00:35Z","webTitle":"Tax cuts to help women on lower incomes but 'taper effect' will trim gains","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/20/tax-cuts-to-help-women-on-lower-incomes-but-taper-effect-will-trim-gains","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/20/tax-cuts-to-help-women-on-lower-incomes-but-taper-effect-will-trim-gains","fields":{"headline":"Tax cuts to help women on lower incomes but 'taper effect' will trim gains","bodyText":"The Turnbull government’s tax cuts for low and middle income earners will benefit women, who on average earn less than men, but the proposed tax offset increases the effective marginal tax rate, which is a disincentive for people to find work, according to a new analysis. A study of the major budget initiatives by the National Foundation for Australian Women (NFAW), to be released on Sunday before the resumption of parliament, says the tax offsets proposed for 2018 would help a large number of low to middle income Australians. However, “the tax offset increases the effective marginal tax rate by 1.5% for taxpayers within the taper zone, which increases work disincentives for women and other low income taxpayers”. The median taxable income in 2015-16 for women was $48,690 compared with $63,430 for men. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “The potential to increase workforce participation by part-time workers through a lower tax rate is therefore moderated by the effect of the taper rate,” the analysis, which examines the impact of the budget on women, says. It concludes that the system the Turnbull government proposes “introduces increased complexity to the system, particularly in the way in which the two tax offsets are layered and stepped with different withdrawal thresholds”. The NFAW also says the government should not pursue stages two and three of its income tax cut plan because the proposed flattening of the tax rates “reduces the progressivity of the tax system and represents a major and inequitable turning point”. A separate analysis of the Turnbull government’s seven-year income tax cut plan by the Grattan Institute says 60% of the annual reduction will be retained by the top 20% of income earners. That analysis suggests that once the tax plan is fully implemented in 2024-25, $15bn of the annual $25bn cost will result from collecting less tax from the top 20% of income earners. The final stage of the tax cut plan – the one currently meeting most political resistance – would reduce the number of income tax brackets from five to four, and require the majority of taxpayers – everyone who earns between $41,000 and $200,000 a year – to pay a marginal tax rate of 32.5 cents. The Turnbull government has been on the road for the past week selling the budget, and the prime minister, and the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, have been campaigning in seats that will be the subject of byelections triggered by the high court’s decision in the Katy Gallagher case. With a mini-election season under way in seats in Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, the political tussle over the budget returns to Canberra on Monday as federal parliament resumes, with the government putting pressure on the Senate to pass the income tax package as a job lot. In addition to the commentary on the tax measures, the NFAW post-budget analysis notes that spending growth is now projected to average just 1.1% in real terms over three years, compared with 2.1% average growth in real terms over the government’s two terms in office. It notes that only funding to schools and the national disability insurance scheme will grow in real terms under the projections outlined on 7 May. The group welcomes the elements of the budget investments in aged care. It ticks improvements to My Aged Care processes; the introduction of quality assurance processes; the establishment of a Quality and Safety Commission; mental health trials for residents in aged care suffering social isolation or loneliness; money to address elder abuse; extra funding for palliative care; extra funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flexible aged care; and a trial introducing consumer centred funding, which is similar to the NDIS. “The centrepiece of the package is 14,000 extra home care packages at a cost of $1.6b,” the analysis says. “Women currently receive two-thirds of home care packages. However, over 100 000 aged Australians are already on the waiting lists. The increased expenditure for this item also appears to be redirected from an underspend in residential aged care, where women also make up two thirds of residents.” The analysis notes the budget “does little in areas such as domestic violence, pay equity, housing, assistance to the marginalised – no increase in Newstart or Commonwealth rent assistance – the environment, health promotion and prevention.” It also notes that there are no longer-term structural approaches to reforms required to meet government services needs over the long term. The minister for women, Kelly O’Dwyer, says the government will deliver a statement on women’s economic security in September. That statement is expected to address issues such as workforce participation, pay equity and superannuation. The NFAW has called on the government to use that statement to examine areas of job design and skills development in the disability sector, with a view to reducing turnover in the sector and improving outcomes for employees and their clients. It wants a detailed gender analysis of government policy and a recurrent time use survey. “NFAW recommends that the government adopt measures to address the undervaluation of work in the caring sector on which it partly relies to make savings to fund its other priorities. In particular, we recommend that it reinstate the $300m budget measure to support child care and the $1.5b measure to fund pay rises for aged care workers, and examine similar measures to support job design and earnings in the disability care sector.” The Henry review proposed abolishing the low income tax offset and increasing the tax threshold instead."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/18/after-a-toxic-buildup-to-the-royal-wedding-are-we-entertained","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-18T16:00:04Z","webTitle":"After a toxic buildup to the royal wedding, are we entertained? | Marina Hyde","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/after-a-toxic-buildup-to-the-royal-wedding-are-we-entertained","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/18/after-a-toxic-buildup-to-the-royal-wedding-are-we-entertained","fields":{"headline":"After a toxic buildup to the royal wedding, are we entertained?","bodyText":"After the week they’ve had, it’s too fitting that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are doing this thing in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Chapel, the official spiritual home to the Order of the Garter. The order was founded after the perceived embarrassment and shaming of a woman at court in 1348, through no fault of her own. Legend has it (probably apocryphally) that Edward III’s dance partner accidentally flashed her garter, to various looks askance, prompting Edward to take the garter upon himself and challenge the mockers with what would become his new order’s motto: “Honi soit qui mal y pense.” Shame on him who thinks badly of this. “Those who laugh at this today,” Edward added, “will tomorrow be proud to wear it.” Note how an embarrassing incident was opportunistically embraced by the crown, promptly knit into its mythology and swiftly used to further its wider ends. Almost immediately, Edward was using the same line to shut down criticism of his dodgy claim to the French throne. Gotta admire the balls on him. To the matrimosseum, then, where it has been revealed that Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle up the aisle in the absence of her father, who you might vaguely have heard is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico. We don’t know too much about his 69-year-old understudy, but as all theatre critics will tell you, anyone forced to go on at the last minute is always “a revelation”. Ideally, a star will be born, because the House of Windsor’s going to need one in a few years. Charles will lead Meghan to Prince Harry, who will then turn to the wider TV audience and bellow: “HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE.” Harry’s tone? Same as the bit in Gladiator when a flashing-eyed Rusty Crowe inquires of the Colosseum crowd: “Are you nut entertained? ARE YOU NUT ENTERTAINED? IS THIS NUT WHY YOU ARE HERE?” And is it? On the eve of a royal wedding whose final week of preparations has been several stripes of toxic, we must once again ask: what do we want out of these people? “She makes him happy,” one member of the public explained to the BBC. “And that makes me happy.” In the Kensington Palace gift shop, a woman buying a £39 mug with Harry and Meghan’s initials on it told me: “I love how down to earth they are.” A lady who had travelled from Florida confided beneath the whirr of a news helicopter: “I just like weddings.” In Ma’am Darling, Craig Brown’s exquisitely naughty and hilarious book about Princess Margaret, the author notes that when it comes to the royal family in the modern era, “the trend is toward praising the unexceptional”. The vast sales of royal biographers and watchers suggest they know their audience, and in their hands the banal is treated with a reverence it would be afforded in the case of no other subject. To read these accounts is to drown in fist-gnawingly dull passages about occasions on which the royals drive! their! own! cars!, for instance, changing effortlessly / fluently / unaffectedly up through the gears, while the prose remains very much stuck in first. All of which leads Brown to the central questions of our modern relationship with the monarchy: “If they are so ordinary, why are they so special? And if they are so special, why are they so ordinary?” This unresolved conflict has been much on display this week, alongside the snobbery and the sycophancy, the cruelty and the casual racism. You can’t move for people explaining that the miserable drama with Meghan’s poor paparazzi-colluding father shows us that “all families are complicated” – like we need telling that, where the Windsors are concerned. Please. They’ve been bringing their own drama since forever. The very fact Harry is marrying an American divorcee sets a low success bar even by the standards of his clan. The last time the experiment was tried, the couple in question ended up in a Bois de Boulogne villa with a couple of mines’ worth of diamonds but only Hitler on speed-dial. Too soon? Very possibly. Royal nuptials do something funny to people who otherwise know that wedding details are almost comically boring. People who would normally need to be a bottle of lady petrol down before they cared what type of cake their friends are having are positively gripped by news that Meghan’s will be a lemon sponge with elderflower buttercream. Other people declare their furious lack of interest like a mantra that needs repeating just the 900 times a day. In Windsor, many were treating Royal Wedding Eve like it was an early flight from Stansted, where it’s basically fine to have a pint at any time. “We open at 6am tomorrow,” said the barmaid at The King and Castle, with a thousand-yard stare. Elsewhere on the lanes around the castle there were slightly more claimants to be “official town crier” than there once were to be Anastasia Romanov. Police had taken the possessions of some homeless people for “safe storage”, making way for the royal superfans who wished to sleep on the same streets to get a great viewing spot for Saturday. And if you were a screenwriter trying to come up with a vignette to illustrate a country in heady thrall to a version of its past yet struggling to meet the challenges of its present, you’d probably ditch that one as being too on the nose. Before we had culture wars, we had John Mortimer’s insistence that the nation could still be divided into cavaliers and roundheads. We now live in an age of endless taxonomy – and anger – where people are forever identifying adversarially. Leavers and remainers, Somewheres and Anywheres, people who adore the royal family and people who can’t stand them. (Confusingly, many of the latter demographic adore the royals at one artistic remove. They worship the Queen as played by Helen Mirren, and can’t get enough of The Crown.) After the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, which I covered for work, I returned home to find my husband had not seen one nanosecond of the proceedings, choosing instead to watch The Sorrow and the Pity, a four-hour documentary about Nazi collaboration in Vichy France. I mean … eyeroll. Someone later asked him if he hadn’t even wanted to see Kate’s dress, and he said “her DRESS?”, as though he’d been offered sight of her dental records, or her GCSE essay on weather symbolism in King Lear. This time round he’ll be at the cup final, Saturday’s other gloriously militarised event where a perceived arriviste will meet the game’s version of royalty. And that concludes the court and social engagements for my household. There was no evidence of protesters in Windsor on Friday, though some are promised for Saturday. Extended opening hours may help. Elsewhere, though, a certain cultivated ennui about Harry and Meghan’s wedding is the badge of someone who would like you to know they have better things to do with their time. Nothing new here. “I have noticed in the press certain references to Princess Margaret wishing to marry someone or other,” Noel Coward sniffed grandly to his diary back in 1955. “I really must try to control this yawning.” Within two weeks, Coward was practically wetting his pants at the news that Margaret was not going to marry the someone-or-other (Group Captain Peter Townsend) after all. “This is a fine slap in the chops for the bloody press which has been persecuting her for so long,” he thundered. “It has all been a silly mismanaged lash-up, and I can’t imagine how the Queen and the Queen Mother and Prince Philip allowed it to get into such tangle …” On and on it goes, quite the opposite of a yawn, right down to his hope “that they had the sense to hop into bed a couple of times at least, but this I doubt.” He perhaps needn’t have worried on that score. Back to the events of this week, though, where we must once again wonder how tangles are allowed to happen to the royal family. How could Kensington Palace’s courtiers not have predicted many months ago that Meghan Markle’s father was a potential vulnerability who might need assistance in the eye of the media maelstrom in which he would find himself? Instead of farting out press releases about floral arrangements, someone from the palace should have raced to Tijuana faster than a teen on spring break and helped manage the situation. Instead, they have presided over the biggest strategic bollock-drop since the snap election. With barely a week to go, perhaps the palace was congratulating itself that the worst press to befall this wedding was the news that having invited 2,460 members of the public inside the castle walls to “share their special day”, the couple weren’t actually going to feed them or anything. Some suspected they were just backdrop for the TV pictures, the most displeased peasant extras since Buttercup’s forced marriage to Humperdinck in The Princess Bride. But now … well. The final countdown has been marked by such eye-covering TV moments as Meghan’s half-sister raging that her father snapped because he had been relentlessly hounded by paparazzi. As she put it: “I think there are examples in history of how dangerous that can be.” Oof. Plotlines never go away in the House of Windsor, they just lie dormant for a couple of series. Alas, there undoubtedly remains a persistent feeling among some courtiers that it is the commoners who bring vulgarity to the royal family, who are themselves always unimpeachable. Anyone who recalls Prince Andrew bellowing at John Travolta, who was dressed as a giant vegetable, during Prince Edward’s dignicidal Grand Knockout Tournament will find that take hard to get behind. (Edward had earlier stormed huffily out of a press conference wearing a sweatshirt reading “NO I JUST LOOK LIKE HIM”.) There was much sympathy for Meghan over the business with her father among those camped out on Friday morning. “It’s terrible what they’ve done to her,” remarked one woman in a camping chair, who, it must be said, had still bought three newspapers to read about it all. “She’s tough enough to survive it though,” judged her friend. None of this is new, naturally, having happened to various brides of Windsor before. Indeed, once you are “in”, it is your turn to take the reins and disparage the latest newbie and their ghastly family. Roy Strong’s diaries feature one encounter with Princess Michael, who is keen to define herself against the then 23-year-old mother-of-one, Princess Diana. Strong recounts Princess Michael’s thoughts: “Droves of the household were leaving, and then there was the terrible mother, Mrs Shand Kydd …” (I don’t know about you, but I never trust a take on terrible relatives unless it comes from someone whose own father was a Nazi SS officer.) “Poor Prince Charles, who had bought Highgrove to be near his former girlfriend.” Can’t bear it for the guy. Strong then moves on to quoting Princess Michael directly: “Being rude to servants is the lowest thing you could do, and she does it.” The Kents, of course, will be neighbours of Harry and Meghan when they move into their 21-room marital apartment in the same quadrangle of Kensington Palace, so doubtless Meghan can expect a warm and supportive welcome there. Looking at the formbook, then, marrying into the Windsors has frequently proved a reverse fairytale. It starts with you becoming a princess, and unravels from there. Tied ends are loosed, and afters are not ever happy. Even so, the weddings themselves are a type of restoration comedy, briefly and amusingly refreshing the view of the monarchy to something light, youthful and positive, and allowing many people to stave off the gathering realisation that the Queen is the last big-hitting link with the postwar consensus, and if she and Attenborough go in the same year we’ll have effectively lost the rights to our country to Sky. We’ve already lost the rights to this wedding to the US news site TMZ, which has wiped the floor with their British counterparts on scoops, in arguably the most shaming defeat since Yorktown. Certainly since England capitulated to the US in the 1950 World Cup. Wasn’t it OUR tabloids who used to go into hospitals and try to get stories off recovering patients? Wasn’t it OUR tabloids who used to goad relatives to say terrible things for money? Aren’t WE the best at ruining lives? What happened to us, man? Perhaps another sort of changing of the guard has occurred. Still, the cast of thousands taking their piece of this wedding remains a sight to behold. Incredible, really, that no one in our royal family has ever eloped. Couple of the Saudis have done it, obviously, and you get a bit of it in Thailand. But at more than one moment this week, Harry and Meghan must surely have been tempted to run off to Vegas, a city of marginally less excess than one of Prince Charles’s weekend journeys to stay with friends in Herefordshire. Yet here we are. At some point on Saturday a “body language expert” on some network’s dime will divine from the specific manner in which Meghan Markle steps from her golden landau that “she has a lot on her mind”. Body language will be just one of the ancient disciplines being brought to bear on proceedings. The erstwhile royal butler Paul Burrell has been handling etiquette and so on for ITV’s Lorraine, though he’s unlikely to furnish viewers with a digression on the etiquette of hiding a load of one’s late employer’s dresses in the attic and then betraying her secrets in a series of lucrative books. Then there are all the bookies, of course, and the hundreds of broadcast technicians taping cables to the pavements all the way around Windsor Castle, in a Sleeping Beauty metaphor I’m sure Kay Burley will be hacking through in due course. And all the American television anchors, and all the souvenir sellers, and the childhood bodyguards who’ve cashed in. And the security consultants, and the lip readers. (For William and Kate’s wedding, the Sun had lip readers trained on various members of the royal family. An executive decision was taken not to publish what had been gleaned from Princess Anne as it was – how to put this? – not thought to fit with the otherwise positive and upbeat mood of the day.) Then there’s Liam Fox, declaring on Thursday that the wedding will boost the UK’s trade ties with the US. There’s Marks and Spencer, changing its name to Markle and Sparkle for three days, and all the many pubs holding royal wedding parties, and all the many pubs holding anti-royal-wedding parties. Just two people getting married, then, trailed by a vast army of chancers and cheerleaders and chisellers and critics also taking their cut – including me, by the writing of this article. As that other medieval saying goes, it’s all in the game, yo. And just look how long it’s been played.

This time, about 50 farmers in green shirts are waiting outside the Mackay civic centre for Annastacia Palaszczuk, chanting loudly “you’re late, you’re wrong”. The following night, a stone’s throw to the north in Airlie Beach, where locals make their living on the climate-threatened Great Barrier Reef, Palaszczuk picks members of the crowd at random and invites questions on any topic. Adani, Adani, Adani. Then Clive Palmer’s Alpha North coal proposal, from a man who promises at the outset not to ask about Adani. Protesters to the left, protesters to the right. In a diverse part of a deeply complex state, the Palaszczuk government has to navigate some tricky terrain to maintain a centrist course. • Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon “You’ve sometimes got to say different things in different parts of the state,” one MP tells Guardian Australia. “If you nail your colours too strongly to the mast in one town, in the next you might get a kicking. That’s not to say we don’t take strong positions like we did on [tree clearing], but it’s a fact of life.” Ministers have spent the past week in the Mackay and Whitsunday region, a stretch of about 150km of Queensland’s central coast; a large part of George Christensen’s marginal federal seat of Dawson, bookended by mining hubs, covered with endless fields of cane, and home to a tourism industry that promotes itself as “the heart of the reef”. Mackay’s mayor, Greg Williamson, like Christensen, backs the idea of building a new coal-fired power station. The association of marine park tourism operators, a group whose members include Whitsunday businesses, this month called this month for governments to “rapidly phase out coal and other fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy”. A woman at Airlie asks why the government is willing to trade thousands of long-term jobs on the reef for “a handful” at Adani, as studies show climate change is literally cooking corals. “We need to get the balance right,” is a line the affable Palaszczuk, whose personal popularity is credited for helping Labor win a tricky election last year, trots out when discussion veers from infrastructure spending announcements to the thornier issues. “I’m just as passionate as the next person about doing everything we possibly can [for the reef],” she says. “When it comes to Adani we have made it crystal clear that it has to financially stack up independently itself. And we’re yet to see that. “We’ve got to get the balance right, the world is changing. I get criticised for having a 50% renewable energy target that’s creating tens of thousands of jobs in regional Queensland. There are [also] a lot of jobs and employment in the resources sector, but we need to get the balance right.” Taking the middle road – or sometimes walking both sides of it – pleases few interest groups. But some believe it’s the only tenable option in a state where the politics is complicated by a divide not only between the urban south-east and the regions, but also from one community to the next. The government’s power base is in the urban south-east, but its thin majority owes as much to party heartland seats in mining towns such as Mackay. The opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, says the government has, on issues such as Adani’s Carmichael mine, managed to take a position that is both for and against. It supports the mine, but with enough qualifications – strict conditions and no public funding – it can pitch itself to supporters as well as opponents. “What this government is really good at is photo-opportunities and small little announcements that don’t make those communities any better,” Frecklington says. “This is a government that is simply treading water.” Where the government has taken a stronger stance – on vegetation management laws to curb broadscale clearing – the reaction has been fierce, particularly from farmers. In Rockhampton last month, Palaszczuk was subject to some fairly vicious swearing and heckling outside the Beef Australia event. In Mackay, she ducked into the community meeting through a back door, saying she wouldn’t subject herself to that sort of treatment again. “Frankly I’m happy for people to protest, but as premier of this state I’m not going to cop that verbal abuse,” she said the next day. “So when there is more respect shown, I’m more than happy to sit down and talk to farmers about their concerns.” Jason, a mining technician who does not want to give his last name, says Mackay is built on coal and he believes the government had gone soft on its support for blue-collar workers in the resources sector. He was one of more than 20% of the people from Mackay who voted One Nation at last year’s state election, and says his family still supports Labor. He wants Adani’s Carmichael mine to go ahead. “If people want to buy the coal and we’ve got the coal, then it’s putting people to work. In the end, why should we have to stop an industry that’s one of our main industries? “You don’t reckon that whether we do go or don’t go ahead, it’s [going to] make any difference [to climate change]? If people need coal, they have to get it from somewhere.” The state coordinator of Farmers for Climate Action, Michael Kane, has told the community meeting in Airlie he is concerned there has been no cumulative study of the impact on water from the proposed mines in the Galilee basin. “A central pillar of the economy in Queensland and central Queensland is grazing and agricultural industries,” Kane says. “There are huge amounts of water [needed for mining] and we don’t think there’s been a cumulative study done of the impacts of all of those mines in the Galilee basin. “We think there is an El Nino coming ... so water is going to be critical out there. This is quite an urgent situation.” The mines minister, Anthony Lynham responds by saying there will be a cumulative assessment done “if the Galilee basin ever gets up”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/23/ariana-grande-responds-to-sexist-criticism-about-her-breakup-with-mac-miller","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T00:21:03Z","webTitle":"Ariana Grande responds to sexist criticism about breakup with Mac Miller","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/23/ariana-grande-responds-to-sexist-criticism-about-her-breakup-with-mac-miller","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/23/ariana-grande-responds-to-sexist-criticism-about-her-breakup-with-mac-miller","fields":{"headline":"Ariana Grande responds to sexist criticism about breakup with Mac Miller","bodyText":"Ariana Grande has admonished a Twitter user for suggesting that she should take responsibility for her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller’s recent car accident and subsequent DUI.

It is the first time Grande has revealed any problems in her relationship with Miller, describing their relationship as “hard” and “scary” and telling Flint that “shaming/blaming women for a man’s inability to keep his shit together is a very major problem”. A police report found Miller’s blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit when he crashed the car, according to TMZ. Flint responded to Grande’s tweet with a lengthy apology, saying: “I think every woman is equal to a man and has the same exact right to pursue their happiness”. Grande was quick to accept his apology. Grande and Miller met on the video shoot for their duet The Way in 2013 and started dating a year later. They got matching tattoos and repeatedly posted about their love for one another. After unimaginable tragedy struck last year at Grande’s concert in Manchester, the rapper pulled out of his own concerts to support Grande, reportedly not leaving her side in the weeks afterwards. On stage at the One Love tribute concert a week later, Miller embraced and dueted with Grande on stage. When they announced their separation this month, they did so with the cordiality of beloved CEO leaving a company after transforming its fortunes. Grande blamed their busy schedules for the break-up, adding on Instagram that Miller was “one of my best friends in the whole world and favorite people on the planet”, adding: “I respect and adore him endlessly and am grateful to have him in my life in any form, at all times regardless of how our relationship changes or what the universe holds for each of us!” Miller also tweeted in support of Grande’s most recent single: “very proud of this girl”, even as early reports of a split were emerging. This week Page Six, TMZ and People reported that Grande had started dating Pete Davidson, himself having only just broken up with Larry David’s daughter, Cazzie, another intense relationship in which David supported Davidson through battles with addiction and borderline personality disorder. Fans are speculating that they have already got matching tattoos on their middle fingers. This is not the first time Grande has admonished a member of the public after she was on the receiving end of misogyny. In December 2016, she wrote movingly and with anger after one of Miller’s fans said: “Ariana is sexy as hell, I see you hitting that” to Miller while Grande was nearby. Grande penned a response on her iPhone notes app which ended: “[Women] need to talk about these moments openly because they are harmful and they live on inside of us as shame ... we are not objects or prizes. We are QUEENS.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/24/standing-outside-the-circle-on-may-day-i-felt-a-sense-of-loss","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T02:34:12Z","webTitle":"Standing outside the circle on May Day, I felt a sense of loss | Brigid Delaney's diary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/standing-outside-the-circle-on-may-day-i-felt-a-sense-of-loss","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/standing-outside-the-circle-on-may-day-i-felt-a-sense-of-loss","fields":{"headline":"Standing outside the circle on May Day, I felt a sense of loss","bodyText":"I am in Thomas Hardy country – Wessex – where there are teeny tiny cottages with thatched roofs and hedgerows and oaks covered in lichen, and for two or three brief, gorgeous weeks, fields of bluebells. In high spring, the air is scented and thick with butterflies. This is also “leave” country, and the faces in the village where we are staying are mostly white and old. London is a different country. We did a few days walking, and what struck me most was how ancient and unbroken this place actually is. From the flints and old stone tools lying around the fields, to old worn paths across farms and the rights of way, to the terraces and rims of iron age hill forts where sheep now graze – the past, not just the recent Hardy past, but the deep, dawn-of-civilisation past – is everywhere. Walking with a local from the village, across a field she pointed quite casually to a medieval lime kiln embedded in an oak, and picked up flints from the ground, some of which could date back to Neolithic times. Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday The human traditions of spring are also preserved – and not in aspic, but as living parts of village life. On my first night, I went to the church, converted into a bar and dance floor. Friday night and the village was having a ceilidh: young people danced with old people, and the movements were complex. I resisted joining the dance – I didn’t know the moves. Later that week, on May Day, the villagers got up before dawn and hiked up a hill with a barrel of specially brewed nettle beer and danced and drank as the sun came up. I was waiting in the village for them to come back down, and at 7am in their weird, old-fashioned clothes, they danced through the town with green sprigs in their hair, and the morris dancers did their bit, and everyone went to the pub for breakfast. And later the drinking from pewter mugs continued as the dancers moved to another pub and brought out their instruments; a box accordion, fiddles, a lute. These dancers would die, and their sons – or maybe daughters – would learn the dance, and the rites of spring would continue unchanged. What I saw all around me was the privilege of continuity. And it made me feel a complicated sort of sadness. I shouldn’t be surprised at the continuity. England’s an old place. Yes, it was bombed in the second world war, but the last successful, large scale invasion was the Norman invasion of 1066. But seeing how unbroken the culture is out here in Wessex made me mourn for all the cultures that have been broken by the English. Colonialism and English incursions and invasions have brought legal systems and tea and railways but disrupted or destroyed ancient ceremonies, and events marking seasons, harvest, new moons and important dates and rites of passage. Many white Australians appear deeply uncurious about the long, ancient rites and rituals of the Indigenous people of our country while hankering for established, perpetual rituals for themselves. We have a cultural and spiritual hunger that we cannot quite acknowledge. There is a longing for cyclical and meaningful rituals that came before us and will outlive us. Isn’t that how it’s always been, everywhere? But these new rituals of ours are not embedded in nature, the earth and a change of season – but in conquest and war. What is the observance and passing into sacred lore of Anzac Day and Australia Day (in their current forms both fairly new celebrations) other than an attempt to embed some sort of continuity and cultural celebration in our calendars? As Richard Flanagan said in his recent press club address “Instead of new ideas and new visions we are made wallow in threadbare absurdities and convenient fictions: Australia Day, the world’s most liveable cities, secure borders.” It’s only when you stand outside the circle on May Day and see an entire village take part in rituals that stretch back to the time of the ancient Celts, that you feel a sense of loss, for what might have been in all the broken and colonised communities of the British Empire. • Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"culture/2018/may/28/political-correctness-isnt-killing-comedy-scared-old-stagnant-comedians-are","type":"article","sectionId":"culture","sectionName":"Culture","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T18:00:36Z","webTitle":"Political correctness isn’t killing comedy.

Scared old stagnant comedians are","bodyText":"Comedy has been an important part of my life for as long as I can remember. My parents, working long and brutal hours in menial jobs in the struggle to raise four children, had every right to be sad, worried and angry people. Instead, to get through the hard times, they turned to humour. The funniest jokes in our house were rewarded; banter and good-natured teasing were encouraged. Although not formally educated, my parents’ natural intelligence shone through in their quick wit. Moving through my teenage years, comedy became even more vital. There is almost nothing worse you can be in high school than a fat girl, and everyone moves quickly to make sure you know it. I still very much endured my share of bullying and teasing, but I was able to make friends fast, build defences and deflect a lot of abuse by using humour. Comedy helped me survive. In the years since high school, comedy has given me great friendships, the ability to make people want to kiss me, and is responsible for my current career as a writer. But it’s also been the cause of immense pain. Recently, some “comedians” like Kevin Bloody Wilson and Austen Tayshus came out strongly against the current comedy climate, claiming that the irreverent and larrikin Australian humour they have wielded for decades is dying, being strangled to death by political correctness (because there’s nothing edgier than whingeing to the Daily Telegraph). Tayshus said: “The soft new generation of PC-wary comedians need to grow some balls and not worry about pleasing the audience.” (Ah yes, pleasing the audience, the worst thing a performer can do.) Comic Vince Sorrenti said: “Comedy is a wonderful form of expression, it’s not quite dead but it’s on life support. I’ve made fun of gender, homosexuality, terrorism, paedophilia. It’s not being negative – comedy enables you to deal with the darker things in life and by ignoring them you create a problem.” Do you notice anything about this sentence? Sorrenti, a very established and experienced comedian who is concerned about the PC police ruining comedy, places “gender” and “homosexuality” in the same category as “darker things” like “paedophilia” and “terrorism”. This hints towards the actual issue here. I have heaps of great comedy memories, but my first one is vivid for the wrong reasons. It’s a memory of being in the house while my older brothers watched Eddie Murphy’s 1983 special Delirious. The house filled with hysterical laughter at Murphy’s genius, as they watched it over and over. That particular special opens with five minutes of extremely homophobic material. Murphy talks about faggots, being scared of faggots, being scared of getting Aids and various other hilarious jokes – mostly about faggots. Murphy has since apologised for the material, but it left a mark on me forever. A more recent comedy memory involved seeing stand-up comedy in Brisbane a few years ago with my then girlfriend, as the comic on stage launched into a set of homophobic jokes about the movie Brokeback Mountain. First of all, Brokeback Mountain had been out for ages – if you are going to try and be offensive, at least do me the service of being current. I was sitting at a table of queer women and I have the distinct memory of my stomach dropping, and the tense looks on their faces, while the audience around us all laughed. Kevin Bloody Wilson’s “poofters” routine from the 90s about going into a gay bar in London has dated about as well as you might imagine. With lines like “I walked into this joint and it’s just top-heavy with these doe-eyed, limp-wristed fucken doughnut punchers,” it is actually quite confronting to listen to now. But as a gay person, it always would have been confronting for me to listen to. I would not have been one of the audience members roaring with laughter – I would be sitting there, humiliated and scared. These things were undoubtedly of their time. Racist and homophobic jokes, which were always obviously bad, and which always punched down in a gross mimicry of what comedy should be, were more accepted by wider audiences back when these men were at their peak. Thankfully, society has progressed to a point where most audiences no longer find it funny or acceptable for straight men to make jokes about faggots onstage. And yet somehow, even without their genius, comedy in Australia is thriving. Comedy festivals around the country are flourishing, there continues to be new avenues for comedians to get on screen and comedy podcasts are constantly reaching new heights. This shift doesn’t mean that comedians can’t make edgy jokes, or joke about whatever topic they choose. I am of the belief that almost nothing is out of bounds, as long as you tackle it in the right way. It is true that you can probably no longer walk on stage, talk about how disgusting homosexuals are and expect the audience to eat it up. But this is not a bad thing. This is not PC culture censoring you or ruining your life, or making it impossible for you to do comedy. This is society progressing, and you remaining sadly stagnant. Complaints against PC culture tend to come from comedians who had it easy for a long time, and who are too lazy or untalented to progress their comedy along with society. These are bitter men who refuse to approach comedy in a more clever way, and who would instead prefer to blame their inability to win over the wider public on those groups they are no longer allowed to use as punching bags. This is sadly not only an argument put forward by the Kevin Bloody Wilsons of the world. I have had similar arguments with more moderate comedians, those who were able to figure out their comedy chops at university, years before their every move could be scrutinised on social media. Frustratingly, they claim that many young comedians are trying too hard not to offend, and therefore not hard enough to be funny. This is as unfair as it is short-sighted. Young comedians refusing to take the trodden path should be admired – they are figuring out how to do comedy without the tried and tested way of punching down and making the easy joke. They are being edgy, they are pushing boundaries and they are being funny under a lot more scrutiny, and they are succeeding. This is not about being overly sensitive, it is simply about growing and adapting to what the audience will accept, and figuring out how to be funny within those parameters. It’s also just about not being a shit person. I’ll happily trade the death of the kind of comedy these men are mourning for the ability to go and watch comedy without feeling like I might become the butt of the joke. • This article originally appeared in the literary magazine Kill Your Darlings under the headline In Rude Health"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/25/tobacco-industry-child-labour-malawi-special-report","type":"interactive","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-25T05:00:52Z","webTitle":"The children working the tobacco fields – 'I wanted to be a nurse'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/25/tobacco-industry-child-labour-malawi-special-report","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/25/tobacco-industry-child-labour-malawi-special-report","fields":{"headline":"Special report: the children working the tobacco fields – 'I wanted to be a nurse'","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"australia-news/2018/may/24/don-dale-no-charges-to-be-laid-over-royal-commission-findings","type":"article","sectionId":"australia-news","sectionName":"Australia news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T02:25:24Z","webTitle":"Don Dale: no charges to be laid over royal commission findings","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/may/24/don-dale-no-charges-to-be-laid-over-royal-commission-findings","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/australia-news/2018/may/24/don-dale-no-charges-to-be-laid-over-royal-commission-findings","fields":{"headline":"Don Dale: no charges to be laid over royal commission findings","bodyText":"A former Don Dale detainee, Dylan Voller, said the royal commission into the Northern Territory’s youth justice system was a “waste of money” after police announced that no charges would be laid despite its findings. The royal commission’s report, released in November, found “shocking and systemic failures” over many years in the youth prison system that were ignored at the highest levels of government. At the time the commissioners said they had referred a number of matters to police, including potential criminal conduct by youth justice officers, the harassment or threatening of witnesses or potential witnesses, and the physical, sexual and neglectful abuse of children in out-of-home residential care settings. But on Thursday NT police confirmed no charges would be laid. “Investigations relating to matters referred to NT police as a result of the royal commission have concluded, with no charges being laid,” a spokeswoman said. Voller, who spoke to the indigenous affairs minister, Nigel Scullion, on Thursday, told the Guardian he was shocked. “There are kids getting charged for graffiti and damaging property but there’s no responsibility for adults who are meant to be looking after young people,” he said. “It’s very disappointing after all the abuse that was seen on television. Not just of me but other young people as well. It will mean the continuation of that in other juvenile detention centres all over the country. It’s going to set a precedent for other guards that they can just keep doing it and getting away with it.” Voller was one of six teenage boys teargassed in Darwin’s Don Dale juvenile detention centre in 2014. The incident prompted two damning reviews and an investigation by the ABC’s Four Corners program, which led to the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory. He said no criminal charges being laid after the commission’s more than 200 recommendations undermined its purpose. “It was a waste of money,” he said. “There’s been all these investigations and recommendations, all these things saying those person have done wrong, and nothing. If I walked up to someone and choked them, stripped them naked or if someone walked into public change rooms and started recording kids ... it’s child abuse. It’s sexual abuse. What gives someone the right to tell a child to kill himself or make him eat shit?” Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon The royal commission found that in many cases “procedures and requirements of the law have simply not been followed”. “The systems failed to comply with the basic binding human rights standards in the treatment of children and young people,” it said. It upheld shocking allegations raised during the 12 weeks of public hearings, including verbal abuse, physical control, inappropriate force and restraint, and the bribing or daring of children to carry out humiliating or degrading acts, or to commit violence against one another. Among more than 230 recommendations, it called for the Don Dale prison to be closed. But the former corrections minister, John Elferink, told the NT News that the fact no charges had been laid showed that the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had been misled when he announced the commission. “We have acted and always acted when in government with absolute probity, something Four Corners had explained to them at length, something they chose not to run with, and as a consequence they put out a story saying that we tortured children, that we acted with barbarism in our hearts and it made comparisons to Abu Ghraib,” he said. “All of those things are indictable offences; none of that was found to be true.” The territory government has since announced it will spend $229m to implement more than 200 recommendations, but has said it cannot afford to cover all of them."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/23/jared-kushner-security-clearance-granted-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T01:12:15Z","webTitle":"Jared Kushner granted security clearance after painful process","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/jared-kushner-security-clearance-granted-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/23/jared-kushner-security-clearance-granted-white-house","fields":{"headline":"Jared Kushner granted security clearance after painful process","bodyText":"Jared Kushner has been granted permanent security clearance, renewing his access to sensitive intelligence and potentially paving the way for his return to a more active role in the White House. Donald Trump’s son-in-law is presumed to have been granted a level of clearance known as Top Secret/SCI that would allow him to see the president’s daily security briefing and other closely guarded documents. He was stripped of that ability in February amid concerns that foreign governments were planning to manipulate him by exploiting his complex web of business ties. The granting of security clearance potentially brings to an end a troubled patch for Kushner. A month after his security status was downgraded, it was revealed that the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, Robert Mueller, had taken an interest in Kushner’s business affairs, including his attempts to gain refinancing of his family’s flagship property at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan from foreign entities. But the FBI’s decision to award him permanent security clearance, first reported by the New York Times, suggests that Kushner may have turned a corner. Lawyers were agreed that such permission was unlikely to have been given were he still in legal peril. As a sign of Kushner’s newfound confidence in his position, his attorney Abbe Lowell appeared on CNN and disclosed that Kushner had been questioned by Mueller’s investigative team for a second time last month. Lowell was adamant that no financial matters had been on the agenda. Instead, the lawyer said, the investigators stuck closely to the script of the Mueller investigation: “The topics were the appropriate topics.” Asked what those topics were, Lowell said they included what happened in the presidential campaign that might suggest there was Russia collusion; contacts with outside people, especially foreign individuals, during the transition period; and post-inauguration events in the White House relating to possible obstruction of justice, particularly the firing of the FBI director James Comey. “Being under investigation for his finances, for his role in his companies, let me tell you, those were not the topics,” the lawyer said. Lowell said Kushner was a witness of interest to Mueller because he had a unique vantage point on all those issues: “He was the point of contact for foreign officials in the campaign and in the transition, and he was around the circumstances in the firing of Comey.” Kushner’s process of gaining security clearance has been unusually painful and drawn out. It began badly after it became clear that he had failed to disclose details of many of his financial holdings on the official forms. He also failed to tell the FBI about meetings with foreign dignitaries including Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador in Washington, in the presidential transition period. Kushner is proving to be one of the rare survivors in Trump’s White House, having held on to his job longer the likes of Steve Bannon and Rex Tillerson. His official role is as adviser to the president, with a special handle on innovation in government and Middle East diplomacy. Last month he spoke at the highly controversial opening of the new American embassy in Jerusalem, while the Israeli army opened fire at the frontier with Gaza, killing 58 Palestinian protesters."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"film/2018/may/23/woody-allen-moses-farrow-mia-dylan-sexual-assault-claim","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T22:42:20Z","webTitle":"Woody Allen's son Moses Farrow defends father over sexual assault claims","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/23/woody-allen-moses-farrow-mia-dylan-sexual-assault-claim","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/23/woody-allen-moses-farrow-mia-dylan-sexual-assault-claim","fields":{"headline":"Woody Allen's son Moses Farrow defends father over sexual assault claims","bodyText":"Woody Allen and Mia Farrow’s adopted son, Moses Farrow, on Wednesday defended his father from allegations of sexual assault made by his sister. In a nearly 5,000-word post, Moses elaborated further on claims he had made in previous interviews that his mother was physically abusive to him and her other children and that she coerced her daughter Dylan into accusing Allen of assault. “I’m a very private person and not at all interested in public attention,” Farrow wrote in the post titled A Son Speaks Out. “But, given the incredibly inaccurate and misleading attacks on my father, Woody Allen, I feel that I can no longer stay silent as he continues to be condemned for a crime he did not commit.” In 2014, Allen’s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow wrote an open letter alleging the director had sexually abused her when she was seven. Allen denies he molested his daughter. “It had been investigated by Yale and conclusions were clear and I have no interest in that whole situation,” he said to the Guardian in 2016. “I get harassed all the time on it. But it doesn’t affect me and I just have no interest in it.” In the new blogpost Moses Farrow disputes the allegations made by his sister, writing: “Dylan was alone with Woody in his apartment countless times over the years without a hint of impropriety, yet some would have you believe that at the age of 56, he suddenly decided to become a child molester in a house full of hostile people ordered to watch him like a hawk.” Dylan Farrow responded to her brother’s claims in a statement: “As I said when he last made these claims, this is an attempt to deflect from a credible allegation made by an adult woman, by trying to impugn my mother who has only ever been supportive of me and my siblings. It’s easily disproven, contradicts years of his own statements, is beyond hurtful to me personally, and is part of a larger effort to discredit and distract from my assault. My brother is a troubled person. I’m so sorry he’s doing this.” Allen continued his successful film-making career after Dylan Farrow’s letter was published, but has faced renewed criticism in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Dozens of women have alleged Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them since October 2017, when the New York Times and Allen’s son, Ronan Farrow, published investigative reports about Weinstein. In his blogpost, Moses Farrow also accuses his mother, Mia Farrow, of physical abuse, including slapping him, and brainwashing. “For all of us, life under my mother’s roof was impossible if you didn’t do exactly what you were told, no matter how questionable the demand,” he wrote. When he made similar accusations in a book published in September 2017, Mia Farrow said in a statement: “Moses has cut off his entire family including his ex-wife who was pregnant when he left. It’s heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up, perhaps to please Woody. We all miss and love him very much.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/23/monaco-grid-girls-sebastian-vettel","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T19:36:46Z","webTitle":"Sebastian Vettel disagrees with phasing out of ‘grid girls’ in Monaco","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/23/monaco-grid-girls-sebastian-vettel","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/23/monaco-grid-girls-sebastian-vettel","fields":{"headline":"Sebastian Vettel disagrees with phasing out of ‘grid girls’ in Monaco","bodyText":"Formula One Management insists there will no ‘grid girls’ at this weekend’s Monaco Grand Prix, despite reports they were to make a return at the behest of the race organisers, Automobile Club de Monaco. F1 denies there was any conflict with Monaco and says that, while women will be seen on the grid, they are part of a promotional arrangement that had been discussed over time and agreed upon amicably. FOM said they could not be construed as ‘grid girls’ and that they would not be holding board numbers nor standing in front of cars. The issue remains divisive among drivers, with Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel saying he believed dispensing with ‘grid girls’ had been unnecessary. F1 decided to cease the practice this season, replacing them with ‘grid kids’– young karters selected by each race’s host nation. The commercial director, Sean Bratches, was unequivocal about the decision at the time, saying ‘grid girls’ were “at odds with modern-day societal norms. We don’t believe the practice is appropriate or relevant to Formula One.” Monaco has been seen as a direct challenge to the change in policy. However, a senior source at F1 management told the Guardian: “What is going to happen here is nothing new.” The women would be present as part of a long-standing commercial relationship between the race and watch manufacturer Tag Heuer and would only be taking pictures and showing messages from social media. The ‘grid kids’ will still be present and FOM insisted there had been no change in policy. Of the five races held this season four have had a promotional presence on the grid. In Melbourne it was children selected by the organisers to promote Australia; in Bahrain, Gulf Air hostesses and stewards; in China, men and women representing Heineken; and in Spain, air hostesses from Emirates Airlines. FOM said it has been in discussions with promoters on the decision and with Monaco for at least eight weeks in what was described as a collaborative process. It was suggested similar promotional activity might occur at other meetings this season but F1 had no intention of returning to using ‘grid girls’. Vettel, who trails Lewis Hamilton by 17 points in the world championship, said he believed the original decision had been an overreaction. “I think all the women that took part as a grid girl in the past did it because they want to,” he said. “I’m sure if you ask any grid girl on Sunday if they’re happy to stand there, their answer would be: ‘yes’. I don’t think there’s anybody that forces them to do it. It speaks a little bit of our times that sometimes there’s a lot of noise for nothing.” Hamilton was non-committal. “I definitely don’t think that we should ever be supporting or pushing these women in general to feel uncomfortable and, if they are, then we shouldn’t do it. If they’re comfortable doing it, I don’t really know,” he said. Haas’s Romain Grosjean disagreed with Vettel and thought F1 was right to dispense with what is seen by many as an archaic tradition. “When it was removed I thought it was a good thing for women in the 21st century because they were not used as just a board holder,” he said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/24/andrew-cuomo-hillary-clinton-cynthia-nixon-new-york-governor","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T11:57:55Z","webTitle":"Why did Hillary Clinton endorse Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon? | Jamie Peck","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/andrew-cuomo-hillary-clinton-cynthia-nixon-new-york-governor","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/24/andrew-cuomo-hillary-clinton-cynthia-nixon-new-york-governor","fields":{"headline":"Why did Hillary Clinton endorse Cuomo over Cynthia Nixon?","bodyText":"It’s long been a cornerstone of Hillary Clinton’s branding that she’s a woman seeking power in a man’s world. From Madeleine Albright’s “special place in hell” speech to the pages of Cosmopolitan to the 2016 primary debates, Clinton and her associates have often presented female identity as inherently progressive in an elected official. “There are plenty of reasons why we need more women in office. That’s true whether you’re a Democrat, a Republican, or an independent,” she wrote in Cosmo. The most recent version of candidate Clinton took great pains to present herself as a progressive as well, at least when speaking to the general public. Imagine my shock, then, when she emerged from a period of relative dormancy to endorse a conservative man over a liberal woman: Clinton has backed the incumbent Andrew M Cuomo over his challenger Cynthia Nixon in New York’s Democratic gubernatorial primary. While progressives and leftists alike have long known Clinton – and the political establishment she represents – to deploy the “representation” card in only the most cynical and selective of ways, this case is particularly galling. In addition to being a man, Cuomo is a machine politician who talks like a progressive Democrat but acts like a moderate Republican. His crimes include underfunding the MTA, attacking public education via charter schools, and protecting his friends in the real estate business from subpoenas. After creating an “independent” commission to investigate corruption, he blocked it from investigating his own office and subsequently disbanded it. His former top aide, Joseph Percoco, was convicted on three corruption charges in March. Up until Nixon’s challenge pressured him into ending their deal, he allowed the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) to swing control of the state senate to the Republicans, stymying efforts to pass single-payer healthcare, fully fund education, and cement New York as a sanctuary state. (It recently dissolved, but this is probably just a hiatus; Cuomo convinced the IDC to temporarily disband in 2014 when he faced a primary challenge from Zephyr Teachout, too.) Cuomo is drowning in corporate money; Nixon has vowed to accept none. Is this what Clinton’s Pac, Onward Together, was talking about when it promised to “advance progressive values”? Clinton’s endorsement of Cuomo might make sense if Nixon’s politics were way out of line with her own currently professed views, but they’re not. With an emphasis on racial justice, education, and raising taxes on the wealthy to fund basic services (not the least of which is our crumbling subway system), Nixon’s program sits firmly within the realm of left-liberal reform and has much in common with the platform Clinton ran on in 2016. Nixon even supported Clinton over Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. If elected, she would be the first female governor of New York, as well as the first openly LGBT New York governor. If we are to take Clinton at her word, it’s hard to think of a better candidate for her to throw her support behind. The picture gets clearer when you look at Clinton’s history with Cuomo, who served as housing secretary in her husband’s administration and campaigned for her in the 2016 primary and general elections. Politico ran a whole five-part series on the relationship between the Clinton and Cuomo dynasties. It’s almost like taking care of your friends is more important than getting more women into office. Of course, it’s possible Clinton’s name has become so toxic her opposition will actually help Nixon, in which case, progressives should thank her. Intentionally or not, opposition from such unpopular establishment figures as Clinton and Christine Quinn will only help the activist and Sex and the City actor make a case for herself as the reformer Albany needs. This article was amended on 25 May 2018 to clarify that if elected, Cynthia Nixon would be the first openly LGBT governor of New York, not the first openly LGBT governor in the US."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2018/may/25/netflix-puts-content-above-costs-but-is-policy-sustainable","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T14:07:19Z","webTitle":"Netflix puts content above costs but is the policy sustainable?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/25/netflix-puts-content-above-costs-but-is-policy-sustainable","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/25/netflix-puts-content-above-costs-but-is-policy-sustainable","fields":{"headline":"Netflix puts content above costs but is the policy sustainable?","bodyText":"Netflix briefly overtook Disney as the world’s biggest media company this week but some analysts are wondering if the streaming service’s rapid growth is sustainable. The company behind Stranger Things and The Crown must continue producing hits, poaching Hollywood talent and gaining subscribers at a rapid rate if it is to justify the faith of an investment community that pushed its valuation to nearly $162bn (£121bn) on Thursday – $10bn ahead of Disney. Netflix had reverted to second place by the close of trading but the trajectory is clear: the California-based business that started out as a DVD rental outfit in 1997 is putting Hollywood and conventional broadcast networks in the shade. It has 125 million subscribers worldwide – including more than 55 million in the US and more than 8 million in the UK – and this year the company is spending $8bn on content, including 700 original TV shows and 80 movies. This week, the company announced yet more of the high-end content deals that underpin its growth, signing up Barack and Michelle Obama to produce films and documentaries, and announcing a $150m blockbuster, Six Underground, starring Ryan Reynolds. The expenditure behind the casting coups and award-winning content, however, is significant. Netflix expects a negative free cash flow of between $3bn to $4bn this year – meaning the amount its spends on content, marketing and other costs in 2018 will exceed what it earns from subscribers by at least $3bn. It needs debt, and willing banks, to do this. Last month, Netflix raised almost $2bn in debt – its largest raise to date and the second time in less than a year it has turned to the debt market – to continue to feed film and TV content to the binge-watching generation it helped create. “They need to keep on borrowing as they are investing so much so quickly in content and have to stay ahead, there’s nothing else they can do,” Tom Harrington, an analyst at Enders, says. “They have to stay ahead of Amazon and Apple, and soon Disney. They are at the moment but there are very well funded, larger, competitors starting to get their act together.” The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, does not like to come second and showed his intent to take the fight to Netflix with an edict to find a Game of Thrones-style hit for its Prime Video service resulting in executives striking a $1bn deal to bring the Lord of the Rings to TV. So, too, Apple, which outbid even Netflix’s seemingly bottomless pockets for a TV series starring Reese Witherspoon, who on top of her Hollywood star premium commands astronomical fees after the success of HBO’s Emmy-winning Big Little Lies, and Jennifer Aniston. Disney has pulled its vast array of content – from Star Wars and Toy Story to Beauty and the Beast and the Marvel universe of superhero films – from Netflix before launching its own streaming service next year. In the global quest to win subscribers Netflix has sparked a content arms race that is becoming an increasing financial burden on the company. Netflix declares a small profit – net income was $290m in the first three months of 2018 – because it is able to spread the spiralling costs of making programmes over a number of years. However, the company has almost $30bn of debt and liabilities across its balance sheet. Netflix’s total streaming obligations, for making and licensing TV and film content, will cost $17bn over the next few years, while its long-term debt as of 31 March was $6.5bn. It also has $3bn to $5bn in costs it expects to pay relating to “traditional film output deals or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown”. Including the recent debt raising, the company’s total liabilities are around $30bn. In Netflix’s favour, it remains in high-growth mode, a 20-year old business with the profile of a digital startup, that makes it a darling with investors that has kept it insulated from negative market sentiment. Revenues surged by 32% to $11.7bn, thanks to millions more subscribers agreeing to pay from £5.99 per month in the UK and $10.99 a month in the US. However, Netflix’s practice of spreading the cost of programmes over a multi-year timeframe – an industry standard – is being questioned by some analysts who argue that the binge-watch nature of an on-demand world means the value of a programme or film expires much quicker than on traditional linear TV. “Nominally Netflix looks profitable,” Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere, says. “That is because all of the cash burn on productions and acquisitions is amortised over a number of years. But on-demand is different to traditional broadcast. The schedule is compressed and there are questions over that [practice for Netflix] and does it feed through to profit and loss in the same way and is it realistic.” Meanwhile, the content deals keep coming. It has an agreement with Shonda Rhimes, creator of hits including Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder; a $300m deal with Ryan Murphy, whose credits include Glee, Nip/Tuck and American Crime Story; the Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman, and Jenji Kohan, who is behind Weeds and Orange is the New Black. All of these cost a lot of money and are driving inflation in Netflix’s content costs. “Netflix is trying to solve a problem of its own making,” Broughton says. “There are two elements here. Netflix wants to make sure it has brand strength associated with its own titles – like [pay-TV channel] HBO with Game of Thrones – and it also increasingly can’t afford to be beholden to anyone else for too many killer show brands. Netflix can’t be at the mercy of content suppliers, some of whom like Disney would rather pull content to protect themselves.” Netflix anticipated the threat of studios pulling their content. Over the last five years it has been trying to insulate itself against the inevitable content backlash. So Netflix has been rapidly boosting its spend on original productions. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, recently said the goal is to spend 85% of its total budget on its own content. Netflix is adamant it can continue growing at a healthy rate. Its backers argue: 700m broadband and pay-TV homes around the world (excluding China) have yet to take up a subscription; Disney and its ESPN sport unit happily shoulder sport programming commitments of $50bn; and the S&amp;P credit rating service has put the company’s debt, which carries the riskier junk status, on a positive watch. The question is, can Netflix add enough new subscribers – and hopefully raise subscription costs – to keep up its increasingly costly spend on content, and service its debt. “Providing Netflix’s growth on subscribers and revenues remains at the same trajectory it is sustainable,” Broughton says. “Netflix has been adept at increasing pricing without losing subscribers but that is going to be difficult in its new growth markets like Asia and Africa, where there are cheaper competitors already. This year could be when Netflix starts to see slower growth. If the growth slows they are in trouble.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/23/former-newcastle-football-coach-george-ormond-accused-of-abusing-19-boys-jury-hears","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T18:17:39Z","webTitle":"Former Newcastle football coach accused of abusing 19 boys, jury hears","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/23/former-newcastle-football-coach-george-ormond-accused-of-abusing-19-boys-jury-hears","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/23/former-newcastle-football-coach-george-ormond-accused-of-abusing-19-boys-jury-hears","fields":{"headline":"Former Newcastle football coach accused of abusing 19 boys, jury hears","bodyText":"A football coach who spent several years working at Newcastle United “cynically manipulated his position” of authority to groom and sexually assault young boys over a 25-year period, a jury has been told. George Ormond, now 62, is charged with 38 criminal sexual offences against 19 victims who were youth footballers at the time. Thirty-six of the charges are indecent assault, along with one of indecency and one of buggery, alleged to have been committed between1973 and 1998. He is alleged to have committed the offences during the years he worked as a volunteer kitman, bus driver and helper in the Newcastle United youth set up, as a coach at a north-east boys’ football club, and as a helper on the Duke of Edinburgh scheme in a Newcastle school. Opening the case before Judge Edward Bindloss at Newcastle crown court, prosecuting barrister Sharon Beattie told the jury: “George Ormond was a person, an older man, you will hear, who used his position to groom and manipulate young people in order to facilitate sexual assaults on them.” Beattie said that many of the alleged victims recall a rule at the boys’ club, which was strictly enforced, that they must never wear underpants. He said that they described constant references by Ormond to the boys’ genitals and to masturbation, repeated indecency, inappropriate touching and sexual assaults. He is alleged to have assaulted the victims at the boys’ club where he gave them rub-downs with liniment, Beattie said, and in his car or van where he had boys on their own after offering to give them lifts home. He was “liked and trusted” by many of the boys and their parents, and was regularly invited into their homes. One assault is alleged to have taken place in Ormond’s home on a boy he had invited to stay over, while Ormond’s then-wife was upstairs. “To many, as well as being in a position of trust, he appeared to be a figure of authority and influence,” Beattie told the jury, “and this was something that at times he cynically manipulated to his own advantage.” Several victims, Beattie said, will testify that Ormond used their football ambitions as young boys to enable his sexual assaults and manipulate the boys into keeping quiet. One of the complainants, Beattie said, alleged that during the time Ormond had begun to sexually assault him, Ormond had said to him: “I know you don’t want to do this but it’s what you must do to be a footballer.” The same alleged victim says Ormond warned him to keep quiet by telling him: “I’ve got your dreams in my hand. If you say anything, I will crush them.” With that, Beattie said, Ormond clenched his hand tightly. That was “a further example”, she said, “of the cynical manipulation of young boys’ dreams for Ormond’s sexual pleasure.” Ormond sat impassively, occasionally making notes, in the dock behind reinforced glass, as the case against him was outlined. Beattie told the jury that Ormond left Newcastle United following allegations made by a former youth player about him. At the time, no police complaint was made against Ormond, but Beattie said that “Newcastle United, under the guise of George Ormond’s lack of current coaching qualifications, dispensed with his services”. That former youth player “and a few others” did complain to the police in 2000 and, in 2002, Ormond was tried and convicted of criminal sexual offences, Beattie told the jury. Two former players went public in 2016 with allegations against Ormond, and then the current alleged victims, many of whom had never previously talked to anybody about these experiences, made complaints to the police. Beattie said that the offences alleged in the current charges “share a number of similar features” with those for which Ormond was convicted, and show, she said, “that George Ormond has a proven disposition to sexually assault young men in particular ways and circumstances”. Beattie said the alleged victims had explained different reasons for why they did not previously make complaints about Ormond’s conduct. “Some chose to bury what happened, some were embarrassed, most had never told anyone,” she said. “Some even felt guilty, worried whether in some way they were responsible for George Ormond’s abuse of them. Of course they were not.” Ormond denies all the charges. Beattie told the jury that he denies that any of the alleged incidents happened at all. “His case in essence is that all these allegations are untrue.” The opening of the prosecution case continues on Thursday."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/24/kids-nest-parents-boomerang","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-24T09:48:01Z","webTitle":"Worried about turfing your kids out of the nest?

Fear not – they’ll be back","bodyText":"A New York judge has ordered 30-year old Michael Rotondo to move out of his parents’ house. The ruling comes after Rotondo’s parents tried and failed to evict their son in a series of letters. “There are jobs available even for those with a poor work history like you,” they wrote. “Get one – you have to work!”. Rotondo, unrepentant, told reporters he planned to appeal. For anyone who is a parent of adults or near-adults, it is almost unimaginable that coaxing them out of the nest could ever come to such a pass, even though most of us, at one time or another, have probably imagined it. It is one of the great paradoxes of parenting: even if you don’t really want them to go, you still worry they will never leave. My oldest son moved into his own place just recently, illuminating some of the finer points of this paradox. The whole time your adult children are living at home, you worry you’re making things too nice for them – free laundry services, hot meals, overly relaxed policies regarding smoking indoors and keeping odd hours. Most seaside B&amp;Bs have stricter rules. The second they depart, however, you start trying to lure them back for a visit with the exact same perks: supper, free beer, a working dryer. Have a bath while you’re here. Of course you can smoke! Do you have a key? Take a key! We’re now accustomed to thinking of this generation as the one that might never leave home. According to the Office for National Statistics the percentage of adults aged 20 to 34 still living with their parents has risen from 21% in 1996 to 26% last year. For males it’s 32%, which is astonishing. Rotondo may be shiftless, but he’s not an anomaly. Under these circumstances, to prepare for children to leave the nest is to simultaneously prepare for their return. You can’t really turn that bedroom into a home gym. The boomerang generation will always have the need of that front-door key. I know well enough what it’s like to boomerang back. When I came home from college in 1992, all my younger siblings were still in higher education and living elsewhere. I hadn’t eaten dinner with my parents alone for 20 years. I lasted about nine months before I moved out after, I seem to recall, a conversation about rent. Two years later, I managed to relocate from Boston to New York, and then to London. Then, all of a sudden, I found myself back in my old bedroom, jobless and painting my Dad’s office for money. I was 28. If my parents ever sought legal advice, they didn’t tell me. There may be extra reasons why Rotondo’s parents went to court (one of their letters advised him to sell his valuables: “This is especially true for any weapons you may have”) that do not apply in most cases. My advice to parents with grown kids still at home is not to worry too much about what you’re doing to hold them back. In my experience, making yourself an always-available source of unsolicited advice is a pretty good deterrent to them staying forever, no matter how good a cook you are. Even if your house is as cushy as an open prison, it’s still a prison. Your kids will leave as soon as they’re able, and they won’t come back if they can help it. When they’re finally gone, you will expel a long sigh of relief, and then spend the rest of your life trying to get hold of them. • Tim Dowling is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"football/2018/may/23/john-terry-miss-chelsea-games-new-aston-villa-deal","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T22:18:00Z","webTitle":"John Terry could miss Chelsea games under new Aston Villa deal","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/23/john-terry-miss-chelsea-games-new-aston-villa-deal","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2018/may/23/john-terry-miss-chelsea-games-new-aston-villa-deal","fields":{"headline":"John Terry could miss Chelsea games under new Aston Villa deal","bodyText":"Aston Villa are confident John Terry will sign a new contract if they win promotion to the Premier League and are willing to reach an agreement with the 37-year-old that would allow him to miss both games against Chelsea to help facilitate any deal. Terry signed a lucrative one-year contract with Villa last July and revealed at the time that he had turned down offers to remain in the Premier League because he did not want to face Chelsea, where he made 717 appearances across 22 years. Within Terry’s deal there is a clause that entitles him to a new 12-month contract if Villa are promoted – they face Fulham in Saturday’s Championship play-off final – as well as a substantial bonus. Villa firmly believe that Terry, who has started 32 league games this season, will want to stay if they return to the top flight and they are prepared to remove any possibility of the fixtures against Chelsea being an issue. Although Steve Bruce’s response to that potential problem was slightly tongue-in-cheek, it is understood that Villa would agree to Terry missing the Chelsea matches if need be. Asked whether it was certain that Terry would stay if Villa defeat Fulham, Bruce, the manager, replied: “Well, we’ll not pick him against Chelsea if that’s what he wants. I really genuinely hope he triggers it. All those phone calls to him, he hasn’t been disappointed with it. You can’t be disappointed when you walk through here.” Bruce said that Terry had been a huge influence at Villa on and off the field. “I just knew what he would give. Let’s be fair, he has been one of the great defenders of our country. He is a great leader of men, which we don’t produce many of any more, and in a quiet way; he is not a ranter and a raver, he is not one who puts heads through doors. He is calm. People like [Jack] Grealish have looked up to him and thought: ‘Is that the way I’ve got to be to be a top player?’” Bruce’s opposite number on Saturday, Slavisa Jokanovic, has said he intends to pressurise Terry and James Chester and expects the pair to make mistakes. “Experience in life is important but it’s not everything,” Fulham’s manager said. “When you talk about experience you are talking about the past. John Terry is a fantastic player, so is James Chester. They have experience playing in this stadium. But probably they cannot be in their best level right now. “We are the youngest team, the team with more energy. We believe in our style. We believe we can dominate the situation. We are going to try to put against Terry some fast and some stronger players. I expect he can make some difference in our favour. He plays in a complicated position. All of us can make mistakes and I expect some mistakes from his side.” Jokanovic responded to rumours of interest in him from Chelsea by saying: “I have a contract and that’s it. I am not thinking about the future. This game is so huge I don’t know what I am going to do on Sunday morning.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"cities/2018/jun/01/quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-russian-world-cup-cities","type":"article","sectionId":"cities","sectionName":"Cities","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T10:00:47Z","webTitle":"Quiz: how well do you know the Russian World Cup cities?","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/jun/01/quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-russian-world-cup-cities","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/cities/2018/jun/01/quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-russian-world-cup-cities","fields":{"headline":"Quiz: how well do you know the Russian World Cup cities?","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/23/uber-shuts-down-self-driving-operation-in-arizona-two-months-after-fatal-crash","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T19:38:45Z","webTitle":"Uber shuts down self-driving operation in Arizona after fatal crash","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/23/uber-shuts-down-self-driving-operation-in-arizona-two-months-after-fatal-crash","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/23/uber-shuts-down-self-driving-operation-in-arizona-two-months-after-fatal-crash","fields":{"headline":"Uber shuts down self-driving operation in Arizona after fatal crash","bodyText":"Uber is to shut down its self-driving car programme in Arizona after one of its cars killed a pedestrian there in March. The company will focus its research efforts on Pittsburgh, where a number of AI car projects, including Ford’s Argo AI program and Google’s Waymo, are centred. Uber will also continue to test in San Francisco, where the company has its headquarters. In an internal email, the Uber executive Eric Meyhofer wrote that the company would be changing the way it tested its driverless cars. “When we get back on the road, we intend to drive in a much more limited way to test specific use cases,” he said. “Taking this approach will allow us to continually hone the safety aspects of our software and operating procedures. We have also used the past two months to strengthen our simulation capability, which will allow us to be more efficient with our use of road miles.” According to the Arizona Republic, about 200 Uber employees – many of them safety drivers – will lose their jobs in the state. Meyhofer said that returning to testing driverless cars to public roads would be tied “to securing the proper testing permits alongside our safety improvements. We remain focused on our safety review, which is evaluating everything from the safety of our system to our vehicle operator training.” The testing freeze came after one of its SUVs hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Tempe while operating in autonomous mode – the first fatality involving an autonomous vehicle. The Uber car, a Volvo XC90 sport utility, had been equipped with the company’s sensing system and was in self-driving mode with a human backup driver at the wheel when it struck Elaine Herzberg, 49, who was walking with her bicycle on the street. A Tempe police spokesman said it did not appear as if the car had slowed down before impact. The switch to testing primarily in Pittsburgh is in keeping with other companies developing self-driving technology. In addition to Uber, Google and Ford, Apple also established a research facility in the city. Pittsburgh, sometimes referred to as “Silicon Valley East”, is popular because of the access to Carnegie Mellon University’s leading robotics lab and because the city’s road network is based not on a grid system, but rather on windy American Indian trading trails. The theory is that if self-driving cars can work there, they can work anywhere."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/23/replacing-cladding-on-tower-blocks-will-mean-fewer-affordable-homes","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T17:59:06Z","webTitle":"Replacing tower cladding will mean fewer affordable homes in coming years","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/23/replacing-cladding-on-tower-blocks-will-mean-fewer-affordable-homes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/23/replacing-cladding-on-tower-blocks-will-mean-fewer-affordable-homes","fields":{"headline":"Replacing tower cladding will mean fewer affordable homes in coming years","bodyText":"A £400m fund announced by Theresa May to pay for replacing combustible cladding on up to 158 social housing high-rise buildings following the Grenfell Tower fire, means fewer affordable homes will be built in the coming years, it has emerged. The government has admitted that the funds for the renovations are being taken from the Affordable Homes Programme. Neither May nor the secretary of state for housing, James Brokenshire, mentioned that the money was coming from that budget when they announced the bailout last week, triggering widespread relief in the housing sector. Across England more than 300 towers rising above 18 metres and clad in similar materials to those used on Grenfell have failed laboratory fire tests and about half are in the social housing sector. Social landlords had lobbied the government hard for the money, saying they could not otherwise afford the replacement work. Uncertainty remains about what cladding materials should be used because the government has yet to confirm whether all combustible materials will be banned for cladding, although on Wednesday May said she was “minded” to do so. The details of the funding for the scheme emerged in a written answer from the housing minister, Dominic Raab, following questioning from the shadow housing secretary, John Healey. Raab said: “This does mean that fewer homes will be delivered in the short term.” But he claimed that £400m would be added to the next Affordable Homes Programme budget, which was not due to start until 2021-22. The initial aim was to provide 225,000 units through the Affordable Homes Programme up to 2021. The government has not said how many fewer homes would be built. Even if £150,000 were spent building every home it would mean a reduction in the new supply of affordable housing units of almost 2,700 over the period up to 2021-22. Raab said: “The government will fully fund the removal and replacement of dangerous aluminium composite material cladding [used on Grenfell] on buildings owned by councils and housing associations, with costs estimated at £400m ... Our Affordable Homes Programme remains over £9bn, with £400m of that now available in 2021-22. “This responds to calls from social landlords for longer term certainty of grant funding for new homes. The programme will still deliver the same number of homes, but this does mean that fewer homes will be delivered in the short term.” He added: “We will announce more details shortly about how councils and housing associations can apply for funding, including conditions attached to the grant.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/26/rolling-stones-london-stadium-live-review","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T16:00:00Z","webTitle":"Rolling Stones review – satisfaction guaranteed from rock’s old stagers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/26/rolling-stones-london-stadium-live-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/26/rolling-stones-london-stadium-live-review","fields":{"headline":"Rolling Stones review – satisfaction guaranteed from rock’s old stagers","bodyText":"We could be in a big venue anywhere in the world. Fans wearing Rolling Stones merchandise converse in various tongues. The bars speak the international language of weak lager. You know you are in a former Olympic venue in a recently reinvented bit of London, however, because you can just spy the top curve of Anish Kapoor’s audacious sculpture, the ArcelorMittal Orbit, peeking out above the rim of West Ham’s stadium. It looks like a big fat red lip – inadvertently echoing the unapologetic leer of the Rolling Stones’ logo, reproduced repeatedly tonight on the backs of fans and on the giant screens behind the stage. “It’s nice to be back in Londuuuuhn,” confirms Mick Jagger, with just the right level of offhand, proprietorial camp at the start of a summer of British fixtures. Later, Jagger will talk about this venue not being far from a place he remembers as “Dalston Baths” – it’s either Leyton Baths, where the Stones played in 1963, or Dalston’s Chez Don club (same era); places not that far away spatially, but a foreign country, conceptually. As the ley lines run, we’re not all that far from Sidcup either, where a fresh-faced Keith Richards was studying at art college when he bumped into his former schoolmate Jagger on a train platform and they bonded over some vinyl. Much as things often aren’t what they used to be, especially in London, that art college is now a Morrison’s. Leyton Baths is a Tesco. The stadium itself displaced a mountain of disused fridges. Everything feels so spectacularly unmoored these days. But some things are more impervious to the ravages of time and the disruptiveness of recent history than geography or architecture. As much as is humanly possible, the Rolling Stones are exactly what they used to be – scrawny Englishmen with a thing for the blues, capable of reproducing the foundation documents of rock music with guts and flair. You’d go see Bach if he were alive: this is the white guy guitar band equivalent. There are times tonight, though, where this Stones gig can feel like a museum piece whose exhibits might require a little more curation, given modern sensibilities. Some of these songs have the air of semi-naked native mannequins posed to look awed at overdressed colonialists; acceptable at the time, perhaps, but questionable now. A lairy and louche Midnight Rambler is the extended showpiece of tonight’s set. Slowing down, speeding up, the band work their way through some call-and-response into an magnificently abstract lull, where Mick Jagger twitches his way backwards down the catwalk, the anchoring keyboards of Chuck Leavell and Matt Clifford are muted and Ron Wood and Keith Richards are not playing so much as issuing prangs of guitar – an interlude that feels unscripted and alive. It’s the best advert for the Stones as a working band, that rolling, itinerant carnival of cutting loose. If the past is another country, however, where they do things differently, nowhere is the lacuna between then and now more noticeable than on Rolling Stones songs about rapist murderers, a slaver’s penchant for young African girls (Brown Sugar), and keeping women subservient (Under My Thumb, a fan selection, in which Jagger preens over what nowadays we might call coercive control). That great extended blues, Midnight Rambler, celebrates a rapist as a kind of outlaw, wreaking countercultural vengeance on the smug within their “marble halls”. If a modern lens exposes some unsightly blemishes, the edifice that is the Stones certainly seems bulletproof. Charlie Watts’s profile might have grown a little more hawk-like since London last saw him in 2013, but he gazes down upon the complicated business of rock’n’roll with a jazz drummer’s hauteur in a pressed blue linen shirt. He dons headphones for a couple of tracks – the awesomely slinky disco of Miss You probably operates to a click track – but otherwise remains largely unmoved. Wood (“the Hogarth of Hounslow”, as Jagger introduces him) and Richards spend the first couple of songs looking worried, accentuating the topography of their crevassed faces. It’s a nice touch, that these gurning multimillionaires seem to care enough to frown their way through Street Fighting Man and It’s Only Rock’n’Roll, fretting as well as strutting. Throughout, Jagger is nothing short of superhuman, his voice deserving of a monument of some kind. An entire generation is losing theirs: Dylan’s reduced to a parched wheeze, Neil Young’s more wilfully inconstant than ever, Paul McCartney not quite hitting the high notes, and Paul Simon embarking on a farewell tour while the going’s good. Jagger’s yowl is as elastic as Lycra and as powerful as it needs to be to boom out across the stadium (and bounce back disconcertingly: this venue was not built for sound). As toned as a racing whippet, he can still launch into his trademark series of signature spasms, like James Brown and Tina Turner doing the waggle dance in a blender. Constancy being a Stones byword, it’s the hits tonight. Variety comes in the form of a blues cover, from their recent Blue and Lonesome album (Ride ’Em on Down), and two unnecessary solo compositions by Keith Richards. These totally undermine his piratical persona by revealing a frail singing voice and a deep seam of sentimentality. Some of these hits feel rote and some still capable of electrifying frissons. One curveball – Fool to Cry, a smooth, soulful cut from 1976 – gets its unexpectedly twinkly debut in the 21st century; the Stones haven’t played it live since 1999. The introductory notes of Paint It Black – Richards, plus a sitar line played through one of the keyboards, at a guess – usher in an orientalist masterpiece that mounts to an almost military flourish; the fact that Jagger hums significant passages of melody remains seductively quirky. As the guitarists play themselves in, complementing each other – Richards on noodly rhythm guitar, Wood on washes of lead – the ravines give way to expensive dentistry as the two take up their roles as the grinning naughty schoolboys of the piece. By (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction, the final song of the encore, both Wood and Richards are up to actual mischief. Playing fast and loose with their parts, they crease up as they actively troll Jagger, who is miles away down the catwalk and dancing to the only thing he is left with: the constant, resilient bounce of Darryl Jones’s bass line."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"music/2018/may/25/lindi-ortega-liberty-review-faustian-haunted-country","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T09:30:43Z","webTitle":"Lindi Ortega: Liberty review – Faustian, haunted country","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/lindi-ortega-liberty-review-faustian-haunted-country","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/25/lindi-ortega-liberty-review-faustian-haunted-country","fields":{"headline":"Lindi Ortega: Liberty review – Faustian, haunted country","bodyText":"Last year, Lindi Ortega told me of her frustration that she was more likely to win fans playing to a punk crowd on a bill with a band such as Social Distortion than she was appearing on the same bill as the hat acts at a mainstream country festival. Perhaps that frustration accounts for her seventh album, on which she makes no attempt to whoop it up, instead presenting a song cycle that’s significantly more western – in the sense of the movies – than country. Guitars twang, mariachi brass swoops in and out, and Ortega sings a story that – as with most song cycles and concept albums – doesn’t really make a lot of sense unless someone’s explaining it to you. It all adds up to something Ennio Morricone, Lee Hazlewood and Calexico might have dreamt up in an imaginary cantina. Ortega has spoken of her love for Quentin Tarantino, and the notional plotline is Tarantinoesque – someone with darkness in their heart has bad friends, loses someone close, has a seance, makes a deal with the devil – and that’s only the first four songs. There’s more, but it all gets a bit Norse-saga-with-sagebrush. Of course, you don’t need to know (or grasp) the plot to adore the music, to bathe in the tumbling arpeggios of Lovers in Love, to thrill at the tension and darkness of The Comeback Kid.

Maduro secured a second six-year term in power on Sunday, shrugging off allegations of vote-buying and electoral fraud to claim what he called a historic, heroic and truly popular victory. Venezuela’s electoral commission said Maduro, who was first elected in 2013 following the death of his political benefactor, Hugo Chávez, received more than 5.8m votes compared with the 1.8m of his nearest rival, Henri Falcón. But, in a reflection of Maduro’s deep unpopularity at a time of severe economic turmoil, the official voter turnout was at a historic low of just 46.1%. Maduro put a positive spin on the vote during a late-night victory address outside the presidential palace, Miraflores, in Caracas, hailing an “impeccable electoral process”. “The whole of Venezuela has triumphed! Democracy has triumphed! Peace has triumphed! Constitutionality has triumphed!” Maduro shouted, adding: “The revolution is here to stay!” But on Monday, the 55-year-old faced a wave of domestic and international censure as well as the looming threat of fresh economic sanctions. Falcón, who on Sunday rejected the “illegitimate” election and called for a fresh vote, tweeted: “We will carry on working so there can be fair elections that will allow us to rescue our country from this totalitarian and wicked government.” The US vice-president Mike Pence, described the vote as a “sham” which was “neither free nor fair”, while in a separate statement, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the US “will take swift economic and diplomatic actions to support the restoration of their democracy.” The 14-nation Lima group of Latin American countries plus Canada said its members did not recognise the election’s legitimacy and would recall their ambassadors from Caracas. In contrast, Cuba’s Communist party leader, Raúl Castro, sent Maduro the warmest congratulations for his “transcendental victory”. Vladimir Putin also congratulated the Venezuelan leader, but also said he hoped there would be a “national dialogue in the interests of the entire Venezuelan people”. Speaking in Buenos Aires, where he is attending a meeting of G20 foreign ministers, Johnson said the group would “be talking about what we can do”. He said: “The feeling I get from talking to my counterparts is that they see no alternative to economic pressure – and it’s very sad because obviously the downside of sanctions is that they can affect the population that you don’t want to suffer. But in the end, as one politician in this area said, things have got to get worse before they get better – and we may have to tighten the economic screw on Venezuela.” Johnson called Venezuela “an absolutely tragic story of a people kept in hostage to a defunct ideology; a ghastly command economy, state socialism, the entire oil reserves in the hands of the state; the country going to rack and ruin. A humanitarian crisis that’s spilling out into the region.” The foreign secretary began his five-day visit to South America on Saturday in Peru, which – like other countries in the region including Brazil and Colombia – is now grappling with what experts call the worst migration crisis in recent Latin America history as Venezuelans flee their home. Johnson said: “They’ve got hundreds of thousands of refugees in Peru from Venezuela. They’re having to cope with a humanitarian crisis. They’re having to give them healthcare, they’re finding that in Peru they’re suffering new epidemics because of the condition of the refugees coming from Venezuela.” Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said new sanctions targeting Venezuela’s oil sector were very likely in the coming days or weeks. “That is obviously something that is extremely concerning because this is already a country that is in a deep economic crisis and we know that oil sanctions would have an impact on Venezuela’s people,” he said. While Venezuela’s oil production had fallen under Maduro “the funds from oil exports still account for about 90% of the government’s coffers,” Ramsey said. “That’s money that is used to import food and medicine and it’s obviously badly needed at a time when there is mass scarcity of basic goods and people are dying of preventable diseases because they don’t have access to medication.” Ramsey criticised Johnson’s “deeply cynical” warning that the situation may have to worsen before it improves. “That is using Venezuela’s populace as a political pressure tool. We’re talking about people that are dying because they can’t have access medicine or basic goods and food. It is deeply cynical to use those people and their suffering in the hope that it might lead to some sort of political transition when that is not even a guarantee.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"books/2018/may/26/why-the-extraordinary-story-of-the-last-slave-in-america-has-finally-come-to-light","type":"article","sectionId":"books","sectionName":"Books","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T09:59:53Z","webTitle":"Why the extraordinary story of the last slave in America has finally come to light","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/26/why-the-extraordinary-story-of-the-last-slave-in-america-has-finally-come-to-light","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2018/may/26/why-the-extraordinary-story-of-the-last-slave-in-america-has-finally-come-to-light","fields":{"headline":"Why the extraordinary story of the last slave in America has finally come to light","bodyText":"“We stand as living monuments,” wrote the historian Len Garrison, of the black British descendants of slavery and empire. “For those who are afraid of who they must be, are but slaves in a trance.” For Garrison, the idea of the African diaspora as “living monuments” was to some extent figurative. But a new book makes it literal. Barracoon: The Story of the Last Slave presents the remarkable fact that there were people alive in America who had experienced abduction from Africa – being examined, displayed, traded and enslaved – well into the 20th century. The book is the story of Cudjo Lewis; a man born Oluale Kossola in the Yoruba kingdom of Takkoi. Kossola was the last survivor of the last known slave ship to sail from the African continent to America with a human cargo. Written in the 1930s, but hidden away from a public audience until now, it is also perhaps the last great, unpublished work by the Harlem Renaissance writer Zora Neale Hurston. The word “barracoon” refers to the enclosures in which captives were held on the coast before being loaded on to ships. In Kossola’s case it was the Alabama vessel the Clotilda, which played its own gruesome part in the slave trade in 1860, half a century after its official abolition, transporting 130 men and women from the west African kingdom of Dahomey – modern day Benin. By 1931, when Hurston interviewed Kossola – sweetening him with peaches, Virginia hams and late summer melons –, he was around 90 years old, and yet able, over a period of three months, to recall his life in Takkoi in great detail; his grandfather, an officer of the king; his mother and siblings; law and justice; love and adolescence. He spoke in heartbreaking detail of watching his community annihilated during a raid by Dahomey’s female warriors, leading to his capture and enslavement, the torture of the “middle passage”, and life in 19th and 20th century Alabama. Through all these years – many more lived in America than he had spent in his African birth nation – he never let go of the unspeakable loss of his homeland. When Hurston takes his photograph, Kossola dresses in his best suit, but removes his shoes, telling her: “I want to look lak I in Affica, ’cause dat where I want to be.” The uniqueness of the story and that of the writer who tells it are layered and intertwined. The old, poetic Kossola, generous with his parables and storytelling, is one of almost four million Africans enslaved late in the history of the transatlantic trade. And while the full history is documented in countless accounts of slave traders, merchants, plantation owners and masters, ledgers and auction records and court documents, the number of first-hand accounts of Africans forced to become Americans can be counted on two hands. It is Hurston, and perhaps Hurston alone, who could have drawn this heavy tale out of the often melancholy old man, and have the vision and skill to make it sing, in the way that Barracoon does, for reasons rooted deeply in her own life story. Hurston was born in 1891 in Eatonville, Florida, a small town with an entirely black population, which she would later describe as “the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty guavas, two schools and no jailhouse”. She would keep close links to her hometown, despite leaving when she was just 13, and then drifting – working as a manicurist and achieving a degree part time at Howard University – until she arrived in New York in 1925. By then she was in her mid 30s (but convinced those whom she met that she was a full decade younger) and had – as she wrote later in her autobiography Dust Tracks on a Road – “$1.50, no job, no friends, and a lot of hope”. Hurston began studying anthropology at Barnard College and, having received a fellowship to gather material in her home state, set about documenting African American folk traditions in towns like Eatonville, and later in the southern states, the Bahamas and Haiti. It was during this period, right at the beginning of her career, that she first met Kossola, interviewing him several times in the late 1920s. It was her first major project, but also her first major failure. An article she published about Kossola in the Journal of Negro History would be accused of plagiarism, allegations which scholars now contest, and which in any event drove Hurston to return to Alabama, to conduct the series of interviews that would form the core of Barracoon, and, this time, to do so in a manner that would cast the work beyond any doubt. Around this time, black art began asserting itself brazenly in an America still emerging from four centuries of slavery and legalised white supremacy, and the belief that the African had no civilisation to offer. By the time of her death in 1960, Hurston would have published more books than any other black woman in America. But it wasn’t until she caught the attention of sociologist Charles S Johnson, champion of the Harlem Renaissance and the editor of Opportunity, the official journal of the National Urban League (which published her work as well as that of Claude McKay, Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen), that she got her break. Even within the Harlem Renaissance, Hurston’s approach was radical. Inspired by her Eatonville roots, she was instinctively compelled by the folklore, the idioms, customs, worksongs, spirituals, sermons, children’s games, folktales and practices of African American communities of the south. While other members of the black intelligentsia were celebrating racial uplift, and while hundreds of thousands fled the rural south in the “great migration”, in search of what they imagined to be progress in northern cities, Hurston was interested in “the Negro farthest down”. Her goal as an author, anthropologist and essayist, was – the scholar Karla Holloway has said – “to render the oral culture literate”. “The unlettered Negro,” Hurston wrote, was “the Negro’s best contribution to American culture.” It was this belief which inspired Barracoon – a book in which there is little of Hurston herself, but plenty of her ideology, in capturing Kossola, a man whose culture slavery both created and destroyed. Like the language of some of Hurston’s later works – Mule Bone, the play she would write with Hughes in 1931; Mules and Men, a compilation of oral folklore in 1935; and her most famous work, the novel Their Eyes Were Watching God in 1937 – Kossola’s narrative plays the music of history itself within its tonalities, rhythms and inflections. But the narrative, like Kossola, stands apart from Hurston’s others; his speech is more a recognisably African Creole than the African American vernacular, and despite all his decades living in America, Kossola is steeped in the thought of Africa, the world – as he calls it – “in de Affica soil”. Hurston’s fidelity to the manner and content of Kossola’s storytelling is the book’s strength. Yet within it were also contained the seeds of Barracoon’s downfall. When Hurston took the manuscript to publishers, they wanted her to anglicise his English, which she resolutely refused to do. “Hurston was not interested in, as Toni Morrison might put it, the white gaze, and how ‘they’ would perceive us,” explains Deborah Plant, a Hurston scholar who edited Barracoon. “She was interested in what was specific in African American culture, those aspects which were rooted in African tradition, African history, African civilisation, because in that authenticity lay the genius – the spirit, as Hurston describes it – that which the soul lives by.” For Cheryl Wall, Zora Neale Hurston professor of English at Rutgers University, “this impatience with Hurston’s determination to transcribe Kossola’s speech faithfully is enormously frustrating”. It was “part of the pattern of Hurston’s life that she had to fight so hard to have her voice heard, and the voices of those whose stories she wanted to tell. We are told the dialect is too difficult. Is it really any more difficult than the dialect of Mark Twain or James Joyce? Yes it requires some extra effort, but it’s the kind of effort we usually put into a literary text without complaint.” The irony is astounding. Kossola, a man denied his home and his voice by American racism, would have the telling of his story silenced too. Barracoon, having been met with intransigence by publishers, remained unpublished, ending up in a private collection that was passed to the archive at Howard University in 1956, where it remained inaccessible to all but a handful of scholars who read it and cited it in their work. Hurston found her own life mirroring this cycle of narration and dispossession. After the success of her work in the 1930s and 40s, her hugely productive career spiralled downwards. She lived hand to mouth, writing articles for magazines while working at odd jobs, including one stint in Miami for an employer who saw her byline in the Saturday Evening Post and tipped off a reporter that the author was her maid. Hurston was humiliated, and spent the next decade in a series of small towns in Florida, plagued by health and money problems, until she ended up in a welfare home where she died, penniless, of heart disease in 1960. At the time of her death, none of her seven previously published books was in print. Neighbours collected money for her funeral and it made front page news in the local black weekly, the Fort Pierce Chronicle. But she was buried in a segregated cemetery, in an unmarked grave. For the novelist and feminist Alice Walker, who in 1973 set out to discover what had become of Hurston, finding this grave in a “field full of weeds” was a devastating experience. “There are times,” wrote Walker, “and finding Zora Hurston’s grave was one of them, when normal responses to grief, horror and so on do not make sense because they bear no real relation to the depth of emotion one feels.” Walker was determined to restore Hurston’s legacy and reputation. She obtained a gravestone, and had it inscribed with the words: “Zora Neale Hurston – A genius of the south. Novelist. Folklorist. Anthropologist.” Their Eyes Were Watching God, still considered Hurston’s greatest work, was soon back in circulation. That edition, by the University of Illinois Press, sold more than 300,000 copies, making it, as Wall says, “one of the most dramatic chapters in African American literary history”. ¶ The publication of Barracoon thus represents a recovery within a recovery; the works of Hurston having been so dramatically resurrected, but this one languishing in obscurity until now. And its publication comes at an emotive moment in the African American experience – an experience loaded not just with historical trauma, but very contemporary pain. Alice Walker writes, for example, in the foreword to the book, that in reading Kossola’s story, African Americans “are struck with the realisation that he is naming something we ourselves work hard to avoid, how lonely we are too in this still foreign land”. Karla Holloway, professor of English at Duke University, says: “The irony is that the loneliness that echoes through Kossola’s account, and that Walker so poignantly notices, is our collective legacy. “We work hard to escape and slip past that loneliness, but inevitably we are captured, again, by the wake of slavery, a tidal wash as reliable as moonrise.” The era of Black Lives Matter, of harassment in coffee shops, of a president who has been both overtly racist and also dismissive of racism, and of the disappointment at the first black president having been able to make little real change to poverty, criminalisation and exclusion, has produced a moment in which the struggle has never been more apparent, yet the cultural expression of that suffering has never been more visible. “I do think one of the reasons that the book is so attractive right now is that there is this longing for African Americans to have access to a pre-US life – a connection to Africa,” says Autumn Womack, an assistant professor of English and African American studies at Princeton University. “If nothing else, Barracoon announces the desire for this kind of connection, even if it’s never really fulfilled. People are searching for a vocabulary to make sense of that.” That struggle is finding expression in film, TV and theatre that focuses on the experience of slavery; from the Oscar-winning 12 Years a Slave, the remake of the memorable series Roots and the multi-award-winning musical Hamilton. It is present in pop culture, with the recent phenomenon of Childish Gambino’s “This Is America”, whose video references the violent brutalisation of African Americans. There are new museums – America’s first of African American history, which opened in 2016; the Whitney Plantation, the first plantation museum on American soil; and the nation’s first memorial to the horrors of lynching, in Alabama. It is abundant in literature too; Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad and other influential books such ass Isabel Wilkerson’s The Warmth of Other Suns, which tells the story of the Great Depression in new and profound detail; Stamped from the Beginning, by Ibram X Kendi, which chronicles the lifespan of American racism; Angie Thomas’s The Hate U Give, radicalising readers of young adult fiction to the injustice of police killings; and Jesmyn Ward’s devastating Sing, Unburied, Sing. The pathos of the African American experience, told with such tenderness in Barracoon, is matched by its complexity. Hurston herself remarked that in writing Kossola’s harrowing account of how the king of Dahomey profited from raiding and selling members of neighbouring kingdoms, she was deeply affected by the question of African complicity in the slave trade. “The inescapable fact that stuck in my craw,” Hurston wrote, “was my people had sold me and the white people had bought me. That did away with the folklore I had been brought up on – that white people had gone to Africa, waved a red handkerchief at the Africans and lured them aboard ship and sailed away.” And yet Barracoon also helps deepen the understanding of the context in which slavery took place. “This idea of ‘African complicity’ is more myth than a reality,” Plant says. “Because at that point in history, there was no such thing as an ‘African’. People on the African continent did not self identify as Africans; instead there was a self identity in relation to specific ethnic groups and specific kingdoms, religions or language. So many of us don’t know, because we don’t have these nuances about our history.” The absence of stories like Kossola’s has hardly helped bring these nuances to the fore. There are other difficult questions arising from the book about the extent to which the African American victims of slavery internalised the attitudes of their oppressors. Kossola recalls how his children in particular endured bullying from neighbouring African Americans, for having two African-born parents. “All de time de chillun growin’ de American folks dey picks at dem and tell de Afficky people dey kill folks and eatee de meat,” Kossola recounts in Barracoon. “Dey callee my chillun ig’nant savage and make out dey kin to monkey … It hurtee dey feelings.” “Those acculturated African Americans could have been more open, more receptive, compassionate, and they weren’t,” Plant says. “They were a source of hostility to Kossola and his community. We can explain or rationalise it, but it doesn’t justify it.” The book’s uniqueness is in its recounting of a story in which we are all equally bound up by this cycle of oppression – the former slave plagued by the trauma of losing his homeland and family, the writer whose work survived the desire of intellectuals for white approval, the reader forced to challenge their own ideas about race and the internalisation of oppression. But more than anything it brings an African past up close to an African American present, at a time of great searching. “Throughout her life, Hurston fought against this idea that there was no connection to Africa once people arrived on these shores, and everything was forgotten,” Wall says. “We know that’s not true. But a book like this really brings that to life.” • Barracoon: The Story of the Last Slave by Zora Neale Hurston is published by HarperCollins."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/22/european-parliament-livestream-mark-zuckerberg-appearance-facebook","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-22T06:00:46Z","webTitle":"European parliament to livestream Mark Zuckerberg appearance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/22/european-parliament-livestream-mark-zuckerberg-appearance-facebook","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/22/european-parliament-livestream-mark-zuckerberg-appearance-facebook","fields":{"headline":"European parliament to livestream Mark Zuckerberg appearance","bodyText":"Mark Zuckerberg will appear publicly before the European parliament on Tuesday, ending a terse standoff with the institution, but further inflaming tensions with the House of Commons, which has repeatedly requested an appearance from the Facebook founder. The president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, announced on Monday morning that Zuckerberg’s appearance would be publicly livestreamed, following criticism that the Facebook chief executive had initially managed to persuade the body to meet him behind closed doors. “I have personally discussed with Facebook CEO Mr Zuckerberg the possibility of webstreaming meeting with him,” Tajani tweeted. “I am glad to announce that he has accepted this new request. Great news for EU citizens. I thank him for the respect shown towards EP.” Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear in front of the parliament’s conference of presidents at 5.15pm BST. The conference consists of the leaders of the parliament’s eight main political groups. Also in attendance will be the Labour MEP Claude Moraes, who chairs the European parliament’s home affairs committee, and Tajani. The European parliament appearance may help thaw relations between Facebook and the EU, but it has further antagonised the British parliament, which has been repeatedly requesting that Zuckerberg appear in front of its digital, culture, media and sport select committee as part of an investigation into fake news. Damian Collins, the chairman of the DCMS committee, said: “The Facebook data breach was executed in the UK and the data went to a UK company, affecting more than 1 million UK users. “The UK parliament therefore should be able to question Mark Zuckerberg about this and the lessons to be learned from it, and we remain open to him giving evidence.” Collins and the committee suggested a number of questions the European parliament should ask Zuckerberg, based on unsatisfactory answers given by one of his deputies, Mike Schroepfer, in April. “If Mark Zuckerberg chooses not to address our questions directly, we are asking colleagues at the European parliament to help us get answers,” Collins said “Particularly on who knew what at the company, and when, about the data breach and the non-transparent use of political adverts which continue to undermine our democracy.” As long as Zuckerberg remains outside Britain, there is little the committee can do to compel his testimony. However, it has discussed the prospect of issuing formal summons against the Facebook founder and other individuals who refuse to give evidence. If continually ignored, those could ultimately lead to arrest for contempt of parliament."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/31/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-electronic-electrical-engineering","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-31T12:38:28Z","webTitle":"University guide 2019: league table for electronic & electrical engineering","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/31/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-electronic-electrical-engineering","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/31/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-electronic-electrical-engineering","fields":{"headline":"University guide 2019: league table for electronic & electrical engineering","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"technology/2018/may/21/google-sued-tracking-44m-uk-iphone-users-browsing-data-apple-safari","type":"article","sectionId":"technology","sectionName":"Technology","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T15:18:06Z","webTitle":"Google sued for 'clandestine tracking' of 4.4m UK iPhone users' browsing data","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/google-sued-tracking-44m-uk-iphone-users-browsing-data-apple-safari","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2018/may/21/google-sued-tracking-44m-uk-iphone-users-browsing-data-apple-safari","fields":{"headline":"Google sued for 'clandestine tracking' of 4.4m UK iPhone users' browsing data","bodyText":"Google is being sued in the high court for as much as £3.2bn for the alleged “clandestine tracking and collation” of personal information from 4.4 million iPhone users in the UK. The collective action is being led by former Which? director Richard Lloyd over claims Google bypassed the privacy settings of Apple’s Safari browser on iPhones between August 2011 and February 2012 in order to divide people into categories for advertisers. At the opening of an expected two-day hearing in London on Monday, lawyers for Lloyd’s campaign group Google You Owe Us told the court information collected by Google included race, physical and mental heath, political leanings, sexuality, social class, financial, shopping habits and location data. Hugh Tomlinson QC, representing Lloyd, said information was then “aggregated” and users were put into groups such as “football lovers” or “current affairs enthusiasts” for the targeting of advertising. Tomlinson said the data was gathered through “clandestine tracking and collation” of browsing on the iPhone, known as the “Safari Workaround” – an activity he said was exposed by a PhD researcher in 2012. Tomlinson said Google has already paid $39.5m to settle claims in the US relating to the practice. Google was fined $22.5m for the practice by the US Federal Trade Commission in 2012 and forced to pay $17m to 37 US states. Speaking ahead of the hearing, Lloyd said: “I believe that what Google did was quite simply against the law. “Their actions have affected millions in England and Wales and we’ll be asking the judge to ensure they are held to account in our courts.” The campaign group hopes to win at least £1bn in compensation for an estimated 4.4 million iPhone users. Court filings show Google You Owe Us could be seeking as much as £3.2bn, meaning claimants could receive £750 per individual if successful. Google contends the type of “representative action” being brought against it by Lloyd is unsuitable and should not go ahead. The company’s lawyers said there is no suggestion the Safari Workaround resulted in any information being disclosed to third parties. They also said it is not possible to identify those who may have been affected and the claim has no prospect of success. Anthony White QC, for Google, said the purpose of Lloyd’s claim was to “pursue a campaign for accountability and retribution” against the company, rather than seek compensation for affected individuals. He said: “The court should not permit a single person to co-opt the data protection rights of millions of individuals for the purpose of advancing a personal ‘campaign’ agenda and should not allow them to place the onus on individuals who do not wish to be associated with that campaign to take positive steps to actively disassociate themselves from it.” Tom Price, communications director for Google UK said: “The privacy and security of our users is extremely important to us. This case relates to events that took place over six years ago and that we addressed at the time. “We believe it has no merit and should be dismissed. We’ve filed evidence in support of that view and look forward to making our case in Court.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/2018/may/21/gcses-are-failing-stress-test-as-students-suffer","type":"article","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T17:43:01Z","webTitle":"GCSEs are failing stress test as students suffer | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/21/gcses-are-failing-stress-test-as-students-suffer","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2018/may/21/gcses-are-failing-stress-test-as-students-suffer","fields":{"headline":"GCSEs are failing stress test as students suffer","bodyText":"I am a year 11 student who is currently sitting their GCSE examinations. Sally Weale’s article (‘My lunchtimes are filled with crying children’, 17 May) sheds some light on what people my age go through. Many people I know suffer from depression and anxiety, we lose sleep, we don’t want to wake up in the mornings and we are afraid to walk into the exam rooms. We are told over and over again that if we do not achieve level 7 or above we will not be able to progress in the future. I am not very academic and my skills are in the creative arts. However, my passion for those things is taken away when I have to sit a written drama exam for 40% of my grade. What are we teaching the younger generation by forcing year 11s to sit these exams? We are teaching them that the only way to achieve their dreams or be successful in what they want to do is by getting amazing GCSE results. Please, our voices are not being listened to. GCSEs damage our perception of ourselves beyond belief. If the government refuses to hear the people sitting the exams, maybe it will listen to the Guardian. Thank you. Fiona Doyle London • There’s much good sense in Gaby Hinsliff’s piece on children’s mental health (Our children are over-stressed…, 19 May). But the building of emotional resilience she advocates won’t be remotely sufficient. Modern schooling regimes profoundly damage the growth of the child’s psychological self, with a kind of “psychological violence” being perpetrated due to politician-driven curriculums, an obsession with “standards”, and an intensive surveillance through which our children are relentlessly disciplined, and with which hapless teachers must comply. For years politicians of all parties have been in complete denial about the harmful impact of their Gradgrind, audit-culture obsessions, and their macho rhetoric of “driving up” standards. At last September’s Labour conference, the week’s loudest ovation was received when a 16-year-old delegate movingly spoke of how at least half of her peers are suffering from mental health issues because of the manic audit and accountability regime. We urgently need to support movements like the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Save Childhood Movement to help head off modern society’s worst impacts; and society needs to begin processing its own anxieties rather than projecting them on to children. Free-market capitalism is toxic for children in multiple ways; and with children spending up to half their waking hours in school, the government must fundamentally reform the poisonous audit/accountability culture. More minor tinkerings won’t remotely address a malaise that has built up over decades. On a multitude of levels, it’s time for radical change. Dr Richard House, chartered psychologist Stroud, Gloucestershire • Concern over undue exam pressure is not new (The new GCSE exams pile on pressure and kill off passion for learning, theguardian.com, 18 May). In the last throes of “payment by results” in the 1880s there was a national debate about “over-pressure” – the strains produced in children by mental activity generally and school work in particular, arising from the government’s ever more complex and changing demands enshrined in regulation. Questions were posed by medics as well as educationists: does over-pressure exist, is it increasing, can it be stopped; is it sex-biased, class-biased, or is malnutrition a factor? Those same questions (including the last one) need to be posed and answered in relation to the new GCSEs. Their critics might take comfort from the fact that Victorian payment by results was soon phased out, partly as a result of the over-pressure controversy. If it happened a century ago, it could happen again given sufficient pressure, not on students but on the Department for Education. Professor Colin Richards Spark Bridge, Cumbria • When my husband attended Manchester grammar school in the 60s, pupils took six O-levels (in order to satisfy matriculation) while still following a non-examined curriculum encompassing the arts, sciences, languages and humanities. (A-levels were more important, as they were the final examinations and the key to university entrance.) This meant that far more time was devoted to education rather than exam preparation. There is no justifiable reason to subject 16-year-old pupils to numerous increasingly stressful examinations when the school leaving age is in effect 18, other than the government’s obsession with league tables and accountability. Formal education should be about nurturing enthusiasm for learning and intellectual curiosity, not this soul-destroying insistence on testing and rigid thought. When will the government start listening to teachers? Susan Newton Oldham, Greater Manchester • Michael Gove’s reintroduction of three-hour exams and an ending of coursework for GCSE students put a nail in the coffin of problem-solving and creativity. Group work and problem-solving – no longer in the curriculum – encourage peer group interaction in which individuals hypothesise, guess, interpret, imagine, argue, disagree, agree, give opinions, or summarise: all essential tools for developing cooperation and successful work with colleagues in future workplaces. They are genuinely rigorous activities that encourage both knowledge and happiness in the classroom. After Gove they have disappeared in favour of arduous exam preparation, which is onerous, laborious, relentless, fatiguing, and intolerable.

The Freight Trade Association told Davis that knowing when a lorry crossed the border would serve no purpose and that the idea was not a potential solution to the problematic border issue. “We told him that it doesn’t work and is a non-starter,” said Seamus Lehany, the head of the Freight Trade Association in Northern Ireland. “A haulier could lift a full trailer in Birmingham but it could contain 40 different consignments from 40 different producers. Then it comes to Northern Ireland and is broken down with mixed loads on different trucks going to different places, so a tracking device telling you the original truck had crossed a border doesn’t tell you anything,” said Lehany. “The Irish border situation is complicated, with physical and political constraints that need careful consideration before a workable solution can be found,” he added. The Brexit secretary met business representatives in Stormont on Sunday as part of his cabinet team’s research into the “max-fac” (maximum facilitation) customs systems he favours for UK borders with the EU after Brexit. Davis was accompanied by the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, and the business secretary, Greg Clark. One haulier at the meeting, William Dennison, said Davis repeatedly told them there would not be any infrastructure on the border. “If there was going to be no hard border why were we having a meeting?” said Dennison, who transports furniture across Ireland for companies including DFS and Marks &amp; Spencer. “We told them that customs was only the tip of the iceberg and the biggest problem was sanitary and phytosanitary checks on agrifood. Twenty per cent of meat has to be checked and 50% of chicken,” said Lehany. The FTA also pointed out that an invisible border raised the prospect of Northern Ireland becoming a smuggler’s paradise for goods that were cheaper in the UK. “So if TVs are cheaper in the UK, for example, they can come over to Northern Ireland [and] next thing they are in Dublin and in no time at all in France. The EU won’t tolerate that,” said Lehany. Jennifer McKeever, the president of the Derry chamber of commerce, said: “Ninety per cent of our 400 members want to remain in the customs union and the single market and they are looking for pragmatic solutions from a starting position that we don’t agree with. “They need to understand businesses are people: people run businesses, their customers are people. We asked them to try to understand this and suggested if they imagined what would happen if they put a border down the middle of Glasgow or Leeds or Birmingham, they could get to understand what the impact of a border is.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"world/shortcuts/2018/may/21/the-pope-says-god-made-gay-people-just-as-we-should-be-heres-why-his-comments-matter","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T14:03:47Z","webTitle":"The pope says God made gay people just as we should be – here’s why his comments matter","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2018/may/21/the-pope-says-god-made-gay-people-just-as-we-should-be-heres-why-his-comments-matter","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/shortcuts/2018/may/21/the-pope-says-god-made-gay-people-just-as-we-should-be-heres-why-his-comments-matter","fields":{"headline":"The pope says God made gay people just as we should be – here’s why his comments matter","bodyText":"It is immensely powerful to hear that Pope Francis, the leader of the Roman Catholic church, reportedly told Juan Carlos Cruz, a gay man: “God made you like this and loves you like this.” Cruz is a survivor of clerical abuse who spoke privately with the pope a few weeks ago, and has since reported his conversation to Spanish newspapers. His abuser, Fernando Karadima, was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011. As a practising Catholic, I find it deeply moving to have Pope Francis appear to confirm what many Catholics already know to be true: God made us just as we should be, there are no mistakes. Lesbian, gay, bi and trans people exist in every community, from every ethnic background and in every religion. However, religion can often be the area of life that people find the most difficult to reconcile with their identity. Some people will say that LGBT people can’t exist in faith communities; that faith communities don’t accept same-sex relationships or those whose gender doesn’t match the one that they were assigned at birth. Some believe that LGBT people can and should be “cured”. As a result of these beliefs, LGBT people often need to find a way to God despite their leaders, rather than because of them. But the pope’s reported words are a striking affirmation that LGBT people of faith belong in church and in religious communities. I have never felt excluded from the church and have always been made to feel welcome. But I have met many people who have had different experiences; people who have been damaged by being told to deny their sexuality or who feel rejected by God. Churches can be unifying spaces. Religions teach that God is love, so it should be integral that all members of the community and their relationships are respected. Just as LGBT people need respect and acceptance in wider society, they also need to be included in their faith communities. Francis’s reported words can help to build bridges between the Catholic church and LGBT people who have felt rejected and excluded from it. Many religious communities, groups and places of worship already include LGBT people. The church accepts that LGBT people exist, but I want us to get to a point where our love is recognised as being as valid as any other. While we have a way of celebrating our love through civil partnerships and same-sex marriage, we also need to keep working to allow LGBT people of faith to marry in church and declare their love in the eyes of God. I would like to see the pope’s apparent openness mirrored by others in the Roman Catholic church. I want to live in a world where all people will be accepted – for their beliefs, their faith, their sexual orientation, their gender identity and everything else – without exception. The words of Pope Francis to Juan Carlos Cruz give me hope that we are moving in that direction.

It involved answering the phone for an important man, except the phone didn’t ring for hours on end, so I spent the time guiltily converting my PhD into a book. I’ve also had several jobs that were not bullshit but were steadily bullshitised: interesting jobs in the media and academia that were increasingly taken up with filling out compliance forms and time allocation surveys. I’ve also had a few shit jobs, but that’s something different. Toilets need to be cleaned. But to have a bullshit job is to know that if it were to disappear tomorrow it would make no difference to the world: in fact, it might make the world a better place. When I read David Graeber’s essay On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs in Strike! magazine in 2013, I felt somehow vindicated. I had sat in the pub on many a Friday evening moaning to colleagues about data entry and inefficient meetings. But with the Martian gaze of the anthropologist, Graeber managed to articulate my plight in a way that made me feel part of some grand, absurdist outrage. I wasn’t alone. The essay went viral, receiving more than 1m hits, and was translated into a dozen languages. “Guerrilla” activists even replaced hundreds of ads in London tube carriages with quotes from the essay, presumably in order to jolt commuters out of their apathetic stupor. As is the way in the world of reactive non-fiction publishing, a book followed. The argument of both essay and book is this: in 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that technological advances would enable us to work a 15-hour week. Yet we seem to be busier than ever before. Those workers who actually do stuff are burdened with increasing workloads, while box-tickers and bean-counters multiply. In an age that supremely prizes capitalist efficiency, the proliferation of pointless jobs is a puzzle. Why are employers in the public and private sector alike behaving like the bureaucracies of the old Soviet Union, shelling out wages to workers they don’t seem to need? Since bullshit jobs make no economic sense, Graeber argues, their function must be political. A population kept busy with make-work is less likely to revolt. Yet as he notes, people are not inherently lazy: we work not just to pay the bills but because we want to contribute something meaningful to society. The psychological effect of spending our days on tasks we secretly believe don’t need to be performed is profoundly damaging, “a scar across our collective soul”. As well as documenting personal misery, this book is a portrait of a society that has forgotten what it is for. Our economies have become “vast engines for producing nonsense”. Utopian ideals have been abandoned on all sides, replaced by praise for “hardworking families”. The rightwing injunction to “get a job!” is mirrored by the leftwing demand for “more jobs!” Rather than directing our frustration at the system itself, we let it curdle into resentment towards workers with less bullshit jobs. Thus the hated “liberal elite” are those who get paid to indulge in such compelling and glamorous activities that many people would undertake them for free. Yet even members of that dwindling caste dutifully take on more and more paperwork, in a gesture of warped solidarity with their colleagues in admin. The problem of bullshit jobs has a lot to do with the problem of bureaucracy, the subject of Graeber’s previous book The Utopia of Rules. The problem with Bullshit Jobs is that the first two‑thirds is essentially an elaboration of his original, brilliant intervention. Graeber uses the hundreds of messages he received in response to his essay as source material, quoting testimonies at length. This puts the cart before the horse, and is also rather tiresome. I wanted to see the phenomenon traced back to its source. He provides one “smoking gun” in the form of Barack Obama’s explicit justification for sticking with the US health insurance system: otherwise, millions of form-filling jobs would be lost. A more systematic analysis – along the lines of his groundbreaking Debt: The First 5,000 Years – would help make this book what he claims it to be: “an arrow aimed at the heart of our civilisation”. Things pick up again in the final chapters, with the injection of salutary – and fascinating – lessons from history. Graeber sketches the evolution of our cult of work as an end in itself, from the emergence of the Protestant work ethic as a response to the breakdown of medieval guilds to Thomas Carlyle’s “Gospel of Labour”. What appear to be natural or inevitable features of our world are relatively new, and not set in stone. Will robots do away with bullshit jobs? Probably not, since computers need humans to break down complex tasks into units basic enough for them to digest. Some radical leftists are touting the idea of “fully automated luxury communism”, but for Graeber this relies on the assumption that jobs are primarily about making stuff. Most jobs – even those that aren’t officially in the “caring profession” – are about responding to the needs of other people, and robots aren’t very good at that. Like many commentators these days, Graeber mentions a universal basic income as a potential solution. But he is suspicious of the very challenge to produce a solution: the question “Well, what would you do about it?” is often used to silence criticism of the status quo. In an age when the myth of capitalist efficiency legitimates corporate managerialism, pointing out the bullshit is a job in itself.

Latest in their number is a fine release on the Signum label of music by Ralph Vaughan Williams from the Choir of St John’s College, Cambridge. Vaughan Williams served as a wagon orderly in the trenches, tasked with recovering shattered bodies from the battlefield, an experience that led him, despite his agnosticism, to explore and set Christian texts in an attempt to find consolation, and to discover what might lie “beyond sense and knowledge”. The Mass in G minor is one fruit of that exploration, an intense, luminous piece that both reimagines 16th-century polyphony and reveals RVW’s emerging harmonic imagination, strongly influenced by his studies with Ravel before the war. Director Andrew Nethsingha shapes a performance of profound dignity and power, beautifully sung by this always impressive choir. He also programmes several other RVW choral pieces from the same postwar period, concluding with Lord, thou has been our refuge, which moves from darkness into light in an expression of a shared determination to overcome adversity. For further listening, Stephen Johnson explores the Mass in G minor in an illuminating edition of Radio 3’s Discovering Music, available on BBC iPlayer, and the incomparable Donald Macleod profiles RVW in a Composer of the Week podcast. • Any recording from the renowned Nash Ensemble is worthy of attention, and their latest, on Hyperion, featuring chamber works by Ernő Dohnányi, does not disappoint. The Hungarian’s music was condemned as backward-looking and anachronistic during his lifetime (1877-1960), but today finds admirers for its inventiveness, clarity of structure and sheer good humour. Here, the Nash combine Dohnányi’s familiar Serenade for string trio in C major with two rewarding, lesser-known works: the String Quartet No 3 in A minor and the Sextet for piano, clarinet, horn and string trio in C major. Both pieces require virtuosic ensemble playing, spiced with a mischievous sense of fun. The Nash have both in abundance in this warm-hearted, generous recording.

It was not the first time Gahona – a crusading Nicaraguan journalist known for his investigative reports on police abuse and drug trafficking – had made such remarks. “I can’t remember how many times he told me they were going to kill him,” said his father, also called Ángel. But on 21 April – day four of a continuing popular revolt against Nicaragua’s President Daniel Ortega – the journalist’s grim prediction finally came true. As Gahona used his smartphone to stream the aftermath of clashes between police and protesters just down the street from his home in the Caribbean coastal city of Bluefields, a shot rang out and his body slammed on to the concrete. “I’m thinking he fell, or he’s joking,” recalled Neyda Dixon, a fellow journalist who was also covering the protest. “[But] when I see him bleeding out, I start to scream.” Gahona, a 42-year-old father of two who ran the local news website El Meridiano, is one of scores of people to have been killed since protests began to sweep Central America’s largest country on 18 April. At first, the upheaval was fueled by opposition to unpopular pension reforms that Ortega’s government had proposed. But when pro-government forces violently cracked down on demonstrators – in many cases with live ammunition – the focus of the uprising shifted to the septuagenarian Sandinista himself, who now faces the greatest political crisis of his 11-year rule. Since the one-time revolutionary returned to power in 2007, social programs, such as his “Zero Hunger” initiative, have benefited many. But protesters also accuse Ortega of turning Nicaragua into an authoritarian one-party state, run in cahoots with his widely loathed first lady and vice-president, Rosario Murillo. A month after the unrest began, violence returned on Monday when riot police confronted protesters and students demanding Ortega’s resignation seized a university in Managua, the capital. Government supporters quickly gathered to end the takeover, but anti-government protesters rallied to support the students. “We’re not here to hold a dialogue. We’re here to negotiate your departure,” the student leader Lester Alemán told his president at the start of talks last week to defuse the escalating crisis. If the students want to see the back of Ortega, the priority for Gahona’s family is finding out who killed him – and why. On 8 May, 17 days after his death, two young men were detained on suspicion of shooting the journalist with a homemade gun. They were paraded before the media by masked police officers and transferred to El Chipote, a notorious Managua jail. But Gahona’s family and friends are unconvinced by that narrative and instead point the finger at police, who they suspect took advantage of the chaos on the streets to dispose of a journalist they considered an irritant. “We believe the police killed Ángel to send us a message. To tell all the journalists here to shut up, to stop supporting or covering the protests,” said Hayzel Zamora, 27, a fellow journalist who witnessed Gahona’s death. Attempts to contact police in Bluefields were unsuccessful. Managua police officials said they had no information to share on the case and nothing to say. Gahona’s mother, Amanda, said her son’s childhood in 1970s Nicaragua – during the brutal dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza – had instilled in him a deep-rooted fear of the police. But after becoming a professional journalist, he never shied away from covering their activities. He became known in Bluefields for covering thorny stories such as police corruption and drug trafficking that other journalists preferred to ignore. “He wasn’t afraid of anything,” said Suyen Sánchez, a journalist and friend. Colleagues say it was that fearlessness that took Gahona out on to the streets on the afternoon of 21 April as anti-Ortega protests swept Bluefields. Sánchez, who works for a local station called Radio Unica, remembers arriving on the scene at dusk to find a group of protesters setting fire to a billboard featuring the image of Ortega and his wife. Gahona, always first on the scene, was already there. According to Sánchez, the shooting started shortly after, as police opened fire on demonstrators, hitting an 18-year-old – one of the same men later detained for Gahona’s killing. “I ran upstairs to tell his brother,” remembered the journalist’s wife, Migueliuth, who had been following his livestream from their home, just a few blocks away. “I only thought that he had been hurt.” In 1978, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, an outspoken critic of the Somoza dictatorship, was assassinated. His murder stirred public outrage and the following year a popular revolution, which Ortega helped lead, toppled the regime. When Ortega kicked off the peace talks in Managua last week, he was interrupted just seconds into his speech, by cries of: “Justice for Ángel Gahona!” One month after his death, however, relatives say there is little, if any, sign of justice. Determined that Gahona’s name will not be forgotten, his mother has joined protests in Managua, marching alongside dozens of other mothers carrying photos of their slain children. “We as a family don’t hate anyone,” she insisted. “We forgive Ángel’s killers. But we want the truth, I don’t care if they only spend a day in jail.” Gahona’s case may still be unsolved, but if his shooting was an attempt to snuff out dissent, his father is convinced that it has failed. “They wanted to silence Ángel’s voice,” he said. “But they only made it spread.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/22/mod-faces-29bn-nuclear-funding-gap-say-auditors","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T23:01:38Z","webTitle":"MoD faces £2.9bn nuclear funding gap, say auditors","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/22/mod-faces-29bn-nuclear-funding-gap-say-auditors","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/22/mod-faces-29bn-nuclear-funding-gap-say-auditors","fields":{"headline":"MoD faces £2.9bn nuclear funding gap, say auditors","bodyText":"Britain’s nuclear defence programme is projected to cost nearly £51bn over the next decade and there is a significant risk that the figure could increase further, according to Whitehall’s spending watchdog. The National Audit Office found that the Ministry of Defence faces a £2.9bn black hole in its finances as it seeks to produce and maintain the submarines that carry Trident missiles and their warheads. Auditors said the fragility of the programme could destabilise the entire MoD equipment plan unless the “affordability gap” was addressed. The findings will intensify the debate over the UK’s nuclear deterrent and whether it is worth the money. This year alone it will cost the government £5.2bn – 14% of the MoD’s budget. The NAO report says the programme could face skills shortages and problems with contractors and sub-contractors. Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said budget pressures on the MoD’s nuclear programme were now “critical”. “In the next 10 years, the MoD must find £2.9bn to plug the gap in funding, despite already requiring £3bn of savings,” she said. “The department will need to make some critical decisions to get the programme on track financially.” Four submarines designed to carry nuclear warheads are currently in service. They are maintained by a network of programmes, equipment and staff referred to as the nuclear enterprise. Auditors examined projected spending over the next 10 years across the programme and concluded it would total £50.9bn. The MoD has committed to finding £3bn in efficiency savings over the next 10 years in order to afford a £31bn Trident renewal programme, the report says. This will replace ageing Vanguard submarines with four new Dreadnought-class boats. Even if the MoD finds these savings, the government will still have to bridge a £2.9bn affordability gap before 2028, the report says. The department has had to obtain permission from the Treasury to draw £600m from a £10bn contingency fund for the programme and has delayed work on a replacement for Astute-class attack submarines by two years. Auditors say the MoD may have to seek further money from the contingency fund. “Problems with the affordability of the enterprise could destabilise the department’s overall equipment plan given that around a quarter of its planned spend on equipment relates to nuclear programmes,” the report says. Auditors express concern at the way that just four contractors – AWE Management, BAE Systems, Rolls Royce and Babcock International – hold 97% of all current nuclear enterprise contracts. “Dependence on a small number of specialist contractors brings challenges. We noted in our 2008 report [on the nuclear programme] the difficulties the department has in giving monopoly contractors incentives to deliver work to time and cost.” Further scrutiny by auditors found an estimated 1,500 sub-contractors, which the report says bring their own risks to the programme. “Many are small and specialist businesses providing bespoke products, and the intermittent and long-term nature of many nuclear programmes creates risks for them.” Auditors say the MoD has introduced new ways of working with BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce, its main contractors on the Dreadnought programme, in an attempt to address its past record of “poor performance”. The government now faces skills shortages, lacking 337 skilled personnel across seven military nuclear specialisms, including nuclear marine engineers and weapons engineers. “[The MoD] assessed five of these shortages as having at least a high impact on operations, meaning they regularly placed demands on staff – such as cancelling leave and training – to maintain operations,” the report says. The department will need another 7,000 equivalent staff a year up to 2021, a quarter of whom will need to be highly skilled, the auditors say. An MoD spokesman said the nuclear deterrent was “our ultimate defence from the world’s most extreme threats” and supported thousands of British jobs. “The Dreadnought programme is one of the most complex engineering programmes ever undertaken by the UK, and the NAO’s report highlights our position that it is on track to be delivered on schedule and within the original estimated cost,” the spokesman said."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2018/may/21/john-oliver-north-korea-trump-john-bolton","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T14:54:39Z","webTitle":"John Oliver: Kim is only person excited to get a picture taken with Mike Pompeo","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/21/john-oliver-north-korea-trump-john-bolton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/21/john-oliver-north-korea-trump-john-bolton","fields":{"headline":"John Oliver: Kim is only person excited to get a picture taken with Mike Pompeo","bodyText":"On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver discussed the prospects for the planned June summit between the US and North Korea. After briefly covering Saturday’s royal wedding, Oliver said: “Let’s move on to North Korea, a country led by a man who is both a brutal dictator and the only person who’s ever been excited to get a picture taken with Mike Pompeo. “The proposed summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un is scheduled to take place on 12 June, but this week it hit a major snag,” the host explained, showing news reports speculating that North Korea would call off the meeting over US demands that they denuclearize. Oliver explained: “The summit is now in jeopardy for a number of reasons, from the fact that both sides apparently have different definitions of what denuclearization means to North Korea’s objections to the United States and South Korea holding a joint training exercise called Max Thunder, which, incidentally, sounds way too much like a porn name for a military exercise. “Negotiating with North Korea is clearly the tightest of tightropes to walk,” the host added. “Unfortunately, instead of a professional tightrope walker, Trump has brought in a big old walrus, specifically, this big old walrus, John Bolton, the brand new national security adviser who’s been appearing on TV making a pretty alarming statement.” Oliver then cut to news segments featuring Bolton, who when asked about the North Korea conflict referenced the “Libya model of 2003-2004”, or the Libyan government’s decision to voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons program in 2003, followed by the capture and murder of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 following the Arab spring. “That may not sound like much to you, but Bolton bringing up Libya is literally the worst thing he could have said in this situation,” Oliver said. “The Libya model that he’s talking about involves a deal with the US and others struck to get Libya to give up their nuclear weapons program. But for dictators like Kim Jong-un, that example is somewhat tainted for reasons so obvious even the human throw pillows on Fox &amp; Friends could understand.” Oliver then cut to a Fox &amp; Friends segment, in which the hosts question Bolton’s allusion to the Libya model given the images of Gaddafi being dragged through the streets by rebel forces. “The point is, it’s not just Kim Jong-un who is touchy about what happened in Libya; Gaddafi’s death is a common obsession among autocrats,” Oliver said, referring to reports that Vladimir Putin frequently watches the video clips of the deposed leader being lynched. “For a sense of just how badly Bolton screwed up here, Trump actually walked his comments back,” Oliver said. “Yes, Donald Trump, a man who would double down on a fucking typo, went on TV and said this.” The host proceeded to show a video of Trump, when asked about Bolton’s comments, rebuking his national security adviser, saying: “The Libya model isn’t a model that we have at all when we’re thinking of North Korea.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"stage/2018/jun/01/trump-tartuffe-moliere-update-audrey-fleurot-christopher-hampton","type":"article","sectionId":"stage","sectionName":"Stage","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-01T08:34:22Z","webTitle":"'Trump is a Tartuffe': why Molière's banned blockbuster got an update","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/01/trump-tartuffe-moliere-update-audrey-fleurot-christopher-hampton","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/stage/2018/jun/01/trump-tartuffe-moliere-update-audrey-fleurot-christopher-hampton","fields":{"headline":"'Trump is a Tartuffe': why Molière's banned blockbuster got an update","bodyText":"“One of the marks of great plays,” says Christopher Hampton, “is that there’s always something in them that speaks to any era.” The playwright has proved his point by relocating a 17th-century French drama to the United States of Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein. Tartuffe is a moral comedy by Molière, in which a religious hypocrite tricks and seduces himself into the household of a wealthy man. Hampton has made Orgon a French movie producer who buys a Hollywood studio, and dropped in some lines about the inappropriate sexual behaviour of movie moguls. “There’s certainly – at the very heart of the play – sexual harassment, big-time,” he says. Molière was Hampton’s special subject when he studied modern languages at university, and has played a large part in his playwriting life. His reputation was made by The Philanthropist (1970), an English response to Molière’s The Misanthrope, and this is the second time he has translated Tartuffe. “It was the greatest success of Molière’s life,” says Hampton, “and remains the most performed French classical play.” There’s a coincidental double bill in Britain this year, with an RSC version by Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto (set in Birmingham’s Muslim community) opening at Stratford-upon-Avon in September. “I assume it’s because hypocrisy is always with us,” says Hampton. “Hypocrisy and religion – it always rings a bell,” agrees Audrey Fleurot, the French actor known to British audiences from her role in the police drama Spiral, who is making her UK stage acting debut as Elmire, a wife targeted by the sleazy preacher. The word “tartuffe”, Fleurot points out, has entered the French language to mean a hypocrite or imposter. After its original French premiere, Tartuffe was twice banned for perceived anti-Catholicism, and its challenge to religious values is the hardest part of the drama to reproduce these days, when few theatregoers would be shocked even if the venal priest came on dressed as the pope. “That’s right,” says Hampton. “Only if you did the play in Iran would you have stakes as high as they were in 17th-century France. In Molière’s day, people were still being burned at the stake. The reason I set it in America is that they do still take religion very seriously. And the idea of someone coming out of the desert, as it were, in California and being charismatic and taken up by rich people is much easier to accommodate.” Another problem for modern stagings is the bizarre ending, in which a messenger suddenly arrives from Louis XIV, and, through a speech larded with compliments to the monarch, resolves the plot. “Molière had to add that part,” says Fleurot. “The play had been banned twice, this was the third version he tried. He added it to flatter the king. So what do you do with this speech that is really nothing to do with the play?” For Hampton, there was only one solution: “When you think about who would be the equivalent deus ex machina in modern America, it has to be Trump. So what happens at the end of the play is that an envoy from the White House arrives.” In order to keep the translation faithful, Hampton felt that the new conclusion should echo the tone of Molière’s “arse-licking speech” about his Royal patron. So the ambassador from Washington now hymns “a great president, whom no impostor’s cunning can mislead, who’s followed this whole incident on Twitter”. The translator says he will be intrigued to see how a London audience likely to be predominantly Trump-sceptic will deal with this, but argues: “Molière was fantastically subversive. The speech is so over the top that I think it was written tongue in cheek.” Fleurot approves of the substitution: “Trump is a Tartuffe, he really is. And yet he became president!” Audiences experiencing this cheeky rewrite are likely to contain a significant number of French ex-pats or tourists, as this is believed to be the first bilingual production of Tartuffe in the West End. A cast of French and English actors will speak their own languages (and sometimes each other’s) with each section surtitled. The conceit is that Orgon’s family speak French with each other but English to the Americans they encounter in Los Angeles. “I think it works out at about 50% English and 50% French,” Hampton says. “It starts pretty much all in French and then, by the end, is almost all English, which appealed to me as a soundscape.” Fleurot is relieved that she decided, two years ago, “to start taking English lessons again. Because there’s more and more possibility, especially because of Netflix, of co-production.” The decision paid off when she was cast in Safe, an English-language drama set in Manchester that was recently released on Netflix.. As a screen actor (in movies such as The Intouchables as well as TV work), she has a particular interest in the post-Weinstein spin of the Tartuffe script, although her position on #MeToo is nuanced: “In every revolution, there’s always excess, and heads fall, so I think there’s good stuff and bad stuff. People discovered it’s more complicated to be a woman than a man? Big news! I’m very happy that these issues became a talking point. But I’m also, like: look, when you’re a woman, you have to deal with harassment, aggression every day. We talk about it being bad in movies, but it’s probably as bad, worse, in, say, the post office. Actors only have to work with people for weeks, months, but in other businesses, you can put up with harassment for years and in constant fear of losing your job for complaining.” She suggests that women in the film business must be permanently on guard: “If I were a man, I could call some director and say I loved their work and would like to meet them and talk about working with them. You can’t do that as an actress because of the fear of it being misunderstood.” Another unfairness to women is a double standard on ageing. “There are male actors who have started a great career at 50 because they are suddenly noticed. How many actresses would that happen to? Women are under such pressure to look young. I have heard that, in Hollywood now, they have to get English actresses to play the grandma because there are no American actresses who look that age any more.” The rule in the Tartuffe rehearsal room is that the director speaks English, which is also the language of small-talk between the actors in order to help the French performers perfect their second language. Everyone involved is aware that a cross-channel theatrical collaboration has a political resonance at this time. “I like to think of it as my protest against Brexit,” says Hampton. “Although nothing of that nature is touched on in the text, I’m very excited by the idea of English and French actors on the same stage, talking two languages. It feels like the direction we ought to be going in, rather than the direction we are going in.” Fleurot sees the bilingual role as a “half-step” towards acting fully in English next time; perhaps Shakespeare or a new play. It seems inevitable, though, that Brexit will make it harder for EU actors to get work permits. “Yes,” says Hampton. “So maybe the first bilingual Molière production in the West End will also be the last.” Tartuffe is at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London, until 28 July."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"global-development/2018/may/21/further-arrests-saudi-arabia-womens-rights-activists-driving-ban","type":"article","sectionId":"global-development","sectionName":"Global development","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T14:13:10Z","webTitle":"Further arrests of Saudi women's rights activists in escalating crackdown","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/may/21/further-arrests-saudi-arabia-womens-rights-activists-driving-ban","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/global-development/2018/may/21/further-arrests-saudi-arabia-womens-rights-activists-driving-ban","fields":{"headline":"Further arrests of Saudi women's rights activists in escalating crackdown","bodyText":"At least 10 prominent Saudi activists, mostly women’s rights campaigners, have now been reported to have been arrested in what appears to be an escalating clampdown ahead of the much-vaunted lifting of the prohibition on women driving in the kingdom on 24 June. The arrests, with more feared by human rights campaigners, come amid a high-profile campaign in Saudi media outlets and on social media denouncing the women as “traitors”. According to human rights organisations working outside the kingdom, most of the women were warned in September against commenting on the lifting of the ban on female drivers, a reform initiative credited to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as on the anti-guardianship campaign. Saudi Arabia’s guardianship system requires women to obtain permission from their fathers, brothers, husbands or even sons for a host of life decisions. According to the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR), among those arrested last week were Eman al-Nafjan and Loujain al-Hathloul, both well-known women’s rights activists. The two women are among nine campaigners whose names have been circulating on social media in recent days. According to the GCHR, al-Hathloul was being held incommunicado while al-Nafjan was able to call her family once. Both are at undisclosed locations. Al-Nafjan, who has been heavily involved in the campaign to allow women to drive in the kingdom, is a professor and the author behind the Saudiwoman’s Weblog, a blog about Saudi society, culture, women’s rights and human rights in general. Al-Hathloul is a Saudi women’s rights activist and a social media figure, who has been involved in the campaign for women to be allowed to drive, and was detained on 1 December 2014 for 75 days and again in June 2017. The Saudi interior ministry has said that those detained are being investigated for communicating with “foreign entities”, working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and providing money to foreign circles with the aim of destabilising and harming the kingdom. Saudi-American women’s activist and blogger Nora Abdulkarim, who has been posting information on Twitter about the recent arrests, said the move had created an atmosphere of fear. “Saudi feminists are timidly returning to agitating on Twitter,” she tweeted. “Some show support for arrested activists, some not. For 1st time in anti-guardianship campaign, very intimidating to speak.” After posting a list of nine of those detained, she added on Monday: “Unfortunately, list is already outdated. 10th arrest occurred today. This one is significant as it is first arrest we hear of new/youth #Saudi feminist activists (who became active in anti-guardianship campaign of 2016).” According to Hiba Zayadin, of Human Rights Watch, the arrests have come amid a high-profile “smear” campaign accusing the women of disloyalty, she told the Guardian. “We know of at least nine individuals who have been arrested whose names are circulating on social media. We believe there are nine confirmed, but we fear that there may be others who will arrested in the coming days. “Some of those named – and others – were called in by officials in September after the announcement that the driving ban was being lifted, and told not to speak out in favour. “So far as we know they complied, so we don’t know why this is being done. But the vicious smear campaign against them has been quite unprecedented.” Among the media outlets that have attacked them is Okaz, which, according to Zayadin, ran a double-page spread featuring some of those arrested. Pictures of some of the women have also appeared in social media posts, where they were accused of “contact with foreign entities with the aim of undermining the country’s stability and social fabric”. A hashtag, #AgentsofEmbassies, and a graphic featuring the activists’ faces, also spread on social media. Campaigners, however, remain unsure of the precise motivation for the arrests. “There’s always been a sense that the women’s activists in Saudi are protected, that they wouldn’t be punished in the same way as other activists,” said Zayadin. “This feels like a message that they are not beyond punishment. Why? It is not clear but one theory is that it is for taking credit away from reforms being pushed by the crown prince. “It is still pretty surprising that this should be happening days before the driving ban is lifted. Another theory is that it may be to insulate the leadership from ultra conservatives who are unhappy about the reforms.” Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 32, is seen as the force behind the lifting of Saudi Arabia’s longstanding driving ban on women, part of a series of reforms being pushed by the powerful royal in the conservative kingdom. The decision to allow women to drive could give them the much-needed mobility to join the workforce. Saudi women no longer need male permission to start a business. But Saudi activists say social change will only be cosmetic without dismantling the kingdom’s guardianship system."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"environment/2018/may/21/an-insect-you-may-not-want-to-be-kind-to","type":"article","sectionId":"environment","sectionName":"Environment","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T17:42:20Z","webTitle":"An insect you may not want to be kind to | Brief letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/21/an-insect-you-may-not-want-to-be-kind-to","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/environment/2018/may/21/an-insect-you-may-not-want-to-be-kind-to","fields":{"headline":"An insect you may not want to be kind to","bodyText":"Oh no: an article about how we can be kind to insects (G2, 21 May).

Hmm, could have done with five more minutes in the oven, a bit less salt, not one of my best, frankly … No, everything is always bloody marvellous. For Jamie, especially. He’ll close his eyes, look up, shake his head, barely able to comprehend what he has just created. “That, my friends, is a mighty, mighty beautiful pasta,” he says of his spicy ’nduja vongole. His creation, his work; it’s like me saying: “That, my friends, is a mighty, mighty beautiful opening paragraph.” He’s doing his stripped-back cooking; restricted to only five ingredients. It has completely changed his life and it is going to take the stress out of ours, too, he says. He is doing it to Back to Life by Soul II Soul – that is how stress-free it is, it is like the summer of ’89, before you had kids, remember? Actually, he is using six ingredients, because everything gets a generous sprinkling of Jamie-isms. “Whack it in a tray … smash it out … everything here is like best mates … crispy and gnarly … gorgeous oils just kind of cooking out of there... it’s fast, it’s furious, it smells incredible… happy days.” Dishes come with a snappy strapline: “minimum effort, maximum flavour, gorgeous grub for those you love” and “a phenomenally fast no-frills feast for the people you love best”. Don’t forget the love – that could almost be another ingredient, a store-cupboard staple, seven and counting. What? You want metaphors, too, to make the possibly unfamiliar more familiar? Coming up … a comforting sausage bake is “a bit like a day in wearing your jim-jams or that frumpy old jumper that rarely sees the street or your friends”. The ’nduja vongole is “a bit like spaghetti vongole’s eccentric uncle”. OK, I’m sold, Jamie, I’m going to get involved, cook along, stress-free. Not the vongole – I already do that. Without ’nduja, granted, I do ’nduja vongole’s boring nephew, but it’s one of my signatures and I’m sticking with it. Totally with Jamie on (the excellence) of parsley stalks, by the way; I once spent an entire morning in a posh restaurant destalking parsley and, in doing so, making it a less interesting ingredient. I’m not going to do the sausage bake, either; that is more of a winter thing and I worry I may not have enough love for it. Flaky pastry pesto chicken? Nah, looks like chicken in a croissant. No, the sun is shining, so I am going to do watermelon granita (“basically like edible snow”): the kids go nuts for it, apparently, and I have got a couple of them with me – kids, that is – so we’ll do it together. Jamie has two of his with him, sparkly clean, just out of the bath in their jim-jams, and ever so slightly posher than he is. Guess what? They absolutely love his granita and give it as many thumbs up as there are thumbs. Right, our turn. On goes Soul II Soul: “However do you want me, however do you need me” … We have got our watermelon and limes from John the greengrocer and mint from the garden. All we need now is our stem ginger in syrup – where do we keep that? Oh, we don’t. Never mind, you can get it in all supermarkets, says Jamie, and we know someone who, at this very moment, is in one of them – a supermarket Jamie used to be best friends with, as it happens. Oh, but Sainsbury’s in Willesden doesn’t have any stem ginger either (they might want to get some in – there is almost certainly going to be a spike in demand). A special trip to Waitrose is called for – what happened to quick and easy? Anyway, we enjoy cutting up the watermelon, although it is not entirely stress-free. The kitchen ends up like a murder scene, CSI Dollis Hill. Then it goes into the freezer – four hours, Jamie says, it will be ready just in time for tea … Four hours later it is not completely frozen. Probably because Jamie has a better freezer. We buzz it up anyway, and it’s more edible sleet than snow. But the kids go nuts for it; it is… [looks up, closes eyes, shakes head] a mighty, mighty beautiful watermelon slush. And next time it might even be snowy, quick, easy and stress-free.

The new versions follow a similar development plan to that used by Tesla for the Model S. The first is an all-wheel drive version of the Model 3, adding a second motor to drive the rear wheels. Announcing the additions to the lineup, Musk said that for the AWD version of the Model 3 one motor was optimised for range and the other for power, allowing it to maintain its 310-mile quoted range. The dual-motor option will cost an additional $5,000, and will increase the car’s power, knocking 0.6 seconds off the time to accelerate to 60mph – now just 4.5 seconds – and reaching a top speed of 140mph. The performance version of the Model 3 is aimed at rivalling German performance saloon cars, such as the BMW M3. Musk boasted the $78,000 car will “beat anything in its class on the track”, reaching 60mph in 3.5 seconds with a top speed of 155mph. The performance Model 3 won’t be the quickest car Tesla sells at the moment, as the Model S P100D accelerates to 60mph in 2.5 seconds, but it will cost about $57,000 less. Tesla’s $200,000 Roadster sports car is expected to be able to accelerate to 60mph in 1.9 seconds once production begins. Production has been the biggest problem Tesla has faced in recent years. The company has hundreds of thousands of reservations for its Model 3, which starts at $35,000 and was announced in April 2016. But the company has struggled to increase production, continually missing targets and producing only approximately 3,600 cars a week for a total of less than 30,000 Model 3s according to estimates by Bloomberg. Musk blamed an overreliance on automation for production delays at its Freemont, California facility, temporarily suspending production in April and reportedly due to again at the end of May. But Tesla said that US production estimates were improving, reportedly decreasing the waiting time from 12-18 months to 4-6 months for some versions. The company reported a $709.6m loss in the first quarter of the year, having burned through $745.3m in cash.

According to reports from Moscow, Abramovich was unable to watch his Chelsea team’s 1-0 victory over Manchester United in Saturday’s FA Cup final at Wembley because his investor’s visa expired last month. His private Boeing jet has not been back to the UK since 1 April. It is uncertain whether the oligarch’s visa woes are temporary and soon to be resolved, or something more permanent akin to a de facto ban. Abramovich has declined to comment. His representatives have said merely, and tactfully, that the process is taking a little longer than usual. Either way, the delay appears to be the result of a new, tougher stance against Russian nationals by the British authorities in the wake of the attempted murder in March of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Relations between London and Moscow are once again in the deep freeze. The government signalled it was reviewing tier 1 investor visas, given to nearly 700 wealthy Russians between 2008 and 2015. Abramovich is one of them. Other oligarchs – some famous names, some lesser known mid-ranking businessmen – will be wondering if they too can expect visa trouble. Abramovich is vulnerable to British retaliation because of his proximity to President Putin. Their relationship goes back a long way. Abramovich was one of Putin’s early supporters. He recommended him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin, when Russia’s ailing leader was looking for a successor. According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the high court in London, Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow from the second half of the 1990s. In October 1999, he attended Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Abramovich allegedly bought Putin, then the prime minister, a $50m yacht. “The request came from Mr Putin,” Berezovsky said in evidence. By the time Putin became president in 2000, Abramovich played a key role in shaping the new government, Berezovsky added in his evidence. Abramovich selected members of Putin’s cabinet, he claimed. Abramovich had the power to open and shut criminal cases and to initiate investigations and arrests. it was alleged. He was, in short, a big Kremlin player, albeit one who operated behind the scenes. Abramovich successfully defeated Berezovsky in a subsequent London civil court case and dismisses most of his claims. Still, there is no doubt that Abramovich has friendly relations with Putin. In 2003, Abramovich bought Chelsea football club for £140m. Two years later, he was involved in another larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13bn. The visa review by the British authorities appears to acknowledge the dual role played by oligarchs in Putin’s system. Oligarchs are entrepreneurs. But they can also be state emissaries. From the Sochi Olympics to this summer’s World Cup, oligarchs have fulfilled requests from the presidential administration, building stadiums, international sporting facilities and Russia’s latest bridge to Crimea. Between 2000 and 2008, Abramovich was governor of Chukotka, a sparsely populated and cold region in Russia’s far east. He transformed the territory with his billions. The Chelsea FC owner has bankrolled Russia’s football union and the national squad. His football academy has built all-weather pitches across the country. Roman Borisovich, a Russian anti-corruption campaigner, described the review of investor visas as a “clever and delicate way” of hitting back at Moscow. Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, has suggested Russian businessmen may now take legal action in the British courts. Borisovich predicts this won’t happen. “The last thing these guys want is to have a public hearing in the UK. They would have to answer questions like ‘how did you make your money’ and ‘are you the real owner of your assets’? Plus ‘are you a conduit for the Russian regime or an instrument for meddling in other countries’? “I would like to see all this in the high court.” Borisovich said the UK government was belatedly abandoning its ‘no questions asked’ policy, something that had made London attractive to Russia’s super-rich. He pointed out that Moscow billionaires did not typically move their factories or production centres to the UK. Rather, they deposited their money here, buying up property that could later be resold. In recent years, Abramovich has kept a low profile, both in Russia and the UK. He was at first surprised by the enormous media attention that accompanied his purchase of Chelsea but got used to it, Russian football pundits say. They add that Abramovich is smart, talented, bright and engaged. His last on-the-record interview appears to have been with the Observer back in 2006. Asked where home was – he has several – Abramovich said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow I feel most comfortable.” “It cannot buy you happiness,” Abramovich said, speaking of money. He added: “Some independence, yes.” Seemingly, however, even a lot of money is no guarantee of a British visa. The question for Abramovich now is whether he decides to tough out the latest period of political turbulence. Or sell Chelsea and retreat to Moscow."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/21/frank-ocean-album-blonde-dissect-cole-cuchna","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T20:01:16Z","webTitle":"Frank Ocean's Blonde dissected: 'A cultural artefact that deserves to be studied'","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/21/frank-ocean-album-blonde-dissect-cole-cuchna","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/21/frank-ocean-album-blonde-dissect-cole-cuchna","fields":{"headline":"Frank Ocean's Blonde dissected: 'A cultural artefact that deserves to be studied'","bodyText":"In 2016, the eagerness for a new Frank Ocean record had transformed from healthy anticipation into irritable impatience. For four years Ocean had made repeated promises about the record’s release date, only for him to miss his own deadlines. Fans desperate for new music began mocking his tardiness on social media. Ocean responded in kind by stamping all the record’s missed released dates on a library card. Then in August that year, Blonde was finally released, and it sounded … weird. It’s an album that on first listen doesn’t necessarily sound like a classic – there are so many layers of vocals and instrumentation. The Guardian’s five-star album review at the time said it was one of the most “baffling, contrary and intriguing records put out by a major pop star – not just this year, but any year”. Its magic was that it contained puzzles, both in its production and lyrical content – a lead vocal line that had been obscured would suddenly step forward from the shadows, three-quarters of the way through a song. As fans and critics gave it more of their time, a consensus began to emerge that it was Ocean’s greatest work. By December, Time, the Atlantic and Vulture had all declared it the record of the year. It’s hard to think of another record so rewarding to those willing to give it the time. Cole Cuchna, the journalist and music obsessive who makes the podcast Dissect, has given Blonde a lot of his time. The third season of Dissect is an extravaganza of Frank Ocean deep dives. There will be an entire 11-episode season on Blonde preceded by a six-part miniseries on Channel Orange, Ocean’s debut. On top of that, Cuchna is releasing bonus episodes with songs and interviews that don’t otherwise fit into the schedule (the first of which, focusing on early mixtape tracks There Will Be Tears and Swim Good, has already been released) – and a separate hour-long documentary giving a more general overview of Ocean’s life and work. Cuchna isn’t sure exactly how much Ocean based analysis he’ll end up producing, but believes it’ll be around 10 hours, a similar length to the Beatles’ landmark documentary series Anthology. Speaking on the phone from his home where he is still writing and recording episodes for the series, Cuchna says only by going into that level of depth can you begin to unpick a record so rich in detail. “It’s hard to write about, it’s so nuanced and complex,” Cuchna says. “This approach is the only way you’re going to get to something worthwhile, it’s just a record you have to spend a lot of time with.” He says that some of the episodes will focus more on production while others will go line-by-line, exploring the narratives and themes emerging in the lyrics. He’s excited about the episode on Super Rich Kids, about a character that starts his days on the roof and by the end of the songs falls to his death. “It has all these overtones of what it means to be born into wealth,” he says. Cuchna says he’s “obviously” doing two episodes on the 10-minute Channel Orange track Pyramids because it’s “a song that tells is essentially the history of the black woman – from royalty in Egypt to the present day – dealing with issues in America”. In past seasons, which have focused on records by Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, Cuchna has had a fairly large trove of interviews with the artists themselves to draw upon, but Ocean has barely spoken to the press in the past six years – meaning that for Blonde at least there’s little of the artist’s own interpretation of his work avaliable. “I don’t think it’s going to be problem,” says Cuchna, unfazed. “When it comes to analysis, it’s about 80% me just digging into the actual music – there’s not too much to draw from, it’s just breadcrumbs, but I quite like that.” The four albums he’s focused on so far have been released in the past decade, and Cuchna says he purposely chooses recent works. His overall aim is to recontextualise these albums, not just as recent classic but part of the overall popular music canon, as worthy of investigation as Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band or Thriller. Cuchna says: “It’s me proving that these are seminal works, that they’re the best representations of culture at this particular time. Looking back in 50 years, they’re what we’re going to be remembering. These are great albums but they’re also cultural artefacts; they can be studied.”"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"business/2018/may/21/network-rail-new-chief-andrew-haines","type":"article","sectionId":"business","sectionName":"Business","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T16:50:47Z","webTitle":"Network Rail appoints new chief – with smaller pay packet than predecessor","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/21/network-rail-new-chief-andrew-haines","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2018/may/21/network-rail-new-chief-andrew-haines","fields":{"headline":"Network Rail appoints new chief – with smaller pay packet than predecessor","bodyText":"Network Rail has announced that Andrew Haines will be its new chief executive – and be paid 27% less than his predecessor to run Britain’s rail infrastructure. Haines, the chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, will be paid £588,000 including benefits, with a possible 9% bonus, when he takes over in the autumn following a short handover period with retiring boss Mark Carne. Haines arrives with a reputation for cost-cutting and transformation during his eight-year stint at the CAA, which earned him warm praise from the transport secretary, Chris Grayling. He said Haines had “done an outstanding job at the CAA”. But he angered many within the organisation, who warned that its safety functions were being impaired as senior staff were made redundant and average salaries were slashed. A leaked internal report obtained by the Guardian last year showed inspectors under Haines believed they no longer had sufficient resources to do the job properly. The CAA boss started his career in rail, as a left luggage clerk at London Victoria station, and later had stints as managing director at South West Trains then First Group’s rail division. He is sits on the board of rolling stock leasing company Eversholt Rail UK, a post he will resign on joining Network Rail. He will take over a business plan for the next five years that will not commit Network Rail to grand engineering schemes after budgeting failures and cost overruns led to large parts of the current plan being abandoned, including electrification of parts of the Midland Mainline and lines in south Wales. Announcing the appointment, Network Rail’s chairman Sir Peter Hendy said Haines would ensure a continued focus on safety, performance and cost effectiveness: “Andrew’s broad experience of rail and transport, and his reputation for relentless delivery and improvement, makes him the ideal candidate to carry on with the transformation of Network Rail that has been led by Mark Carne.” Haines said he would work to “deliver closer working between track and train, embed devolution and turning the digital railway strategy into reality whilst efficiently delivering on challenging safety, operational, engineering and investment commitments”."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/27/actress-x-london-contemporary-orchestra-lageos-review-intriguing-hybrid","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-27T06:00:17Z","webTitle":"Actress x London Contemporary Orchestra: Lageos review – an intriguing hybrid ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/27/actress-x-london-contemporary-orchestra-lageos-review-intriguing-hybrid","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/27/actress-x-london-contemporary-orchestra-lageos-review-intriguing-hybrid","fields":{"headline":"Actress x London Contemporary Orchestra: Lageos review – an intriguing hybrid ","bodyText":"At a first glance, techno and contemporary classical music do not seem like ideal partners. One, a bass-heavy hedonistic genre designed for dancefloors, the other suited to the calm of the concert hall. Yet Darren Cunningham, aka electronic producer Actress, and the London Contemporary Orchestra have built their careers in pushing boundaries of genre. Both sets of artists explore the hybridity between the electronic and the acoustic: the LCO regularly records experimental film scores, including Jonny Greenwood’s recent anxiety-inducing compositions for You Were Never Really Here, and last year Actress performed a live rendition of Steve Reich’s 1988 work Different Trains. On Lageos, rather than have the orchestra approximate the alien sounds of Actress’s electronics, they formulate a new sonic palette that is in equal measures intriguing and unsettling. The album is often upbeat: strings streak in between clattering, fairground rhythms on Galya Beat, while Hubble and N.E.W. are softer, more melodic interpretations of Actress’s previous releases. It is in moments of quiet ambience, though, that Lageos excels, blurring the boundaries between static and harmony on Momentum or between creaking double bass and kick drum on Voodoo Possee, Chronic Illusion.

It’s about way more than Brexit","bodyText":"It is a snowy December day in New York. Tom Hagen, consigliere to one of the city’s mafia bosses, is stopped on the street by Virgil Sollozzo, a big-time drug-runner, who invites him to get in a car. Fearing a hit, Hagen hesitates. “What are you worried about?” says Sollozzo. “If I wanted to kill you, you’d be dead already.” I don’t know if Theresa May is a fan of The Godfather, but even if she isn’t familiar with the film, she should recognise that scene. She has been in it enough times. The prime minister has often looked like a hostage in the back of a car driven by backbench Tory MPs. They surround her as she is going about her Brexit business and make her offers she can’t refuse. Or can she? No one doubts that the Eurosceptic right can hurt May. There are about 60 members of the European Research Group, the faction chaired by Jacob-Rees Mogg. That is more than enough to force a leadership contest. But, despite constant whining about Brexit betrayals, they haven’t pulled the trigger. The Tories are not famously merciful with leaders who disappoint, so it follows that the Moggy Mafia think May is someone with whom they can do business. They like having her in Downing Street. Call it the Sollozzo rule: if they wanted to do her in, she would be done already. That doesn’t make her safe for ever, but it shows the threats so far have been empty. It is hard to measure the balance of power between the Tory leader and the Brexit hardliners, partly because the nature of their disagreement is confused. Both say the UK must quit the single market and customs union. Both make an inviolable principle of “taking back control”. But May sees that promise through the lens of immigration, while many Tory MPs care more about autonomy in trade. The prime minister always includes the phrase “global Britain” in her speeches, in deference to those Brexiters who see the whole enterprise in terms of a buccaneer nation, casting off the ropes of continental regulation, setting sail on the seven seas of international commerce. May doesn’t reject that concept, but her instincts are more parochial. She believes the referendum result expressed an epidemic of economic insecurity and cultural dislocation – a howl of rage against a system felt by many to reward arrogant financial elites at the expense of ordinary folk. That is why she is relaxed about aligning Britain with EU regulations on labour protection and environmental standards; she has no urge to light bonfires of red tape. But for many in her party, divergence from EU standards is a national liberation struggle. It is the reason they are Eurosceptic in the first place. May worries about people who voted leave because they wanted respite from globalisation. A bunch of her MPs voted leave because they think Britain isn’t globalised enough. That difference expresses a profound dilemma for conservatism. It is an argument about the relationship between economic liberalism and social cohesion that has been brewing since the Tories were expelled from power in 1997. It contains a dispute over Margaret Thatcher’s legacy, made more acute by the financial crisis and its ongoing social repercussions. It leads to questions of whether public discontent today is better explained by excessive exposure to market forces (individual greed driving rampant inequality), or misapplication of market forces (prosperity obstructed by a meddling state). Or where the truth lies between those propositions. Different diagnoses on that spectrum lead to very different policy prescriptions. Yet the Tories have conspired to squeeze this massive ideological conundrum into the tiniest argument over a system for customs checks in Northern Ireland that might be applied some time after 2021. Some Conservatives are pondering the party’s agenda beyond Brexit. A new thinktank, Onward, was launched yesterday, founded by Tory MP Neil O’Brien, previously an adviser to George Osborne, and Will Tanner, formerly May’s deputy head of policy. It is supported by Michael Gove, environment secretary, and Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Tories, who stood in opposite camps for the referendum campaign. But before Gove was a leave evangelist he was a pioneer of David Cameron’s modernisation project. It is revealing as a judgment of the way the Westminster wind is blowing that he has chosen now to emphasise that section of his CV. The aim is to develop ideas that will attract younger, socially liberal voters who currently recoil from the Tories. The party’s poll share is propped up by ex-Ukippers and pensioners. No one seems able to say how the imbalance will be redressed, but identifying the problem is a start. It is also a point of difference with the monomaniac strain of Brexit-Toryism that seems to have lost interest in public opinion since the referendum, as if democracy peaked on 23 June 2016 and nothing voters might subsequently say could count as much – at least not before the job of leaving the EU is complete. May isn’t that kind of Eurosceptic, but nor does she have the strength to face the zealots down. And neither side can express what the disagreement is really about. Do they even know any more? Many Tories take it for granted that Europe is the cause of division in their party, so a fresh start must be available on other side of the Brexit rainbow. But maybe the opposite is true. Europe isn’t the great Conservative schism any more – it has become the thing that distracts them from their other problems. That is why May is still their leader. She is the no man’s land candidate, standing between factions and representing none, deferring the civil war. It will be fought one day. Maybe then the Tories will work out what it is they are actually fighting over. • Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"uk-news/2018/may/21/brexit-must-benefit-scotland-to-avoid-complacency-over-independence","type":"article","sectionId":"uk-news","sectionName":"UK news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T16:43:59Z","webTitle":"Brexit must benefit Scotland to avoid 'complacency' over independence","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/brexit-must-benefit-scotland-to-avoid-complacency-over-independence","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/uk-news/2018/may/21/brexit-must-benefit-scotland-to-avoid-complacency-over-independence","fields":{"headline":"Brexit must benefit Scotland to avoid 'complacency' over independence","bodyText":"Ministers should make sure Brexit properly benefits Scotland amid potential complacency over the possibility of another independence referendum, the Conservative leader in the country, Ruth Davidson, has argued. In a speech in London following Nicola Sturgeon’s comments on Sunday in which she vowed to “restart a debate” on independence, Davidson said it was important to restore the emotional bonds of the union after Brexit. Davidson’s warning ran contrary to comments earlier at the same event by Michael Gove, who said he believed the Brexit vote had made unionism stronger. Addressing the conference in Westminster, organised by the Policy Exchange thinktank, Davidson said she had heard many pro-union Scots say that after Brexit “they now feel their relationship with the rest of the UK is transactional – that where once emotion and a sense of shared values bonded them together with the UK as a whole, now it is down to brass tacks and necessity of economic security and regulatory ease”. She said: “So while Brexit may not have made the headline difference to percentage support for or against the union, we must be careful that it does not erode support for the union beneath the numbers.” Davidson’s suggestions for shoring up the alliance included making the UK government and economy less dominated by London, and placing agencies running powers repatriated from Brussels around the country, for example a fisheries organisation in Peterhead, Aberdeenshire. She was scathing about Sturgeon’s comments about looking again at independence, saying the SNP was “reverting back to its favoured position of seeing if anything turns up”. Davidson continued: “Now, at this point I could easily talk up the theory that Nicola Sturgeon has blown it, that the union is safe, that independence has had it. But, again, I would repeat my warning about the dangers of complacency.” Downing Street also condemned Sturgeon’s renewed talk of independence on Monday. Theresa May’s spokesman said: “Now is not the time for another divisive independence referendum and there is no appetite for one. The people of Scotland voted decisively in 2014 to remain part of the United Kingdom and that should be respected.” Speaking earlier, Gove said the decline in SNP support since the Brexit referendum showed it had actually made the union stronger, and that there was no rising support for a united Ireland. The environment secretary said: “The referendum campaign was fought against a backdrop of people predicting that Britain leaving the European Union would lead to damage for the UK as a political construct. And so far, that hasn’t come about.” Brexit was “at last in part of a vote of confidence in Britain”, he argued. Gove criticised the SNP for using identity politics to promote Scottish nationalism, even as he refused several invitations to discuss the anti-immigration tactics used as part of the leave campaign. Answering questions after his speech, Gove was asked three times how he squared his condemnation of identity politcs with some of the tactics used by Vote Leave, notably the notorious poster which read: “Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU.” Each time he declined to address the specific question."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-agriculture-forestry-food","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-28T23:01:08Z","webTitle":"University guide 2019: league table for agriculture, forestry & food","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-agriculture-forestry-food","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-agriculture-forestry-food","fields":{"headline":"University guide 2019: league table for agriculture, forestry & food","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-social-policy-administration","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"University guide 2019: league table for social policy & administration","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-social-policy-administration","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-social-policy-administration","fields":{"headline":"University guide 2019: league table for social policy & administration","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-social-work","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:00:17Z","webTitle":"University guide 2019: league table for social work","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-social-work","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-social-work","fields":{"headline":"University guide 2019: league table for social work","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2018/may/21/too-many-measures-targeting-homeless-people","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T17:42:30Z","webTitle":"Too many measures targeting homeless people | Letters","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/21/too-many-measures-targeting-homeless-people","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2018/may/21/too-many-measures-targeting-homeless-people","fields":{"headline":"Too many measures targeting homeless people","bodyText":"It is great to see investigative work being done on antisocial behaviour powers, showing the impact on those who are homeless. These measures require such probing (Homeless people facing fines and prison, 21 May). Since antisocial behaviour powers were devolved to local areas by the coalition government in 2014, there is no centralised, routinely publicised data about how they are being used. Freedom of information investigations are now the only way to answer questions about who is sanctioned by antisocial behaviour measures. Your article singled out public space protection orders (PSPOs), but there are a range of measures that are used to sanction the homeless. For instance, our own research suggests that dispersal powers, a police-only measure to move people on for a period of up to 48 hours, are far more routinely used than PSPOs and result in far more prosecutions. There is a requirement to publish PSPOs and consult about them. Other measures, such as community protection notices and dispersal powers, have no such obligations. PSPOs are the more visible element in a wider spectrum of enforcement approaches which are being employed with very little scrutiny. Stop and search has annual statistics rightly drawing attention to its use. It is interesting that similar powers the police have to stop people, confiscate items, and exclude them for periods of up to 48 hours, are regularly deployed with no centralised data collection about their use.

Here’s a chance to change your streets","bodyText":"Imagine if, with an email, you could help to start a national conversation about cleaning up the air where you live, improving the health of your community, boosting the local economy and making your neighbourhood a happier place to be. Well, you can – and you’ve got until 1 June. This is the government consultation on its cycling and walking safety review, its purpose, “to help make cycling and walking the natural choices for shorter journeys”. If you’re sitting, or standing there, thinking, “I don’t cycle, why should I care?” don’t look away just yet, because this is not just about walking and cycling. This is about having a national conversation about the places we live, and what we want them to be like. Do we want to tackle our lethally and illegally poor air quality, for example? Do we want the choice to cycle and walk to the shops, to school, to work, without fear of dangerous roads? Do we really need every one of our neighbourhood streets to be thoroughfares for passing motor traffic, or would we like them to be places to play, to walk, to sit and shoot the breeze? Research suggests cycling could be a “miracle pill” for our nation’s health, but most of us can’t access it. There is a 60% chance you’re one of those who would like to cycle more, but feel the roads are too dangerous. If you’re a family there’s a 38% chance you would cycle more often if there were more traffic-free routes; an additional 25% of you have family members who don’t feel confident cycling, according to Cycling UK. If so, you are the people the Department for Transport needs to hear from. More than those already mixing it with motor traffic, you can help to build the case for change. We in this country are dreadful on cycling and walking. We have four decades of motor-centric thinking embedded at local and national level, and we lag behind many of our European neighbours, in cycling particularly. Change isn’t going to happen overnight. However, with some of the worst obesity rates in the world, and our filthy air, we need to put pressure on our politicians to get moving. Around 11% of trips less than a mile, and 29% of one to two miles, are currently taken by car. Imagine our streets, and our air, if more people walked and cycled those trips. I’ve seen at first-hand the impact walking- and cycling-friendly interventions have had in the Netherlands. Neighbourhood streets become places children play out, where people get to know their neighbours, and where it’s safe for older people to get out and about, including on bicycles, without fear of traffic. Places you hear birdsong, rather than the rumble of engines. Studies have found people living on streets with lighter traffic know more of their neighbours, and are healthier. By making residential streets dead ends for traffic, with bollards or planters, say, while allowing cycles to pass through (known as “filtering”), we can start to achieve change. On main roads protected cycle tracks help to encourage more people to cycle to work, reduce conflict and make streets feel safer for everyone. Imagine what school-run streets would be like for everyone if kids could cycle to school. One Danish study of 20,000 children aged five to 19 found improved concentration in those who cycled or walked to school. The benefits of cycling and walking on high streets are tangible, too: time and again studies have shown that town centres don’t grind to a halt when motor traffic is restricted – far from it, they thrive: bike lanes can increase retail sales by a quarter. There isn’t gridlock. Deliveries still happen. Shopping streets become places people want to be. I’m not judging anyone here – I grew up and learned to drive in rural Somerset and I know what it’s like to live with poor public transport and fast rural roads, where it feels too dangerous to cycle and driving is the only realistic option for most trips. But time and again, surveys show most people support more cycling infrastructure, and more spending on cycling, even if it takes road space from cars, or slows car journey times. Yet we still lack national design standards for cycling infrastructure, which means that local councils, with the best intentions, build routes people can’t use because of barriers, diversions, cyclist dismount signs and narrow, painted lanes that give up at junctions. If you’re not an expert, don’t worry. Cycling minister Jesse Norman is looking for ideas, and what he calls “idealism with a sense of the practical”. The government is listening right now. It’s time to send a clear message. • Laura Laker is a freelance writer for the Guardian.

I seldom dared leave London during my 20s. I was never sexually abused by my father. (I somehow managed to hate myself enough without being forced to endure that horror.) I never shot up heroin in the penthouse suite of a flash, New York hotel. I shot up heroin in grubby bedrooms and the back of cars. But to concentrate on the differences between Patrick Melrose and me is to commit a major category error. Edward St Aubyn’s five semi-autobiographical novels contain some of the most viscerally accurate depictions ever written of what it means – and how it feels – to be an addict. And watching them come to life in the virtuoso performance by Benedict Cumberbatch in the new TV drama has brought the memories flooding back. In just a few hours of television, superbly scripted by David Nicholls, the checklist has been near-enough complete. It starts with the obsession. Nothing can be allowed to get between addicts and their drugs. I never set out to be an addict. Like many others, I thought I would be the exception that proved the rule – the person who beat the system. It would be me who controlled the drugs and not the other way round. As Patrick would say: “Some hope.” I often took drugs that I didn’t even particularly like. Drugs such as coke and speed, which made me feel far too awake, and dope, which just made me feel stupid. I took them because they were there. Anything was preferable to being me. It sometimes felt as if I was a guinea pig in my own pharmacological experiment as I tried to calibrate the platonic ideal of absence. The first time I took heroin was like coming home. For some people I knew, heroin was the final taboo. They would smoke dope and take coke, but draw the line at smack. Not me. I actively sought it out as if we were long-lost blood brothers. As if I had always known all the other drugs I had taken had been merely a buildup to the main event. My feelings of inadequacy and despair gave way to a warm embrace. No one and nothing could get to me. I was invulnerable. I was me and not me. I was an outside observer delivering a running commentary on myself: Patrick’s voiceover narration in the TV drama of a weekend he spends in New York collecting his father’s ashes is no mere stylistic device holding the drama together. It’s a powerful depiction of his dissociated state. With heroin, the world had been refashioned in my own disconnected image. Every time I took it thereafter was a desperate attempt to recreate that first experience; a longing that met with ever-decreasing success. Before long, I was taking heroin just to feel normal. Or the closest approximation to normal that I could manage. The drama captures the relentlessness. One of the striking features of Patrick Melrose is just how much everything revolves around drugs. Most of the first hour-long episode was taken up with Patrick buying drugs, coming off drugs or taking drugs. Patrick’s ability to score in a foreign city in the early 1980s is impressive. I seldom left London in that era because I needed to maintain an umbilical link to my supply of drugs. And, even then, days could pass with me standing around outside phone boxes or sitting in a dealer’s house. Just waiting. And waiting. In many film and literary depictions of using, the drugs are often relegated to an incidental role because the nature of addiction is so profoundly boring. Here, they get pride of place, centre stage. For a heroin addict, it’s the living that’s incidental. That’s the way it is. Being a heroin addict is a full-time occupation. A deadly dull one at that. One without glamour. The first thing I did when I woke up in the morning was take some smack. The rest of the day would have a familiar rhythm: taking more drugs, trying to find some money to buy more drugs, waiting for the dealer to be in. The years I wasted hanging around, buying more drugs and taking more drugs. Only once that was all sorted could the rest of my life be fitted in. Friends came and went. Crap jobs came and went. It was a question of priorities. Patrick Melrose captures the denial. The belief that no one else knows what a mess you are; that when they look at you, they see a person who knows what they are doing. This is one of the more perverse strands of arrogance. Patrick expects to be indulged. It doesn’t occur to him that there is anything abnormal about being discovered by the concierge crawling along the hotel corridor on quaaludes or opening his door naked to a valet. And if reality does briefly intrude, such as when Patrick is brushed off by a friend of his girlfriend, then it is instantly rebuffed with more heroin. Safety in powders. Self-deception is an integral part of the addict’s armoury. You intellectually understand that you are a junky and yet somehow convince yourself you’re a different order of junky to those around you – a superior junky. Someone who could go straight if they really wanted to, but now just doesn’t happen to be the right time. Tomorrow is always a better time to go cold turkey than today. The chaos of the addict’s life frequently descends into near-farce, something the addict chooses to wear as a badge of heroic pride – and Patrick Melrose has that comedy. I managed to miss almost all of my own wedding reception by holing up in a toilet with a dealer who, for the first time ever, was showering me with free smack. Patrick’s weekend in New York is laced with humour as he picks up his father’s ashes: he ends up being directed to the wrong body in the morgue, where he is greeted by enthusiastic mourners. But, beneath the comedy, there is pathos. Today, I just feel sad that I was absent on what should have been one of the most significant and happiest days of my life. Patrick describes his life as one of “ungovernable shame and violence”. And it’s the shame that’s the big one here: the violence is just collateral damage. Shame is the one that gets you every time, because deep down you know how worthless you are. You know that every day is another testament to your failure. And there is nothing you can do to stop it. Your anger turns in on yourself as the days turn into weeks turn into months turn into years. The self-destruction gets steadily worse. You end up doing all sorts of things you’d promised yourself you would never do and somehow you find a way to normalise them. Until you can’t. My own rock bottom came on my 30th birthday after nearly 10 years of addiction. I was holed up in a flat with a large bag of heroin, surrounded by the small handful of friends who had stood by me and I’d never felt so miserable. I had obliterated a third of my life and had failed at almost everything. After that, I started overdosing regularly. Not because I desperately wanted to die, but because I wasn’t that bothered if I stayed alive. Edward/Patrick and I are the lucky ones; those who found recovery. A friend and my wife together persuaded me to get help, and I found, to my surprise, that I wanted to live more than I wanted to die. I went into rehab on 9 March 1987 and have been clean ever since. And, yes, I am still counting the days. Many of the people I knew haven’t been so fortunate. Some died while I was using. Some got clean and then relapsed and died. Some found the pain of living without drugs just too much and killed themselves. Others died of Aids and hepatitis C. The rate of deaths from cancer and heart disease has been far higher in those I knew who were addicts than those who weren’t. At times it has felt attritional. The body count on my timeline is terrifyingly high. The Patrick Melrose books get to the heart of the addict’s condition. Even in recovery, St Aubyn never soft-soaps or descends to saccharine Hollywood endings. He tells it like it is. The blood, the dirty hits, the overdoses, the casual violence and the banality. No one gets off scot-free from heroin addiction. Yes, I’m unbelievably grateful for the second chance I have been given. I have a family I adore and of whom I am enormously proud. I have my dream job. Life in many ways could not be more sweet. But there is a price. Edward/Patrick can speak for themselves, but here’s my story. I have severe depression and anxiety. I have been in hospital with mental illness. I am still driven by the same feelings of inadequacy I had as a teenager. Futility and despair are still my default settings in life. I just choose not to use on them. It is not always easy. Most days, I still feel less than those around me. I still wake up feeling as if I have failed. I still find it hard to feel the love of those around me. I just know that taking drugs isn’t the answer. So I plod on. One foot after another. One day at a time.

The persona of every solo One Direction member can be summed up as: “Yes, I have sex now.” Even Taylor Swift has abandoned her good-girl persona for leather and frenzied gasps. And so it goes for 19-year-old Shawn Mendes, a cherubic Canadian pop star who’s occasionally seemed less like an autonomous artist than a hard factory-reset Justin Bieber, or his primary influence, infamous lothario John Mayer. How should a young, apparently heterosexual male songwriter best convey his sexual appetite, post-#MeToo? Online fandom is quick to decry the sexual politics of any song lacking respect for its subject or the community it represents. So, despite the myriad girls waking up on Mendes’s bare chest, or leaving him perplexed when they walk out after a one-night stand (“I thought you really felt this when we were talking about breakfast”), Mendes’s MO is all respect. God, he’s respectful: “I don’t know what it’s like to be you,” he duets with Julia Michaels on the earnest, folky Like to Be You. Woke, too: In My Blood is a rousing rebuke of anxiety, and dreary Khalid duet Youth assesses the struggle to stay young in a heavy era. Mendes’s cheeky R&amp;B is similarly clean-cut – Robin Thicke with the lines resolutely un-blurred, less rock your body than spoon it lovingly into the night. The start of the album is more adventurous: the ticking guitar of Nervous tells the story just as well as his sweet vocals, and the cross-purposes interplay of falsetto and deeper backing vocals on Where Were You in the Morning? amplifies his internal conflict. But towards the end, Mendes’s bottom lip starts quivering and his sensitivity becomes a tad toxic: girls who don’t love him back are poison, curses. Perfectly Wrong is droopy in the extreme. His attempt to detoxify pop masculinity is admirable, but you’re left yearning for a bit of rough and tumble."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"film/2018/may/26/renaissance-hugh-grant-freed-romcom-hell","type":"article","sectionId":"film","sectionName":"Film","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-26T07:59:50Z","webTitle":"All hail the renaissance of Hugh Grant, freed from decades of romcom hell | Hadley Freeman","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/26/renaissance-hugh-grant-freed-romcom-hell","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2018/may/26/renaissance-hugh-grant-freed-romcom-hell","fields":{"headline":"All hail the renaissance of Hugh Grant, freed from decades of romcom hell","bodyText":"Back in the mid-90s, shortly after I saw Four Weddings And A Funeral – when I, along with half the females in this country, developed a profound soft spot for Hugh Grant – I went to see the adaption of Beryl Bainbridge’s novel An Awfully Big Adventure, purely because he starred in it. The rest of the cinema audience had clearly come for the same reason, and we all made a collective excitable giggle when he appeared on screen. But those giggles died down pretty fast, because this was no Four Weddings. Grant plays a predatory, charismatic gay theatre director named Meredith who callously toys with the minds of women and the bodies of men. “What he wants is hearts,” someone explains to one of Meredith’s devastated victims. For too long, it seemed this was Grant’s problem: all he wanted was hearts. He was terrific in An Awfully Big Adventure, and yet afterwards he reverted to romantic comedy landfill, playing dippy Englishmen who had tics instead of personalities, with diminishing returns: Nine Months, Two Weeks Notice, Mickey Blue Eyes, Did You Hear About the Morgans? (No, and for good reason, too.) Richard Curtis tried to help by writing increasingly washed-out versions of the character he played in Four Weddings, resulting in the execrable Love Actually. As of 2016, the only movies Grant had made in which he was clearly enjoying himself were the ones in which he played unlikable characters: Bridget Jones’s Diary, as the emotional fuckwit Daniel Cleaver; and About A Boy, as the emotionally stunted adult who lives off Daddy’s riches. But when you’re young(ish) and pretty, playing the villain means you are not the star. And anyway, the foppish English chap shtick worked so well for Grant that, even after he was arrested in 1995 for getting a blowjob from Divine Brown, a sex worker, he trotted out that character again when doing the US TV talkshow rounds – and prurient 90s America forgave him. So he continued to go for hearts. Soon, Grant became as known for hating his job as he was for romcoms, peaking with the time in 2007 when he hurled what was described as “a family-sized tub of baked beans” at a paparazzo. There are few things more dull than a successful actor who is grumpily disdainful of his job, as Daniel Craig continues to prove; but with Grant his frustration was especially annoying to us fans, because it felt like a problem of his own making. Who knows, maybe his looks meant meatier roles weren’t open to him, or maybe he couldn’t bear the thought of taking second billing; whichever, he kept making movies he obviously couldn’t stand. As much as I enjoyed Music And Lyrics, his 2007 romcom with Drew Barrymore, he was operating not so much on autopilot as in a quasi-coma. Which brings us to Grant’s deeply enjoyable renaissance, which continues this weekend with the second part of A Very English Scandal, the BBC’s excellent dramatisation of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal, in which Grant plays the predatory, charismatic gay politician. Almost a quarter of a century later, Grant has at last been allowed to pick up where he left off with Meredith. Not so long ago, Grant was swearing off acting ever again, but in the past two years he has produced the best work of his life, starting with his excellent turn in Florence Foster Jenkins, as Meryl Streep’s devoted husband, followed by his even better one as the malevolent Phoenix Buchanan in Paddington 2. For the first time in decades, Grant is enthusiastically embodying his characters. Maybe this is because he suddenly produced five children in the space of seven years (and is now due to marry the mother of three of them), and realised he had to stop dicking around and earn some money. Or maybe it’s because his once merely handsome face is now more interesting, so he’s getting better parts (a privilege, it has to be said, not afforded to women). Probably it’s a bit of both. It took teaming up with Alfred Hitchcock for Cary Grant to show that the same qualities that made him such a convincing romantic lead – the charm, the suavity, the persistence, the unknowability – could be turned into something decidedly more sinister. Hugh Grant knew this all along; he was just waiting for someone to let him prove it. In A Very English Scandal, he has finally got the role he’s been working towards all his life: the most English actor since Cary Grant – one who understands how to capture the lightness of this country, but also its darkness."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-earth-marine-sciences","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:01:16Z","webTitle":"University guide 2019: league table for earth & marine sciences","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-earth-marine-sciences","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-earth-marine-sciences","fields":{"headline":"University guide 2019: league table for earth & marine sciences","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/may/21/paul-mountain-obituary","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T17:02:07Z","webTitle":"Paul Mountain obituary","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/21/paul-mountain-obituary","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/may/21/paul-mountain-obituary","fields":{"headline":"Paul Mountain obituary","bodyText":"My friend Paul Mountain, who has died of a brain tumour aged 68, was a violinist and teacher who played with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London before becoming a senior figure in the musical life of Leeds. A passionate believer in the importance of music in education, he was influential in the lives of hundreds of young people across the city. Born in London, he moved with his family shortly afterwards to Liverpool, where his father, Peter, was leader of what is now the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. Paul spent a happy childhood with his two younger sisters. His mother, Muriel (nee Dale), was better known as the pianist Angela Dale. Paul became a talented violinist, but after leaving Merchant Taylors’ school, Crosby, he went on to Warwick University to study economics. He was also a gifted sportsman and his choice on graduation seemed whether to become a professional tennis player or pursue a career in economics. He chose neither: in 1971 he joined the BBC Training Orchestra, where his father was string specialist, and subsequently the Philharmonia. In 1975 he moved to Leeds to take up a position with Leeds Music Support Services, later Artforms, working as director of the Leeds Youth Orchestra and leader of the Leeds String Quartet and later as a peripatetic teacher. As director of the youth orchestra, he ran tours all over Europe. Exhausted on returning from one of these trips, to Italy, he fell from a top floor window, suffering spinal injuries. He was paralysed from the waist down and lost some fine motor skills in his hands. The hardest blow was that he could no longer play the violin to his previous standard. He continued to work as conductor of the Leeds Youth Orchestra and perform in schools as a part of the Leeds String Trio. He also taught violin until his retirement in 2005. He then began working at Pinderfields hospital, where he had been treated, counselling people with spinal injuries for the charity Aspire. His own experience allowed him to empathise fully with the patients. He continued until last year, when his illness was diagnosed. Paul could not have continued living at home without the care of his partner – and from 2008, his wife – Cally (Carol, nee Yeadon), herself a talented professional musician. When anyone asked, “How are you, Paul?”, he would always answer, “I’m fine!” He was an avid reader and was always recommending books. His taste in literature and music was eclectic, ranging from Shostakovich to Tom Jones. Paul stood for election as a local councillor in 1992 and was a founder member of the Almscliffe branch of the Labour party. He railed against injustice, particularly with reference to disability. An elegant, charming and passionate man, Paul is survived by Cally, his son Stef, his stepchildren Danny and Lekky, grandchildren Jack, Otto and Kit, and sisters Jen and Al."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"sport/2018/may/25/libertys-end-how-a-great-new-york-team-was-banished-to-the-suburbs","type":"article","sectionId":"sport","sectionName":"Sport","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-25T09:30:43Z","webTitle":"Liberty's end: how a great New York team was banished to the suburbs","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/25/libertys-end-how-a-great-new-york-team-was-banished-to-the-suburbs","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2018/may/25/libertys-end-how-a-great-new-york-team-was-banished-to-the-suburbs","fields":{"headline":"Liberty's end: how a great New York team was banished to the suburbs","bodyText":"When the New York Liberty play their home opener on Friday night, they will take the court at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, New York. A far cry from their familiar home court of Madison Square Garden, one of the most famous sports venues in the United States. The Liberty, one of the WNBA’s charter franchises that first played at MSG in 1997, is historically one of the most popular teams in the league. Some of basketball’s most decorated players have dotted their roster down the years, including Swin Cash (now the team’s director of franchise development for the Liberty), seven-time All-Star Cappie Pondexter who has played in seven WNBA All Star games, Hall of Famer Rebecca Lobo, and Becky Hammon, who is now an assistant coach with the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs and who recently became the first woman to interview for a head coaching position with an NBA team. So why the move? First, the team’s owner, the Madison Square Garden Company helmed by James Dolan, wanted to sell the Liberty (the sale process is still ongoing and the current owners continue to operate the team.) But it was soon revealed the team, whose home schedule takes place almost entirely during the summer months when the Garden is unoccupied by the Knicks or Rangers, would have to kick it to the suburbs – a move that prompted Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer to threaten the loss of MSG’s property tax abatement, which saves the company $50m annually. What’s clear is the Liberty’s owners don’t have interest in fully promoting the team. By moving them 30 miles outside of Manhattan to an arena that only holds 5,000 spectators shows a lack of commitment to growing a team that has already experienced steady growth. The move simply doesn’t make sense. The Liberty averaged about 10,000 people for home games last year and ranked fourth in the league in attendance. According to sports economist David Berri, the math simply doesn’t add up. “In 2017 the Liberty, led by All-Star Tina Charles, attracted 9,899 fans per game at Madison Square Garden. The Westchester County Center, though, only seats 5,000 fans. So, if the Liberty played in Westchester last season there would have been 83,107 fewer fans at Liberty games in 2017,” Berri told Forbes. The Liberty aren’t the only WNBA team that will be downsizing their home venue in 2018. The Washington Mystics, who play out of the Capitol One Arena in the nation’s capital, are moving to a venue that only hosts 4,200 fans despite drawing an average of 7,711 fans per game last year. “Had the Mystics played at this new arena in 2017 they would have seen 60,712 fewer fans (overall),” Berri said. Berri is was dismayed at the decision for the team to move away from its core fanbase. “I think such a move sends the wrong message,” he said in a conversation with the Guardian. “People tend to focus on attendance as the mark of the league’s health. Deliberately making it lower sends a signal the league is struggling (when it is not).” In fact, the WNBA overall has seen a steady uptick of attendance as well as viewership. In 2017, the WNBA saw its largest turnout to games since 2011, averaging over 7,500 spectators per game. In addition, during the playoffs the WNBA had an plus-8% increase in viewership on ESPN and ESPN2. Even the telecast for the WNBA draft which aired on ESPN2 and ESPNU had a 25% increase in viewership from the year before. With all of these positive metrics, why move a popular team to the suburbs? Why not look at ways to invest more into the fanbase that already attends games, and in a city that has a population of 8.5m people? Why make it more difficult for existing fans to attend games? Laureen Irat, who runs BeyondtheW, a media company dedicated to all WNBA news, said of the move: “There is so much history that the Liberty have made at MSG as being one of the inaugural teams in the league, and part of a handful that are left. I also think the timing of it what was what made it a bit confusing.” According to Irat, the timing of the move did not make sense. “The team has been to the playoffs in the four seasons. Their franchise player, Tina Charles, was a runner up for MVP and their team has the current Sixth Woman of the Year, Sugar Rodgers. To me personally, given these circumstances, it seems like they had already made their decision before the season ended.” However, Irat feels hopeful that the current level of talent on the team will withstand the move. “This group of women are talented, focused, and tenacious enough to play at a high level in any setting and under any circumstance. The goal is to get a championship, and they’ll do whatever it takes to achieve that,” Irat said. Perhaps the best thing that can happen for the Liberty though is to find owners who will value them. And hopefully the team will find itself playing again at Madison Square Garden at a venue worthy of the talent on the team, and a venue worthy for their fans."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"us-news/2018/may/21/trump-john-brennan-cia-gina-haspel-swearing-in","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T16:59:42Z","webTitle":"Trump attacks former CIA director ahead of Haspel's swearing-in","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/21/trump-john-brennan-cia-gina-haspel-swearing-in","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2018/may/21/trump-john-brennan-cia-gina-haspel-swearing-in","fields":{"headline":"Trump attacks former CIA director ahead of Haspel's swearing-in","bodyText":"Donald Trump praised the new CIA director, Gina Haspel, at her swearing-in ceremony on Monday, saying there was “no one in this country better qualified” for the job. Trump had struck different tone earlier, when he promoted criticism of the former CIA director John Brennan and suggested the Barack Obama appointee was to blame for the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian election interference and links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. On Twitter, Trump referenced remarks from the Fox &amp; Friends commentator Dan Bongino, which argued that Brennan “started this entire debacle”. Bongino, a former secret service agent, also said Brennan had “disgraced the intelligence community”. Brennan became the agency’s director in 2013 under Obama, and served until January 2017. He has become a vocal critic of Trump. On Sunday, Brennan responded to Trump’s demand that the Department of Justice investigate whether the FBI “infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes”. In his own tweet, Brennan told Republican leaders if “Trump continues along this disastrous path, you will bear major responsibility for the harm done to our democracy”. In his remarks at Haspel’s ceremony, Trump took a different approach than in his previous visit to CIA headquarters in northern Virginia. Last year, in his first speech as president, Trump angered many when he stood in front of a wall marked with stars representing fallen CIA officers but focused on settling scores with the media, including over his inaccurate claims about the size of the crowd at his inauguration. This year, he paid tribute to the lost CIA agents, saying “their stories of service and sacrifice and daring will live for all time”. Trump also hailed the staff of the CIA, calling them the “most elite intelligence professionals on the planet” and promised them the “the tools, the resources and the support they need”. The Senate confirmed Haspel last week after overcoming concerns about her role in the agency’s use of torture in the interrogation of terrorist suspects after the 9/11 attacks. Trump said Haspel showed courage during the process, in the face of “very negative politics”. In her remarks, Haspel said she wanted to send more officers into the field, improve foreign language proficiency and strengthen working relationships with partner nations. She also said it had been nearly 50 years since an operations officer, which she once was, rose to become director. After living through her rocky nomination and confirmation process, she said, she now knew why."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-anthropology","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"University guide 2019: league table for anthropology","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-anthropology","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-anthropology","fields":{"headline":"University guide 2019: league table for anthropology","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-politics","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:00:18Z","webTitle":"University guide 2019: league table for politics","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-politics","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-politics","fields":{"headline":"University guide 2019: league table for politics","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"music/2018/jun/03/fatoumata-diawara-fenfo-review-a-seductive-marriage-of-ancient-and-modern","type":"article","sectionId":"music","sectionName":"Music","webPublicationDate":"2018-06-03T07:00:42Z","webTitle":"Fatoumata Diawara: Fenfo review – a seductive marriage of ancient and modern","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/03/fatoumata-diawara-fenfo-review-a-seductive-marriage-of-ancient-and-modern","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/music/2018/jun/03/fatoumata-diawara-fenfo-review-a-seductive-marriage-of-ancient-and-modern","fields":{"headline":"Fatoumata Diawara: Fenfo review – a seductive marriage of ancient and modern","bodyText":"Pierced of lip, electric guitarist Fatoumata Diawara has verve to spare, and a dynamic voice whose partial cloudiness is fundamental to its appeal. The singer released her debut album, Fatou, in 2011; an intervening aeon has seen the Mali-born, Paris-based artist act in films and collaborate extensively; Ultimatum, her Disclosure feature, was released earlier this month. In the wake of the discovery last year of slave markets in Libya, she recorded a powerful anti-racism track, Djonya. Fenfo (“Something to Say” in Bambara) finds Diawara engaged on an outreach programme, making contemporary roots music about themes that range from the specifically African – Kanou Dan Yen lambasts the tradition that stops different ethnic groups intermarrying – to the universal. Don Do, the album closer, finds Diawara aching about unrequited love to a sparse accompaniment: her electric guitar and Vincent Ségal’s cello. Fenfo’s most seductive marriages of ancient and modern have already come out: Nterini, the lead track, and the mesmeric Kokoro. Nonetheless, the depths of the tracklisting are a surprise. Ridiculously easy on the ear, Bonya (Respect) spikes 60s US R&amp;B with kora runs courtesy of both Toumani and Sidiki Diabaté, while Dibi Bo comes to Anglophone ears as finger-clicking doo-wop that also invites you to sing along; exercise caution, however, on Negue Negue."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"commentisfree/2018/may/21/feminist-meghan-dutiful-royal-wife-duchess-of-sussex-white-house","type":"article","sectionId":"commentisfree","sectionName":"Opinion","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T11:03:27Z","webTitle":"As a feminist, why should Meghan settle for being a dutiful royal wife? | Simon Jenkins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/feminist-meghan-dutiful-royal-wife-duchess-of-sussex-white-house","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/commentisfree/2018/may/21/feminist-meghan-dutiful-royal-wife-duchess-of-sussex-white-house","fields":{"headline":"As a feminist, why should Meghan settle for being a dutiful royal wife?","bodyText":"So much for chapter one, a glorious display of British romantic ceremonial at its best. Now for chapter two. I predict that this will not be about the obvious “mixed marriage”, but about a different one. This is between a Briton and an American, and between two people with starkly different career trajectories. All comment on the Duchess of Sussex has been on what she will do for Prince Harry and the royal family. It has been one-way traffic, the benefit going to Britain and its global image. But what will the marriage do for her, beyond bring her staggering celebrity? It is taken for granted that Meghan will be the “dutiful wife”, living where her husband wants her to live, attending his charity events and doing and saying what “the palace” ordains. Her American life, her dysfunctional family and acting career are regarded as her past. This narrative has been universally patronising, a narrative of rescue. Meghan’s America has been depicted as Cinderella’s scullery. She may describe herself as an actor and a “feminist”, but few ask what that means. Having spent much of my own life married to a strong-minded American actor, I know that such “mixed marriages”, however loving, are subject to unavoidable strain. I find it incredible that the duchess should be expected graciously to abandon her past for the warm embrace of British royalty – bringing to it just enough novelty to update the monarchy just a little, and make it seem “more relevant”. We should apply to this marriage a feminist template. Suppose Meghan had been an American man, marrying a British princess. Would he have been expected to come to Windsor to submerge himself in a life of sybaritic luxury? Would he be expected to obey “the palace” on his career moves and public utterances? I think not. American and British cultures are not the same. Where two careers diverge, where geographies diverge, the Atlantic suddenly seems very wide. Everything we are told about Meghan indicates an articulate and intelligent woman. At 36, she has a dazzling career ahead of her. Suppose after two years of royal candyfloss, she gets an offer she cannot refuse, and naturally expects her spouse to accompany her to Los Angeles? Suppose she – indeed, they – find California a relief from stuffy west London? Meghan has already shown herself adept at combining a career with a public platform. Her friends and associates affirm that she is a political animal. I suggested over the weekend that, such is her fame, she could perfectly well follow a route once taken by a certain Ronald Reagan. I even suggested she might lead for the Democrats against a Republican Ivanka Trump. It was treated as a joke. All I can say is, why not? I fervently hope this marriage succeeds – on either side of the Atlantic. And if they can put an American in Kensington Palace, surely we can put a Briton in the White House. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/opinion","pillarName":"Opinion"},{"id":"media/2018/may/21/russian-broadcaster-rt-three-new-ofcom-investigations","type":"article","sectionId":"media","sectionName":"Media","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T11:47:56Z","webTitle":"Russian broadcaster RT faces three new Ofcom investigations","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/may/21/russian-broadcaster-rt-three-new-ofcom-investigations","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2018/may/21/russian-broadcaster-rt-three-new-ofcom-investigations","fields":{"headline":"Russian broadcaster RT faces three new Ofcom investigations","bodyText":"Ofcom has opened three new investigations into the Kremlin-backed news channel RT for potential breaches of the broadcasting standards code, on top of the seven investigations it announced last month. The media regulator placed the 24-hour news channel’s output under additional scrutiny after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, which has been blamed on Russia. The latest potential breaches identified by Ofcom include an episode of RT’s flagship CrossTalk discussion show broadcast on 20 April, which described all of the US government’s potential strategies in the Syrian civil war as “poorly thought-out options”. The regulator will also investigate two news items on the channel, originally known as Russia Today, for alleged lack of balance. One, captioned “Face of nationalism”, discussed the Ukrainian government’s position on nazism and the treatment of Roma Gypsies. The second was a report on the treatment of anti-fracking activists by the UK authorities, which included interviews with Bob Dennett, the co-founder of campaign group Frack Free, and Joe Corré, an anti-fracking activist. “We note the new investigations by Ofcom, and will work with the regulator through its processes,” said a spokesperson for the Russian channel. An Ofcom spokesperson said RT has historically had an acceptable record when it comes to breaches of broadcasting rules. However, when the regulator began extended monitoring of the channel after the Salisbury attack it discovered multiple potential breaches of the UK code. The regulator said that as a result it would continue to monitor the output for the foreseeable future, given the number of potential breaches. An 11th investigation into RT, dating from the end of last year, is continuing into the apparent use of fake tweets by the former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond on his eponymous show. In extreme circumstances Ofcom has the power to withdraw RT’s ability to broadcast in the UK for continuous breaches of broadcasting regulations, depriving it of the right to be distributed through Freeview, satellite and cable services. However, this would not necessarily be a disaster for the business. RT has delighted in its outsider status, holding up official criticism of its output as evidence that it is speaking truth to power and giving an alternative view. Prof Stephen Hutchings, of the University of Manchester, who is leading a research project into RT, said this month that the broadcaster’s future could lie in its successful and unregulated online operation. “They would love for Ofcom to ban them,” he claimed."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"travel/2018/may/21/national-beekeeping-centre-wales-conwy-review","type":"article","sectionId":"travel","sectionName":"Travel","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-21T11:30:51Z","webTitle":"National Beekeeping Centre Wales, Conwy: ‘Connect kids with ecology – because the bees need us’ – review","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/21/national-beekeeping-centre-wales-conwy-review","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/travel/2018/may/21/national-beekeeping-centre-wales-conwy-review","fields":{"headline":"National Beekeeping Centre Wales, Conwy: ‘Connect kids with ecology – because the bees need us’ – review","bodyText":"In a nutshell This low-key and friendly visitor centre is a champion for Welsh honeybees, which are increasingly under threat from climate change and loss of wild flower meadows. It raises visitors’ awareness of environmental issues and illustrates the 4,000-year history of beekeeping and honey-making, from the ancient Egyptians via the Romans. A Hive Aid scheme lets you adopt a beehive at one of three locations nearby, and regular courses (from £60pp) train new generations of beekeepers. Fun fact Bees pollinate about a third of everything we eat and play a vital role in sustaining our ecosystems. In economic terms, honeybee pollination could be worth up to £200m to the UK alone. Best thing(s) about it It’s a fun but also educational visit set in the glorious countryside of the Conwy Valley. The What’s the Buzz section is great for primary-school-age children, describing how bees communicate with each other: their “waggle dance” – it goes on to explain – is the way a bee lets others in the hive know the distance to the forage for nectar and its relation to the angle of the sun. Join one of the regular apiary tours to see the honeypot hive up close. What about lunch? Next door is the Furnace Tearoom, part of the Bodnant Welsh Food Centre, which serves light bites (toasties and wraps around £4.50) and coffee. And the Pavilion Restaurant at the National Trust’s Bodnant Garden is nearby for cooked food, including baked potatoes (£5.25) and daily specials such as local casserole with bread (£5.99), plus coffee and cakes. A walk around the gardens afterwards reveals bee-friendly plants, such as spring heather, lavender and sage. (The National Beekeeping Centre will be hosting bee-friendly events here for National Meadows Day on Saturday 7 July.) Exit through the gift shop? There is a small range of gifts on an apis theme, including knitted bee toys (£1.99), wooden honey twizzlers (£1.99) and a selection of honeys all made by north Wales producers (from £4.95). The bestselling Bodnant honey (£8) goes fast. Getting there It is just off the A470 on the Bodnant Estate in the Conwy Valley and 10 minutes from the A55 north Wales coast road. Follow the brown signs just after Bodnant Gardens. Value for money? Yes. Visits and activities for kids are free, though donations are welcome. Taster days (from £60) and intensive weekend beekeeping courses (from £145) are held at Abergwyngregyn, 10 miles west down the A55. Opening hours Visitor Centre opens daily from 10am-4pm but it is volunteer-run so phone ahead to check. Expect a buzz around the annual Conwy Honey Fair (13 September 2018). Verdict 8 out of 10. A good way to connect kids with themes of ecology and, besides, the bees need us. But the wasps can buzz off. • beeswales.co.uk"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"world/2018/may/23/world-weatherwatch-spring-brings-wildfires-storms-and-ash-plumes","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-23T20:30:32Z","webTitle":"World weatherwatch: Spring brings wildfires, storms and ash plumes","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/23/world-weatherwatch-spring-brings-wildfires-storms-and-ash-plumes","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2018/may/23/world-weatherwatch-spring-brings-wildfires-storms-and-ash-plumes","fields":{"headline":"World weatherwatch: Spring brings wildfires, storms and ash plumes","bodyText":"Eastern Russia has been experiencing widespread and intense spring wildfires, thanks to a drier than normal autumn and winter, leading to parched vegetation. As of 17 May, nearly 700 fires had been recorded across 40 territories with about 400 considered extinguished, according to the Russian Federal Forest Agency. As stated by the Global Fire Emissions database, the Amur Oblast region has experienced the most fires per month since 2008. An outbreak of strong thunderstorms caused an estimated five deaths in the north-east US on 15 May, during the first occurrence of severe spring storms for that region this year. Strong winds, hail and heavy downpours caused most of the damage, although there were also reports of tornadoes in New York state. Many places were struck during the busy evening commute, which enhanced the disruption. The Kilauea volcano in Hawaii has been periodically erupting since early May, and the latest, on Tuesday, sent its plume an estimated 9,000ft (2743 metres) into the sky. Last week, stronger eruptions produced an ash cloud as high as 30,000ft, prompting aircraft warnings. Given the unpredictability of volcanic eruptions, there is no sure way of knowing when the effects of lava, ash and toxic gases will cease."},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-accounting-finance","type":"interactive","sectionId":"education","sectionName":"Education","webPublicationDate":"2018-05-29T07:00:22Z","webTitle":"University guide 2019: league table for accounting & finance","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-accounting-finance","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/education/ng-interactive/2018/may/29/university-guide-2019-league-table-for-accounting-finance","fields":{"headline":"University guide 2019: league table for accounting & finance","bodyText":""},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"}]}}
